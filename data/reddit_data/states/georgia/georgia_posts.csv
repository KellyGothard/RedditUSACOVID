Because it's a boarding school we would live on campus just south of Dillard. It seems like it's a really great fit for her, but I'm not sure it's a great fit for *me*.

we're both \~30, and have definitely gotten a little spoiled in New England by being able to drive to anything in 30-45 minutes. RGN's campus is pretty isolated in Blue Ridge, which isn't so bad for my wife since teaching at a private school is more than a full-time gig and her whole life will mostly be at the school.

For me, though, it doesn't seem like there are a lot of options. I can keep my current job and work from home, but every city is 1.5 hrs - 2 hrs away by car. As someone whose interests include playing music, art, tabletop gaming, movies, hanging at bars, and other mostly social things, it seems like having a social life might prove difficult in that area.

**TL;DWTR: (in order)**

* What?
* When?
* Who?
* Where?
* How?

# What?

WHAT IS A PRIMARY?

A **primary** is a contest among candidates *within one party* who compete to represent their party in the general election. It's the voting equivalent of the ""regular season"" in sports, where teams compete against other teams *within their conference* with the goal of winning the conference championship.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PRIMARY AND A GENERAL ELECTION?

The general election occurs several months later, in November; it will feature *all primary winners from every party*, in *every contest,* who compete to be elected for their respective offices. It's the voting equivalent of the ""playoff"" or ""championship series"" in sports, where all of the *conference champions* compete *against one another* with the goal of winning a national championship.

WHAT AM I VOTING FOR? WHAT'S ON THE BALLOT?

In *presidential preference* primaries, you vote for your *preferred presidential candidate* within *one party* of your choosing. In *general* primaries, you vote for your preferred candidates in U.S. Senate, U.S. House, Georgia State Senate, and Georgia State House races. In *general* primaries, you must choose *one party* for all of the aforementioned races.

WHAT ARE THE CHOICES? WHICH PARTIES CAN I CHOOSE FROM IN PRIMARIES?

In Georgia, the options are *Democratic*, *Independent* (sometimes called ""nonpartisan""), and *Republican*. Those options apply to both *presidential preference* and *general* primaries. Smaller parties typically do not have traditional primaries: instead, they typically have statewide or nationwide conventions.

CAN I VOTE IN BOTH THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES?

You cannot vote in both parties' *presidential preference* primaries. Likewise, you cannot vote in both parties' *general* primaries. Whether you are allowed to vote in one party's *presidential preference* primary and the other party's *general* primaries, I'm not sure. I believe it is not allowed, but if someone knows for sure, feel free to let me know in the comments. In brief, **you must choose one party**.

WHAT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR?

Governors serve four-year terms, and the last gubernatorial election was in 2018. Thus, the next gubernatorial contest will occur in 2022; you cannot vote for gubernatorial candidates in 2020.

WHAT ABOUT THE SCHOOL BOARD, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, JUDGES, AND OTHERS?

Regardless of a candidate's partisan affiliation, these offices are considered *nonpartisan*, thus, primaries are not necessary for these offices. Candidates technically cannot run as a ""Republican for School Board"", or as a ""Democrat for Judge"".

WHAT'S A CAUCUS? IS IT THE SAME AS A PRIMARY? I HEARD CAUCUSES ARE IMPORTANT...

**A caucus is not the same as a primary**. A caucus, unlike a primary, takes place at a set time in a large, open room. Typically, supporters of each candidate gather next to signs with their respective candidates' names within the room, in a manner similar to the way schoolchildren gather at one of four corners of the gym basketball court while playing ""Four Corners"" in P.E. class. In some caucuses, each candidate's supporters are then allowed to debate with one another in an attempt to win over supporters of other candidates. When those processes are complete, votes are tallied, and everybody goes home. Every caucus is different; procedures are dependent on state and party. Ultimately, caucuses achieve the same goal as primaries: they nominate the *most preferred candidates from one party*. **Georgia does not have a caucus**. The reason that you may have heard about the importance of caucuses is because of the state of Iowa. Traditionally, Iowa has always been the first state to begin the presidential nomination process, and Iowa utilizes the caucus process instead of the primary process. As Iowa is the first state to vote, Iowans ""set the tone"" for the rest of the country. Thus, it is vital for presidential candidates to perform well in Iowa. Nevada, another ""early state"", also utilizes the caucus process instead of the primary process.

# When?

WHEN DO 2020 PRIMARIES OCCUR?

In Georgia, *presidential preference* primaries occur on **Tuesday, March 24, 2020**. *General* primaries occur on **Tuesday, May 19, 2020.**

WHEN ARE PRECINCTS/POLLING SITES OPEN ON PRIMARY DAY(S)?

**Precincts are open from 7:00am-7:00pm on primary day(s).** If you are standing in line before or at 7:00pm, you will be allowed to vote regardless of the line's length. Occasionally, due to unforeseen circumstances such as severe weather or a power outage, precincts will be allowed to remain open for an extended period of time.

WHEN DO I REGISTER TO VOTE?

To be eligible to vote in 2020 *presidential preference* primaries, **you must register to vote before February 24, 2020**. For the *general* primaries, you must register by April 20, 2020.

WHEN DOES ABSENTEE/EARLY VOTING BEGIN?

For the *presidential preference* primaries, absentee ballots can be mailed in after February 4, 2020; early voting begins March 2, 2020. For the *general* primaries, absentee ballots can be mailed in after March 31, 2020; early voting begins April 27, 2020. Note that early voting typically occurs on a few Saturdays prior to the primary date; sometimes, early voting will be available on weekdays two weeks prior to the primary date.

WHEN WILL I KNOW WHO WON THE PRIMARIES?

For *presidential preference* primaries, you will know who ""won"" in the state of Georgia sometime between several minutes and several days after the last precinct closes. If the contest is noncompetitive, you will most likely know who the nominee is, at a national level, sometime around ""Super Tuesday"", March 3, 2020, when a plurality of states have their primaries. If the contest is competitive, you may not know until after June 2, 2020, when the last primaries occur. Ultimately, presidential nominees will be confirmed at party conventions later in the summer; that's when you will know for sure. For *general* primaries, you will know who won sometime between several minutes and several days after the last precinct closes, usually within several hours.

# Who?

WHO CAN VOTE IN PRIMARIES?

In Georgia, **all registered voters are eligible to vote in primaries, regardless of prior partisan affiliation**.

AM I REGISTERED TO VOTE?

Visit the Georgia My Voter Page (MVP) at [https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp)  to find out. Go to the right side of the page and fill in your first initial, last name, county of residence, and date of birth. If you see information about your polling place and elected officials after clicking ""submit"", you are registered and eligible to vote. **If you receive a message stating ""your registration information was not located"" after clicking submit, it's very likely you are not registered to vote**. If you believe you should be registered, but receive the aforementioned message, contact the Georgia Secretary of State's office to verify. Georgia's Secretary of State's office has been known to terminate the registrations of voters who have not voted in several consecutive prior elections, who have recently changed addresses, or who have a name spelling mismatch with their driver's license. This ""maintenance"" is routinely completed to prevent voter fraud, according to the Secretary of State's office. \**This is a controversial practice, to say the least, and I do not intend to spark a debate about it; I intend to inform others about possible causes of the termination of one's registration.\**

CAN 17-YEAR-OLDS VOTE IN PRIMARIES?

In many states, 17-year-olds are eligible to vote in primaries as long as they turn 18 before the general election. Georgia is *not* one of these states, **17-year-olds cannot vote in primaries**.

DO I NEED TO BE REGISTERED WITH A CERTAIN PARTY TO VOTE IN THAT PARTY'S PRIMARIES?

**You do not need to be registered with a certain party to vote in that party's primaries**. Georgia is considered an ""open primary"" state. In fact, party registration is not really a thing in Georgia. 

# Where?

WHERE DO I GO TO VOTE IN PRIMARIES?

You go to your assigned precinct or ""polling place"". The polling place is typically a government building, school, community center, or church in your community. You can find your polling place by visiting [https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp) . Go to the right side of the page and fill in your first initial, last name, county of residence, and date of birth. Click ""submit"". Then, you can see your assigned polling place with its address listed.

WHERE DO I GO IF I WANT TO VOTE EARLY?

Follow the same procedure as above. Click on ""Click Here for Early Voting Locations and Times"". Then, you can see where early voting will take place in your county. Typically, early voting occurs at a central location, such as the county courthouse or another county building.

WHAT IF I CAN'T MAKE IT TO EARLY VOTING OR PRIMARY DAY VOTING?

Absentee voting by mail is available. Note that, in Georgia, **you can vote absentee by mail for any reason**, you are not required to present any documentation of absence. To request an absentee ballot, follow the same procedure as above. Click on ""Click here for an Absentee Ballot Application"", or visit your county's registrar's office to request an absentee ballot.

# How?

HOW DO I REGISTER TO VOTE IN THE PRIMARIES?

**Visit the Georgia My Voter Page (MVP)** [**https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp**](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp) **to register to vote**. In the middle of the page, click on the black ""Register"" icon. The process takes about 10 minutes to complete. You will need a driver's license and an address of residence in Georgia in order to register online. Alternatively, or if you do not have a driver's license or an address (you will need additional documentation), you can register to vote in person at your county registrar's office. You must be at least 18 years old and be a U.S. citizen in order to successfully register.

HOW DO I VOTE ON PRIMARY DAY? CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS?

Once you arrive at your polling place with your driver's license (**don't forget your driver's license!**), you wait in a line. After you're motioned forward, you're directed to a table. At this table, you are given a paper form. You have to fill in the blanks with some basic personal information such as your name, date of birth, address, etc. Most importantly, **on the form, you select the party whose primary you want to participate in**. In Georgia, the options are *Democratic*, *Independent* (sometimes called ""nonpartisan"") and *Republican*. After the form is filled out, you return it to a poll worker. The next step in the process is registration verification: you leave the table and travel to another part of the room where a poll worker will compare your form with your driver's license and the Secretary of State's records. Once you're verified, you will be given a ""ballot"" (which is actually an electronic card that is inserted into an electronic voting machine) for the party you selected on the form. This process applies to both *presidential preference* and *general* primaries. Last, but certainly not least, you vote for your preferred candidate(s) on the electronic touchscreen. You verify your selections, and finish voting. Your vote(s) are stored on the ""ballot"", which you hand to a poll worker after it is ejected from the machine. I believe that the new machines to be used for the 2020 primaries will print a paper receipt with a QR code, which can be used to count your vote(s) in the event computers are hacked or stop working. \**The voting machines, both old and new, are controversial; I do not want to spark another debate in the comments.\** Don't forget to collect your ""I'm a Georgia Voter"" sticker on the way out!

65,blizzardboy3000,1578791402,engjr4,Question,"Hello!

My spouse and I went to college together in Savannah, GA and loved the environment and atmosphere and people. We were not there long enough and since then (several years we’ve been out of college) we’ve longed to just move there.

However, I know next to nothing about moving states and much less about GA laws and regulations and need a lot of help.

Can anyone suggest some good areas to live? We do not want to be in Atlanta (I’ve heard horror stories), but I know Savannah is pretty expensive and the hurricane weather scares me (that’s a personal thing, though). We’re willing to live further inland but anything as similar to Savannah as possible would be perfect. I saw someone mention Macon was a nice place but I genuinely do not know!!! 

The hard part about this is I’m the one who carries my spouse and I financially. Due to medical reasons my spouse can only work part time at a substantially lower rate than what I bring in monthly, so all of this is very hard for me to figure out on my own.  I’m pretty hirable and believe I can find a job— I just need to know WHERE we’re going to potentially live before I can even look.

Some info about me/us: we are an LGBT couple. In Savannah we had zero problem with this and I don’t expect it to be an issue in most places as I live in central PA and I’ve yet to come across problems even here, so I’m not too worried about it but please tell me if I should be. We are both mid twenties. I’m currently a manager and we have a cat and a dog that would have to come with us as well. We own two vehicles. I really don’t know what else to put here honestly but...

...like I said. Any information helps. Or even a link to “moving to GA 101” Type website lol. I heard vehicle registration was also kinda hectic to deal with. I just need a push in the right direction!",Georgia,Spouse wants to move to GA. Need advice.

I recently moved out of my parent's house and need to get my own car insurance. I also need to get the title transferred to me. The car is completely payed off and the title/ownership is in my Dad's name.

After referencing this website:  [https://dor.georgia.gov/transfer-vehicle-titled-georgia](https://dor.georgia.gov/transfer-vehicle-titled-georgia)  it says I'll need a MV-1 Title/Tag Application, Emission Inspection Certificate, the original valid title, insurance, and payment of fees.

As well, I do know that because he is immediate family and is transferring the car to me for free, we need to fill out the MV-16 Affidavit to Certify Immediate Family Relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

What is EVERYTHING that I need to do? There's so much differing information from every source I visit online. I don't know if I need to just fill out the MV-16 and go to the county tag office, or also fill out the MV-1.

As well, do we need to make any handwritten changes on the title itself, or will that be completed at the tag office?

105,pmjsandwich,1579457477,eqztnc,Traffic/Weather,"I live in Georgia and one morning during rush hour traffic around 9 AM on I-85 South towards Atlanta, I was driving on the express lane (Peach Pass) while there was backed up traffic on the far left passing lane. There is a double solid line that separates the express lane from the passing lane. So as I was driving past the traffic to my right, there was one driver stuck in that traffic that suddenly CROSSED the double solid lines into my lane and I had to brake hard to avoid a collision. I flashed my high beams at him to say ""what the hell bro"" and after that, he pulled an asshole move by going 20 miles an hour (in a 70-speed limit, 40 minimum). Being in the express lane, I couldn't pass him because its illegal to cross the double solid lines and you get fined for doing so. 

Understandable I was angry that I did this buddy a favor by avoiding a collision but he kept on going less than 20 and while there was nobody in front of him, there was an entire line of cars behind this car. I was tailgating the guy and so was everyone behind me and when I slammed my horn on the guy, he stuck out his hand and flicked all of us off. 

So in a scenario where this happened, if the driver in front of me decided to brake check me and everyone in the express lane got into an accident, who would be at fault? Keep in mind this guy broke the law by crossing the double solid lines to the express lane and was way below the minimum posted speed limit. Would I have had been responsible to keep a safe distance between myself and this car even if that meant I would be going well below 10 miles an hour on the highway?",Georgia,Would I be at fault?
106,jwayne88,1579461844,er0ufr,Nan,"Wascom arrested me for no reason and wasted 3 months of my life in jail. I was arrested for simple assault when I did not even commit the offense. Also this county violates people due process and psychologically tortures them when they are sent to the county jail. I haven't spoken to anyone in the news but shit better change before I pay to have this county investigated. Also the jail works with a company called securus and records phone conversations that are used in court to convict people when its their money that pays for the call. I am sure those people never signed a waiver or were aware that the county allows to use that against them in court and that to me is a violation of my constitutional rights. 

Malicious Prosecution is going on and indictments are being forged and are not sealed or notarized. The district attorneys are dragging people that are locked up with too many continuances for their charges and Henry County Jail is using psychological torture to secure plea’s from inmates by use of 21 hour lockdown in pods E1-E2. This is unconstitutional and violates international law for housing of pre-trial inmates. Also 21 lockdown promotes recidivism and helps make people who have psychological disorders worse. Yet they do nothing about and don’t care about it at all. The people who work here are awful. Also Henry County charges people with trumped up charges such as an inmate named Ortiz who committed the act of simple battery and is charged with Agg. Assault. There is also an inmate last name Wright who is charged with armed robbery and Agg. Assault and the reason why they arrested him is because they believe he robbed a pawnshop when they have no Proof.

At the bottom of the post I have the current subreddits I post these on, and my other cases.

&amp;#x200B;

* Date of Birth: 1938 - 1978 (40 - 80 years old)
* Sex: Male
* Location: Allatoona Lake, Georgia
* Date of Death: Unknown - during 2018
* Body Discovered: September 1, 2018 
* Manner of Death: Unknown
* Height: 5’10’’ (1.77m)
* Weight: 230 lbs (104 kg)
* Race: Probably caucasian
* DNA: Dental, DNA and fingerprints available

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

* Someone on a boat found the victim floating on the water. They recovered his body at around 5:40pm, from the lake near the Bethany Bridge area of Red Top Mountain Road.
* He had gray hair.
* The man had a gunshot wound to his right temple. It is not known if this is what killed him.
* He had on a backpack filled with rocks and sand, ankle weights and a small boat anchor fastened to a back brace. 
* Additionally, white and red ropes were used to bind the body.
* He was found wearing the following articles of clothing:  
 A blue t-shirt with short sleeves;  
 Tan pants;  
 A brown belt;  
 A yellow string with a compass, which is believed to have been worn as a necklace;  
 Black swimming flippers.
* The man had no identifying marks or identifications on his body.
* Most likely from decomposition, his remains later surfaced near a bridge, where the water was measured to be six feet deep. It is unclear whether his body floated to this location, or if it was dumped where it was found.
* The amount of weight attached to the victim would not have been enough to hold him underwater.
* No firearms were recovered.
* The Police Department tried to match his identification to any missing people in Bartow County or metro Atlanta but were unsuccessful.
* The Police Department also said facial recognition software has not identified the man.
* The Bartow County Sheriff's Office has since received numerous tips  regarding the identity of the victim but to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

Ruled out: Glenn Towery, Raymond Boisse. 

Possible matches: John Compton (u/musicle submitted a tip on January 14th 2020. His NamUs page was up at the time of the submission and has since been taken down. I contacted his wife to ask her if he's been found or identified but she has not responded as of 01-02-2020.)

201,LucidLemon,1580662357,exr88c,Nan,"For a long time, people amongst the left and liberals have been hedging their bets between Warren and Sanders, on the basis that both have common ground. With the primary approaching, however, it is in our best common interest that a choice is made.

Let's assume Warren is still in the race by March 24th, and you are an equal fan of both - or that Bernie is your #2 but you like Warren more for this or that reason. That's my audience here. Centrists, moderates, conservatives etc - do as you do - not trying to win y'all on this one. 

People wishing to upend the current order of things, this is what we know:

Unfortunately, Warren has no path to the nomination. She isn't going to win Iowa. Given her polling even marginally close to thag 15% mark in several states, it's possible she's even outright not viable in several precincts.

WIthout Iowa how does she get Super Tuesday? She certainly isn't going to win New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina. Those early states are necessary to build the upswing and momentum to win at convention. Her fundraising and polls are slagging across the board.

So how does she get the nomination? It's simple. She cannot.

A common refrain I've heard amongst liberals is to Vote Blue No Matter Who, because unity against a common foe will help in 2020. Some people take this to the point of mocking third party voters, which, if to assume those people were ever inclined to vote democrat (personally I don't think so) has a logic to it

**But the common foe for progressives** ***right now*** **is Biden &amp; Bloomberg. Warren is that third party vote, she is essentially a nonviable spoiler candidate.**

I hope I have laid out a clear case why it is on us to unite, and in uniting move from Warren to Bernie rather than the other way around. If Bernie was tanking and Warren had the energy and potential Sanders has now, progressive liberals would rightfully make the reverse argument.

This is the unfortunate truth of First Past the Post, be mad at it instead of the strategic voting it creates. It will be Bernie or the party will not yield to our values.",Georgia,To progressives: The 'Unity Pact' served us well. Now it is time for it to come to an amicable end under one banner.

288,XavierSarkisian,1581300687,f1jc8b,Question,"Hello

Now heads up, I'm an Armenian-born Canadian and only briefly stopped in a town in Northern Georgia once to refuel when I was in the Eastern U.S. with a few friends of mine, so I know almost nothing about Georgia save what a couple friends from GA have told me.  Hence is why I am posting this here to GA's subredit.

One of the first songs I remember hearing was the Vicki Lawrence 1973 song the Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, a song that my Dominican girlfriend is absolutely in love with.

We may visit Georgia in the future and would love to learn more about it.

Anyway, what if they made a movie based on the story of that song?

I know they made a movie in 1981 named for the song, but that movie has almost nothing what so eve rto do with the Vicki Lawrence classic.

I'd like to know from some Georgians their thoughts on some of these elements of the hypothetical movie if they ever did make one:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  what would be a good name for the brother and the little sister mentioned in the song?
2. The brothe ris the guy that went from Candletop to th ehome town only to find out that his woman was cheeting with a guy named Seth Amos and Andy Wolloe, and was th eone hung for Andy's murder despite not having had the chance to commit it.
3. The little sister is the narrator and the one who killed not only Andy but the wife/girlfriend of the brother.

Some names I have thought of for the sister include:

Georgina Callander (named after a friend of mine form Savana, Georgia who was both a vietnam war nurse and a plane mechanic, she always wanted her name to be in a movie.)

Other names we thought of for this character are Chloe Michaels and Harriet Webster

&amp;#x200B;

For the brother's name, I thought of either Henry Callander, Henry Michaels or Michael Webster.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  what should the brother's wife be named?  I thought of maybe Karen, Mary or Fran.

&amp;#x200B;

3. where should the home town be where the story takes place?

4.  what is Candletop and where should it be?  I'm thinking that maybe it could be a jailhouse as the brother spends two weeks there, although it could be another town.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally 5, who are some actors you think should play what rolls in the movie?

I'd hope that they include Vicki Lawrence as a cameo in the movie, since it's telling the exact same story as her song, only as a movie instead of a 3 minute song.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus: should it be animated or live action?

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to ask r/Georgia as I thought people from Georgia would be able to tell me what they think would be cool about a movie set in their state, granted it'd be early 20th century Georgia but still.

Thoughts?

My girlfriend recently got stopped going 85 passing through Tifton on I-75 south. I wanted to get some advise on how she should approach dealing with the speeding ticket.  I read online that courts will often drop the super speeder fee if you show up in court and plead no guilty.

Let me know if you have any advice on how she should handle this or if you've dealt with this in the past.

She's definitely learned her lesson from the scare alone of getting a ticket. Unfortunately it had to be the hard way.

Thanks for any help!",Georgia,Georgia Super Speeder Advice

It smells like gym clothes after a single work out - it's not rancid, but it's enough that I can notice it myself.

Meet Huey and Gandalf!

https://imgur.com/a/NECpmof

Huey and Gandalf were abandoned a few months ago when a neighbor of mine was evicted and decided to leave their pets behind. :( I have been caring for them ever since, and I am hoping to turn this situation around by finding them wonderful homes.

Huey 
• 4-5 years old, male, blonde 
• Neutered 
• Up to date on rabies, FVRCP, and feline leukemia (negative test) 
• Had bath and flea treatment 
• Shy boy at first but warms up fast to whoever feeds him cause he loves to eat! He is independent and wants attention on his own terms, but I could see him turning into a lap cat in the future. 
• Okay with other cats – if my cat was a little friendlier I think they could be buds but she is giving him the cold shoulder. 
• A little nervous around dogs but getting better (1 dog would probably be fine, but a little overwhelmed with my 3!) 
• Knows how to use the litter box, no accidents at all! 
• Loves to play! 
• Also he is cross-eyed 😉

Gandalf 
• 2-3 years old, male, grey 
• Neutered 
• Up to date on rabies and FVRCP 
• Flea meds 
• A little shy at first, but extremely sweet and affectionate to people. He warms up quickly and is 100% a lap cat. All he wants to do is hang out and get pets. 
• Good with other cats and and friendly to dogs!

These dudes would make great pets. They can be adopted individually or together. A small re-homing fee applies, which will be donated to Winging Cat Rescue. Let me know if you are ready for a new best friend. Please spread the word!",Georgia,Two abandoned cats looking for forever homes (Henry County)

-Old style 70s GOP boomer
-An Evangelical Christian disgusted by other evangelicals who is planning to go democrat
...And then me, who canvasses for, and donates to Bernie Sanders, as I’m a leftist. 

Normally all this leads just to fascinating dinner conversations, but now it’s leading to this mystery. I’m furious.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, please direct me to the right place if it isn't.  


I have a friend who is a resident of Georgia who has been struggling with heavy depression and suicidal thoughts. She has been unable to get long-term care, and instead has been in-and-out of short-term facilities. She has financial struggles as well.   


Are there any long-term facilities in Georgia that she could be at? Do any of these long-term facilities offer financial aid programs or long-term payment plans?   


Second, she had applied for a program before that allowed her to receive partial wages while she was in the short-term facility. I believe it's a state program. She doesn't remember the name of the form she used to apply or the conditions. Does anyone know of such a program and where I could find the application and find out the conditions for successful entry into the program?

Not a word was heard from anyone in the discussion group in rebuttal. No one said, “Bernie is actually an FDR style democratic socialist who advocates for things like Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage and child care for working families, that kind of thing.” 

In fact, no one said anything in defense of Sanders at all. I cannot say I am surprised – Johnny Isakson is as far left as they wanna go. The tame corporate Dems that populate Georgia politics at present are firmly center right, they wouldn't help a poor person because that might be socialist.

I imagine Nigut and his guests are utterly bewildered at Bernie leading the polls, based on the very limited understanding of Bernie and his message that they display in their discussions.

My husband was just told last week his company is shutting down and he will be out of a job in 60 days. However, the parent company really likes him and would like to keep him. This means a raise, a sign on bonus, and relocation. There are two openings, one being in Columbus, GA. I started doing research and read it’s not very safe/family friendly. 

If the job is offered we will certainly visit - but I am too anxious to wait. What do you know about Columbus? Will I be okay to put my kids in the public schools? Will it be safe for me to take my kids to the park, out and about during the day while my husband is at work?

I am from Indianapolis so I am not a stranger to high crime and watching my surroundings, but I also know the city like the back of my hand so I know where to avoid or be extra cautious. With moving out of state, I just worry about moving with my two little babies to a “dangerous” city I know nothing about.

504,thecannarella,1583458681,fe5zgi,Nan,"If you get your power from a Georgia EMC there is a bill in the general assembly that could affect your monthly power bill. 

In a nutshell the cable and phone companies who use the power poles to string their infrastructure pay a monthly pole attachment fee since the EMC owns the pole and is responsible for maintaining it at their expense. They say the negotiated rates that have been in place are preventing them from serving the rural areas with broadband. This is pure bullshit. The number of customers per mile is not enough for them to make a profit and invest in the infrastructure so they simply don’t serve those areas. I totally understand that, but rural GA is not being served with broadband.

Last year there was a bill passed that would allow the EMCs the opportunity to provide broadband services to their customers if they choose. Many are in the process of doing discovery to see what it would take to serve their members. The for profits are doing this because they see this as a threat and they should. If they cared about providing broadband to rural areas they would have by now but the economics don’t add up for them and lowering pole attachment costs doesn’t cover the amount of expansion it would take to get into those areas.

Yes I work for an EMC and am passionate about rural broadband. They only way it will happen is if the EMCs do it. Incase you are wondering why GA power is not involved with this, it’s because they have enough density for the providers to make a buck.

505,azn_gay_conservative,1583473546,fe90g1,Nan,"They fucking suck. Georgia needs to deregulate the distribution part of electric. Georgia Power aka Southern Company is a stockholders owned corporation registered in Delaware. They can't make money with rate (regulated) so instead they treat customers like shit and just charge whatever the fuck fees they want knowing full well we have no other option.

So I opened a prepay account for my house. I put nearly 200 in it so somebody can stay there and have power for a month. Since it's a prepay account you'd expect the power to be disconnected after the money runs out right? Wrong!!!! Georgia Power kept the service on for nearly a whole month and keep billing me AFTER the balance reaches 0. A month later they sent me a 300 bill?!?! The damn bill has no usage chart, neither does the online system so I have no idea how the f on earth they arrived at that amount.

Naturally I called customer service right? They told me that I needed to call in to disconnect, even though it is prepaid and does not have a positive balance, otherwise the power will still be on. Wtf? Then what the point of prepay then?? I told them I never knew thats how ""prepay"" worked, and nobody at Georgia Power explained that to me when I first opened the account. They basically said ""oops, our outsourced customer service aka consultants made a mistake, but tought luck its your fault anyway so you need to pay up.""

Damn crooks!! When you're on regular post paid if you don't pay they will disconnect you in a heart beat. But when they see a way to keep billing their customer they keep the service on to milk the cow as much as they can.

So I know our little state *loves* to make everything complicated, including the fact that we class all traffic tickets/citations as misdemeanors. I have gotten 2 traffic tickets in the last decade, and both were while I was employed somewhere else, so I have never had to apply for a new position with them on my record. 

I am now about to begin working at a new job, with my offer contingent upon a clean background check. I plugged my info into the county criminal record check, and was a bit flabbergasted to see both of my traffic citations (both for unlawful use of wireless device aka my phone was in my hand at a light - something I no longer do) listed, and classed as misdemeanors in the sidebar.

I have a note from my new employer that says: ""The following records shall not be considered in the hiring process even if revealed in a background check: (1) records of arrest not followed by a valid conviction; (2) sealed, dismissed, or expunged convictions; (3) misdemeanor convictions where no jail sentence can be imposed; or (4) minor infractions."" 

Does anyone have experience with traffic citations showing up on a background check for potential employment? Would these show up at all, and if they do, would they fall into the ""not considered"" record umbrella as mentioned above?

So I've lived in Social Circle Georgia all my life, and I don't really fit in. I'm a sixteen-year-old geek with dyed-hair and a crippling addiction to cherry-vanilla Coke, definitely the kind of kid you'd see in a far-right conservative developed town (or in my family for that matter). Also, my mother is *really*, ***really*** overprotective, I'm not allowed to leave the house even though we live right outside of the town square. My mom also decided to home-school me, so I've never even had the chance to make friends, but I really want too.

That's where this post comes in!

Do any other Alt-kids/bookworms live in Social Circle Georgia? If so, I'd like to meet up. Now I understand how creepy that sounds, but I'm about ninety-percent sure that I'm not a creepy old man living in his mother's basement, crunching on Cheetos, this post goes as a testament to how desperate I am to meet someone who's not related to me. However, I'm not stupid. Hell, even I have reservations about meeting with someone on the internet, even if he did have virtual-candy. So as a safety precaution to both myself and to anyone who might respond, I would like to talk on Discord first.

So, yeah. If your a geek/bookworm/Alt-kid hmu (in a strictly platonic sort of way).

Greetings,

Please read the message below and review the attached documents from DeKalb County School System.

We have been committed to keeping our community updated about the rapidly developing situation with COVID-19. Throughout the process, we have relied on the guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, DeKalb County Board of Health, Georgia Department of Education, as well as our state leaders. During today’s 3 p.m. press conference, Gov. Kemp communicated the following, “Given the rise of the coronavirus, I am going to issue a call to action. If local communities feel it is prudent, you should consider closing day cares and schools as early as tomorrow through the next two weeks.”

As a result, Mrs. Ramona Tyson, Interim Superintendent of DeKalb County School District (DCSD), in collaboration with other metro area school districts, will close the school district on Monday, March 16, 2020, until further notice. All employees will continue to be paid and will work remotely from home. Student learning will continue through virtual learning assignments in the VERGE platform.

I created a survey  that is inspired by Condé Nast Traveler's YouTube series of ""[50 People from 50 States](https://www.youtube.com/user/condenasttraveler/videos)"". They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results.This poll  will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

Henry County people. You need to please, put this in perspective.  Please listen and take this to heart. If you live in another county, this may be a similar situation. 

We have one hospital, Piedmont Henry. It has (according to its website) 236 beds. That's it. There are over 225,000 people who live here (that was in 2017). If 2% of our people get it, that's 4500 people.  If 10% of those people need hospitalization, that's 450. Now keep in mind, some of those beds have other people in them right now for other things. 

Let's please be smart about this. Don't panic and follow the guidance of the CDC. Go get groceries when you need to, get your RX filled. 

At the end of the day, a lot of people will potentially get this, the more people who have it at one time makes it more deadly due to a lack of healthcare infrastructure we currently have. Spreading out the rate of infection will save lives.",Georgia,For those in Henry County

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like this is all part of life 

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now. 

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

From what I gather, this isn't an old policy that was grandfathered in. The administration actively came to this decision during the middle of this pandemic. An employee on another subreddit commented, ""I tried contacting OSHA and they said while it is immoral, it is not illegal.""

My dad is a Publix cashier in the most infected county in Florida. He is in his 70s and has severe cardiovascular disease. I've tried to get him to take time off, but he doesn't have the money to. I have begged him to let me help him out for a few months but he is adamant that he won't take ""handouts"" from his kids. I've suggested he try to get a position like stocking where he has less customer contact, but he says the manager likes him at the register.

I told him he should wear one of his medical masks to work. He has about a 100 of them that he bought a while back for a time just like this. I work as a medical provider and we're putting these same masks on both ourselves and on patients when they have a fever/cough. I, unlike him, have the luxury of medical assistants who will call and prescreen every person I interact with.

Unfortunately, Publix has made a strict policy that employees can't wear protective masks to keep themselves from getting infected. Getting infected for my dad means having a pretty substantial risk of dying. It also means breathing COVID viral particles on a hundred people a day before he becomes symptomatic. While other companies are bending over backwards to protect their employees as well as their customers, Publix's leadership has made a decision to do the exact opposite.",Georgia,XPost: Publix bans employees from wearing medical masks

If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [475,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO has classified it as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf)). [Here's a shadowgraph imaging](https://media.wired.com/clips/5e6a65157c07c90008d05257/360p/pass/PLoS-video-V3.mp4) of people breathing ([source](https://www.wired.com/story/they-say-coronavirus-isnt-airborne-but-its-definitely-borne-by-air/)). Unfortunately it is a bit misleading as it does not show drop dispersion, but gets the point across.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures. [A short GIF](https://i.imgur.com/KpJWSm4.gif) on how we stop the virus from spreading.** 

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/). [Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&amp;feature=youtu.be) on the topic.

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum.

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* Practice [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, [wash your hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fmjbsk/washing_your_hands_is_more_effective_than_hand/) and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Wear a mask in public when possible ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323085/) | [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fmla3q/sarscov1_frequent_mask_use_in_public_venues/) | [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html))

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* [Take extra precautions when shopping for groceries, even when buying online.](https://www.consumerreports.org/food-shopping/how-to-protect-yourself-from-coronavirus-when-grocery-shopping/?EXTKEY=EE032IBAC&amp;utm_source=acxiom)

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing physical distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days.

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) of source)

* People with weakened respiratory system due to [smoking](https://twitter.com/kr3at/status/1240296333354950658?s=19)/vaping ([source 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)), ([source 2](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/Abstract/publishahead/Analysis_of_factors_associated_with_disease.99363.aspx)). Quitting now [can save your life](https://coronawiki.org/page/covid-19-the-role-of-smoking-cessation-during-respiratory-virus-epidemics).

* Lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function or that require home oxygen (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf), last page)

* **UPDATE:** March 18th: ""99% of Those Who Died From Virus Had Other Illness, Italy Says"" ([article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says) | [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fkq6vz/99_of_those_who_died_from_virus_had_other_illness/))

* **UPDATE:** March 20th: [Comorbidities in Italy published](https://www.covidgraph.com/p/coronavirus.html#comorbidities). 48.6% of deceased had 3+ comorbidities.

* **UPDATE:** March 22nd: [Study Calculates Just How Much Age, Medical Conditions Raise Odds Of Severe COVID-19](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/22/819846180/study-calculates-just-how-much-age-medical-conditions-raise-odds-of-severe-covid?utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=health)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""**

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response measures taken, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to vulnerable others, but because experts don't know what the longterm side effects are. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

Take precautions, or [this can happen to you](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/the-story-of-a-coronavirus-infection.html?__twitter_impression=true).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin. March 17th update: The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2: ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" (Source [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)). A genome analysis published March 20th suggests two viruses may have combined ([source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/coronavirus-origins-genome-analysis-covid19-data-science-bats-pangolins/)).

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. Nonetheless, to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that).

775,fragydig529,1585373416,fqe536,Question,"Here is what I’ve went through. The reason I’m saying “Think” is because I have been refused a test from multiple locations. I live in Northwest Georgia in a county I think isn’t testing to keep numbers low.

My son (2yo) and daughter (5mo) have had running nose and my son (2yo) has had a dry cough as well during this entire week. My wife (32yo) remains asymptomatic.

My daughter developed symptoms first and was taken to the doctor (March 2nd or 3rd) she had a nose swab (not specific for corona) done and results came back as 2 unknown viral infections.

My son was taken to the doctor (March 27th) and we were told it was definitely viral, but probably just the cold. No test of any kinds were done. Was told to just let it run it’s course despite his cough worsening throughout the week.


My experience
Starting on Saturday March 21st I (30yo) developed an itchy throat and began sneezing. I was coughing but not uncontrollably.


Sunday March 22nd the conditions from the previous days remained, no change except slightly more coughing and started feeling winded from basic activities like putting my clothes on.


Monday March 23rd I woke up with a sore throat, and my nose was pouring mucus. Coughing was involuntary at this point.


Tuesday March 24th, (This was the worst day) woke up with an extremely sore throat, hard to swallow, mucus still pouring from my nose, constantly having to blow it every 3-5 minutes. Terrible headache this day. Coughing was constant and uncontrollable. That night my fever started rising and got up to 104.2F, stayed around 103-104F for several hours. I tried to let the fever go as long as I could because I knew it was my bodies natural response to this sickness and it was trying to deal with it.

Started feeling severe body aches, and tightness in my chest, really didn’t feel like I was getting enough oxygen, breathing really heavy. 

I didn’t go to the hospital because I didn’t figure they would do anything as I had called them earlier in the day to see if I could get tested and was told basically Not if I’m under 65, not currently hospitalized, and haven’t had contact with anyone from an infected country. In hindsight I should have went anyways, but I was worried about passing this sickness to the people working there if I could just get over it myself at home.

Eventually I started feeling pretty weird like I was swaying back and forth and I felt low to the ground (not sure how to explain it but I assume it was the fever), so I took a Tylenol, my fever dropped a little but was still high. 

The house temp was 75F but I was absolutely freezing and my wife said I turned a heater on and fell asleep in front of it sitting with my head in my hands, I don’t remember that though.

She said when I went to bed I couldn’t sleep much, I had chills all night, body aches, coughing, mucus constantly draining, difficulty breathing, tightness in my chest, sneezing and headache.


Wednesday March 25th, my temperature was at 101F and fluctuated to 102F throughout the day, sore throat was still there but not as bad as the day before. Extremely winded this day, mucus still pouring out of my nose. Headache. Felt completely out of it this day. Like I was living a dream, but that may have been the lack of sleep, I only slept about 4 hours the night before. Still coughing, this was probably the worst day for coughing, it hurt physically to cough. Coughing up a lot of mucus on this day after spending the last 5 days with an unproductive cough. Some blood at some points but only small amounts. I was extremely weak this day. Stayed in the bed most of the day because I couldn’t get up without losing my breath.

I was really confused this day, my wife said I was talking really goofy and not making much sense, I’m thinking this was the fever too. My wife said she was really worried about me this day, I was telling her what to do if I passed, like what my accounts were and all. I remember having a very bad feeling this day. Something just didn’t feel right. Couldn’t sleep at all this night either, I slept for 3 hours on and off. Cough kept me up and had to keep getting up to clear my nose. 


Thursday March 26th, still had a fever but was even lower now from 99-101F, sore throat was very mild, just itchy feeling. Still coughing but not nearly as bad, sneezing but also very mild. Body was still achy, chest didn’t hurt anymore and no more tightness in my chest. Was still very winded, I had to stop and take deep breathes after going down the stairs. Mucus had slowed down from draining.

Later that night my nose stopped running entire and started building pressure in my sinus cavities, got an extremely bad headache and tooth ache from the sinuses. I’ve never had a headache that bad. The sinuses were really bad as in I would blown my nose and you could hear the mucus but was unproductive in getting it out. There was so much mucus stuck in my nose, I felt like I was drowning, and I couldn’t clear it. I also vomited 2 times this night.

I took 2 Tylenol for the headache as to avoid NSAIDs. They didn’t not help at all. Slept 2 hours. Headache wouldn’t let me sleep.


Friday March 27th, severe headache and sinus congestion, no cough.
Sinuses could not be cleared no matter how hard I tried. Mouth has a really weird taste in, I know it’s nasty but it tasty like blood and mucus. Fever was nearly completely normal, hovering around 98-99F, itchy throat.

Called the doctor and told them I think I had the Coronavirus and was over it now but wanted to be seen to clear up this sinus complication I have from it, and get tested to verify that’s what it was. They told me to come on in.

Got to the doctor and a nurse met me outside and screened me. I answered yes to every question except I didn’t have diarrhea, and I hadn’t attended a church in the area with a high number of confirmed.

“Are you coughing?” No

“Well it’s not a sinus infection or you would have a fever” Ok.

Then he looked in my throat and my nose and said “This isn’t coronavirus, I’m going to give you a shot of steroids to clear up this in your nose”

I didn’t think this was coronavirus, I think this was the aftermath. He did not test me and cleared me for work this coming Monday. Everywhere I have called around me is saying you will not get tested unless you have every symptom and are over 65, in the hospital already, or have traveled to an infected country.

I’m not sure where to go from here. If this wasn’t coronavirus this was extremely similar to exactly how it’s being described, so why am I not being tested? Can you really just look at someone’s throat and nose and say “Nope, that’s not coronavirus”? My sickness started 5 days ago, came to a head 3 days ago and finally started subsiding today.

I was really confused this day, my wife said I was talking really goofy and not making much sense, I’m thinking this was the fever too. My wife said she was really worried about me this day, I was telling her what to do if I passed, like what my accounts were and all. I remember having a very bad feeling this day. Something just didn’t feel right. Couldn’t sleep at all this night either, I slept for 3 hours on and off. Cough kept me up and had to keep getting up to clear my nose. 


Thursday March 26th, still had a fever but was even lower now from 99-101F, sore throat was very mild, just itchy feeling. Still coughing but not nearly as bad, sneezing but also very mild. Body was still achy, chest didn’t hurt anymore and no more tightness in my chest. Was still very winded, I had to stop and take deep breathes after going down the stairs. Mucus had slowed down from draining.

Later that night my nose stopped running entire and started building pressure in my sinus cavities, got an extremely bad headache and tooth ache from the sinuses. I’ve never had a headache that bad. The sinuses were really bad as in I would blown my nose and you could hear the mucus but was unproductive in getting it out. There was so much mucus stuck in my nose, I felt like I was drowning, and I couldn’t clear it. I also vomited 2 times this night.

I took 2 Tylenol for the headache as to avoid NSAIDs. They didn’t not help at all. Slept 2 hours. Headache wouldn’t let me sleep.


Friday March 27th, severe headache and sinus congestion, no cough.
Sinuses could not be cleared no matter how hard I tried. Mouth has a really weird taste in, I know it’s nasty but it tasty like blood and mucus. Fever was nearly completely normal, hovering around 98-99F, itchy throat.

Called the doctor and told them I think I had the Coronavirus and was over it now but wanted to be seen to clear up this sinus complication I have from it, and get tested to verify that’s what it was. They told me to come on in.

Got to the doctor and a nurse met me outside and screened me. I answered yes to every question except I didn’t have diarrhea, and I hadn’t attended a church in the area with a high number of confirmed.


Have you had a dry cough? Yes
Fever? Yes
Sore throat? Yes
Shortness of breath? Yes
Chest pain or tightness? Yes
Sneezing? Yes
Runny Nose? Yes
Nausea? Yes
Headache? Yes
Do you have any respiratory symptoms? Yes, I think I have a sinus infection

Have you traveled to another country or been around someone who has? Yes, I’ve been around someone who has

Have you been on a cruise or been around someone who has? Yes, I’ve been around someone who has

Have you attended AFFECTED CHURCH or been around someone who has? No

She gave me a mask and escorted me in. When the doctor came in he said

“Do you have a fever?” Not today, but I have since Tuesday until yesterday. 

“Are you coughing?” No

“Well it’s not a sinus infection or you would have a fever” Ok. 

“And you said you were worried you may have had coronavirus?” Yes, I was really sick over the past 5 days

“Have you traveled out of the US?” No but I’m around someone who has

“When?”
About 4 weeks ago

“Are they sick?” I don’t know, I haven’t been back to work this week

“Have you been on a cruise?” No, but I’ve been around someone who has

“When?” Last week

“Are they sick?”
I don’t know, I haven’t been back to work this week

Then he looked in my throat and my nose and said “This isn’t coronavirus, I’m going to give you a shot of steroids to clear up this in your nose”

I didn’t think this was coronavirus, I think this was the aftermath. He did not test me and cleared me for work this coming Monday. Everywhere I have called around me is saying you will not get tested unless you have every symptom and are over 65, in the hospital already, or have traveled to an infected country.

I’m not sure where to go from here. If this wasn’t coronavirus this was extremely similar to exactly how it’s being described, so why am I not being tested? Can you really just look at someone’s throat and nose and say “Nope, that’s not coronavirus”? My sickness started 5 days ago, came to a head 3 days ago and finally started subsiding today. That’s why I chose to go to the doctor today.

Should I find another doctor and try to get tested before returning to work or what should I do?",Georgia,Possible Personal CoViD-19 experience

787,Ct586,1585423499,fqqn8p,News,"Well, where are we? There’s a looming pandemic, cities and states are taking sweeping actions to protect the population, and the federal government is giving out free money. There are daily briefs coming from the white house, where the message is confusing at best, or a President demands to be treated nicely or he won’t help Americans. As if the looming danger of losing loved ones wasn’t scary enough, the nation's economy seems to have ceased to function in any recognizable manner. The American public seems split between anyone but Trump, or a stance that he is the only one who can save us.  So where the hell are we?
      Let's start with the economy. While I’m sure I don’t need to reference the unemployment numbers or the record breaking drops in the markets these past few weeks. I’ll take a look back , all the way to the far away past of 2018. In that year, starting around February, the markets saw wild swings,most notable the record drops, which at the time were some of the largest ever seen in its history (1). To avoid getting technical, I think large swings are not a sign of stability. Moving onto 2019, the pattern continued culminating in red flags for the markets starting in September. If you are unaware, at this point, the yield curve inverted, a trusted marker for recession, and the federal reserve found itself short on cash. Their solution to this was to pump billions of dollars into the markets for several months(2) giving the illusion of a steady and strong economy. Catching up to today, the apparent instability of the economy, compounded by the emerging pandemic, and the Crushing one two punch of Putin and Saudi Arabia dropping the bottom out of the oil markets have led up to the largest drop in the markets since 1920. Not the strongest economy by any metric.
     With that in mind, where are we as a nation? Throughout history, our nation has turned to its leaders in times of crisis, its institutions stood as a lighthouse to navigate us through the fog and deadly waters. As we turn to this light, we find it dim. The message of this administration was the same as almost every issue it faced. In lieu of listening to the experts sounding alarms, this president chose to take a political stance. A hoax he called it.(3) He played golf, he held rallies, and continued to dismiss it as nothing serious, claiming he had more expertise than the scientist (4). While his response to the virus was at best an ignorant folly, it was his previous actions that truely baffle the mind. He proceeded to disband a pandemic response team, which was designed to respond to these types of pandemics at the same time cutting funding to the CDC, leaving us woefully under prepared. As we look at the current situation, we can see that at every turn President Trump made the wrong choice. His current daily briefs are some of the most confusing spectacles I have ever seen. He continues to spew rhetoric from his rallies, and is immediately contradicted by his vice president, and experts. He becomes hostile towards journalists on the simplest of questions, and spouts his favorite line “Fake news”. He demands respect and appreciation for supplies needed to save American lives as if this were some bizarre new Mario Puzo novel. While this president frets about his feelings he’s sacrificing American lives in the name of his ego. You may even be repeating his talking points, that this virus is a hoax, its just another flu, or that its such a small percentage that there is no reason not to return to work to save the economy. If you agree with these statements, I ask you to name who you’re willing to sacrifice in the name of wealth, which of your loved ones are you willing to lose, because the rest of us are unwilling to sacrifice our loved ones in the name of his economy. 
     This brings us to the political divide currently besieging this nation. Lets face it, on one side we have a party that can’t seem to agree on which direction they should go, and the party itself seems split for the foreseeable future. To their credit, their current message is to save lives. The other side seems to have changed entirely over the past three years. Rallying to President Trumps defense no matter the message. If you haven’t read the Mueller report, I strongly urge you to read it, I will provide a link below. This report is exhibit A as to the doctrine this administration has adopted. This party attacks experts that contradict their desired image, has suppressed witnesses that speak the truth, and shame veterans who signed their names on the line, and fought for this nation. This party has been eroding our institutions, flooding our judicial system with unqualified judges, and attacking the press with the mantra “fake news” at anyone who disagrees with Trump. With the help of a sympathetic network, this party has tailored a message that the American way of life has been under attacked. These other Americans want the United States to fail, and if you don’t fight, they’ll come after you next. 
     To borrow from Mark Twain “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes”. Now this isn’t the first time this message has been used to mislead Americans. This same message was used by the wealthy and powerful in the 1850’s. You’d barely notice the differences between the two. Wealthy slave holding southerners, convinced the mostly illiterate white southerners (literacy in the south was around 30%) that their way of life was under attack, they were told that their rights were being eroded, and that the big bad government was coming for them. This message was so prevalent, that it can still be heard today. You hear it repeadidly that the civil war was about states rights, not slavery, while even a cursory glance at any of the documents drafted for sessecion by the confederacy list the institution of slavery as the key reason for leaving the union. Today literacy isn’t the ability to pick up a book, but the ability to navigate the current technology and social media and understand how it is used to spread information, or in this case misinformation. While the population centers of this nation tend to lean away from the administration's message, rural Americans think they’re under attack. Immigration, jobs, and even the way you talk is threatened by the big bad government. Again the wealthy are telling them that the boogeyman is coming to get them, and only he can fix it. President Trump’s latest press conference was very clear in its message. Toe the party line or no help for Americans in your state. Is this really what we’ve come to? Will there be a bidding war for supplies, the states with the wealth out bidding the poorest of states, leaving these Americans to fend for themselves? Could it be true, that everyone else, and yes I mean everyone else is lying, cheating, and trying to bring you down? Or could it be that President Trump is as crooked as his own history shows? From failed businesses, crooked charities, and an inability to work with anyone else (Gen. Mattis comes to mind.) Please don’t let this man ruin this nation. He will sacrifice it and your lives in the name of his wealth and his ego, that's exactly what his own personal history shows us.
    This pandemic will pass. We will mourn those who are lost and as the dust settles, do we come together and deal with what comes next, or will we continue to allow this man to divide and conquer us? I’ll close with a simple link, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksw3Zc7Fh38 and ask you not to focus on the words, but the message.

Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

857,Aw_Hell_Naw,1585770685,ft78iv,Nan,"From the meeting notes:

The Fayetteville City Council reconvened in a special called meeting April 1, easing some of the restrictions passed March 24 to help combat the spread of COVID-19 locally. 
Following the county’s lead, Fayetteville is adding a voluntary shelter-at-home request of citizens, with exceptions to include emergency errands, traveling to and from essential jobs, those passing through the city, errands for food or medicine, and exercising outdoors. 
There are no restrictions on operating hours for essential businesses within the city, as opposed to the county which restricts them from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
The previous list of essential businesses was repealed and replaced with a more expansive group.
Among the businesses that must remain closed are massage, manicure/pedicure, hairstyling, and personal grooming because they would not be able to maintain six feet of separation. Massages for medical purposes, such as chiropractic procedures, are exempt. 
Gyms and other workout venues are to remain closed. 
Event spaces are to remain closed, including event spaces inside hotels. 
Other businesses can remain open, and they are allowed more than 10 people inside, if they can maintain at least six feet between. City Manager Ray Gibson cited craft stores, grocery stores, and businesses like Home Depot as examples. 
The walking trails at Patriot Park will remain open, though the separation minimum must be maintained. 
Churches can still host services if they maintain separation, with online services encouraged. 
Restrictions on restaurants remain, limiting them to take out or delivery only. Restaurants who do not have a drive-through window may allow customers to come inside to pick up food, provided they maintain six feet of separation. 
Cafeterias in nursing homes are exempt from dine-in restrictions, with the six feet separation maintained.

The full ordinance can be viewed at: https://fayetteville-ga.gov/government/current-agendas-minutes/",Georgia,"With 4 deaths in the books, the city of Fayetteville EASES restrictions put in place to combat Covid-19"

Calling is also a dead end as I just get an automated message stating everyone is already on a call right now and it hangs up on me instead of letting me hold for a representative. I’ve lost count of how many times I have called. 

I emailed an appeal but that has gone unanswered as well... The problem is I only have about 9 more days until I can’t appeal anymore.

If a patient presents w only one symptom or less they cannot wear mask due to lack of having enough. If healthcare workers had access to enough mask to wear them all shift long the spread would be seriously dampened as asymptomatic carriers are (as most of us know) a very real issue. If you were diligent and prepared by stockpiling dozens or hundreds of mask, kudos to you; there is nothing wrong w being well prepared.

We are attracted to Georgia because the houses are supwr cheap in major cities like Atlanta. I found some 3 bedfroom/2 bath houses for $200k. In Mass, you will not find a nice house that doesn't need extreme repair dor that price. Plus taxes in Mass are very high.

I am finishing a master of science degree in mechanical engineering, and there seems to be a surplus of jobs too for my fiancee and I.

I was talking to my friend to recently relocated to NC from Mass, and he was looking into Georgia but he said the are some weird job laws in Georgia. I can not find any truth to this and he hasn't guven me a reason as to why he said that.
