Assuming that:

* The 6 foot size estimate is even close to accurate (big ""if"" considering they were only spotted at night.).
* The reported group sized is between 5-30 (iirc). 

The size and number of drones flying in unison makes this a big budget thing ruling out hobbyists. Possible operators would include government agencies, military, medium to large private companies, research institutions, and criminal organisations (I'm putting this one waaaay down the list).

If the operators are anything but government or military they would need to apply for these waivers from the FAA to be used (legally) as they are currently: 

* Daylight Operations
*  Operation of Multiple Small UAS (unless there are 5-30 pilots flying in perfect unison)
*  Operation Over People (possibly according to reports)
*  Visual Line of Sight Aircraft Operation (possibly considering reported distances traveled)

I am in McCook and they flew over and passed home last night. They're flying in a fixed pattern and there have been reports of some turning around but no credible reports of those stopping and reversing. So I'm very strongly leaning towards the idea that these are fixed-wing drones. Which when the FAA started interfering a lot, about five years ago, they changed everything to legally being called a drone. Also, for quadcopter style drones to fly as far as with these have been reported flying is almost impossible right now. We have hella good technology but they're poorly efficient for distance even with LiPO batteries. I had a foam board fixed-wing drone that I made myself. It had a 7-foot wingspan and it cost me all the $50. I could have put GPS in it or cameras to fly by site and it wasn't easily flown 35 miles. So I think these are rather cheap to buy fix sling drones or homemade fix swing drones. Also for these two be big sticks foot wingspan quadcopters they require commercial license is almost certainly because they will be over 55 lb. Sorry if there's a ton of typos.

There is oil exploration in the area.

The drones appear to be focused on the Colorado side of the border.

Nebraska has full coverage LiDAR ground survey for the state in the public domain.

Colorado appears to not have LiDAR for the area this is happening.

So I think its a terrestrial LiDAR survey from drones.  To get high resolution, they could be flying swaths as little as 75-100 yards wide which would explain the longer duration and number of drones.

The argument against this is that this would be a horribly inefficient way to go about this.  Whereever they are based would have to have a LOT of battery charging capacity.

Yang and warren are progressive, but warren has slowly moved away from some of her progressive ideas  and Yang isn’t as progressive as Bernie.

It’s important to remember, over the past 40-50 years, Democrats have moved to the right. Obama and the Clintons (along with Biden, Buttigieg, and Klobuchar) have much more in common with Trump, the Bush’s and regan than they do with FDR, JFK, and LBJ.

If those distances are accurate then they are operating beyond line of sight which means they are operating autonomous or via satellite. Directional and line of sight and satellite dishes are obvious and easy to spot.

His reasoning is backed by all of the farmers he buys corn from. Lack of government aid for the flooding has ruined many crops this year and has financially devastated hardworking people. My dad struggles every day to keep the ethanol plant running, because “the president is more concerned with doing business with foreign oil companies than providing incentives for renewable energy.” We seem to be moving in the opposite direction.

I'd say this one sits about 200 feet off the ground. I posted on the FB page about all of this and had people telling me the bright one was Venus. I've watched the damn thing hover for a couple hours and cut the lights and disappear. 

Once the ""mothership"" looks to be in place, withing about 5 minutes we start seeing the larger fixed wing style, but flying much higher and they are booking it.  They seem to be following a path in a grid pattern like has already been stated. 

Yesterday morning I was driving into Gibbon to head to work and I saw one hovering just above a power pole. It was definitely a very large fixed wing craft. As soon as I stopped to take a picture it took off. 

I have spent the last few nights feeling like I'm losing my damn mind. 

I'm guessing we may have them out here again tonight, as it seems they stick around and area for 3-5 nights and then move on.",1578142738,fd274oi

194,194,mommaneedscoffee,"Yes. 
It seems like the ""mothership"" just kind of hovers for a couple hours and then disappears. The ""mothership"" ones look to be more like the rotary type. The ones that appear after the ""mothership"" are the fixed wing type and they are the ones higher up and flying in a grid pattern. I've tried to get photos and videos of them, but with how dark it is they just look like floating blobs and flashing lights. I have some video from last night when we saw 6-10 at one time. 

Yesterday morning (12/3/2020) I saw them in the same place as normal when I let my dogs out flying like they were the night before, this was around 5:15 a.m. The hovering one I saw north of the interstate heading into Gibbon, NE around 7:10 a.m. It wasn't fully light out yet, but light enough that combined with the brights on my vehicle I could see it. 

It's incredibly concerning to me. I can honestly say this is a type of invasion and violation that I've never felt before. 

We bought a place in the country for the peace, quiet, and assumed privacy, so for this to happen is incredibly scary.

The drones appear to be flying in a grid-like pattern. They started in Colorado and have moved West into Nebraska. None of the theories other than military makes sense to me. If it was commercial, logistically they'd need a ""command vehicle"" near the drones, and legally they'd need the waivers we haven't seen with the FAA. Also, if it wasn't military, we'd see them scrambling their own military helicopters and drones to either capture or destroy the illegally flown drones.

So why the grid patterns? It appears that the drones are searching for something. What if the military ""lost"" a piece of equipment? Lost a piece of equipment in the area of the country with the most ICBMs with nuclear warheads in the country.

I didn't really think much of it at the time. 

I went out after dusk this evening due to the high number of sightings in central NE area last night, to see if they were still around, and around 700pm on the east side of town I watched one appear and start to travel west towards Grand island. Once it traveled over my vicinity and approached Grand island, 6 others in perfect equal spacing appeared from the West from the Grand island area in a single file line, all travelling in perfect synchronicity with each other speed and spacing wise. Once they met the object flying west, it instantly locked into line with the rest of them, and they all traveled back in the east-southeast direction over me. Once they got east of me, they each shut their lights off in the exact same position in the sky one by one once they reached that position and I didnt see them after that.

After hearing law enforcements statements, it's obvious these are government related.Due to the way they have slowly spread across the state and are blanketing the entire area it may be safe to say they are mapping, or looking for something. Ramped up training of drone swarm search and recon tech also might be the case, who knows.

The Archway in Kearney can occupy a full day. There is also a firefighters museum nearby if you're into that.

Grand Island is the North American home if Case IH combine production. If you’re interested in agriculture or not, they’re aren’t many places you can see a half million dollar vehicle being built. They do offer tours. 

Hornady ammo also offers tours. 

GI has several good restaurants downtown — Coney Island, Chocolate Bar, Wave Pizza, Sin City. And lots of good little Mexican places. Downtown Hastings has good places too — Odyssey, Back Alley, Big Dally’s for a  sandwich. 

Horse racing - live race season at Fonner Park. You can also see the state fairgrounds and visit the Raising Nebraska exhibit, which is basically a science museum dedicated to agriculture.

It's not because there aren't builders willing to pump out small houses in bulk. The economics of it just aren't right.

At best, what this enables is for house flippers to buy a property, convert it to a duplex, and resell it as that. I can't imagine there are many existing properties that are laid out for that to be a quick or easy fix, so then you're running right back up against the material and labor cost issues.

All this work for an end-result of an 8-10 percent reduction in my property taxes? In a mere THREE years, my property tax bill went up by about 33 percent!

Here are a couple things that would help drastically:

1. Change the laws so that if/when property values increase, tax rates are required to drop by a corresponding percentage. The end result being that if valuations increase, your property tax AMOUNT wouldn't change. But those valuations would be reset any time a property is sold.
2. Require counties to list, on the annual real estate tax statements, the details of each and every bond that is funded by those taxes. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Right now, there are a bunch of bonds rolled into the various line items that we don't even realize are there, not to mention the perpetual LPS bonds. Think of a credit card statement.

877,877,bareback_cowboy,"&gt;  Just because I get fired from jobs a lot due to me having to leave ky shift because my mom needs to run to the ER or whatever....

That's your problem. Fix it.

I don't know what your family's specific problems are, but I do know that there are plenty of services available besides just straight welfare.

1. There are transit services that are free or very cheap across the entire state. If your parents need to go to the doctor, they can arrange rides using those services.

2. Health and Human Services can direct you to local social services that can help with disabled family members. You say ""central Nebraska"", so that's a pretty big area, but look for places like Community Action Partners. There's a CAP in Kearney that provides services for 13 or 14 counties from Hastings to Cozad/Lexington, north and south of the interstate.

And again, I don't know your specific problems, but listen to what the social workers tell you. Why is your income too high? If your family has money, then use it to get help. If your family has money on paper simply because your parents, your siblings, and your nieces and nephews are all under a single roof, figure out how to break that apart so you/your parents/your siblings would qualify for Medicaid and/or services.

But specifically about your job, nobody will hire you because, as you said, you've been fired from multiple places. It's a tough hurdle to overcome but you can do it.

1. Figure out how to minimize disruptions. Your mom needs a ride to the doctor? Schedule them in advance. If it's really an emergency, get a list of friends or family members or neighbors that can take her.

2. Tell your potential employers the truth. ""In the past, I had to leave work a lot to take care of a family member. **That is not a problem any more because I have arranged for other people to handle that while I'm at work.** Tell them what the problem was and tell them how you have fixed it. Of course, if you haven't fixed it, you'll get fired again and be back where you started.

Finally, if you're still having trouble, some of those same resources (CAP) can help with job searches. The state and the non-profits that work for it have a vested interest in getting you employed. Have them look at your resume, do some practice interviews. You can get some feedback and you'll be able to find something.

Good luck!",1579652483,ff7lmgr
878,878,decorama,"Family is important. But is there anything you can manage differently? Why do you have to take care of your sister's kids? That should be her responsibility - not yours. Look for support in taking care of your Mom. Is your sister helping? Your line ""mom needs to run to the ER or whatever"" makes it sound like a common issue. Perhaps she needs assisted living of some kind?

If family is more important to you than income cool beans. There's plenty of people that are like that. Your dad needs to pay you. Or whoever page for the rest of the stuff for the person you take care of. You have to make definitive changes. On top of all of that I would strongly suggest that you recheck son of what you've been told through different agencies.

If you have significant mental health, intellectual/developmental or other disability needs, I would recommend googling to see what lawyers specialize in disability cases in your area, and give one or two a call.

The internet literally has opened the door for anyone to make a business. I have a few side hustles that make me a huge chunk of money but not my full time job (could be if I wanted) but the catch is I work my fucking ass off to make them work. Find something your good at and sell, make, deliver whatever and go hard.

1187,1187,berberine,"I believe the gentleman in the video was James Osborn, of Ainsworth. I certainly wouldn't drink fracking wastewater. No one knows what, exactly, is in fracking wastewater.

It is my understanding that the water that is mixed with the fracking chemicals is generally of the drinkable variety.

We fought with the company involved to find out what chemicals they used and were stonewalled at every turn. No one really knows what chemicals are used in fracking and each company that does it claims they have their own proprietary formula to frack.

The issue during these hearings was the Terex Corporation was going to ship their wastewater from Colorado to a site 13 miles north of Mitchell in Sioux County. The wastewater was going to be sunk down below the Ogalalla aquifer. If their pipes ever broke, it could spill into the aquifer, contaminating the aquifer. Think about how big the aquifer is. Do you want contaminated wastewater getting into your clean water supply?

One side tried to convince everyone that even if ""a casing has a leak, there’s another string of casing that covers the aquifer. If the tubing and casing leaks, there’s still another layer of cement and pipe."" The other side, which the man in the video was on, didn't want the wastewater anywhere near the Ogallala aquifer because of the risk of contamination.

Although the site was located in Sioux County, the NGOCC is in Sidney. Initial pushback happened during the county commissioners' meetings in Sioux County. I think there were two meetings there, possibly three. The state legislature held a hearing and ESU #13 was opened up so people didn't have to travel to Lincoln to testify. 

Then, the NGOCC said they would hold a meeting in Sidney. There were several hundred people who showed up. My publisher, editor and I covered it. There was a lot of testimony from all sides from regular folks to industry experts.

The hearing in OP's video was also held in Sidney. At the last minute, people were told only 60 people would be let in because there wasn't enough room. The video here was posted by Bold Nebraska.

I attended the final court hearing in Sidney. While I try to be impartial, I always thought it was a dick move to make elderly ranchers travel so much and so often to fight for something that was right up against their land. IIRC, only people who had property within 1/2 mile of the proposed site could appeal. That was two people.

The only reason ""we"" won (and the paper took the stance that fracking was wrong and shouldn't be allowed) is because the NOGCC didn't have the authority to issue the permits. By the time the case got through the courts, the company wasn't interested in the site anymore. I can't remember the bill, but the state legislature modified the NOGCC's authority so they can issue permits in the future.",1580432907,fg1tcta

4. And lastly, make false and misleading statements. There are 20+ government agency's who's job it is to decide where foreign aid goes. Trump held aid to get a quid-pro-quo from a country for something that would personally benefit him. President Trump was informed of a whistleblower's complaint about his dealings with Ukraine before he released aid that had been withheld from the country. Considering the aid went to the same ""people"", it's a farce to act as if his reason of holding aid was for anything but his own personal gain. Bolton, Lev Parnes, and many others have said the same thing.

1328,1328,teebob21,"I'm just a citizen, not a public policy expert or a politics wonk. The following is just how I see it + some Google time.

To start with, the census is [a constitutional mandate of the federal government.](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/census-constitution.html) It was made a decennial survey of the population in 1954.

From this perspective, it's a ""federal issue"". Why should individual states have to budget for a federal objective......but oh yeah....dollars. States are incentivized to ensure that every person possible is counted, since the next decade of funding will rely on these results.

As such, there are efforts to create state ""complete count commissions"". Basically, state tax dollars go to fund the ""getting out the vote"" of the census.

Now, one might ask: why might some residents *not* want to respond to the census?

The reasons, again, are hard to discuss without political and social implications. I'm not here for that; I'm laying out facts. As an example: Hispanic migrant communities are notoriously hard to get an accurate census count. These communities have distrust of a government agency asking how many people live in their household, and what is their employer? This reluctance is often cited as being fear of deportation due to illegal immigration....but for whatever reason, it exists.

It is in the best financial interest of the states to get an accurate count of its population. But at what cost? Is it the federal government's job, or the state's? Each of us is likely to hold a different opinion.

To quote the TL;DR of the article: Gov. Pete Ricketts signed a proclamation Monday encouraging Nebraskans to respond to the upcoming census. Last year Ricketts vetoed a bill that would have created a statewide committee to coordinate census outreach efforts.",1580808714,fgi6wvw

My contention was that a higher census count (the point of the committee) would lead to more federal funds --&gt; which could be used for roads and schools

Government is not always inept. Corporations aren't always efficient. Your 10 years experience doesn't negate the fact that government action does, sometime, get things right / can actually help. Blanket ""government is bad"" statements, hell any blanket ""x"" is always ""y"" statements are bad for discussing policy.

Those private funds could be sent as donations towards rural school districts that are underfunded instead.   


It's not that the idea can't ever work, it's that it's flawed from the outset. It would be better off if a 501(c)3 were established, then let that do the outreach. But the University people look like Government officials (because they are.) That is not going to help, though there are lot's of people that don't trust the census as they think it's akin to a: gun registry, government euthanasia program, tied to FEMA for extermination camps and any of hundreds of other insane conspiracy theories.

* any and all husker sporting events.  I'm a season ticket holder for basketball and it's often the highlight of my week during the dreary winter.
* some great golf courses in and around the town
* awesome little downtwon scene known as ""the railyard"" with bars and restaurants.
   * ""O"" street caters more to your college crowd with a lot of bars in walking distance
* there is a bike trail that runs through almost the entire city (at least southside) and is great for walking/running/etc. or just getting around town without driving
* there is a comedy club and theatre down in the railyard area that can provide wonderful entertainment as well as the Lied Theatre which attracts some pretty big names and shows
* Pinnacle Bank Arena is an amazing facility and attracts a lot of artists for concerts and is a blast to go to.  I saw Smackdown Live there a year or so ago (not a wrestling fan at all) and the experience was unbelievable.  Such a great venue

1428,1428,YaBoiJFlo,"As someone who is also from Southern California, currently attending UNL, and had not visited until the summer before I was due to attend; I really enjoy it here. There are some things about home that I certainly miss, namely In-N-Out and the beach. As most others have said, it is always cold and always windy, however if you have the right gear it is not so bad. The key to being successful and staving off homesickness is to build a good friend group. These people will become your family away from home. They will help you get through the college grind. Luckily, there is no easier time to make friends than freshman year of college because everyone is trying to make friends. Join academic and non-academic clubs. Basically join whatever interests you, and only stay in the ones that really stick with you. Joining too many clubs can burn anyone out. The people saying that it will be an insane culture shock are exaggerating. You're still in the US, and people still speak English. Lincoln feels pretty big when you first get here, especially at the football games (which I highly recommend getting season tickets for at least one season). Just be open minded to new experiences, and go on as many road trips as you can. Exploration is the best part of moving somewhere new. Good luck my friend!

I could provide more specifics but I doubt it’d be terribly relevant since it’s been so long.

Also, from my experience, people quit Raikes generally because it’s either too restrictive on their time, and they have discovered in college that they want to do other awesome stuff, or because they were recruited into it thinking they could sort of dual major it with pre-med or something else far afield, which just doesn’t work. It’s very rare that someone leaves because of the difficulty.",1581258098,fh2mxgb

1513,1513,Brilliant-King,"Hey! Congrats on admission. I’m a current Junior in the program, so I’d love to give some insight.

If you made in into the program, there is a 99% chance (if not more), that you have all the skills necessary to succeed in the program. Don’t let impostors syndrome get to you. When I started as a freshman, I had zero coding experience, though I was quite familiar and adept with computers. My small, rural high school offered zero coding, AP, Honors, IB, or dual credit courses, so I came in with nothing. Combined with my non-typical (for Raikes) engineering major, I’ve had to take heavy course loads every semester, and I’ve done just fine.

Everyone I know that has left the program either decided 1) that the coding/business combo wasn’t in their interest, or 2) that video games or some other past time was more important than their schoolwork. During one of the interview days, I was part of the parent panel, and I stressed the importance to them of encouraging their sons/daughters to find a healthy balance between work and fun. There will be plenty of it in Raikes.

1514,1514,virtualolson,Thank you very much for the response. That is very reassuring so thank you very much for the advice/words of wisdom.

The camp had 3 current students and one recently graduated act as TAs and so they were able to give a ton of information about the school. 

I'm from a very small town and my school works very hard to help every student graduate and not get held back, so part of what really drew me in about the program is how Raikes does this too. I know other comments mention this but you really do seem to have every resource available to help you succeed. They believe everyone to be like family and so if you're struggling there's no shortage of people available to help you.

Hopefully this helps!",1581262746,fh2z4ew
1516,1516,andrewsmd87,"I can't speak to the difficulty of that program but I went to school for CS and there are a few things I wish someone had told me ahead of time that I feel are probably universal.

The first is be prepared to work. IDK what HS was like for you but I rarely had homework or had to study, outside of school hours. I was always able to grasp things and get my work done relatively quickly. That changed in college, not for just the programming classes but overall.

Find out when your programming teacher's office hours are and try to plan time to work on stuff, near them at those times if you can. Along the same lines, find out if they offer any tutoring or group help type things for coding, and try to be there during those times to work as well.

In my case they had a senior level student in the labs at set times a few times a week to answer programming questions, and until you get a strong foothold on coding (unless you already have one) that will be immensely helpful. A lot of times new programmers will get stuck on some dumb little thing that someone with some experience can just spot in a couple minutes. This isn't them doing your work for you, it's, oh yea in this case it returns 0 and the way you're trying to evaluate it, it thinks it's false, even though 0 technically means it exists, -1 is what you want to check. Small things like that.

Also, start on your homework ASAP. If they give it to you tuesday and it's due in a week, try to be started on it by that evening or Wed. I guarantee you it will take longer than you expect, and 10 hours of work straight the night before will not yield you the same result as 5 2 hour spurts across a week. Plus, when you hit one of those walls, you're not under crunch time to get something done. You can take a step away for a day, and/or wait to ask your professor or the tutors or whatever. It will be 100% less stressful, trust me.

All of that advice needs to be applied to any math classes you have as well. Unless you double major in some stem field or something, 95% of your other classes will not take up near the time that CS and math ones do. The 5% are if you get some asshole teacher who thinks their 100 level intro to psychology class should require you to write a PHD level dissertation or something (they exist). But also, in that case, if you get in day one and the work load seems ridiculous for the given class that is just a gen ed, drop it and pick up one from a different teacher. I REALLY wish someone had given me that advice as well.",1581264064,fh32u7t

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Gun Control Act (GCA), codified at 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), makes it unlawful for certain categories of persons to ship, transport, receive, or possess firearms or ammunition, to include any person:  
&gt;  
&gt;*convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*who is a fugitive from justice;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act, codified at 21 U.S.C. § 802);*  
&gt;  
&gt;*who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*who is an illegal alien;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*who has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*who has renounced his or her United States citizenship;*  
&gt;  
&gt;*who is subject to a court order restraining the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of the intimate partner; or*  
&gt;  
&gt;*who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.*  
&gt;  
&gt;The GCA at 18 U.S.C. § 922(n) also makes it unlawful for any person under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to ship, transport, or receive firearms or ammunition.   
&gt;  
&gt;Further, the GCA at 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) makes it unlawful to sell or otherwise dispose of firearms or ammunition to any person who is prohibited from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms or ammunition.

It seems they were thinking about that. From what I've read, the proposed bill *for Nebraska* requires **clear** evidence of ""extreme"" risk of violence as found by a court. The so-called jilted ex-lover wouldn't easily be able to fake this. A simple restraining order or a single eye-witness with no physical evidence wouldn't be enough to trigger this sort of red flag.  

&gt; Others take it a step further and say that this gives the government the ability to take away your guns with impunity

Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's really arguing with people who take it this far. There's no reasoning with paranoia.  

Another important note, the removal of firearms wouldn't be permanent. It's only temporary. The goal is to remove access while the person cools down or seeks help. I believe one of the quoted cases to support this is when somebody attempted suicide, failed, and then while being treated, killed some colleagues and himself. A red flag law might've saved lives there.

Red Flag laws are a reactionary measure, and clearly haven't done their job in states where they are in place, and have worked to cause deaths of people that have been ""Red Flagged.""

The biggest thing that should be done is to look into fixing the reporting systems at the state, federal, county, city, and military levels to the FBI NICS database to provide accurate information to firearm dealers.

Secondly, we need to make NICS checks open to individuals as a voluntary action, and I guarantee you'll find more people choosing to use it rather than sell to a prohibited person.

You missed ""alleged without evidence"".  If the police have reasonable suspicion that someone has committed a crime (e.g. ""Here's the email where my ex-spouse threatened to shoot me""), they are going to arrest and charge someone under existing laws (death threats are illegal).  The same goes for something like ""my ex-spouse is standing in my yard screaming at me and waving a gun"" - it's going to get them arrested for brandishing at the very least.


The whole concept of Red Flag laws is to bypass reasonable suspicion, evidence, and due process to trample someone's rights.  E.g. if I called the police and said ""I believe /u/swattages has firearms and is dangerous"", Red Flag laws would have the police kicking down your door to seize your firearms based on statements from me that are hearsay *at best*.  Under existing law (read: due process) the police might investigate, but they're not taking anything away based on my unsubstantiated allegations.",1581450793,fhbvki4

1612,1612,marr75,"&gt; Lets be honest here, gun violence has been consistently trending down for over 40 years.

Violence in general has been trending down, so this same argument can be applied to (some of) the need to possess firearms. I say this because I disagree with the logic for the same reason in both cases: trends and probability don't matter when you're talking about individuals making decisions about small chances of dying. In the same way that many gun owners want to be able to protect themselves (with guns) from low probability events like muggings gone wrong, gun control advocates want to be able to protect themselves (with legislation) from low probability events like gun violence. It's your life, it's the sum total of everything you are and everything you have, I no longer expect to be able to talk people out of their positions on the matter using statistical trends. I understand and respect people's desire and strategic approach when choosing whether it's better to have a tiny chance of dying from suicide/an accident because there's a gun in the home vs a tiny chance of dying during a mugging gone wrong/""bad guy with a gun"" and you're unarmed scenario. Neither side is being fully ""rational"", they both want agency over whether they will die ""that way"", one through gun ownership, one through gun control - regardless of the declining rates of violence.

The deal was that they could use the railroad right of way (the land set aside for the tracks) to lay main trunks for the phones lines for free in exchange for free access to the lines to make calls (inside the rail companies.) Later the Union Pacific laid data cables across the country and sold space (bandwidth) on those trunks to ISP’s. This was later spun off into Level 3 communications.

Second

&gt; ""This right to bear arms shall not be infringed, meaning that it is self-evident and inalienable. You cannot have your weaponry seized without due process.""

Fourth

&gt; ""This right cannot be violated without a Warrant being issued upon **probable cause supported by Oath or Affirmation.** The left will often argue that because of the warrant, all due process has been adhered to in Red Flag Laws. Advocates for the Red Flag Laws try to claim that simply because a Warrant is issued, all Due Process is being adhered to. When an ex boyfriend, girlfriend or otherwise can simply CLAIM that you are a threat to yourself or others, any warrant issued is NOT upon probably cause, nor is it supported by oath or affirmation.""

Fifth

By their very design, Red Flags laws put a torch to the concept of due process.

Sixth

&gt; ""The Sixth Amendment goes further in to Due Process saying that we have a right to a speedy and public trial, impartial jury, to be informed of the crime we have committed, the nature and cause of the accusation, to confront the witness, obtain witnesses in our favor, as well as assistance of counsel in our defense. Red Flag Laws deprive us of ALL of these guaranteed rights. Where is the speedy and public trial? Where is the impartial jury? When are we informed of a crime committed? What crime was even committed? We never get to confront a witness or call our own witnesses.""

Seventh

The value of virtually every gun is over $20. 7th guarantees a trial by jury for items over that amount, but Red Flag laws take away your property before you've had a trial, been convicted of any crime, heck even before you know the charges brought against you.

Fourteenth
&gt; Quoting the amendment: *""nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""*

There's that pesky due process again.

&gt; Are there any court cases pointing to such?

Let's say the legislature of your state passes a law in which speech endorsing [certain views of yours] is suddenly criminal. Now police can arrest you if they receive a tip from, say a coworker or ex, that claim you are participating in said speech.

They were divided into inbound and outbound as well as Nebraska and all the other states.  They filled out kitchen table when he was on call.

Vivid memories of my dad in the kitchen with a phone in each hand.  Deaf in one ear or he would have learned how to have simultaneous conversations I am sure.

The deal was that these lines were not just plentiful, but were staggeringly cheap because of a screw up on ATTs part.  They dropped a transatlantic cable into Omaha for dedicated long distance thinking that SAC would buy it.  SAC was using radio and other communication systems even back then (see the giant antenna farm north of Elkhorn).  They didn't buy the lines and ATT scrambled to find buyers.

First off, this article was pretty weak as hell. I can't even find the original on autowise.com 

I did find

&gt;The car news site Autowise put together the map based on geotagged Twitter data in the last month. During that time, more than 20,000 Americans have tweeted about potholes.

1) One month Twitter study. Nice. This is to general clicks from Nebraska and Missouri so we go to autowise.com

2) It's in states where freeze thaw cycles are the worst in the dead of winter

3) This is garbage clickbait news.

It’s a little harder to gain experience and complete courses outside of these areas if you are interested in other areas (Cybersecurity, IT, Hardware, etc.) From what I know of the business side, there are a whole lot of actuaries who do very well, but they also have the complaint that the capstone focuses too much on software development.

Also, Bernie is much more socialist where Warren is not. I don't want our country to go full socialist, but I think having a socialist president with a left-leaning congress, we'll get some actual though-provoking and publicly beneficial debates/lawmaking that will improve the country as a whole for everyone STARTING from the working class and moving up to the middle and least for the wealthy class (but still somewhat beneficial for them). After-all, it's the spending of money from the poor and middle-class that subsidizes profits for the wealthy. They can't do that if they're spending everything on surviving.

Also, better social systems will reduce violence and mental health epidemics which will reduce gun violence which will reduce calls for gun restrictions. That's why I vote Bernie, Warren is just a little too right for what I think needs to get done in the next 4 years.

I don't believe I'm making welfare a 40 year race to pop out children, and I know a handful of people that made that their job.  But they only did it as they didn't have any other options.

The ever important **delegate** count happens at the county and state level conventions.

1.  You can go to your county convention and can be elected/selected to go to the state convention as a delegate for your preferred presidential candidate. 
2. At the state convention you can then be elected as a delegate for your preferred presidential candidate to go to the national convention.

I can't stress enough how important it is to attend the convention as a supporter of your candidate. There are rules and methods by which the parties use to establish the candidate delegate count that could be decided at the county and state conventions.

The VOTER FRAUD that is happening is the fraudulent attempts to disenfranchise voters by the Republican Party, which is why the Republicans have fought so hard against efforts to secure our voting systems and thus our elections.

&gt;Fraudulent voting is a problem.

Prove it.

Let's say I take you at your word on this...(which I don't, but for the sake of argument)

Here's the problem with your lack of logic - 78,000 votes were fraudulently cast in 2018 SPREAD ACROSS THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES.  Which means that they DIDN'T impact the 5 cities you're trying to pretend that they did.

This is another in a LONG LINE of your dishonest posts in this subreddit where you try to prop up the failing Republican Party.  Just let it go man - your kind is dying off.

1958,1958,jtothewtothes,"True. What's happening, at least in my experience living in rural Nebraska is families own the land collectively and share the profits.

 So for a real life example, you have 3 brothers who all have their own families and houses. The 3 of them together can do more work and make more profit than just one farmer on his own, especially as their family (children) age and are able to help out. They then buy land that their older farmer friend are selling because either they are too old to farm it or not worth the profits being a single farmer. Farm numbers go do, total farmed land remains the same. This is what has been happening in at least in Platte and Nance Counties since the 1950s and shouldn't be a huge surprise. 

Also, as a side point, the notion the farmer are poor is just not accurate. Farmer were poor in early American and Nebraskan history because literally they grew/raised the food they ate and had very little access to markets to sell their products. Today farmers, at least in Nebraska, are firmly in the middle class, perhaps even the upper middle class. The average farm size in Nebraska from the article is 982 acres. Nobody who owns 982 acres of farmland in Nebraska is  poor.  The government has been heavily subsidizing farms, particulary corn production since LBJ's campaign against poverty in the 60s. Literally the entire corn industry is a made up economy by US government. No cattle 100 years ago ever ate corn like they do today. Corn is an unnatural food source for cattle. Corn is in thousands of foods at the grocery store that have nothing to do with corn. Corn is in our gasoline for pete's sake.... All of this is government sponsored to 1. Give farmers a job 2. Make food cheaper 3. Make fuel cheaper. As the saying goes, if a farmer wants to make more money, ""just put up another mailbox. """,1582399020,figfoip

I mentioned the zoning codes for lincoln in another thread on this issue - there are eight residential zones and 5 of them allow all these ""middle housing"" units. This law would basically force Lincoln to allow these items in zones R1 through R3, areas that are currently only open to single family residences and a density of between 4 to 6 homes per acre (IIRC - don't care enough to look up the specifics again).

BUT, this law allows the city to maintain the current setback requirements! So who gives a fuck? My home, in an R4 area, is already encroaching on the setbacks because it was built before they became law. Most homes in these older established neighborhoods already are too big under the current regulations. Result? It'll still be illegal to build these middle housing units in those areas because they won't be able to fit on the lots, and this law wouldn't change that.

This is a solution in search of a problem. If we actually had laws prohibiting these types of structures and if cities and towns were actually fighting against them, I could see a point to them, but that's simply not the issue in Nebraska.",1582438876,fij9nca

Now if the middle class could afford nice housing without it eating 50% or more of their income then there would be less demand for cheaper housing which should lower rents while driving home sales for younger people.  

Building shanty towns on the middle of nowhere isn't going to solve the fact that poor people cant afford to live anywhere.

There are [fifty seven State Recreation Areas](http://outdoornebraska.gov/staterecreationareas/) however and [nine State Historical Parks](http://outdoornebraska.gov/statehistoricalparks/)

From the Game and Parks FAQ:

&gt; State Parks are public use areas of significant scenic, scientific and/or historical values and of sufficient size to allow adequate development. From our standpoint, State Parks are destination areas. They have many amenities available daily to guests, ranging from swimming and paddle boating to horse trail rides and jeep rides. Entertainment is offered and it is up to the guest how much or little they would like to participate.

&gt; State Recreation Areas are areas that possess resource values primarily associated with active outdoor recreation pursuits, day-use activities and camping. All the state’s major water-oriented areas fall in this classification. State Recreation Areas are mainly situated along bodies of water. Guests provide their own entertainment, primarily fishing and boating.

&gt; State Historical Parks are sites that have notable historical significance to the State of Nebraska. State Historical Parks offer a chance for cultural interpretation. Living history demonstrations are periodically staged and guests can tour the historic grounds and buildings.

I've been to all of the parks, most of the recreation areas, and four of the historical parks, and I've also done the Nebraska passport the past two years.

All of the parks are great - the old German POW camp at Fort Robinson is neat. Camping at Chadron is probably my favorite and it's just down the road from Robinson. Canoeing the Niobrara is a relaxing Saturday and camping at Smith Falls afterwards is always fun. Living in Lincoln, I go to Platte River State Park and use their .22 rifle range sometimes - it's a short drive and a nice range that's well run. But to pick a favorite... I don't think I could, I have so many great memories from all of them.

As for State Recreation areas though, Calamus Reservoir is one of the best. Burwell has a great pizza place (and other little shops and occasionally they've been known to host a rodeo), the lake is huge and never terribly crowded, and the surrounding Sand Hills are beautiful. Plus you can take a drive an hour further and check out the Nebraska National Forest at Halsey.

There's so many fun things to do at the parks and sra's!",1582684641,fisgyr3
2096,2096,__WanderLust_,"Indian Cave State Park.

I've been to all of the state parks and this one is by far my most favorite. I like that the biodiversity is so extreme in that it's a crossroads for a lot of eastern and western species of fauna and flora. The history in the region is fascinating and the geology is unique compared to the rest of the state.

My favorite part is that it's so primitive and far off from the cities. I'd die if the decided to make it into basically a theme park like Platte River and Mahoney. This special gem needs to stay wild. I hope others agree.",1582686819,fiskv9f

Dick_head helped the subreddit by trolling the founder of the sub who was not respecting elections and was being tyrannical, banning every member of the democratically senate.  The conflict ended when jackie gave up from a mixture of trolling, the subreddit moving all members to r/SimRepublic and trying to sell the subreddit.  

Originally when he was banned from the subreddit, it was during the jackie crisis, which was before we had a functioning court system which lead to a movement to give him a fair trail.

Once he was unbanned he pushed the line and managed to troll the subreddit without being banned.  

Eventually though he got a month long ban given out by our court system.

When he returned he was a changed man.  Took the sub mostly seriously and almost won the presidential vote.  However he was sued for harassment and was banned for 3 months by the court.

Fair enough. I think people were attempting? to be more efficient/specific but just created more confusion instead.

Yeah, I’m not sure what’s going on there. On Reddit it can be pretty common to find corrupt mod teams, sadly :/

2295,2295,eczblack,"Hello! We just moved from las Vegas to Omaha 6 months ago. Some things we noticed:

-housing is more expensive than we figured it would be. Pretty comparable to las Vegas, both rent and buying. 

- meat and fresh veg is less expensive but most other goods are a bit higher

-utilities are about even because of the humidity. It's not as hot but you run air conditioning/heating more. There is no dry air here. You are gonna want to run the air conditioner when it gets to mid 80s temps, if not before. It is just as windy here, if not more so, than Vegas.

-if you like the outdoorsy stuff, look into the camping at the state parks. There is a variety of stuff to do, from fishing to fossil digging to white water rafting. Nebraska has a program that leases out private land access for hunting and fishing, which eliminates having to know someone who owns land to gain access. 

-if you are going the speed limit, you are going too slow. Prepare to be glared at by cars desperate to get by you.

-football game days are nutty in Lincoln, especially traffic. Plan ahead. 

- I have yet to find good food at restaurants equal to the level we found in Vegas. Lots of restaurants, most are mediocre at best. I dream of Roberto's.

Fishing is better there than in Vegas (except no mountain trout streams).  Branched Oak lake would be great to do a little Kayak fishing and has great sunrises and a fair number of eagle sightings.

The Murdock trail connects Omaha to Lincoln (till the Platte objected) and if the rail to trail bridge is not totaled, it will be rebuilt.

Lincoln does have some good other outdoor activities such as farmer's markets, outdoor concerts/shows at the Pinewood Bowl, good dog parks, outdoor dining, etc. You didn't mention hunting, but that's an outdoorsy thing that a lot of people are in to, maybe not so much in the Lincoln area, but definitely in the state.

 - If you do not have a driver’s license or state-issued identification, you will need to register with a paper form. A fillable form is available at http://www.sos.ne.gov/elec/ele_forms.html. You can also find a paper application at any county election office, any Department of Motor Vehicle office, banks, libraries post offices and offices that offer state public assistance.
 - Note: If you utilize a written voter application, you will be asked to submit proof of your current address (a copy of your utility bill, bank statement, etc.) as well as sign the application. Through the online process, information is checked with the Department of Motor Vehicles and your signature is retrieved and added to your voter application.

The speed can be a good or a bad thing. It means that our leg is a lot more responsive, but it also means that things change often and bills that aren’t well thought out or will have long term repercussions are passed just as quickly as fix-it bills. 

It’s also a lot smaller and less unwieldy, so it’s a lot easier for regular citizens to reach out with their issues and an individual rep can champion it. You can actually see a real change just by talking to your rep and bringing things to their attention.

Incubation is anywhere from 5-14 days and you can spread it before showing any symptoms. You can even spread it for some length of time AFTER you've recovered. That means potentially 4-5 weeks of infecting the people around you. 

Mortality rates seem to be about twice as bad as influenza for healthy adults under 40, but are 10-100+ times higher in older/unhealthy people. 

So all of this has the potential to create a perfect storm where there aren't enough hospital beds and healthcare personnel to treat the people dying left and right because no one could bother to wash their hands and keep to themselves for a few weeks.",1584186569,fkh2zmo

The full press release can be found here: https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/chief-justice-heavican-our-state-courts-remain-open
 
Information regarding the impact of the Novel Coronavirus and COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. In order to ensure all lawyers have the most current information on our Emergency Preparedness Plans, the Nebraska Supreme Court will post all orders and communications from the Nebraska Supreme Court, the Administrative Office of the Courts and Probation, and local courts to the Nebraska Supreme Court’s website, https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/, as they are released.
 
We recognize that during this public health emergency, representing clients in litigated matters will present unique challenges. As members of the legal profession in Nebraska, you are both officers of the court and public citizens with a special responsibility for the quality of justice. Lawyers must stay current on all administrative orders, accommodate unexpected developments, and maintain a professional and courteous attitude toward other lawyers, litigants, judges, and court staff. 
 
All lawyers should be familiar and comply with:
 
- The Administrative Order issued by the Chief Justice on March 12, 2020, and the additional responsibility placed on lawyers pursuant to this order.
 
- Any order from a judicial district in which you have pending matters, and the responsibilities placed on lawyers pursuant to those specific orders.
 
In order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and assist the courts, please utilize electronic filing through the Nebraska.gov portal to reduce or eliminate trips to the courthouse when possible. In matters which are not urgent, we urge you to consider requesting, and agreeing to, continuances. When it is feasible, please request to participate in hearings telephonically or via video conferencing. Your cooperation and collaboration will permit our courts and probation offices to continue the essential functions of the Judicial Branch.
 
Additionally, as a result of this public health emergency, many civil legal aid organizations have temporarily closed their physical offices, and self-help desks are not being staffed. During this time, it is imperative that Nebraska lawyers devote professional time and resources to ensure that those who cannot afford legal counsel because of economic or social barriers have equal access to our system of justice.",1584924106,fl8hyvm

In order for your understanding of “social distancing” to be true, no person should come the 6 feet guidelines set by the CDC, of another person(s), animate or otherwise, that has been within 6 feet of said person(s), animate or otherwise. Everyone in a hospital that’s treating a patient with the virus would be guaranteed to contract the virus. This is not the case.

What makes a bathroom, or door, or otherwise inanimate object less or more likely to become germ-infested than a slice of bread, or a soda, or any other edible/in-edible items found within a food-service based business? 

Is it even possible to be completely distant from anyone or anything? To touch an object, animate or otherwise, that has not been in contact, or within 6 feet of another person? (no fapp puns intended)

I don’t think anyone thinks about the plastic casing containing the ground beef they bought is a possible carrier of a Virus, but it absolutely is. And so is the plastic package holding the toilet paper, so is the box housing the toothpaste, and also the plastic bags used for groceries.

Regarding hand washing, people attending events aren't going to have easy access to this unless they are using bathroom facilities. They're still opening the door, using the toilet, and then washing their hands after. They're then touching the door handle again.

3424,3424,swattages,"I don't know if you watched that Town Hall with Ricketts and the Director of Public Health (Dr. Anthone) last night, but it didn't exactly inspire confidence. They seem far too overconfident, and even though I approve of Rickett's social distancing orders and think the communication being done there has been pretty good, I don't think they're properly prepared to handle the strain this will put on our hospitals. They were also obviously playing a little bit of the PR game when absolute transparency is what is needed. Things that were said:  

- In response to questions about increased frequency of testing, Dr. Anthone remarked about how we've had only a linear growth, but then immediately said something to the effect of ""and that's good because that means we only have to test the high risk people, those who have traveled"", without addressing the obvious logic gap there that maybe we're only seeing linear growth because we are absolutely not testing enough. Ricketts chimed in about bumping up the widespread frequency of testing of the general public based on symptoms alone (paraphrased), but that it couldn't happen for at least another 4-6 weeks, which is WAY too late. They're going to focus on increased testing of medical staff and at-risk populations first (which is where a focus of limited tests should be), but it seems pretty clear we just don't have the capacity for the kind of testing we need right now and over the course of the next month.  
- Dr. Anthone estimated we'd hit the peak in maybe a week or two, if I heard him right. That makes absolutely zero sense just looking at the growth rates country-wide.  
- Dr. Anthone's plan for respirators seems to be ""hope we don't need the ones we have"". We have 600 state-wide total, and they've halted elective surgeries to free some up. Reminder: many are already in use, and those respirators are spread out across the entire state.  
- Did NOT address PPEs (unless I missed it somewhere), which will run out long before respirators, putting our medical staff at huge risk. The question posed by PBS was just more generalized, ""Are our hospitals prepared?"" It was a vague, overconfident answer with no depth.  

I don't know about you, but I lost trust in our Director of Public Health yesterday. Or, at least, I lost faith in our leaders' ability to be transparent about what's really going on in a time when it's needed most. We all know states across the country are really struggling to try to pull enough resources to fight this thing. Nebraska is no different, and I just found it appalling that they would try to lead us to believe otherwise.  

Right now, the country's confirmed cases are growing at an average of 29% new cases per day over the course of the last week (we've been hitting over 40% per day growth a number of days over this past month, probably due to NY's increased testing). The growth in deaths is an average of over 30% per day over the last week. That daily death growth rate is absolutely INSANE, especially considering that globally, that same number is around 13-14%, so we are experiencing a crazy explosion right now, and other states are really only just catching on. There's a sizable portion of states that are a week away from absolute-FUCKED-ville.   

The CDC has figured an average of 13 days from report to death, so if we lag our new death counts to our confirmed cases 13 days prior, depending on the actual mortality rate (maybe a 1.5% - 3.4% mortality rate), we might be closer to something like 4-9x more cases than is confirmed in the lab. That means we might be closer to a million cases in the US compared to the reported 104k.  

Even bringing our daily death growth rates down to the global level (around 14%), over the next 30 days, we could be looking at 80-90k dead bodies from this virus in the US. For comparison, H1N1 hit around 12k in the span of an entire year. Current rates suggest that could be closer to something you don't even want to imagine. Hell, we're probably looking at H1N1's total numbers after a year in about **8 more days**. The first COVID-19 death in the US occurred just under a MONTH ago. So, about a week and a month to hit an entire year of our last flu pandemic in the States. And THAT is with huge measures being implemented to try to contain this damn thing.  

I don't even want to talk about the # of hospitalizations.

My first question was how without enough testing how do we know we’re doing enough, his response was “well our model says we’re ahead of the curve”. I then asked how our model can be accurate without proper testing and he essentially just repeated himself. And my final question (not final but last one of mine they took) was to how many tests were doing and not our capability. All we ever hear about is the capacity for testing and not the numbers were actually testing. He said he didn’t know the exact number (how he doesn’t know is another topic) but we’re expanding to 1000 a day capacity. I feel like he is just echoing trumps rhetoric and staying on the good side of the Republican Party to set himself up for either a spot in congress or a presidential run. He has been asked multiple times about a stay at home order and until last night made it seem like it was never going to be an option. It seems to me that he would rather keep the economy going than take care of the citizens of Nebraska. I don’t understand how you can make these types of decisions without widespread testing.

I can't remember the details but the now former director made some comments basically saying ""if you have something to say about me, about the way I dress, etc say it to my face"" 

And then they went into an executive session closed to the public. Treasurer comes out of it say ""I resign, effective immmediately, good luck losers""

3435,3435,General_Operation,"Thanks for the write-up, that's good. You make a lot of good points and I certainly agree about Rickett's communication. We are having the same issue across the entire country: We are not testing enough. 

I completely understand the need to test the people who are showing symptoms, but here's something they are not talking about. This was about a week ago: My sister has been very sick. She had 3 of the four symptoms (didn't have a sore throat). She was unable to get tested. Their reasoning? ""You don't have all the symptoms and we do not have enough test kits. We have to save what we have for the most extreme cases"". 

That's the problem. The lack of restrictions is compounded by the fact that testing is not widespread. You want to keep the older people safe? You need to be testing everyone because there are perfectly healthy people carrying this thing and they have no idea. Greater restrictions are needed at least until we can start testing more people to identify who needs to be quarantined.",1585403896,flqqxyf

Before that, she had done nothing.

I think people underestimate how many travel back and forth from Omaha and Lincoln just for work every day.

The numbers are overall low so there's a lot of jumping around, and considering today is already at 11 new cases, that doesn't look anything like the ""linear growth"" Dr. Anothone claimed. Also, of the 2 that died, ""Neither person was identified in the positive test total until Friday.""  

The hell?!? They only tested positive the day they died??  

And then, ""Using press releases from local health departments and DHHS, 10/11 NOW has identified at least 16 cases of community spread."" That's 18-19% of total cases and we're still not testing symptomatic people? Even the clearly severe ones?? What the hell is going on??  

And it gets better because they talked around a question about presumptive cases (their answer was just talking about the changing definition lol what), ""Also of note this week, after requesting data on presumptive cases (people who are told they likely have COVID-19 based on symptoms, but aren't tested) and recoveries, 10/11 NOW has learned authorities are not tracking that data.""

3451,3451,lemonadestand,"I wondered how Nebraska looked compared to the surrounding states as far as reported cases go. I decided that I would rather look at the data normalized by population. So the numbers you see on the chart are the actual numbers for Missouri (the bordering state with the largest population). The numbers for Colorado are pretty close to their actual numbers  (because CO and MO have similar populations), but the numbers on the graph get progressively farther off from the actual numbers as the population of each state gets smaller. Notice that Wyoming's normalized numbers are about ten times as big as their actual numbers.

Still, I think this is a reasonable way to look at how the number of cases is growing in in states with very different populations. I'm working on a logarithmic graph of the same data for those of you who like to look at the slope of the line to see how quickly the increase is accelerating. I'll post that in a bit.

Let's work together to keep those curves as flat as possible.

3467,3467,stevewhite_news,"Ok I’ll try to do a chronology...

Mid aughts, state fair is out of money, attendance is lagging, and landlocked UNL wants land. 

Legislature votes in ‘08 to move fair to Grand Island. Lawsuits follow. Fair built in about one year, just in time for 2010 fair. 

Attendance and revenue soars for several years and things are generally positive on fair board. 

Then in the fall of 2017, long time director Joseph McDermott “retires” with contract for “consulting”. 

A few months later Lori Cox arrives from Montana, with promise to take fair that was starting to get stale and “move the pickle”, which is apparently about selling product. 

She brings in new staff folks, plans big bash for 2018, the 150th fair. But attendance wasn’t great. 

Big outdoor concerts don’t sell well. Rain forces them to be moved inside, where it’s obvious they didn’t have the ticket sales to justify big outside shows.

Meanwhile there are rumblings that Cox and some on the board aren’t seeing eye to eye. Plus the mayor (Jeremy Jensen) says the fair and their landlords at Fonner Park don’t get along. There’s an awkward city council meeting where both sides just pretend like everyone gets along when it’s clear there’s not much coordinations.

2019 was a rough year. Flooding across Nebraska, etc. This hit the fair too. The grounds literally flooded during the last week of August 2019 during the fair, leaving parking lots underwater. Attendance plummets. Costs soar. Plus the Sky Tram got stuck with people on it who had to be rescued. Not a good look, although that’s a third party vendor who runs the rides. 

Cox is a no-show for the big livestock championship at the end of the fair. This is seen as odd. It’s kind of the culmination of the fair’s ag mission and everyone who is everyone in the fair world is there. That’s in Labor Day, final day. Next day, board meets behind closed doors for hours and Cox is again nowhere to be found. You’d think the director would be there for meetings immediately after the fair. 

In the aftermath of the 2019 fair, the finance director with a newborn at home announces fair is deep in the red. They’re hemorrhaging money. He quits in the middle of the meeting. 

Somewhere around this time Joe Jordan reports board doesn’t like Cox, there’s a link in this thread. 

Cox stands up at a board meeting with a football and dramatically declares she’s the quarterback.

Then in November, the board slashed the budget, laying off the staff, including some longtime employees. 

This meeting includes possible open meetings violating. I objected to chair when he said they were going behind closed doors to discuss the budget. Nebraska open meetings law doesn’t allow that. A local radio station sued over this. 

Board doesn’t fire Cox, so her contract is renewed. 

In January, county fairs elected new reps for StateFair board. 

Volunteers and donors have been attending board meetings, raising questions about how they’ve been treated. 

Then comes word there may be some questionable expenses and a hard drive from the finance office was found to have been wiped. 

Cox is not implicated. I want to make that clear. 

It’s also becoming clear after the 2019 fair that the board is split about 50/50 on Cox. After the new board members take office, the balance tips against her. 

The open meetings lawsuit takes a weird turn, as the fair’s attorney claims they are not a quasi government agency (as they precisely claimed) but a private nonprofit corporation. That’s a weird look for an organization receiving city tax dollars and state lottery dollars.

Jensen, the former mayor, is on the board at this point. He’s a finance guy by trade and backs Cox, saying she’ll right the ship. 

Cox then takes medical leave, apparently due to stress on the job. Her daughter was then killed in a car crash in Montana. 

After all of this, the two sides agree to part ways. 

Cox keeps her salary through the end of her contract and will be named “senior consultant”.

She also gets a letter of commendation, thanking her for meritorious service. 

Board gets to move on with new leadership.

And it's absolutely not a dumb question. But without thorough testing, there is no way to know whether this is a ""somewhat accurate representation"" or not. 

Another problem is that Nebraska is not tracking ""presumed positives""; people, like myself and my wife, who have these symptoms and are self quarantined.

Let's say that the out of the 3 confirmed cases in Lincoln, 2 required hospitalization; it's rough numbers, but for those 2, there are 8 people who are infectious and either asymptomatic or showing a mild form of disease. 

Another absolutely critical part of this, especially when it comes to lack of medical care; people don't go to the doctor or hospital unless they are dying because they can't afford to. Even possible moderate cases are untrackable, beyond our lack of testing, due to the confusion on how to get tests, who qualifies, and lack of money needed to access those tests.

I actually spoke to Representative Fortenberry's office regarding Parental Alienation; my mother did it to my father during the 80's until her passing, and it had devastating effects, but it was so hard to prove. If it weren't for the fact my mom used me as her mouthpiece in some phone calls to my dad (my dad was speaking to me thinking I was my mom and she was basically giving me a script to read arguing their marital and custody issues) that I realized years later how sick and twisted it was (on top of other things I could write a book about), I probably would not have ever understood how non-blatant this problem is.

It can be very insidious and hard to prove, let alone easy for any parent to not fall into the trap, even unintentionally. I know in my own divorce and custody issues there were false allegations while credible allegations did not have enough proof to bring to light as valid concerns. False allegations to authorities is a step in the right direction to combat this, though not a final solution.

For anyone that struggles with Parental Alienation, please keep as much proof as possible (I have taken to taking pictures of my kids' text messages that show my ex telling our kids how I'm, basically, being mean to him or not wanting him in their lives, and other sly put downs about me that are not true, and he is smart enough to not make false allegations to authorities...it will be behind the scenes to my kids or mutual friends/relatives that can be said in passing or overheard), and do not be afraid of having your kids be involved in counseling/therapy, where a medical professional can provide evidence as well (especially if your child is telling the therapist things without you being present).

I wish I could have made my dad's life easier back then instead of being with my mom as she broke into his house when he wasn't there to find evidence she wanted/needed to show us kids how awful he was. My mom was probably one of the most ruthless people I've ever known when it came to men and her divorce from my dad - he certainly was/is not a saint, but he got to a point of giving up (which my siblings are resentful of, understandably), and my siblings and I suffered the most from a system that needs major overhauls.",1585492441,flu0ln3

The doubling rate seems fairly predictive. Last week, the doubling rate was dead-on for Monday at 120 cases. Hopefully, things will level off/slow down, but if other places are an indication, the number of confirmed and active cases will grow fairly rapidly.

These are just numbers, and I'm no statistician. Hope everybody stays safe and healthy, as much as possible, anyway.

3538,3538,Raw_Venus,"3d printing masks are a very bad idea for many reasons.  

* One of them is that the plastic used for 3d prints are by their nature very pours. The humidity from your breath along with the heat will make it an ideal spot to grow bacteria. They are also near impossible to clean because of that. No, soaking them in 99% IPA won't do anything. In fact, it may be worse in the long run. There could be chemical changes that make it harmful to the user or it could leach out of the plastic during use and cause harm to the user that way.

* You can't make a good seal from the mask to the face. The plastic used in 3d printing is very rigid and won't conform to anyone's face.  The same story with the seal for the filter. If those masks are not making a good seal then they are useless.

* I could use the exact same gcode file and get two different results. Ask me how I know that. It is simply not reproducible on a large scale for medical equipment.

One thing that is needed and can be 3d printed is face shields. The NIH has an approved one that anyone can download and print. As of right now the link to NIH face shield is down. You just need a 3d printer, any plastic sheet such as overhead projector pages, and a 7-inch rubber band.

But it would be in keeping with the tendency of the broader political right, Republican governors, and the White House to maintain that such measures are overkill or unnecessary, even though the evidence seems to indicate otherwise.

That's one of the main worries, as I see it, about Trump's response, which has been, in effect, to prioritize some weird political loyalty over a focused, even-handed, and purposeful coordination with state and local government. One's left wondering if governors and other officials like Ricketts, whose political fortunes are more or less bound up with Trump's, will be more likely to make decisions based on pleasing Trump than taking swift, effective action. And self-avowed ""conservatives"" have been fairly explicit in aligning themselves with a skeptical attitude about the severity of the threat (with exceptions, of course). 

So you have particular political pressures and ideological tendencies coming to bear on judgements about public health. It's likely that a lot of that is more critical at the local level, especially when we're talking about rural counties and municipalities.

All I know is that, for the sake of my rural friends and family (and healthworkers and everybody else), I kind of wish they'd make the directed measures effective statewide.",1585835231,fm7rkfd

3603,3603,purplepartybarge,"Suggestions are fine, but we clearly don't follow that line when protecting the rights of others. We don't ""suggest"" that people not commit assault or robbery or fraud because we've decided restricting those behaviors with the force of law is necessary to protect the rights of the victims of those behaviors.

The ""conservative mindset"" you're alluding to is really a vulgar, thin libertarianism that concerns itself only with ""rights"" and never with duties. You can't have one without the other.

If people want live peaceably and well together, you have to accept the duties that come with claims to rights. In this case, that means accepting that your right to ignore clear and present dangers (to others) doesn't take precedence over the broader community's rights (to life and general welfare).

Government isn't the only actor that can commit ""overreach"". That's the basis for laws and their enforcement (in this society). Individuals taking chances with other folks' health are committing their own ""overreach"", one far more egregious than reasonable directed health measures.",1585837517,fm7vayz
3604,3604,JoeTemple,"I think it's a stretch to conflate laws against assault with laws to quarantine myself. The former does not impose a great burden on me, while the latter does. I see your point in how both laws ""protect others"", but they are vastly different laws.

With that said, I agree that people should be mindful of distancing practices even in the absence of a DHM. I'm sure the 37 counties that are not under DHM are quite aware of the issue at hand, and I'm not sure that issuing a DHM is necessary. 


Why do you think a DHM is necessary, as opposed to using social pressure to enforce the guidelines?",1585838223,fm7whk5
3605,3605,purplepartybarge,"I don't think it's a stretch at all. In both cases you're weighing rights against rights, and in cases where someone perceives that, say, their honor's been violated, foregoing violence may feel like injury.

Social pressure isn't enough, clearly, based on precedent. If we're going to tell people they can't protect themselves by using force themselves to protect their health from people ignoring directives (or even ""suggestions""), then some other entity has to take the role of protecting those rights. In our society, that's the state (meaning government).

Again, and I hope you're not being intentionally obtuse, the reason social pressure doesn't work in the case of health measures is the same reason it doesn't work with fraud. Bad actors will violate the rights of others while the innocent party has no recourse -- and in the case of ignoring health measures that right may be that to one's *life*.

I think you're missing my point because I have not said people have rights to hold parties.

My entire argument is this: Let the people manage themselves through this ordeal. If Jim the barber in Arthur County wants to keep his shop open so his 15 regulars can get cuts, let him. If someone is throwing a large party, then absolutely we should be talking to the host and asking them to break it up. If the host doesn't comply, the police have the authority to break it up for them (at least that was my experience in a past life). I don't see how adding a DHM will dramatically improve the health of certain rural residents, though I can see how it would put Jim on the street.

Now, to address your argument:

I am unsure of what ""precedent"" you are using to say that folks won't listen when someone asks them to stay home. Maybe if I knew what you were talking about, I might see it the way you do.

Finally, I want to emphasize that I am not arguing *against* DHM; I'm arguing that a lack of DHM does not constitute a failed response. There are other ways to protect the lives of the vulnerable without the State handing down edicts from above.",1585839968,fm7zmm9
3609,3609,purplepartybarge,"DHM puts institutions and firms on the hook *legally* for complying with best practices -- think of it as a special case of regular health regulation. There's clearly a difference in the absence of a mandate, as witnessed at beaches in Florida and elsewhere, churches bringing hundreds of people together in tight quarters, other businesses refusing to follow guidance. Those acts constitute the same kind of harm as violating any health code that we normally back with force of law.

If what you're saying is true, then there's no need for any health or other regulation. Maybe that's your position, but then we're having a very different discussion.

There's also the clear evidence that mandates carry much more gravity and thus tend to communicate the seriousness of circumstances much more effectively than purely advisory announcements.

3679,3679,swattages,"Good question. Let's do a little math.  

Daily new confirmed case growth for the past 7 days:  
3/27 - 21.92%  
3/28 - 28.09%  
3/29 - 18.42%  
3/30 - 12.59%  
3/31 - 17.76%  
4/01 - 21.23%  
4/02 - 17.51% (so far)  

4 weeks = 28 days  

Sustained growth at the min growth rate from the last 7 days (12.59%): 255\*1.1259^28 = 7,056 cases  

Sustained growth at the average growth rate from the last 7 days (approx. 19.65%): 255\*1.1965^28 = 38,734  

Sustained growth at the US growth rate over the same period (approx. 16.27%): 255\*1.1627^28 = 17,363  

**Answer:** NOT for confirmed cases. But given how little testing we're doing... well, let's work that out at the US average growth rate (kind of in the middle of Nebraska's 7-day average and minimum). Let's say we are catching 90% of the cases with tests. I feel that would be pretty optimistic, but let's go with it. So instead of 255 cases today, we're talking about 283. 283\*1.1627^28 = **19,270**. Bump that down to, say, 85% of cases, that becomes: 300\*1.1627^28 = **20,427**.  

BEFORE we leap to conclusions here, we have been experiencing some ridiculous growth, and it's kind of hard to see that being sustained for very much longer. If we look at worldwide death rates, for example, we hit our highest growth rate at 14% and that hasn't been lasting. Seems like it's definitely staying above 10% but as we can see from the above example, a single point makes a massive difference when we're talking about exponential growth.  

The other thing to remember is that smarter people than you and I are predicting a peak around the end of the month. That means those growth rates will drop off significantly, and while the numbers are still going to be pretty fucking scary by the end of the month, **especially if Ricketts doesn't change anything and all these assholes keep ignoring the threat**, 25k cases is probably a little bit of a stretch but definitely not outside the realm of possibility. Considering that 20% of cases are being hospitalized and so far we're only testing travelers with symptoms, hospitalized cases (mostly) and links to confirmed cases, we might be catching much less than 85% of actual cases walking around there, and that also impacts the math by a LOT.  

**No matter what, even a growth rate of 10% (well below our average OR median while completely ignoring the most off-the-wall days with our confirmed cases since March 1) is too damn much because that means our hospitals are already fucked.**",1585894678,fmahvuo

He originally moved to Chadron to commit suicide. He paints everything in Chadron in a very negative light, like calling a local barber racist just for being a small-town barber (barber never even spoke more than a few sentences to him). Try to have a conversation with the guy? Good luck, he thinks he is an intellectual and if you live in Chadron you must be an idiot so he will speak down to you. His wife is 25 years younger than him and from Mexico but isn't allowed to have any friends (a very nice woman!) Their child has autism and is a super nice kid, but was extremely sheltered, my younger brother went to school around the same time as him. Since his documentary's release, I pretty much only see him walking his dog by his house and the railroad in the cheap part of town these days.

I feel pretty good about our officials here in Nebraska, in a relative sense.

But I don't know if I really buy this argument that Nebraska's relatively sparse geography justifies foregoing a stay-at-home order. It may be that such a thing is unenforceable or has deleterious side effects that outweigh the value, and I'd listen to those arguments if presented. However, I don't see the point in wasting the advantages we have here, in part owing to geography and in part owing to the quick action our officials and institutions have and are taking.

Rural spaces aren't impervious. If I were out in the country, I'd want a stay-at-home order unless there were really good reasons against it that weren't just that it's taking longer to get to the hinterlands so we should let business go on more normally until then.",1585956874,fmd0vdr

Honestly I’m willing to debate the reasons for why government was so unprepared for this pandemic. Also it’s worth pointing out that both the Bush and the Obama administration failed to address the warnings about our supply of ventilators. So drop the MAGA act at the door if you feel like taking an honest look at the situation. This inept response was years in the making even before Trump took office.

“Is this how MAGA stuff works?” Wtf kind of question is that? What’s “MAGA stuff”? No, this is how government works. They suck at almost everything. They suck at education, healthcare, poverty, crime, drug abuse, infrastructure and pandemics as it turns out. But I actually give both sides of the aisle a bit of a pass on this one because we simply didn’t know how bad it was going to be. So when you had a bunch of media headlines in late Jan/early Feb telling America to get a grip because the flu is more dangerous it’s understandable. Or when everyone on the left called Trump racist for restricting travel to China. China’s government is a piece of shit and they kept this under wraps for as long as they could. As a result they hurt every other country’s ability to prepare. Also the WHO was dumb as shit for trusting China when they said the virus doesn’t transmit human-to-human in mid January.

3817,3817,Monkey1Fball,"Pretty much correct.

Kansas Territory breaking into 2 (Kansas Territory + Colorado Territory) was truly favored by both the KS and CO folk.

Basically nobody paid any attention to Western Kansas Territory (a good chunk of modern-day Colorado) from 1855 to 1858.  There were more Indians than settlers out there, and the primary issue of the day as regards Kansas Territory was whether Kansas would be a slave or free state if and when it got admitted to the Union.

But then the Colorado Gold Rush kicked off in July 1858, and within a year Western Kansas Territory all of a sudden had 100,000 settlers.

People in Eastern Kansas Territory didn't like that --- all of a sudden there was a potential shift of balance and power to the West.

People in Western Kansas Territory didn't like the new situation either --- they felt the territorial legislature didn't care about their needs, with the capital being 600 miles away near the Missouri River.

So the Western folk met in October 1859 and decided to create their OWN territory (Jefferson Territory).  They basically seceded from Kansas Territory.

The problem with that is Congress, because of the greater issues of free and slave states and territories and their equality in America, didn't recognize the new Jefferson Territory.  Eastern Kansas Territory was fine with Jefferson Territory as a separate entity but the actual US Government was not. 

That stalemate of sorts continued throughout the tumultuous year of 1860.  Kansas wasn't going to get into the Union as a state, and Jefferson Territory was going to get recognized as its own entity, until the stalemate was broken.

But then Lincoln won and the Southern States seceded from the Union.  

In pretty quick order, Kansas was admitted to the Union, and the Colorado Territory was created.  Although the US Government never did formally recognize Jefferson Territory, they sort of did (it was basically Western Kansas Territory, although they did also add chunks of Nebraska Territory, New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory in creating the new Colorado Territory).

So I could be a coward, and this is also complicated. And, this is a hard decision to pull the trigger on. I'm not an expert in this disease or public health lines and neither are any of my colleagues, and we are hearing two different things from two different public health departments. One is strongly encouraging us not to hold the service, the next is saying you're fine with your windows rolled up. What they both agree on is that the directed health measure as it stands is unclear. So when even the folks you get advice and guidance from are not clear, what is a non-health professional supposed to do? That's part of why this is a difficult decision. That's not cowardice, that's prudence, and thoughtfulness in knowing what I am and what I am not a subject matter expert in.

The 5-day moving average -- there also appears to be a pattern of roughly 5 days right now too. A 5 day ""cycle"" between peaks and dips. If it holds (probably not since GI started blowing up), we'll start to drop off again either today or tomorrow once all the data is in (our DHHS likes to tweak case numbers between days for whatever reason). Either it's purely coincidental (5 day average before symptoms appear after catching it) or it's because the vast majority of cases are in Douglas County and we're actually seeing a pattern of spread.  

So you're a data scientist? What kinds of data do you typically work with?",1586289424,fmpy3hq

One thing i've learned as a data scientist is that you can never be too certain about the reliability of the data source!   


It will be interesting to see how the 5-day moving average evolves over the next couple days. I'm sure it will continue to rise, just at a slower pace than 3/27 through 4/2.

Same, and it bugs me that my tinfoil hat is in regards to this. My instincts tell me they're probably just correcting reports once they get a chance to look them over. The only thing about that is it messes up all the other data miners out there so you can get conflicting reports. I want to trust the DHHS's numbers, but after listening to Dr. Anthone (the Director) attempt a PR spin along with our Governor on the first NET Town Hall, I became suspicious. He didn't seem all that qualified to be in that position, either...  

Dr. Ali Khan was a huge breath of fresh air when he showed up instead of the Director for the second Town Hall. Loved that guy. He clearly knew what he was talking about and it was obvious he was only interested in information and providing answers. If NET does another COVID-19 Town Hall, I sincerely hope he's there again instead of Dr. Anthone.

Not sure what exactly is going on here, but I'd love to hear an explanation from our DHHS!  

Edit: Important to note that at noon, we did not have anything over 50 before yesterday. Yesterday was the first day. Since they changed the data, it looks like we hit over 50 on 4/02, 4 days prior, which makes it look like our growth is smaller yesterday (and again today?). Since they also increased yesterday's numbers and the day before that, I'm questioning if today's totals aren't actually higher.  

The most alarming part?? **The changes at the 6pm update increase the totals yesterday from 418 to 433!** And the increase to yesterday's numbers only account for 4 of the 15 extra cases!  

I clearly don't know the whole story here but this seems suspicious and it's concerning.",1586303853,fmqor2l

That question shows a serious lack of understanding of what happened in the Crimea situation.  The United States had no duty to intervene when Russia annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine, given Ukraine is not part of NATO and doesn’t benefit from its Article 5 (otherwise known as “collective defense”) protections.   I wouldn't disagree that Obama and other Western leaders could have applied pressure in other ways, short of military force, but describing annexing Crimea as “giving it away” rather than emphasizing it as an illegal incursion is quite the ridiculous suggestion, worthy only of derision.

Meanwhile, Obama did work to remove Russia from the G-8 as a response - something that Trump wants to undo...in other words, Trump wants to take away the only punishment enacted against Russia for that annexation of the Crimea region.

If you experience any of these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate (separate from other people) and call a health care provider to report your symptoms and that you might have been exposed to COVID-19.

There was a national inquiry which produced a massive report on the problem that was released last year, you can look at it and related documents [here](https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/final-report/). (The report is over a thousand pages long, split into two volumes, so there's a lot to wade through.) There's a salient point in the Introduction, where they attribute the problem to ""state actions and inactions rooted in colonialism and colonial ideologies, built on the presumption of superiority, and utilized to maintain power and control over the land and the people by oppression and, in many cases, by eliminating them."" (From the first volume of the Final Report, p. 54.)

Specific issues cited include the lack of resources in indigenous communities, attitudes on the part of police services toward indigenous people and in particular toward cases of missing and murdered women, girls, and gender and sexual minorities, and lack of communication and cooperation between police and other services. (I'm glossing over a section from the second volume of the Final Report, found on p. 234.)

The report was published on June 3, 2019, so if you want to do some more research you can find articles about it from various news outlets around that date. You can also certainly find more information at the National Inquiry's site [here](https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/).",1586576449,fn22y7x

Each county within a public health district will have a county public health board. These documents will be found at the county level. They serve to direct county officials on matters of health (laws, declaring emergencies, etc.)

Each municipality then will have a public health board. It’s founding documents will be at its level of government. This board advises the city officials in crafting ordinances.

This division of government is how Omaha had restaurants and bars closed for about 2 weeks before my municipality did.

Founding documents and cities of different sizes will be set up differently - villages, cities of various classes, and metros all have different ways they are allowed to govern.

In particular, John Locke (major influence on the Founding Fathers) argued for limited government (appealing to you, I would assume), whose powers would only extend exactly so far, and no further, as to protect the inalienable rights of all citizens.

Life would be one of those inalienable rights, and right now citizen's lives are being threatened.

Debate on exactly how far that should extend, what is best to do, etc. etc. but ""our rights [being] trampled"" isn't an argument that has a basis in the Founding Fathers ideology or in the current situation.",1586787134,fn9y013

As for ""one-size-fits-all,"" if Lancaster (Lincoln) county locks down for two weeks, and reports 0 new cases, and then as soon as they open again, someone with COVID 19 in Dodge (Fremont) visits and sets off a fresh epidemic, it's going to keep dragging this out.

The virus infects the same whether you're urban or rural, and evidence, like I shared above, suggests that rural counties aren't being protected by being more isolated -- if Alaska isn't protected by the isolation, why would a county in Nebraska in the dead center of the U.S.?",1586788997,fna15gm
486,486,Apmaddock,"You’re assuming a lot in thinking that sheltering in place for a couple of weeks will keep Nebraska safe from infection in the weeks following.

Smart",1586790203,fna3ate
488,488,davvolun,"First, I think you should take a closer look at the link I shared. Lincoln and Omaha are not actually the hardest hit -- they could be, if the virus gets out of control, they could be much worse very quickly. But as of Friday, Douglas county was 12th per capita and Lancaster was, I think, 34th? Point being, a shelter-in-place would be much more important for those ""400 miles of countryside"" than for the major cities right now.

A) I'm not actually advocating for shelter-in-place, I'm advocating for doing what the epidemiologists and other area-relevant experts say to do. If that is shelter-in-place, so be it.

For example, I was critical of Ricketts refusing to issue a stay-at-home order despite 4/5 of the states doing it, but when Fauci said what we were doing was sufficient and effectively identical, I revised what I thought of Ricketts' efforts. It helps when someone has shown they aren't trying to gain politically by the actions they're taking.

B) Not really assuming that much... Literally, if every single person across the world stayed inside for 2 weeks, maybe 3 to be safe, this would be over, at least for now, and we could all get back to work. Of course, I know that's too much to hope for... But that's based on very simple knowledge of infections, the immune system (and our current lack of protection against this disease), and best estimates for the life of the disease. Alternatively, if every single person got infected, this would also be over in two weeks, although a lot of people would be dead, and our hospitals would be devastated.

C) Aren't you the one arguing against a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach?

&gt; how that will somehow be a lot different than sheltering the more densely populated communities is beyond me.

I don't believe I'm arguing shelter-in-place would be different between rural and urban; if shelter-in-place is the correct approach for Nebraska's urban population, it's probably the correct approach for its rural population too.

If you look at a map of active infections, I don't see a case to be made for, say, using different approaches for western vs. eastern Nebraska, or North Platte vs. Norfolk. It's pretty much everywhere, and, again, rural Nebraska is simply less capable of providing the medical care necessary if this thing is out of control.

530,530,yetanotherbrick,"Yes we should draw on the collective expertise, because that's not what the senators did in their op-ed.  

&gt;Sens. Steve Halloran of Hastings and Steve Erdman of Bayard wrote an opinion piece for the Hastings Tribune and several other newspapers across the state, arguing against measures that shut down the economy. They say isolating the most at-risk individuals, banning large gatherings and targeting hotspots earlier could have been more effective.

&gt;“What we're talking about is having a significant percentage of the population deal with coming down with a virus such as coronavirus, and letting their antibodies build and be able to survive through it, which if you look at the statistics for Coronavirus nationwide, the survival rate is very high. We're focusing way too much on the number of people who have gotten it but not enough on those that recovered from it,” Halloran said.

This is contrary to medical opinion about not overwhelming the hospital system.

&gt; And so if we just open up the bars and the restaurants and let everybody go and mingle, what we're going to see is a surge in cases that will go to the hospital, the lack of ventilators, even for those that are younger, middle aged or healthy,” Morfeld said.

&gt;Gov. Pete Ricketts said herd immunity will build up, but it’s a matter of timing. “Yeah, people will be exposed to this over time. What we’re trying to do is make sure we slow that down, so that we don’t overwhelm the health care system, Ricketts said.

The when and how to reopen are good questions to be examining, but their argument cites a single expert, Dr. (DSc BioStats) Knutt Wittkowski, whose views his previous host university distanced themselves from today:

Odds are, we're probably all going to get the virus  (or the vaccine, but who knows how long that will take), and with proper treatment, it's not as fatal as we've seen it be.  If we hurry to re open the economy, we'll cause a surge in cases which has the potential to overwhelm our health care system. This means that if anyone gets sick, they will NOT receive appropriate care and are far more likely to die.

Hurrying to open the economy by ending the most effective measures we have against the spread of the disease has a very high likelihood of killing a lot more people.

625,625,JoeTemple,"I appreciate your thoughtful response, really. Let me try to explain where I'm coming from.

My argument is about the marginal benefits and marginal costs of what we are doing. Let's start with a baseline of ""normal life"". Obviously, packing bars and packing PBA would be a great way to create a massive problem. And although kids are unaffected in most cases, they are great carriers for the virus, so let's shut down schools as well. Let's also shut encourage people to work from home, if it's possible.

So let's say that with all these measures, we can reduce transmission and mortality by 80%. Life is a little inconvenient, but we can manage. Now the question is, what does it take to get that 80% to 95%, or even 99%? Let's say closing tattoo shops, salons, etc reduces mortality by 1%. Is it worth it? I'm arguing that it is not, but I have no idea.

I do know this: we wouldn't shut everything down to save one life. And we wouldn't keep everything open at the expense of 10,000 lives. Where is the line? I don't know. No one knows. But can we **please** stop pretending that ""we will stop at nothing to prevent the virus""? It's unrealistic and it's not helping.

With all that said, I'm not saying I have the answers. I am just a dude who's been sitting at home way too damn long. I have an extremely narrow window though which I am watching these things, and all I know for sure is the things in my own life and the things I see on the news. I am open for a conversation, and it bums me out when people accuse me of being ""evil"" or that I want people to die; this is not true. I am just sharing my perspective of how I see things.

Once again, I appreciate you, /u/ibrewbeer, taking the time to pen a thoughtful response to my comments in this thread. I think you understand that questioning the status quo is a good thing, and the fact that you are asking me to defend my points rather than asking me to defend a strawman you've created really speaks to your intelligence and your discretion. And it certainly puts you on the upper echelon of commenters in this thread.

I will end with this. I understand that we have it pretty good in Nebraska. Many places, such as Michigan and California, are being hit with (in my opinion) draconian restrictions on movement. In that way, I am sort of attacking a strawman with my arguments. Regardless, I think it's a good exercise to push back on those who would restrict your liberty in the name of ""the greater good"". There are times when this is necessary (I'd say right now is one of those times), but we have to make sure that they don't push to hard. And we make damn sure that when the crisis is over, that our liberty is returned to us in full.",1586875825,fndqzjq
626,626,GeorgeTheNerd,"test, contact tracing, continued social distancing and shelter in place (widespread now, and localized as needed until there is a vaccine).

South Korea is doing this. New Zealand and Australia are on course to get that done. Austria, Iceland, and Switzerland are also on course.

But we need both a month or more of the current practice and massive increase in testing.  5 fold increase in testing at least. And that part is going to take a lot of coordination and work on the government to get the supply chains in order to scale up.

We may also get the scientific breakthrough needed in that time.  There are many possibilities from the clinical trials currently in progress to better pathology to better understanding of spread mechanisms to finding some sort of connection to nutrient deficiency.  Each on their own is a small probability, but with many, the chance we find one that pushes down the IFR is descent. 

It's expensive, it's hard, but the herd immunity option is a whole lot of death. 

We have worked to prevent death from lack of hospitalization to some degree.  The question now is how much are we going to pay to lower deaths further and it seems a lot of politicians don't seem to want to pay for anything more than the deaths caused by lack of hospitalization.",1586876151,fndrkzw

But 100 miles in today's world isn't that far, and the per capita link should be compelling evidence that rural towns are having **bigger** social distancing problems than the Bob Kerrey bridge. And the reason I would ""demand action in a part of the state I [presumably] haven't been within 100 miles of"" is because someone *else's* lack of preparation risks my life.

The point is that this disease is, verifiably, so infectious that if Alice in Ord gets it and travels to Grand Island and has lunch with her friend Bob, the truck driver, then Bob makes a delivery to his client Carl in Omaha, it's likely that Alice, Bob and Carl have now spread the disease from Ord to Omaha in less than a day, and Alice's actions directly impacted my safety, even though she's never even been ""within 100 miles"" of Omaha.

634,634,ibrewbeer,"I'm going to do everything I can to not attack you, but I have a problem with some of your logic. You also said some things I wholeheartedly agree with.

Disagree:

&gt; although kids are unaffected in most cases 

The [CDC disagrees](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e4.htm) with this. It's a large leap in logic to read this page and say the phrase ""unaffected in most cases. 

Agree: 

&gt;they are great carriers for the virus 

You are accurate in that they can be carriers too, and based on anecdotal evidence of my experiences, kids are most likely to be seen in non-family social groups playing in their back yards with friends, playing basketball at the park, and generally not being aware of proper hygiene to prevent the spread of the disease.

Disagree:

&gt;Let's say closing tattoo shops, salons, etc reduces mortality by 1%. Is it worth it? I'm arguing that it is not, but I have no idea. 

You're admitting to arguing a position with no factual basis. Even if your numbers are accurate (we both admit they probably aren't), you're throwing your hands up and essentially saying ""no idea, this is what my gut says."" This is not how to convince others to share your opinion, or in most cases even listen to you. 

Agree:

&gt;And we make damn sure that when the crisis is over, that our liberty is returned to us in full. 

This is absolutely something we need to keep an eye on, no question about it. With this administration in charge, ""running the country like a business"" means profit above all else, including lives. They're using this as an opportunity for a power grab and we need to work at every level to make sure this doesn't continue unabated. 

Listen, sharing your perspective is a valuable thing, and people reading it is a valuable thing. The bottom line is that neither of us are (presumably) infectious disease specialists or economists. Most of the people in those lines of work and other related specialties are telling us that we need to continue doing what we're doing, and do a better job of social isolation in order to keep this disease from spreading too fast, overwhelming our health care system, and causing unnecessary deaths because people can't get the care they need to beat this thing. I'm going to listen to these experts. We can't prevent all deaths from this, but we can prevent unnecessary deaths as much as possible. I would argue that it's a moral imperative to do so.

I know your gut says ""but what about the local businesses?"" and that's where my ideology and yours split. I don't think keeping open non-essential businesses is worth lives lost. People who own businesses do not have a right to customers or a good economy. We as a country don't have a right to endanger others for financial gain, financial stability, or even financial survival. It sucks, but businesses close all the time. People go bankrupt all the time, but they survive and they're able to jump back into the economy in a different role and start contributing again. If they're dead, they can't do that.

It sounds to me, and please forgive me if i'm wrong, that you don't know anyone personally who has been affected by this, and since Nebraska has so far escaped the worst of it (so far being the operative words here), this isn't a surprise. My father-in-law is currently being passed between hospitals and nursing homes in the Chicago area for health issues unrelated to COVID, but every appointment he has, every facility he visits is an opportunity for him to contract the disease, and in his current state, it \*will\* kill him. 

I encourage you to look around for the videos posted from front line health care workers in NY, WI, IL, CA, and other hard hit states (or ramping up states) to get some perspective on how this is affecting other people. I'm happy to get some links for you if you would like. This will hit Nebraska harder soon.

In the northwest corner of the state over 20 counties had zero confirmed cases. One county stands out in the middle, Cherry County, which has a rating of 17.6 cases per 100,000 residents. Cherry county has 5,713 people in it. That means it has 1 case. Cherry county is about 6,009 square miles. 

Douglas county has 38.9 cases per capita or 247 cases. Where do you think its more important to practice social distancing? Is the risk roughly twice as much in Douglas county than Cherry County?

Although per capita tells us an interesting story - I don't think it accurately describes your risk of exposure. Even Kimball county with 10 cases (4 of those 10 are members of one household) and a per capita rating of 275.3. Playground equipment in Kimball has been taped off, but the public parks are not closed - however they are in Omaha. Are people in Kimball being less prudent? Perhaps there are different levels of risk inherent to the usage levels of the facilities.

I've been running my small town's streets and trail system twice a week since the outbreak and I've very seldom come within half a block of another person. Comparing this to the author's description of the midtown trail system, I feel very safe.

Are rural towns having a BIGGER problem with social distancing or does per capita measurements in extremely rural areas of the state not tell the entire picture of risk?

694,694,davvolun,"I'm glad you've examined the evidence, but as the per capita numbers clearly show, your ""risk of infection"" or ""where do you think it's more important to practice social distancing"" is simply not valid.

Rural areas are getting infected at a higher per capita rate. Period. Cherry picking Kimball County doesn't excuse that there are still at least 10 other countries work a higher per capita rate than Douglas.

I'll agree that if Omaha didn't follow advice, the situation there could more quickly spiral out of control, and the resultant infected or even fatality count would be much worse. But, again, what the evidence is showing, is that Omaha is doing a better job than 11 much smaller population counties. And Lincoln, as of the writing of the article I linked, was doing better than 32 smaller counties (33 - Douglas).

You've also ignored, or chosen to ignore, one of the other major factors -- medical care access. If Douglas has a small, contained outbreak, there are more than enough high quality facilities -- more than enough ventilators.

Now, I don't know how many ventilators Kimball Health Services has on have -- maybe they're the one hospital in the world that has 20 ventilators for every person within an hour driving distance. Can't really say, don't know.

But on the off-chance they only have a handful of ventilators to service their typical needs, the next closest hospital is 30 minutes away, assuming you knew before you left that KHS was tapped out and the next option wasn't, of course.... If you only find out when you get to KHS, and go straight to Sidney, or start calling around to find out who has vents, wasting precious time, I don't know. Not the situation I would want to be in.

Point being, while there may be a greater chance of running into someone at a higher population density, rural areas aren't, verifiably, doing a great job of prevention infections, whereas even a mild, contained outbreak could quickly, **quickly** overwhelm supply.

I hope a shelter-in-place order remains unnecessary for the state too, in Kimball or Omaha, rural or ""urban"" (let's be honest, even Omaha ain't *that* urban), but, again, again, again, the evidence shows rural isolation isn't protecting anybody.

I’ve never downplayed the risk to rural areas. I’m simply stating the importance of local governance in making the decisions of what to shut down and when (above and beyond what the governor has already called for as stated in the original article) because what makes sense in Omaha, might not in Red Cloud (once again the counter-argument of the main article we are all posting about). 

I also stand that by that cases per capita doesn’t equate directly to risk exposure or necessary government action. That is just simplifying things way too much.  For some it might be a good measurement - I don’t live anywhere near those areas so I can’t comment. Kimball county has had 47 tests and 47 negatives since their first initial outbreak. 4 of the 10 cases was one family. They still have their parks open - because it makes sense for Kimball but not for Omaha.

You accuse me of cherry picking data when my main argument is we need to cherry pick the data and allow appropriate local action to go above and beyond what the state has already laid out - the counter argument to the main article. 

I admit, I mistakenly thought you were advocating for statewide action because of your 100 mile argument with the various city residents when you said someone else’s action (100 miles away) risks your life.

709,709,GeorgeTheNerd,"The whole supply chain is separated into grocery and restaurant. Restaurant supply can't sell to grocery stores because their packaging doesn't have things like nutrition labels and lack the UPC needed to make the cash register work. Restaurants buy in different packaging, different sizes/weights, and with limited branding before point of sale. And different factories have specialized into different camps. And their suppliers specialized and the supplier's suppliers specialized.  Even TP is specialized for one or the other. The trees used to make TP that were planted 10 years ago and being harvested this month were planted with either restaurants or home use in mind. 

I doubt all the empty shelves has much to do with hoarding. It's all been about a massive shift in usage that the supply chain isn't built to handle. There is now way to little in the 'grocery' category and way too much in the 'restaurant' category.

722,722,JoeTemple,Is there a better model available?,1586951121,fnh072b
723,723,talks_to_ducks,"I think at least among my close friends (also statisticians) we haven't found one we trust yet for the course the US is going to see... mostly because we don't think the data is of high enough quality to do anything with. For instance, up until yesterday or so, NY wasn't counting anyone who died in their homes as having died of COVID... and when they finally did count those people they found that suddenly their deaths increased by 75% or so (from around 6000ish to 10000 ish - I don't remember the exact numbers, but that's ballpark). Throughout most of this crisis, we've been told testing doesn't matter (which it so very much does) and that deaths are hard to miss... but when you don't know what the numerator is (deaths or people who needed medical care, either way) and you know the denominator is wildly wrong, I'm not sure you can successfully model anything *well*. You can certainly get models, and they might help inform the next week's public policy, but you should probably not treat the predictions anything other than *slightly* more reliable than a Ouija board. 

As a result, in countries like Germany that have enough testing capacity, I am way more trustful of the models than I am in the US, and especially at the state level (because testing capacity differs from state to state). 

They're constantly updating even the IHME model to account for some of these issues, but we usually say ""garbage in, garbage out"", and that's no less true here. Most epidemiologists know not to trust the actual numbers until 6 months or more into a pandemic -- because in the first part of the pandemic, you're scrambling anyways. Unfortunately we're now in a pandemic large enough that the general public is using models that epidemiologists know how to handle/interpret/where to trust, and the general public doesn't. Hell, I'm a statistician, and because it's pretty far outside my specialty (data vis), I don't know exactly where the model is likely to fail either - I just have a much better gut check on when it is likely to be trustworthy, and enough technical vocabulary to be able to read the papers and go ""ok, so my gut was right, this thing is crap"".

The US was not as prepared as Germany and South Korea, though maybe a little better than Spain and Italy. It would be fair to assume that our death rate will not be as low as Germany or South Korea, and likely falls somewhere between Germany and Italy. 

But let's just assume your number is accurate, that is still a very high death rate. If you open businesses to get ""herd immunity"" millions will die. To get herd immunity you need most of the population to catch the virus and become immune. Even if only 100,000,000 Americans were to catch it that's 600,000 dead.

And in this case in particular, the “15 Mexicans in an apartment” is discriminatory, racist, and ignorant. It is singling out a specific ethnic group, and it simply is not true of the majority of that group. It’s a way for certain people to put down an entire category of fellow humans in order to feel superior.

The fears of pressure treated wood and leaching are largely overblown, but everyone determines his or her own risk tolerance for themselves.

The risks of adverse levels of exposure from food grown near pressure treated wood are miniscule, even in CCA wood which has not been available for sale for residential use in the US since 2004. Since the solution to pollution is dilution, the risks of growing food mulched with compost made in a pressure treated enclosure are even smaller.

850,850,teebob21,"Yup - there's arsenic in there. The first link I gave cites a study of As migration in garden soils. The TL;DR is ""not enough to be of imminent concern in most cases.""

It's also ubiquitous in soil. Natural ranges are from 2 mg/kg to ~40 mg/kg. The global average is about 3.4 ppm. [Ohio, in particular, has naturally elevated levels of about three times the global average.](https://www.soils.org/news/science-news/ohios-high-soil-arsenic-levels)

Fortunately for vegetable-eating lifeforms, vegetable plants do not readily take up harmful amounts of As. In those that do, As is not heavily translocated to the fruits. Some, such as comfrey and burdock, are natural bioaccumulators, and are thus useful for site remediation.

[In this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755492/), it was found that safe vegetable crops could be grown even in soils with As concentrations in excess of 200 ppm. 

&gt; This analysis suggests that in some settings, communicating risk information to gardeners about acceptable soil levels of Pb and As for vegetable gardening can be refined by specifying preferred crops for soil conditions. Findings support the gardener exposure reduction practice of growing fruit crops in preference to leafy and other crop types where soil Pb and As concentrations are elevated. While the association between soil and vegetable contaminant concentrations can be obscured under diverse field conditions (McBride et al. 2014), this more targeted study suggests that tomatoes (and presumably a number of other fruit crops) can be grown in substantially contaminated soils (up to 1000 mg kg^(−1) Pb and more than 300 mg kg^(−1) As, in the case of these lead-arsenate contaminated orchard soils) without exceeding health-based standards, but carrots (and other root crops) and certain leafy greens may exceed standards when grown in orchard soils of similar type with more than 50–100 mg kg^(−1) Pb or As.",1587065972,fnm6kag

Hard work has nothing to do whatsoever with race. There happens to be a strong socioeconomic and perhaps a cultural aspect to the fact that the Mexicans he hired tended to be hard workers. It's more because they were probably raised in a much harsher environment than many of the American born applicants. A 'poor' kid in the US usually has a roof over their head, electricity, and running water. And if they didn't, and they survived to working age, I bet they are pretty hard workers. A person born in the wrong part of Mexico to a 'poor' family is lucky if they have access to safe drinking water. And if they escape those conditions to get here and find a job, yeah... they probably don't take it for granted and screw off like a middle class person might tend to. 
But ANYONE, regardless of race or ethnicity, is going to have those tendencies. So yes, attributing it to race is racist and incredibly ignorant. 

Think about this; you have these ideas about 'Mexicans' because the Mexicans you have encountered are likely the poorest and most desperate examples in Mexican society, who risked everything they had (which was very little) to come here and work jobs like construction and meat packing and cleaning hotel rooms. You don't encounter the vast majority of middle class, educated Mexican people here, because they are living comfortable lives in Mexico. There are plenty of doctors and lawyers and teachers, and none of them are interested in illegally coming to Nebraska to work illegally. You are attributing things that come from deep poverty to race. Race has nothing to do with it.

Edit: To put it another way, think of the most burned out, trashy meth addicted local people you can imagine. Now, picture shipping them in a group to a city in Northern Canada, where there are no other US citizens. Now, do you imagine that their impression of us in general might be a bit skewed?

Anecdotally, while not representative of this issue in Nebraska, I recall that tribal representatives from Standing Rock refusing to participate in meetings or hearings.  I don't think it's a huge logical leap to conclude that tribal leadership is horribly mismanaged.

1006,1006,Wes-tron,Seems like a lot of people are ready to write off the tribe for they way they wrote this press release. Treating them like they don’t deserve the same basic and civil rights as any other citizen is part of the systemic injustice done to Native tribes across the country.

1008,1008,Hugo_Hackenbush,"""Often wrong"" implies you misunderstand what the point of models like this are in the first place and the fact they're making estimates about a range of possible outcomes.

1019,1019,nebranderson,"I think you need to deepdive into the context and historical background of these two comments you're equating as well as look at the power divide between these two groups, among many other things. I think a good litmus test to simplify this for you is how do you believe a white person would react to the statement that he is greedy because he is white vs how a Native American would respond to being told that since they are an ""Indian"", they must be a drunk. Do you truly believe that the power and effect of each statement are at the same level?",1587236684,fnt8jos
1020,1020,Vivid-Tailor,"Basically, you can say Pete Rickets is greedy, but he is one person. By saying all white men are greedy is the same as all Indians are drunks.

1025,1025,nebranderson,"Mate, I'm trying to reason with you. We are not talking about whether or not a blanket statement is good or not. I agree, saying all X people are Y is wrong and ineffective, and will cause divide. But your analogy is baffling.

Think of racism as something that is only truly possible from a position of power. And certainly I hope you would agree that for the history of the US (and Nebraska), the power has been with white people and not with Native Americans. No one gets a pass for ignorant and blanket statements, no one. But the impact of those statements greatly differ based on several factors. Oversimplifying it by equating two ignorant comments about a demographic does not always work. I hope you can meet me there.",1587241222,fntgkt8

Not all whites are greedy, not all native Americans are drunks. Racism is about race, not about power. People leaning left have tried to redefine racism to a position of power to give themselves a free pass to be racist to whites.
