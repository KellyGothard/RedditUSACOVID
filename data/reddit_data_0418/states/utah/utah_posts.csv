2. Are the drivers really that crazy? The number of automotive fatalities in Utah is actually quite low, you guys actually have like the 10th least in the US. I am worried about this because my wife is Japanese, they drive on the other side of the road there, I'm a bit worried.

I was told it is also better to buy land with a cabin/house on it already since it's a giant pain to build in the wilderness. 

Anyone have any suggestions on a good area for him to look? 

I understand the 2 hour from SLC might put some restraints on people helping out. So if you have a place that is a diamond in the rough please reply. 

He loves to fish, hunt, read and is very capable ( at this point ) of taking care of himself. He is very intelligent and in good shape for his age.

I am seriously contemplating moving to Utah, specifically the Ogden area with my husband and three children. I love where we currently live but the cost of living keeps climbing and it is hard to keep up. There is also a nursing program I am interested in there. 

When we expressed our desire to move to friends and family, many of them were concerned that we would face discrimination there due to being a biracial family (white and Hispanic) and due to the fact that we are not religious and very liberal. 

We were planning on vacationing there for a week or so to get a feel but you can't really get a true feeling for what it's le to live there in such a short period of time. 

Are these things we should truly be concerned about? The family members who have expressed these concerns so strongly are liberal whites who live in the Boise area and have said the Salt Lake area is worse in terms of shunning people who don't conform.

275,275,MotheroftheworldII,1580430022,ewfdzm,Nan,"The S.B.85 proposed by Senator Scott D. Sandall would make not having a front license plate on your vehicle a primary offense. Currently it is a secondary offense so you can still get a ticket. It is not currently a reason to be pulled over and given a ticket. S.B. 85 would change that and you could be pulled over and ticketed for nothing other than not having a front license plate.

I don't know how many people would be affected by this but, I drive a 2004 Mazda RX8 and putting a front plate at the required 12 inches from the ground means the license place obscures almost 50% of the grill thus reducing air flow to the engine. I see this as a big problem. I know someone with a Porche with a front end so low the license plate would have to some how be attached to the hood or *s roof. 

If this bill would affect you I would suggest that you write to your Senator as well as to Senator Sandall.",Utah,Utah State Legislature Bill S.B.85 Removes Secondary Offense For Not Having A Front License Plate

[Tim Quinn](http://house.utah.gov/rep/QUINNT/) in the state legislature has introduced a bill that will allow just 25% of the electorate to 'recall' (effectively impeach) a state senator (much less than the threshold the nation's founders envisioned for removal from office). If this bill is passed and the sole republican senator that answered his conscience and voted to convict the president is removed, the message will be clear - do anything the president asks, or you're gone -  effectively making the republican party owned by one man, Donald Trump. Such control is not seen in representative governments, but it is always seen in autocratic ones. If this bill sounds like a bad idea to you, its important that you act and make it known that you oppose [HB0217](https://le.utah.gov/~2020/bills/static/HB0217.html). 

There are at least two things you can do:

1) Call or email your state representatives and ask them to oppose this bill (you can find them [here](https://le.utah.gov/GIS/findDistrict.jsp)).

2) Call or email the bill sponsor [Tim Quinn](http://house.utah.gov/rep/QUINNT/) and ask him to withdraw it.",Utah,"If you don't want the republican party to be beholden to one man, you should act now."

What kind of choices do Utah's people want for their privacy and personal data?  


Presently there is no opt in or opt out. **Utahs HB183** brings a choice...maybe.  
If you are issued a Driving license in Utah all your information is sent to the Utah Population database. Your social security number, address, and personal details.   
Did you get married, divorced, have a child, have a medical procedure? That is in there too.

""Over the years, the Utah Drivers License Division (DLD) has provided the personal identifying information of [3,997,558](https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/huntsman/utah-population-database/data/) Utahns to the University of Utah (the U.) for research purposes without obtaining the license holders’ consent to do so. In fact, a [Memorandum of Agreement](http://www.citizensfortaxfairness.org/pdf/Privacy%20-%20DLD%20and%20Uof%20U%20-%20RGE%20DLD%202018%20Agreement%201-2-18.pdf) between the DLD and the U. expressly prohibits the U. from telling licensees that it is using information provided by the DLD to contact them.""

Drivers license or ID card number, first, middle and last name, sex, Social Security number, birth date, height, weight, hair color, eye color, birth place, mother’s maiden name, residence with up to 20 previous residences and date changed, mailing address, up to two previous names and date changed, etc.

""Under the current system, the only way a person can prevent their personal identifying information from being transmitted to the University of Utah by the DLD is to forego obtaining a Utah driver license and that is simply not a realistic option. And once the University of Utah has an individual’s personal identifying information, the person cannot submit a [GRAMA](https://archives.utah.gov/opengovernment/how-to-file-a-request-for-records-under-GRAMA.html) request to the U. to see what information it has on them. In addition, the U. refuses to remove personal identifying information from their databases even when requested to do so.""

When the database began to take off in the 1980s, Smith said, Utah policymakers, as well as the health and government agencies that were sharing the data, determined that the U. could add records to the database — or use those records for research — without an individual's knowledge because of the ""unique opportunities the resource provided for understanding health and disease, and for developing new medical treatments.""

[We planned a loop](https://imgur.com/a/Qh3GW5u) that would take us through Zion NP, Bryce, Capitol Reef, Arches and Canyonlands, then passing through Monument Valley, south Grand Staircase and Kanab on the way back.

Here's a draft of our itinerary so far:
* Day 1: Arrive in LV, go to Valley of Fire State Park

* Day 2: Snow Canyon State Park

* Day 3: Zion

* Day 4: Zion

* Day 5: Bryce Canyon

* Day 6: Capitol Reef

* Day 7: Capitol Reef (possibly Goblin Valley+ on the way out)

* Day 8: Arches

* Day 9: Canyonlands - Island in the Sky

* Day 10: Canyonlands - Needles

* Day 11: Monument Valley + Lake Powell area

* Day 12: south Grand Staircase area, Wahweap or Toadstool Hoodoos

* Day 13: Coral Pink Sand Dunes + extra

* Day 14: back to Las Vegas

I'd like some local perspectives on that itinerary. For instance, would it be best to condense days 11 and 12 into one, if that means spending more time in a NP? We're also considering spending only 1 day in Zion and allocate the extra day to the Capitol Reef area. From what I understand, CRNP has a lot to offer for full day hikes, and we're thinking that Zion might be too crowded to our liking (we were in Grand Canyon last October and although the trails were not too crowded, the shuttles were packed).

Finally, I'd like to know about your personal favorite parks, trails and hikes in Utah. Both of us are somewhat experienced hikers and always up for a good challenge.

Any help is extremely appreciated!",Utah,Greetings from Quebec! Seeking advice visiting Utah this October.

Taking my family on a road trip through southern Utah in mid March. Unfortunately we only have a few days to conquer and see as much as we can. I've always wanted to see Zion and Bryce Canyon, but  really hoping to get a list of the TRUE highlights.

We will be starting in Page AZ, then heading up through Zion, before making our way East towards Colorado. It seems there is about 2 hour drives between each park, but not sure if we need more than one day in each? What should we do and what should we definitely NOT miss?

I've been reading a lot about Utah (specifically southern Utah) and it comes across to me as a magical place. My friend and I want to pay a visit for my birthday week in mid-April, to do some hiking / primitive camping in the national parks and hopefully make some new friends while we're there. I have a few places in mind to visit (Arches, Mt. Zion, Bryce Canyon) but I'd like to know if anyone has any advice for somebody who wants to go off the beaten path and put in effort to experience nature in solitude away from crowds.

A couple of things I'd like to know: What sort of things should I be mindful of when trying to primitive camp? Is it easy to backpack far out to a camping spot in the parks? Are crowds avoidable in Spring? What small towns should I visit to meet people? Are there any other good resources for a newbie planning a trip?

But a little background about myself: I’ve lived in the Bay Area (California) my entire 29 years on this earth. 

6 years ago I moved into my first apartment which was $1,100/month (which was cheap at the time). 500 sq. ft 1 bedroom 1 bath. 

Life happened, and fast forward to now where it’s me solo working a full time job 45-50 hours a week making a decent wage (or one would think) paying for a room in a house which is $1,300 on top of my share of utilities (maybe totaling $1,500). 

Our sales tax here is nearing 10%, the state takes 13% of my income each pay check (one of the highest income taxes in the country). On top of gas averaging $3.45/gallon

*Stop telling us your sob story*

All I’m trying to get at, is that when I look at some of these houses in Utah (Tooele, West Jordan, Ogden, even some SLC houses), I’m looking at mortgages that seem incredibly low, at least to me, and it makes me sick to think that my girlfriend &amp; I could afford to have a wonderful house in Utah when I’m shoving out $1,300 for a room. 

I guess my whole point I’m trying to get at is this: living in California my whole life (specifically the Bay Area) under oppressive taxes and cost of living, is it wrong for me to think most house in Utah are on the inexpensive side? 

Also, I make this post with discretion toward the fact that I know each &amp; every one of you Utahns, work extremely hard for what you own, I’m not making this post to say it’s easy living out there, because I know for a lot of people you work hard and long for what you have.

Am I wrong to think this way? Or is it just because I’ve been in California my whole life I’ve been indoctrinated to think this way?

TL;DR - Moving to Utah soon, seeing how cheap cost of living is and mortgages, is it wrong for me to think this way considering I live undue such oppressive costs in California?",Utah,Why are houses so cheap in Utah?

One way we are thinking about staying at monument valley for a night, there seems to be camping spots open and available (it's the Navajo reservation so no BLM camping). On the other end we were thinking about stopping by Mesa Verde but it appears it's too early in the year for that (higher elevation). Most of the park is closed (but may be fine for a quick visit) and all the campgrounds are closed. I haven't been able to find any options nearby. We would just be either tent camping or sleeping in the camper shell on my truck so nothing fancy and I'm open to setting up on open BLM land.

As our country and state grapple with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), state leaders are determined to do their part to protect the health and safety of our communities.  These decisions are not made lightly. The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus a worldwide pandemic. We are combining efforts as a system to slow the disease’s spread.  As part of that initiative, Snow College will implement the following action plan:

Move to online instruction for the rest of the semester, effective April 1;
Cancel classes on March 30-31;
Cancel or reschedule all college-sponsored large gatherings (indoor and outdoor) through April 30;
Restrict international and domestic travel, as well as in-state travel to large gatherings (as previously announced).
Each day, new knowledge about this infectious disease is being developed by researchers and clinicians. Please check the college’s COVID-19 website for the latest updates. We are adjusting our response daily based on the best recommendations of these scientists, after consultation with USHE institutions, and under the guidance of state and federal health officials. 

Online learning only through end of semester and Classes Canceled March 30-31
Snow College will shift to online instruction beginning April 1 for the remainder of spring semester. Classes are cancelled Monday and Tuesday, March 30 and 31, allowing faculty and staff time to prepare for the transition to online coursework. In these extraordinary circumstances, faculty are encouraged to streamline coursework as much as possible, be available for online consultation with students, and develop digital or take-home exams. Faculty, for guidance on how to move your class online, the Teaching and Technology Center (TTC) will remain open throughout Spring Break and on March 30 and 31 to help instructors transition to online offerings. 

Beginning Wednesday, April 1, students will be able to access recorded lectures, homework assignments, and engage in video consultations with their instructors.  More information will be forthcoming on considerations for classes where face-to-face is necessary (CTE programs, performing arts classes, labs, etc.).  Requests for exceptions to online instruction should be rare and should come from individual deans to the Provost for review, subject to accreditation requirements.",Utah,I teach at Snow College and just received this email:

* Consider your pet in your preparedness plans (e.g. food, litter, vaccinations).

I'm a Californian getting ready to move out there as I was offered a job transfer from my company.
Curious as to how the ATV laws out there are?

Hear a few rumors and questions for ATV....
 Can you ride with no helmet? (I never will I always ride with one, just asking)
 Can you actually just ride your quad down the street to the liquor store to get a bag of chips or toothpaste something?
Are there any sand dunes out there? How are trail riding?
Can you actually just ride in open areas by your house?


For handguns I've read but it's too much reading and get confused for a simple question just need questions answered lol.... (again from california so my guns are pretty much useless, unless at the range)

Can any one with a utah license actually just open carry there gun where ever around town? As long as its ""two actions"" (rack slide, pull trigger) this correct?
Consealing your gun you still need a CCW or permit right? But can be loaded in chamber?
And you can carry a gun in your car right? Is this loaded? Two step action as well? Concealed or openly?

Thank you guys!!! I appreciate you.",Utah,ATV and Handgun questions???Please help simple questions. Moving to utah!!!

Link to order: https://www.grandcountyutah.net/DocumentCenter/View/9105/SEUHD-Restrictions-Order-3-17-2020-FINAL?bidId=

I’ve been planning a trip to Grand county BLM land to camp, collect rocks, and just enjoy the otherworldly wildness of Utah for a few months now. Amidst this pandemic, I’ve been trying to research everything I can to make sure my trip is still allowed. 

I stubbled across this order, from grand county, saying “all camping on public or private lands” can only be utilized by “essential visitors and primary residents” (pg 4, section 3). I can’t find what the definition of a essential visitor is and I’ll be coming from CO so I’m not a resident. 

I don’t want to drive 5+ hours only to be turned around and/or ticketed from violating an order. I  99.9% sure that I wouldn’t see even another car on the BLM rd I’m taking in and take this pandemic very seriously, so I would practice the “200 ft” distancing and not interact with anyone. (TBH I’d drive an hour away if I saw other person in my preferred primitive camp area). 

I see nothing from BLM on this matter. In fact, I see that they are waiving entrance fees nationally as of today. So, what is this order? And more so, what is an “essential visitor?” 

Many thanks in advance",Utah,Is BLM land closed to everyone except “essential visitors and primary residents”?

There are three affected parties it addresses:
1. The State
2. Small Businesses
3. Employees

Right now, many small businesses (especially local restaurants) are feeling the crippling pain of social distancing. Employees are in a tough spot because many are losing hours, receiving pay decreases, and being laid-off. The State has reserves but will also suffer from the economic impact.

The idea: An economic relief bill that offers a 100% (or another feasible and beneficial amount, with a cap if necessary) income tax credit to small businesses for purchases made to local restaurants for its employees. This benefits employees, small businesses and the state in the following ways:

Employees: Many employees cannot afford to support local restaurants because of their reduced wages and hours. An employer providing some meals to the employees helps the employees keep more money in their wallet that they would have spent on the food.

Businesses (less affected or large businesses): Have an incentive to purchase food for its employees because of the tax credit. It is not short term-relief, but a small cash flow sacrifice where possible is later matched with the tax credit.

Local Restaurants: Benefit by the increased spending, and reduce the risk of going out of business as a result.

The State: will take a hit on State income tax but will still see an increase in sales tax on the food purchases as a result. I'm unsure how devastating the hit on income tax would be to the State...

This could probably extend beyond just the local food industry to other affected industries. What are your thoughts? Is this possible? What negative effects would this cause?

TLDR; State should offer tax incentives to businesses that purchase food/goods from local restaurants/businesses for its employees.",Utah,I have a small idea for economic relief

I would hope we are all aware of the present circumstances with COVID19 and their effect on our economy. I was listening to NPR the other day where they were focusing on the impact of COVID19 on our small businesses, specifically restaurants and bars. To sum up their conversation; some businesses will find the demand for their work is just delayed until this all passes, however in the case of restaurants and bars that demand is lost. 

I am lucky to be able to work remotely, and to be able to pay my bills through this mess. Not everyone is so lucky. I want to support my local restaurants, but I also understand eating out increases my circle of ""social exposure"" which puts me at an increased risk. 

Does anyone else here feel the same? Has anyone found a better solution? The next few months are going to be rough for all of us. I would love to help lift where I can.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

Because of this, school has been overwhelmingly hard for me, and I have decided to take a break in order to better know how I can change in order to succeed at school. Because of personal circumstances, and the fact that my home is on the East Coast, while most flights are being canceled, I would like to stay in Utah to be near my boyfriend. 

I know it’s unusual and suspicious to ask strangers this, but I have already asked the people I know in Utah, and none of them are able to accommodate me. I’m honestly getting desperate. 

So please, if any of you live somewhere between South Jordan and American Fork, and are willing to do this, message me and I can verify that I’m not trying to scam anyone. I’d like to move in sometime between April 6th and April 10th, but a week or two after that might be able to work out. I don’t have that much stuff, and I’m not that needy.

With the impact from the pandemic forcing so many people to find new ways to connect, there's an unprecedented amount of online activity with an incredible amount of first time users experiencing what online communities are like.

I pretty much live on Discord. I'm in the early stages of assembling a discord server for people in Utah, and am opening it up before it's ready for prime time in hopes to get some good ideas and feedback while things are being assembled.

I'm an experienced moderator on several platforms, including Discord, but I've never done a geo-centric online community before.

Reddit is one platform I very rarely use so I don't know if links or posts like this are allowed, but I couldn't find a rules list to check. If it's not, would a moderator please DM me and take this down, so I'll know for future reference.

Here's one of the oldest Utah road maps I have from 1924 produced by Continental Oil Company (Conoco). [Side note: while browsing around this map, you might come across a town in Colorado with an extremely outdated name]"
1397,1397,aLionInSmarch,1586048819,fv544h,Nan,"I have been seeing a lot of news about various elements in the government being [underfunded](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/10/coronavirus-testing-delays-caused-in-part-by-underfunding-cdc-director-says.html), [underprepared](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cuomo-critics-highlight-years-of-taxpayer-waste-and-mismanagement-deepening-the-coronavirus-crisis), and just generally [negligent](https://www.propublica.org/article/us-emergency-medical-stockpile-funding-unprepared-coronavirus) at a fundamental responsibility of the government; [public health](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/trump-scrapped-pandemic-early-warning-program-system-before-coronavirus). Those links are from a number of different sources and hopefully represent an ideological spectrum that the COVID-19 pandemic is not solely any individuals blame (although feel free to apportion that blame out as you see fit) but there is definitely some systemic failures across Republican and Democratic administrations both federally and at the state and local level.

&amp;#x200B;

And I get it. Disaster planning is not sexy. In a world of competing interests, experts calling for spending on a hypothetical disaster are in an uphill battle. I wonder then if perhaps that represents a spot for a third party to occupy. A party that occupies an ideological center and advocates for fundamental good governance and perhaps eschews the larger culture wars battles altogether. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize Utah United was/is (its still going I think?) a moderate party but I generally suspect they didn't make enough traction because they didn't really have a hook to separate themselves from centrist Republicans/Democrats. Democrats in Utah are already pretty darn centrist and the Republicans seemed to be captured by the far right and more moderate republicans don't want to vote for anyone with a D next to their name. This same problem is mirrored in other more liberal states where the republicans are moderate and the Democrats are far left and moderate democrats don't want to vote for the Republican. Sort of a problem of human nature I suspect.

&amp;#x200B;

A party that might dodge these culture war questions by doubling down and focusing on when all this craziness is done ""what are we doing to mitigate the next COVID-19?"" or ""what are we doing to harden the electrical grid from malicious actors"" or ""mitigate wildfires in the west"" or ""prepare for hurricanes in the atlantic"". These ""culture war"" questions won't go away, and indeed, are important - but I suspect that fighting them has really done a lot of harm in some fundamental areas of the government's essential responsibilities. My goal then is to try to mitigate that harm by focusing on neglected areas that will not arouse those passions. Gun control/abortion, etc (you know the list) are important but they suck up a lot of oxygen as per the articles cited at the top seem to imply. 

&amp;#x200B;

Getting a bit of sexy in the party is critical to this as well. I personally like and I know reddit at large probably does too an expanded support for high-profile science and human-spaceflight programs in NASA and efforts to improve both quality and access to a robust public education system. Those seem like topics that cross the traditional Red/Blue lines of division and certainly manned-spaceflight is a very exciting and inspiring endeavor.

I was wondering if Hole in the Rock Road is currently open to the public, or if it is closed off due to Covid-19?  My wife and I had a trip to the Bahamas planned for a few weeks from now, which is now cancelled due to the virus, and instead we were wanting to do some hiking off Hole in the Rock Road.  Sounds like Glen Canyon is off limits to the public at this time, but wanted to see if anyone in Utah actually knew if that road was open or not.

Identified cases mirror a percentage (5% roughly) of tests performed, as you would expect.

I haven't been able to determine why testing is declining so quickly. Is testing down because the demand for testing is down (fewer symptomatic people coming forward) or is there some other reason testing is on the decline? 

I've been tested \[negative\], with mild non-COVID symptoms, I didn't ask to be tested, my Doctor just sent me. A few other friends in SLC and Utah County have also been tested, so it seems like testing is accessible, unless something has changed.
