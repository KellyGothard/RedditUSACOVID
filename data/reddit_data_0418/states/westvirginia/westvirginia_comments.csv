We are already one of the whitest places on the planet. If keeping West Virginia white were the solution, we should be rolling in money. 

If working hard is how people got rich, West Virginia should be rolling in money. Republicans straight up lie to you. Democrats tell the truth sometimes but rarely have three balls to fight for you. Bernie is the only one who will shake up the system enough to make sure we get back on the right path where we recognize that workers are AS IMPORTANT AS business owners and aren’t cogs people like Murray can dispose of when he goes “bankrupt”.

If you love coal miners elect someone who will insist retirees get treated with respect and vote Bernie. 

When Trump goes to Welch and faces tv he real problems we face, then maybe we can start talking about how much he cares. 

But you listen to rich guy propaganda who tells you that Mexicans are evil when it’s been the white men of Wall Street who extracted our mineral wealth and left behind no infrastructure. 

Until you stop falling for this propaganda young business owners like me are going to have to support your drug addled families because you’re too ignorant to demand help from your government. You’re too busy demanding useless bullshit our racist rich overlords feed you.

79,79,CraigCarpenterII,"I grew up in Huntington. Went to school from kindergarten thru 12th grade in the middle of the West End. The West End is a bad part of town; I've been stopped twice by police twice as I witnessed SWAT storm a house; a kid I grew up with went to prison for dealing; the field my school practiced soccer and had P.E. on was always surrounded by prostitutes (one day eight of them were arrested at the same time; I carry Narcan with me always because I've been with people as they overdosed from narcotics. And yet, I never felt unsafe. I've had many drugged-out people come up to me asking for a cellphone or money but I'm usually surprised by how nice they are.

Get to know the areas and you'll be just fine. For reference, Huntington is basically a long horizontal strip below the Ohio River where WV, Kentucky, and Ohio meet. This list isn't exhaustive but I think it covers the important areas

West End- western part of the city (west of 1st street); pretty dead; lots of abandoned/burned homes yet somehow business seems relatively unaffected; lots of churches; Adams Ave is the de facto main street in this part of town; has a Sheetz with Tesla Superchargers for some reason

Westmoreland- even further west than the West End; technically part of Huntington but is in a different county than the rest; doesn't feel like Huntington; looks like a typical small town save for the hills and trees

Old Central City- surrounded by the West End; full of old shops (mostly nice antiques), the Central City Cafe, the railroad and radio museums, and a small park with an old gazebo

South Side- south of center of city; lots of 1910's looking, thin but tall houses; proper city; nice neighborhoods; brick roads; large, beautiful houses surround the park and Fourpole Creek on both sides; large trees line the park and some streets;

Southeast Hills- east of Hal Greer Blvd; lots of winding roads; run-down businesses; goes directly from proper pieces architectural art to the Marcum Terrace area; cemeteries; dead-end roads

Southwest Hills- southwest of Hal Greer Blvd; roads are wind like hiking paths; Huntington Museum of Art; overlooks Downtown; has houses that make the South Side look like a Hoovertown; closer to Downtown than most of the rest of the city, but feels farther away; Ritter Park Amphitheater and Rose Garden

Guyandotte- far east of Huntington; outside the flood wall; thought was its own city for most of my life (it actually was for a long time)

Downtown- very old; Keith Albee Theater (one of the first of its kind in the world outside of NYC and designed by the architect of Madison Square Garden); safe; great shopping and eating; Heritage Station

Campus- a true architectural masterpiece; the area around campus is close to Downtown and is basically the same except more dangerous and less fun

As a child, I new that orange wasn't a normal color for water, but I didn't really understand how *weird* it was until I had spent some time out of the state.

When people come in and try to say that we shouldn't rely so much on coal mines, they will naturally hit a brick wall. Google tells me that (as of 2017) 2% of West Virginians are employed by the coal industry. If I recall correctly, the average person can remember the names/faces of  about 150 people, so voting against whatever the coal companies want is like telling three people you know that you want them to be unemployed. And in a clannish society like West Virginia, that's not gonna happen. You don't vote for something that will hurt your neighbors, and they won't vote for something that they *think* will hurt you.

Personally, I hate the GOP. I'd love to be able to vote Republican, but the party as a whole just pisses me off so much that I can't trust them. Being a registered independent kinda sucks, but at least I know what I'm getting into when I vote for a Democrat. Party doesn't matter much on a town/county level, but for state or federal? Fuck. I hate that I have to put my ideals aside in favor of accountability.

I don't get it! Why can't these coal companies just switch over to wind or solar? It's not like they don't have the money for investments! Really, if someone has an explanation better than, ""They're choosing short term gains over long term gains,"" I would love to hear it. Honestly. No sarcasm. A bit of added context for their train of thought could really help me.

Godfuckingdammit! I know I'm going on a rant at this point, but I just need to vent. The stream in my yard had a Ph of 2! 3 at best! That's pretty fucking low either way. Even the EPA guy was amazed when I (as a child,) told him that I liked to catch frogs in it. Frogs shouldn't have been able to survive in that! There was hardly enough oxygen! Sure, the EPA put in some limestone (or whatever) lining to try and help fix the Ph balance, but did that cure the water coming out of the ground in the first place? No. Did it cause anything more than an algae bloom? No. Was any of it their fault? No. It was the fucking coal companies who thought Moria didn't dig deep or greedily enough!

307,307,Silent_Cow,"We purchased an old log house that had oil heat. When oil prices skyrocketed, we knew that heat was unsustainable... 

We had our chimney professionally sealed and flues rounded for burning wood. That was great for 15ish years, until it became tiresome. 

We’ve since sealed the chimneys shut, closed at room level and installed propane fire logs in three fireplaces.  This was has been the best move to date. We’ve had this for about 5 years. Spend about 600-900 a year for heat, depending on the weather. This year, being so warm, I’m expecting less than 600.00. 

We plan on getting an electric heat pump to balance out the system. I think these two will be great together. 

Like you, we live where no gas is run. Cable isn’t even out here..  so options are tricky. 

Propane logs in 3 of our fire places have been great.

Others dont like to mess up their vehicles with trash and feel it is best to throw it out the window. I'm not sure what's worse. 

Just be glad you didn't move out here 30 years ago. Illegal dumping has gotten a lot better, but it's still an eyesore.

They use to have a free dump day each month at the Jeff Co landfill, but they stopped doing that maybe a year or so ago. This helped the issue a little, but I've definitely noticed an uptick on the roads to my house outside of  Ctown.

429,429,crimechisel,Thank you.,1578507641,fdko5kj
430,430,SumHighFalls,"Thanks for sharing your positive experience.  Glad you had fun!  I remember the soreness of those few days after skiing.

I share your enthusiasm for Winterplace.  In the 90s, friends and I made the trek from Carolinas or Tennessee 3 or 4 times to Winterplace.  For me, it was a great all-around choice, based on cost, distance, skill level, and expected frequency of skiing.  

Based on where I lived then (and now), I knew I wasn’t going to go skiing yearly, let alone several times a year.  I’d always be a relative novice, just out to have a fun day and a little exercise and adrenaline.  Winterplace was great for that, and not terribly crowded back when I went.

My first time on downhill skis as a kid was at Mt. Timberline, near (maybe even then-owned by) Canaan Valley.  They were the closest to where we lived at the time.  Went a few times over the years to Wisp in Maryland, and once during college to Sugar or Beech in NC.  And one work trip around 2005-ish to Wintergreen in Virginia, where we had time only for an hour of tubing (but spent 2 days stuck in a conference room that overlooked the slopes - that was cruel!).  Never made it to Snowshoe for skiing (that I remember) though I’ve heard many people say it’s the best in WV.  When I’ve been in ski areas out West, it’s always been off-season.

Several friends are really into skiing and have skied a lot of the big places out West and in Europe.  One of them went to Winterplace with me.  I finally made it down one of the black diamonds.  She had noted that they probably wouldn’t rate as black diamonds anywhere but the East Coast.  But, she still enjoyed the skiing and we had a great time.  She and her husband have made weekend ski trips to Winterplace with their grade-school-aged kids.

Hope you have fun skiing West Virginia!",1578508910,fdkq9xc

There's a really nice restaurants and some nice shops, the theater has been restored.  I believe they're in the process of restoring the hotel there also.  The houses in town are deteriorating for sure but the campgrounds I passed were full of campers.  One of the people I was with said it looked like Fayetteville did before it blossomed.  They think it's 10 years away from being where Fayetteville is today.  I'm not an expert but I believe a lot of Fayetteville's visitors are from out of state and are there for the climbing and rafting.  Looks like most visitors to Hinton are in-state people there for the fishing.  So, idk if Hinton will ever get to Fayetteville levels since out of staters will spend on hotels, rafting trips, cabin rentals, etc. but it is a nice town.  I love backpacking and mountain biking.  I wish there were hiking/biking trails like Fayetteville has.  There may be, I just don't know where they are.  

Speaking of potential, you're right.  I think they could cash in on the Amtrak station being there.  Promote the trip from the Charleston/Huntington area for locals and people in town for business alike.  You in Charleston/Huntington for work and don't know what to do for a weekend?

Consolidate the counties and you basically eliminate positions like Sheriff, Superintendent of schools, Treasurer, and so on for the entire county administration. You'd presumably have a similar number of teachers, bus drivers, clerks, deputies, and so on, but the duplication in supervisory roles and the duplication in maintaining two courthouses and so on would be eliminated.

You can repeat this over and over for many counties where it makes sense to do so.",1579019569,fedtinm

1) Virginia is the only state where an incorporated city is not part of the county it resides in which means if Frederick County went to West Virginia it is entirely plausible  that Winchester would not. 

2) There is no way you would keep a single existing Teacher or Police officer using WV pay scales. Virginia pays a new teacher 15-20K more a year then a teacher with 15 years experience in WV (Guess how I know?). Never mind the PEIA benefits are not even close to Virginia's 

3) Virginia got rid of the personal property tax years ago and I HIGHLY doubt there are many that would want it back.

As the story goes the early immigrants came to North America and were pushed west and got as far as the mountains and could not afford to go any further.  In many places they remained rather isolated, outside teachers arriving in the late 1800's and then radio in the 1920's contributed to the dialect being forced closer to that of the rest of the US.  An example of the linguistic retention was that in about 1910 a music historian Professor Childs discovered Old English balleds still existed in Appalachia that were less changed in 400 years than they had been in England.

I know the majority of counties didn’t do shit. We made that shit happen. We dragged you fuckers kicking and screaming into the Union. The only real West Virginia is our West Virginia. 

The real story of West Virginia was that back in that day, the primary tax was property tax. Income tax hadn’t been invented yet. 

In West Virginia our land sucked so we didn’t have big plantations. We had small farms using livestock. Richmond decided that livestock should be taxed but slaves should not. So West Virginia was paying WAY extra in taxes, getting very little in the way of infrastructure, we barely had black people here at all, so when Richmond wanted us to contribute to the confederate movement WHICH DESPITE EFFORTS BY LYING PIECES OF SHIT TO WHITE WASH THE WAR WAS ALMOST **ENTIRELY ABOUT SLAVERY** we told them they could fuck right off that we weren’t going to be sent to die for Rich coastal elites to stay rich off our backs. 

Then there was a man named Francis Pierpont who was a lawyer in Fairmont. His wife wouldn’t sleep with him until he abolished slavery and he created the state of West Virginia almost by his sheer force of will. Her abolitionist wife was terrorized by those who were SO USELESSLY XENOPHOBIC that they favored slavery even though most northern counties had a dozen or so slaves AT MOST. 

So you can pretend like your some Mayberry bullshit but despite you pretending that your welcoming friendly people, the best of you all are two faced backstabbing hypocrites. 

At least if we don’t like you, we tell you so, and if we don’t like you it’s never because of where your parents were born or who you love. 

We are strategic geniuses who used our limited resources to run out a government that was taking advantage of us. You’re just the tool we needed to keep them from coming back. So you can leave if you want, but if you’re going to stay put some respect on your northern betters and quit supporting the capital of the richest losers of a war to keep slavery.

It would also allow municipalities to pass additional gun laws that could not go beyond *DC v. Heller*. The third would require a background check on firearms. None of those involve confiscation.

Not all prohibition has ended poorly. We prohibit individuals from owning high-test explosives, for instance. I haven't seen that prohibition complained about much. We also prohibit individuals from owning dangerous animals, from setting traps aimed at intruders on their property and from owning tanks. None of these have been problems either.

However, the prohibition argument is entirely baseless, because nobody is trying to prohibit guns, just put some sane regulations on them.

What sort of education do you think would be helpful? What gun laws are we not enforcing? The NRA has lobbied strenuously to stop background check laws at gun shows, for instance. As for what is wrong, with the people, how would you go about figuring it out? The NRA also prohibits the CDC from studying gun violence, which is how we would figure that out.

We'll fight for coal, to bring back the good jobs. Mind you; they are not speaking only to miners, but the trucking, heavy equipment, restaurant owners, and every other support industry. This is why two coal barons ran for governor and one of them won.  
  
There aren't many people I speak to here who want coal, but there aren't many people I speak to who want to be jobless and on welfare either. The alternative is to abandon their worthless homes and move to a place where there are jobs that pay a living wage. What makes it worse is that many folks' retirement are the home they paid off, this is a financially risky. Also, WV is ranked as the #2 highest per capita over 65 population in the country. They aren't going to move. It's too little too late for almost all of them.  
  
So now we have a welfare state and a drug problem. Predators of the hopeful abound. We have drug dealers, tweekers, video poker rooms, lottery, lying politicians, rehab clinics popping up everywhere, and lots and lots of Narcan.  
  
What we NEED is a new industry to replace coal. Fracking is a decent one, but it is just as prone to corruption and fragile to regulation, commodity prices, and once the buildout is complete, layoffs. Years ago, there was a push to retrain the unemployed to telecommute computer type work. This failed very early on. So if anybody can think of an industry we could embrace, I'm sure every politician within our borders would be shouting it from their soap box.  
  
Tourism would seem to be such an industry, but that has been tried for decades. There is a lot of competition over tourism. Manufacturing seems to be a great thing. We do have people who will work hard in this state. There is no shortage of that! Where I live, Hino (a division of Toyota) has just opened a giant plant.

1051,1051,Ribonacci,"It’s generational. 

Part of the problem is the fatalism of Appalachia, that things just do not get better unless by some higher power intervening. Therefore, people are unlikely to buck back when they feel they are being taken advantage of. It has always been this way. It will always be this way. Keep your head above water and no more, because death comes for you tomorrow as far as you know. It has been a hallmark of Appalachian thinking for generations. 

Part of the problem is historical. When people did buck back against the industries that strangle the state, we had events like Matewan and the Battle of Blair Mountain. We have mines suddenly moving out of the area, leaning starving towns behind. We have smear campaigns against those who wish to work for the public good against those who would exploit the capital and labor of the men and women of West Virginia. It is steeped into the culture. 

Part of the problem is health-related. So many people here have broken bodies and minds, with no means to find help in a brutal healthcare system. Dollar General is the mainstay, processed food the staple. The needle is your friend, OxyContin your only comfort. It is difficult to fight a system, when you must simultaneously fight an aching mind and body. Your children see you broken. Your grandchildren see you broken. They know this will be their future. 

That isn’t to say there are not people fighting to make way for a future for West Virginia. There’s a generation of both young and old working in small and silent ways to build up their comminities, because there is a deep love for these mountains and it’s people. But we are fighting nearly two hundred years of exploitation and ruin, and those things will not change overnight. 

In my opinion, the industry we should cater to? Healthcare. Make this state a resort for the sick, those who are not sound of mind or body. Nature can be profoundly healing, and there is demand for skilled labor in the health field that would draw people in. We now possess several top-of-the-line healthcare centers. Expand it, make it affordable, and people will come. There will never *not* be illness - as much as we would hope the opposite.",1579363144,fesa6zq

West Virginia needs people who wish for better each day, who continue to focus on how to better our situation and not thrive in the negativity that we are all drowning in.  

In my opinion, West Virginia needs Criminal Justice Reform, lower tax rates, and more land development for industrial entities. McDowell County where I'm from is practically dead but with just one single interstate exit, it could spark an industrial revolution for the County. These dead strip mines could be used for large factories such as Pepsi, Gatorade, Toyota, Tesla, and Amazon, the economic effects could be felt for Wyoming, Mercer, Mcdowell, and Raleigh. 

What it requires of us is educated voting and the ability to stand up for what we want and not allow politicians and Union Management to swindle us any longer. It also requires us to accept the fact that Coal Mining is officially dead in the capacity that our Economy can solely depend on it.  We also have to accept that the Unions have contributed to the downfall of our economy as much as our politicians. 

Anyway, I guess my point is that this internet/social media-fed generation that is developing needs to wake up to the fact that no state is going to perfectly fit their wants and putting down the place their from and moving away does nothing but continue the trend of diminishing the perception of West Virginia.",1579364671,fesfo9w

Second, many of those already in WV and in need of elder care will have some sort of funding for their care if they or their spouse paid into Social Security and Medicare, and might have some sort of private coverage.  Third, it’s second-nature to many West Virginians to look out for others and to step in to help.

This is the time for the State to invest in its people and for West Virginians to develop more healthcare organizations from within the State.  WVU/UHC only covers part of the need.  The nursing home ‘industry’ already attracts greedy and unscrupulous people indifferent to patients, families, employees, or communities.  

My thinking was focused more on the growing need for elder care, especially as more baby boomers hit the range for needing continuous care.  Addiction treatment definitely is needed, though possibly not funded.  I like your idea about wellness in general.  In a way, there’s room for a combination with attempts to develop tourism as a major industry.  WV can be a place for recovering, but also a place for recharging before burning out or breaking down.

If a candidate supports policies that invest in economic development via industries that don’t scar the land and poison the water, they somehow have to watch every word they say - without sounding like they are being shifty.

Healthcare is good, you're a stone's throw from Charleston Area Medical Center(CAMC), which runs two hospitals in Charleston and a bunch of smaller offices. Really, there's no lack of healthcare in the area.  

Charleston is the largest city in the state and there's usually something going on. Lots of good non-chain restaurants. You're not too far away from a lot of outdoor activities like hiking, skiing, mountain biking, whitewater rafting, etc.  

West Virginians are very friendly but they've also known most of their friends since they were little. It takes a bit to get into friend groups but it takes a bit of work.

Nitro is really small and there's not a whole lot there. As others have mentioned it's just a few minutes on 64 to Charleston which has some higher end stuff, restaurants, sports, theatre, etc.

When we rented in nitro, we paid $600 a month for a small 2 bedroom house. It was basic but that should give you an idea of costs. You could easily get something nicer for more.

The 1950s house we bought in Saint Albans was $96,000. 2 bedroom, dated. Townhouses are roughly the same price. Again, you could go much higher and nicer.

1396,1396,SumHighFalls,"I’m from WV, but lived in Alexandria, Annandale, and on Capitol Hill for several years.

The Eastern Panhandle might be the easiest for the days you have to commute.  

MARC service reaches the area.  Maryland has gotten testy about MARC tickets being subsidized, even for WV riders.  If you decide to look seriously at that area, you should make sure you’re up-to-date on that issue and how it might affect not just ticket rates but availability of parking.  For example, if a rate change happens (or happened) and people decide to just drive to a different station.  I live several hours away and haven’t needed to follow this closely.

That said, I don’t know how expensive the housing is in the commuting area.  I was a little curious, as a possibly very good job opportunity would require me to work in downtown DC again instead of telecommuting.  There were some options more reasonable than I expected.  Compared to DC and Northern Virginia, they likely will be bargains.

North Central West Virginia was where I lived.  There are a lot of people going back and forth between there and DC because of the location of FBI and NASA facilities in Clarksburg and Fairmont.  Depending on what happens with the relocation or refurbishing of the FBI HQ in downtown DC, many more FBI jobs might temporarily or semi-permanently move to WV.  That is indirectly relevant to your question, in that the presence of the FBI center in Clarksburg/Bridgeport brought an influx of development and a boost to the local economy.  

As a college town, Morgantown has more nightlife than Clarksburg or Fairmont.  I’ve ended up chatting with people about why there isn’t a good music scene (even a local one) in the area.  Thinking back to when I lived there as a child and when I visit now, people tend to make their own entertainment.  They’re more likely to grill out and sit around a fire pit passing around a guitar or having a few beers, or to go to the school events of their own kids or those of family and friends.  Clarksburg has developed an Amphitheater and rehabbed a historic theatre as a multi-use venue.  

The area is known for its Italian cuisine and had a strong immigrant influence in its prime.  National chain quick service or casual restaurants have entered the area in the last few decades.  I remember when we had to drive to the next town to go to Wendy’s.

I recommend determining what time of day and what day of the week you’d most likely commute, then checking out travel times on map apps for those days and times.  Something might be doable if you will be traveling over on Sunday evening and staying somewhere local, but too much if you actually had to travel from home to be there at 9 AM, then go back the same night.  The higher elevations and less dense populations (and government resources) can make winter travel more challenging or impossible, depending on the route.

Right now - around 3:30 PM on a non-holiday non-snowy Sunday afternoon, Apple map shows 3 hours and 52 minutes from Clarksburg to Alexandria (just for an example), via car.  It took 45 minutes to commute 11 miles into DC via carpooling when I lived in Annandale.  That was toward the end of my time living in the area, when I was OVER using METRO.  When I first lived there, I took the Fairfax County Connector bus to METRO, then took that to work.  Then I discovered I could drive to Springfield Mall, park for free, catch the free Mall shuttle or $.25 Fairfax bus ride to the Franconia-Springfield METRO, and still get to sleep in 30 minutes longer than when I took the Connector bus.  (I had to allow for a wider variance in timing when taking the Fairfax bus from in front of the apartment complex).

I knew some people who lived in Harper’s Ferry and commuted 4 days a week to jobs in DC.  They took the train and used that time to get work done.  They also had flexibility on their arrival and departure times at work.

A family member lived in Moorefield when he worked construction in DC and VA.  That was nearly 30 years ago.  I don’t remember Moorefield having much to it back then, and didn’t know until recently that he was commuting all the way into DC when he lived there.

Hope this mini-novel helps!  I love WV and am happy to see people enthusiastic to live there.  Moving from WV wasn’t my choice; it was a parent’s job transfer.  I continue to live out-of-state now because of a lack of jobs in my spouse’s field (and the spouse’s hatred for snow).  But, most of my family members still reside in WV and I visit as often as I can, which is not as often as I would like.

1424,1424,tickl3s,"I split my time between Reston and Morgantown, WV. Leaving out of Reston on Friday after 4pm to drive to WV has definitely increased in travel time over the past year or so, probably due to the silver line expansion and everyone moving into this area. It used to take me 3 hours to get to Morgantown, but now its sometimes 45minutes to 1 hour longer, all due to traffic getting out of Leesburg on 15 and the Frederick/Hagerstown area of I70. I've tried an alternate route that cut out the I70 traffic and keeps you down lower through Virginia and Paw Paw, WV but it can be a hit or miss since it's smaller roads and you can get caught behind a line of cars.

I can't speak to the morning traffic getting into DC on a workday as I've never personally done it, but my fiance has driven out of Reston to go to Morgantown at 5:30am and he says the traffic going the other way (into DC) is a steady stream already.

In March, I would definitely recommend getting to Smoke on the Water, maybe check out the Forks Inn if you decide to stay. The best margaritas and live music in town is always at El Gran. If you're looking for the best locally crafted brew, you can't miss Big Timber.   


There's also  the train depot if you're at all interested. The college campus is very beautiful that time of year, particularly the Halliehurst mansion.  The Gandy Dancer does old school dinner and a show if thats your thing. Check out downtown for a bunch of cute boutique cafe's and stuff.   


For the most part, all of the best things to do in Elkins actually surround Elkins. In the fall, come down for Augusta /The Forest Festival l.

PA might change quick.  Kentucky... eh probably not.  Tennessee, North Carolina.. potentially maybe..

  WV is in the perfect spot to be the cannabis tourism destination for the mid Atlantic states and is only losing market share as time drags on.

&amp;#x200B;

The plan should be:

\- repair infrastructure

\- Promote Tourism

\- Invest heavily in local restaurants - breweries - tourism related businesses

\- Legalize cannabis - use that tax revenue to fight the drug and related issues - fund schools - roads etc.

\- Promote tech - work to ban the uber/lyfts/grub hub/ amazon / facebooks and set up a \`WV can do it!\` attitude toward tech.  Do it better - do it in house.  Stop looking to outside saviors to set up shop here.  Do it yourself.  

\- Invest heavily in local agriculture - be the best - beef, wool, eggs, lamb etc. in mid atlantic

\- run a WV Proud campaign - get some real pride in this state and what it has to offer

1684,1684,7-and-a-switchblade,"Agreed.

I came to Charleston 7 years ago out of circumstance, not because I wanted to.  Before coming here, I associated 3 things with the state: moonshine, drugs, and coal.  To this guy living near Philly, that's all I really knew about WV, so why would I have ever left home?

From this outsider's perspective, if you want people to come to WV, you have to convince them that WV politicians care about anything other than raping their land and people.  I think turning 'moonshine and drugs' into 'beer and weed' is a good place to start.  WV does legit have some good wine and beer, and weed to me is such a no-brainer: get into what is obviously about to be a massive industry early on while painting it as a public health measure, an alternative to meth and percocet.  Tourism would follow shortly after, and the infrastructure for it is already here.  WV has tremendous natural resources.  For now.

The only thing I would add to your list is investment in non-coal energy sources.  WV is a geothermal hot spot, and all the MTR mining has at least made for lots of nice, flat land to put some more wind farms up.  I know that WV loves fellating the coal industry, but my history text books taught me to expect you guys to guillotine the coal magnates, not elect them governor.  We keep pouring money into paying for life support for a moribund industry that is producing less coal despite hiring more people.

The drug epidemics, plus the downturn of coal and the economic recession left much of West Virginia economically depressed.

The people here are either extremely friendly and kind, or wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire. There is no in between.

on that trip that I decided to apply (and was accepted) into a position at a West Virginia summer camp! I am extremely excited, and I am planning on leaving a few weeks early to explore West Virginia. My plan is to travel around the state, sleeping at campgrounds and in my car to save money, and showering at truck stops and at camp grounds. I am looking for suggestions on places to visit (Fallout locations and Historically Significant places, and nature places). I am a history education major, and I am fascinated with West Virginia and it's history. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to revisit some places, but I am really looking for new places to visit and cool historical sites.

 I have visited: Huntington (and the history museum there), Kenova, Point Pleasant, Charleston (but didn't go to the museums),  and New River Gorge.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on revisiting Kenova to talk to Mr. Griffith again, Hillbilly Hot Dogs, revisiting Point Pleasant, and also revisiting Charleston for the museums.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently planning on visiting the Palace of Gold, Beckley, Greenbriar, and Morgantown.

&amp;#x200B;

The summer camp I am going to is on the far eastern part of the state, so I will have the opportunity to explore the entire state almost.

Jobs are around, but unless you are living in one of the few bigger cities you'll probably have a good 30 min or longer drive to get to work. Most of the roads are just horrible from over weight vehicles and absolutely minimal maintenance. Also, At least up north, you'll be battling oil and gas traffic every time you try to go somewhere. Crime is everywhere. (Its mostly drug related.) Education isn't great for several reasons.  (Less pay and benefits than other states so many good teachers leave, drug addicted parents that dont care at all and a legislature that is bent on changing everything even though most of them haven't been in a public school in yrs). The last bigger issue I'd point out is the cost of housing. At least in the northern panhandle, its gone up crazy amounts. (Ex: ten yrs ago guy bought a 1 bed 1 bath house up the street from my parents for 75k Added a 2 car garage and sold it a few months ago for 140k) These and some other issues are why we are leaving WV.

As for closer to parks, I don't know too much about the towns on the way. Davis and Thomas are towns right by BW Falls and they have a couple neat little shops and restaurants. I'm not sure about urgent care nearby. BW Falls actually rents out cabins and so do many other parks. Canaan Valley Resort is nearby as well and has lodging. There's a town called Oakland, Maryland that isn't that far away and it's a really pretty town, but I don't know what all is there.

Overall, I think you're perfectly fine staying in Morgantown and you'll enjoy yourself. But those are the things I know about the area you'll be traveling to in relation to your needs. One thing about Morgantown I would say is that if you are coming while students are still in town (before mid-May or after mid-August), I would stay away from High Street after like 9pm if you have your child with you. It's not dangerous but there will be a lot of kids going out to bars and they can be annoying. I'm 31 and I don't even like to go downtown at night anymore.

For someone with an interest in history, I’d strongly suggest, if you’re in the area, checking out the towns of Davis, Thomas, and Elkins, as well as a +1 for visiting Cass.

This area was originally developed for its timber in the 19th century, and there’s a lot of that history still on the landscape.  Cass, Davis, and Thomas were all once lumber camps.  Cass, in addition to the railroad, has an entire town of restored buildings, including restored company houses that are rented as “cabins” by the state park.  Thomas and Davis still have a good bit of lumber camp feel to them, in addition to a healthy smattering of fun restaurants, shops, bars, breweries, coffee shops, etc as the area has developed for tourism.  The Purple Fiddle is a great music venue in Thomas that pulls acts well above its weight.  

One of my favorite scenic overlooks in the state is located where 219 crests Backbone Mountain just west of Thomas.  You’ll know it by the fuck-off big windmill right by the road.

Elkins was the bigger, more commercial town for the region, where the company headquarters and rich(er) people lived.  A large portion of the town’s Victorian commercial district and houses are still intact, and (much like the tourists in Davis/Thomas) the presence of a college helps breathe life into the town.  Elkins leans pretty heavily into its railroad heritage, and has a pretty cool railroad museum with a great model railroad setup.",1580911840,fglvdea

using the [Dictionary.com](https://Dictionary.com) definition: Representative -  a person chosen or appointed to act or speak for another or others.

In this case, Mr. Manchin was elected by the *Majority* of the population in West Virginia.

Have we already forgotten when Trump called the News Media ""the enemy of the American people"", immediately followed by poison being sent to said stations to ""kill the traitors""

An abc news article from April 2019 stated:

""But a nationwide review conducted by ABC News has identified at least 36 criminal cases where Trump was invoked in direct connection with violent acts, threats of violence or allegations of assault.
In nine cases, perpetrators hailed Trump in the midst or immediate aftermath of physically attacking innocent victims. In another 10 cases, perpetrators cheered or defended Trump while taunting or threatening others. And in another 10 cases, Trump and his rhetoric were cited in court to explain a defendant's violent or threatening behavior.
Seven cases involved violent or threatening acts perpetrated in defiance of Trump, with many of them targeting Trump's allies in Congress. But the vast majority of the cases -- 29 of the 36 -- reflect someone echoing presidential rhetoric, not protesting it.""

Honestly you might be right. And if that’s the case and Joe truly believed in his heart that Trump was guilty.....that judgment alone should be enough for us to vote him out. 

Anyone who sat through that clown show and didn’t come to the conclusion this was a partisan witch hunt based on the flimsiest of public phone calls ever obviously has flawed judgment and shouldn’t be representing people who’s judgment is exactly the opposite.

At this point, the coalfields have had a steady diet of “Republicans want to put you to work, Democrats want to put you on welfare,” coupled with the very real collapse of the coal industry.  It’s been slow-motion dying for decades regardless of who’s in office, but it did, in fact, completely collapse during the Obama administration, just like Fox News said it would.  Everyone knows so many people who have had to pack up and move to North Carolina, usually taking a heavy loss on their house because the real estate market is in free-fall, or, worse, have had to stick it out on some combination of checks and being the 55-year-old dude working at McDonald’s, and that’s IF the heroin or pills don’t get you.

Oh, also, that guy has had a lifetime of both conventional wisdom and lived experience teach him that all “politicians” are complete swindling, criminal greaseballs, but especially the local ones, who have all been Democrats for generations.

Now, give that guy a choice between “We’re going to put you back to work!” and “We’re going to put a lot of miners out of work,” especially if the latter message comes from the Democrats that you’ve been taught have turned their backs on you anyway.  And especially if that particular Democrat is part of the same clan that passed NAFTA and pushed environmentalism to the fore in the first place.

After all that guy’s been through, even if he KNOWS it’s all bullshit, he’s at least going to vote for they guy who makes him feel valued and proud, not like a problem that has to be solved.  (Especially not a problem that has to be solved by teaching his high school graduate class of ‘78 ass to code on the computers he can barely use for $12/hr IF somebody manages to get one of these coding farms off the ground in the first place).  He certainly isn’t tracking in real time production numbers vs. employment stats for central Appalachia and how that may have been affected by tweaking the Clean Water Act.

It also doesn’t help that, starting with my generation, pretty much anyone with the slightest propensity for taking a broader view or seeking out a cosmopolitan understanding of the world has long since moved away, many of us straight out of high school.  Chicken or egg, right?  Either way, it’s a self-reinforcing cycle.

West Virginia's economy has been based on resource extraction of timber and coal and the only infrastructure that is needed for that is railroads to ship it to other parts of the country for export or finished goods.

2472,2472,cwisser,"Why are you attempting to make this a party lines issue? I get it, you think everything is the Democrats fault, but that doesn't make you're debate any more sound. And the discussion is around whether or not protesting should be a felony. 

I've pointed out that in many cases the laws are wrong and the lense of time has shown that the protestors we're right... Hell our own nation was founded by protestors who believed the law was wrong...

I've also pointed out that in many cases the legislators are bought and paid for by lobbiests and the laws written by the interested parties legal team. Something that is well documented and happens frequently.

For these reasons, when corruption is common, and the laws don't protect the people, the people should always be able to slow progress in their best interest through protest without fear of the government using guns against their own citizens.

What is currently being looked at is having a much lighter vehicle (2000 lbs instead of 8000), and a battery powered propulsion system with regenerative breaking (the current power collector is a reliability concern since when they fail they do so with fireworks). Vehicles would charge inductively while dwelling in stations. The interior would obviously be updated to just look better but the overall shape of the car will be the same due to guideway constants. 

Mechanically the parts will be designed to use parts that are widespread and has a healthy aftermarket supply. Vehicle capacity should remain the same but the potential top speed “might” increase (consider it “future proofing”  for expansion). The vehicles will perform exactly the same as the current ones do with any hardware upgrades deemed necessary by the train control vender. Thats pretty much it.

Failure to get a good education so you could provide a better school district for them.

It was also reported that none of the players were involved. They were suspended for leaving the bench while police were wrestling the assistant coach to the ground. And for not returning after the coach removed the whole team to the locker room.  

This sure seem retaliatory due to pressure from the Governor. That type of pressure wouldn't have been present if the coach wasn't the Governor. 

Statement from Woodrow Wilson Principal
&gt;During a timeout taken in the fourth quarter of the game, a WWHS assistant coach approached his administrator and asked the administrator to address an opposing fan who had been using derogatory language and gestures towards him throughout the game.  At no time did the assistant coach enter the stands.  At no time did the assistant coach engage in a physical altercation with the opposing fan.

&gt;During the continued timeout, the referees made the decision to call the game.

But why.. ?.. The seem to have some fore-knowledge that raiding that particular house would be ""worth their time"" (finding guns, testing the urn for drugs, etc). How did they know that ?

If you're ""serving a notice or civil papers"" ,. and you're serving it to a single-mom with 5 kids or some 80yr old widow grandma who uses a walker,... (or to a person who has no criminal record of any kind),.. it makes no sense to raid that house. (it won't be worth your time because your random-chances of finding anything illegal is near 0). Cops might be stupid,. but they're not THAT stupid. You're not going to waste your time raiding a house to find nothing. 

What I'd suspect happened is:

* someone brought a civil suit

* prior to serving the summons,. the Police do a quick search on the Address or Name to see if they're walking into anything dangerous. 

* (for some reason we don't yet know), the Police discovered a history of risk or suspicion about the person or address involved

* so they (stupidly, and illegally, yes) raided the house (breaking laws in the process).

Also ask where you need to bring your trash. When I lived in Pocahontas County I was responsible for bringing it to the dump myself. Here in Hampshire County I just have to get it to the nearest paved road (~2 miles away).

today, the town doesn't just feel empty, it is. it sold its soul in the early 2000s and its never getting it back. 

heroin, meth, prescription drugs, laziness, complacency, and corruption took over and it's here to stay. all the potential this state has is meaningless. and the people in it don't care to make the sacrifices to improve. 

some of us wanted to help and change the state but all attempts to improve just fall on deaf ears. so almost every driven individual has to move away. 

even after i moved to Orlando over 15yrs ago, i still wanted to help restore Charleston and the state. but the more time passed, i realized just how bad things are for the people in the state as a whole. and how much better my time and efforts were spent on other people, places, and things.

Third ward councilman Zachary Cruz says the ordinance really doesn't go far enough. 

Councilman Dave Harshbarger explains that the ordinance does not actually decriminalize marijuana, but rather gives police ""another option at their discretion to issue a lower level penalty"".

This alternative penalty would include zero jail time and a maximum fine of $15 for possession of less than 15 grams.

Councilman Barry Wendall cautioned WVU students about the ordinance. ""If you're a WVU student you could still be arrested by WVU police and sent to magistrate court and you could be jailed for six months and kicked out of school.

2988,2988,BoogerDavisReturns,"KANAWHA COUNTY, W.Va. (WSAZ) -- A Nitro man has been arrested on wanton endangerment charges after an incident with an AK-47 on Tuesday evening.

According to the criminal complaint, Gregory Blaylock, 30, of Nitro, was charged with two counts of wanton endangerment involving a firearm.

The complaint says that police responded to a shots fired call in the 400 block of Main Avenue in Nitro. The suspect was described as ""wearing a flannel shirt and carrying an AR style rifle,"" and was later found on Beech Street. Police ordered the suspect to drop the gun and put his hands in the air.

Police say they then told the suspect, Gregory Blaylock, to get on the ground.Investigators say that's when they found a pistol and additional magazines for the pistol and the rifle.

**According to the complaint, Blaylock told police that he saw people following him, so he fired about 10 shots at them. He also told police that the people following him ""either shattered into a bunch of pieces or turned into trash bags.""**

Officers searched the area and found three AK-47 bullet casings on Blaylock's porch, four bullet holes in the apartment complex's cinder block, two bullet holes in a neighbor's air conditioning unit, two bullet holes in the porch wood, two bullets in a nearby dumpster, and three bullet holes in the Kelly's Hot Spot beside the apartment.

Several bullet casings were also found inside Blaylock's apartment.

The complaint says two people were inside of Kelly's Hot Spot when Blaylock was firing shots.

Blaylock is being held at South Central Regional Jail.",1582141238,fi4hejk

To the folks commenting on how long you have to wait. Yes, you're going to have to wait a while to get reimbursed. This is simply a consequence of how public budgeting works. These kinds of things are considered a Claim Against the State and the Legislature must approve the spending of these funds. This happens only once a year when the Legislature passes the budget for the next fiscal year. Unfortunately that means that anyone who has submitted a claim in the past year (and had their claim approved) will have their money appropriated in the fiscal year 2021 budget. The Legislature will (likely) be passing that budget before the end of the current session (ends March 7th). That budget doesn't go into effect until July 1, 2020. So people who have had a claim approved won't get paid until sometime after that.

3076,3076,chefmarksamson,"Depending on what you’re into, you’ll pass or pass relatively close to Greenbrier Valley Brewing, Smooth Ambler Distilling, and Hawk Knob Ciders (all around Lewisburg-ish), and Weathered Ground Brewing in Cool Ridge.  I’ll also plug Hatfield and McCoy Moonshine in Gilbert: really nice guy, and surprisingly good white whiskey.

You’ll cross the New River Gorge near Beckley; absolutely make time to stop and explore.  You’ll be close to Sandstone Falls and Grandview, and there should (weather depending) be plenty of opportunity for outdoor exploration of all sorts there.  

On a related note, you’ll be passing close to Lost World Caverns, and there’s an exhibition coal mine in Beckley, if you’re into any of that.

The King Tut Drive-In in Beckley is a kinda legendary bit of Americana I highly recommend checking out.  Likewise, if you make the trip up to Logan from Gilbert, check out Morrison’s Drive Inn and the Parkway Drive In.  They have a bit of a cross-town rivalry (even though they now share ownership) over who makes the best slaw-dog (it’s Parkway).

Just down the road from Parkway is Chief Logan State Park, which is a solid option for hiking and mountain biking, as well as having a fishing pond and some sports-y playground-y stuff for kids to do, if that’s a concern.  If you’re looking for a bit more of a lake-y lake, check out R. D. Bailey lake at Justice.

Again, depending on season (I think they’re closed until spring) I’d recommend driving to Matewan to visit the WV Mine Wars Museum.  It’s a fascinating bit of history in a very historically significant little town (they made a movie and everything), plus the drive there on the new section of U.S. 52 (King Coal Highway) provides IMO some of the most breathtaking mountain views in all of the Coalfields.

Again, depending on when you’re going and what you’re into, there’s a ton more stuff to do around Logan and Mingo.",1582311867,fib03f5

3208,3208,wontonstew,"Theosis, like many stricter denominations of christianity can be difficult.  Sometimes while attempting to strive for purity, by human nature can influence you to a position of judgement toward others.  Only you can answer whether some of that is expressed in some of the racist beliefs you may feel.

Family is a gift, but also can bring out the worst in people and limit our growth.  I didn't get treated as an adult until I was moved out and financially independent.  At a certain point we stop growing, and we fall into habits and mediocrity.
 
Video games are great for social interactions when in-person interactions are difficult, but they also come with a price.  It's far easier to blame external cultural beliefs than to recognize that adapting and flourishing in the culture you've been (and are) immersed in is very difficult for you.  A lot of people find gaming online helps ease the pain (misery loves company).  Sometimes though, when you get stuck in a prison without books, just a headphone and microphone to others in the same prison, just other cells...  it can become just an activity to pass the time.

I volunteered at an agency that helped new refugees.  It's been over two years and I can't explain the lasting happiness I felt helping people.  Volunteerism is such a gift, if you have anything where you live.

Have you ever tried Zombies to 5k app on your phone?  There's also a trophy system, and honestly I've done it in the dark and it can be pretty awesome.  You can start by walking.  I'm sure you've heard about studies showing repeated daily exposure of being in the woods help both depression and memory.  Pets can bring pleasure, but again there are limitations.

I'm sure your therapist encourages control of your life, and doing what you want but I would also imagine its through good coping mechanisms and healthy growth.   It would be awesome if in a few months, perhaps a year or so you can look back at a time when you held racist beliefs and your isolation in society as distant history.",1582576197,fio4mld

1. Racism is alive an well. Plenty of stars and bars flying out in the country, on license plates, decals, etc. I feel like I see it more, the more rural I drive. A coworker was recently driving out to look at a property in the low mountains and stumbled across a straight up white supremacy compound of sorts, with a dozen trailers and confederate flags flying. 
2. Yes to all of those. I'm in Fairmont, and opioid abuse is a big problem, and with it comes homelessness and crime (mostly of the break-in type). 

The only other thing I can say is definitely check the soil. On the extreme end, there are entire communities, I believe, that have been razed because of toxic contamination. Otherwise, there's illegal fracking dumping. Seems like if you're going to buy land, you'll need to be on the ground here, or have someone do some due diligence on your behalf. 

If you do move here, please post about it! I'm hoping to buy some land a bit further south in the next couple of years, would love to hear your experience.

1. How bad are we talking? Prejudice is one thing, violence is another. Even if they would not be friendly or welcoming, would anyone black/asian/hispanic be in danger?

Thanks for the headsup. Yeah, unfortunately the internet can only take you so far, hence why I'm posing the question. Nothing like real world experience.

Out in the boonies, there could be some cooking going on. My doctor said he lives way out in the boonies, and he knows there's a meth house past him, even further up the ridge. He said he just keeps his head down.",1582741188,fiugxe6
3252,3252,QuinnSasso,"1. Racism definitely exists all over the state. You'll see a lot of confederate flags/Trump signs and what not. But that's the extent of it. Everyone keeps to themselves and minds their business. If you're in a super-remote part of the state you'll never see anybody unless you're out driving to nearest store or whatever. I'm from the Eastern panhandle and there is a large presence of latino and black people. It's not all hillbillies like the stereotypes make you believe. In short I'd say your friends are not in any danger, relative to anywhere else in the country. 
2. Opiod abuse is rampant. If you're from TN then it's going to be similar.  Honestly you'll see the worst effects of it in towns and cities, not in rural areas. In my first 17 years living there, someone smashed our car windows looking for valuables once. The state has a high poverty rate so you'll see a lot of that. Again, similar to TN.
3. Building codes exist but are not enforced in rural areas. Zoning laws are lacking. You'll see strip clubs next to elementary schools. Wild and wonderful. 
4. Where I'm from the soil is all clay. Can't speak for rest of state, but we grew vegetables in raised beds with a mix of topsoil, compost/chicken shit. Takes work but worth it imo. 
5. Honestly the state is an undiscovered gem. No one wants to go there because of its seemingly bad reputation, but there are so few people that live there that you can exist unbothered for as long as you want.

1. How's racism in the rural areas? I'm not talking about the big cities, I'm looking to live very rurally and offgrid, probably up in the mountains. I have people coming with me who are not white. Will this be an issue?

Racism is a massive problem in WV, in cities and in rural areas.  I grew up in WV and have since moved to cities and I am well and truly shocked when I return to WV.   WV is, I think, either the first or second whitest state in the US.  

1. What other issues might I run into in rural, remote, isolated places? Opiod abuse? High crime or poverty rates?

Opoid abuse is worse in southern WV but exists everywhere.  Poverty is very high.  Crime is comparatively low.

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are the building codes like in rural areas? Strict? Nonexistent?

Depends on county.  But often close to nonexistant.

1. Bonus question for anyone that knows the answer: How's the soil quality, particularly in the mountains? I'm from East TN, and the thing preventing me from moving back there is the leached out, acidic soils making it impossible to grow anything useful without industrial/chemical inputs. That being said, does anyone know if WV mountain soils suffer from the same problem?

Will vary by location.  My family grew up farming tobacco, corn, and potatoes and the soil was fine for that.   Best farmland is bottomland and it can be difficult to farm in the hills.

1. Anything else I should know or be aware of?

I hoped I didn't paint too dire a picture.

I will be retiring back to WV in the next few years so, obviously, I don't think it is that bad.  But I am a white guy who hunts and drives ATVs and likes to shoot guns so I will probably blend in better.

If you are a good neighbor and ""don't think you are better than anyone else"" you will probably eventually be accepted.",1582743709,fiulkfk

1) WV is probably the least racist State I have lived in. McDowell County, very remote, rural is 40% African American. It is one of the most politically incorrect States though but there is no underlying malice. Just ball busting. Opiods are bad everywhere but violence is very very rare in WV and is almost always between people who know one another. Check out areas around Cannaan Valley. Very trendy, progressive, remote. Non existent building codes if you are on your own property.  Rich soil.  WV is essentially a giant forest. The northern half of the State is VERY VERY Italian.",1582744208,fiumh01

3271,3271,MarkJ-,"Ya know, anymore I am not sure how to answer. I reckon it depends on the specific neighborhood/holler.

While there is some prejudice there is also a very strong streak of live and let live. Everyone knows your business but they seldom, if ever, get in your business.

My own semi rural neighborhood has a mixed race couple and a gay family, while you will hear a slur now and then for the most part it is treated as no more than a novelty or used as a land mark. --""2 houses down from the queers"".   And just up the road is a 3 percenter fool who flies the confederate battle flag.  We have some  trumpers, a few liberals, an ammosexual or 3, couple of longhaired country boys, older church folks,...  When you think about it we are pretty cosmopolitan. lol

Outside of urban areas building codes are lax at best, though lately in my own county the tax assessor has become aggressive. If you build it, they will tax it. 

Any Opoid use is kept on the down low, any trouble from that seems to come from outside my neighborhood.  Call it, every 3 years or so, there will be some petty theft or a break in or 2. Dogs will keep that to a minimum.

My problem is, the IT department of the company I work for seems to be a couple of idiots. And if anyone inputs time in 2 different timezones, it breaks our timecards with overlaps. Example:

I am going to Texas on the 8th. If i input my travel time on the 8th as EST, and then my locations are central, all my times entered for EST will overlap with the central timezones. Even though theyre on different days.

the economy in WV is absolute crap. it never even follows the national economy, it's just always crap.

Everyone smokes cigs, and inside their homes at that.

Its a horribly corrupt state. the 1% control absolutely everything and do not care about you. 

the people are generally standoffish and you can find a fight anywhere and not on purpose. 

there is hardly anything to do and there are weeks on end where you are just not going to see the sun at all. hope you like they color grey.

and to answer your first question, the town i came from was a big one. well, big for that state anyway.

Morgantown police officers lead the investigation with the assistance of WVU police.

It’s the second shooting in Morgantown in as many days; A WVU student was murdered Friday morning at the university-operated College Park apartment complex. Two non-students face attempted murder charges in connection to that shooting.",1582982831,fj3ghzy

The post you replied to literally says “I said....” What world are you living in? That was my interpretation of what you said. I asked if you agreed or disagreed.  Instead, You called me a troll. 😢

Airport - SUCKS, sucks, sucks.  Worst part of living here.  A flight to anywhere will cost double what it costs in other places and take all day, due to the “hub and spoke” system.  

Schools - Vary.  If rich enough, live in South Hills neighborhood of Charleston, where the schools are awesome.  The rest of the county ranges from mediocre to dysfunctional.  If you cannot afford that, and have kids, live in Putnam County, which has great schools.  

Things to do - depends on what you like.  Post some things you are into and I’m sure people will fill it in.  A more diverse community than you probably believe it is.  If you are into the outdoors, you can be in the real woods in a few minutes.

Housing - Affordable and varied, especially if the school district does not matter.  

COL -  A little below average.  While any one tax is not that high, the state or a sub-division taxes EVERYTHING in some way, so it all adds up to pretty high overall.

4039,4039,IgnoreMe304,"&gt;At the very beginning of the new play “Coal Country,” we are told it is “a West Virginia story about 29 men and a big machine.” This is an understated way to inform the audience that what follows will be devastating.

&gt;That story is true, and it happened in 2010, when those men all died in a devastating mining disaster. We learn a few things about some of the victims: that Cory was 5 when his dad took him out to shoot his first deer, and that Greg had been Patti’s neighbor for 22 years before he asked her out.

&gt;But really, we don’t know all that much about those folks because the show is about the ones who were left behind: It’s Cory’s father, Tommy (Michael Laurence), who recounts that hunt, and it’s Patti (Mary Bacon) who talks about Greg’s courtship. Memories and grief are what they have now.

&gt;Anger, too. Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen’s “Coal Country,” with live music by the rootsy singer-songwriter Steve Earle, is also about why what happened at the Upper Big Branch mine can be called a tragedy, but it can’t be called an accident. A terrible twist of fate defines an accident. What happened at U.B.B., as everybody calls it, was precipitated by greed and cost-saving negligence — embodied by Don Blankenship, the chief executive of the company that owned the mine, and whose trial figures in the show. Conditions had gotten so bad that months before the explosion, an experienced miner named Goose (Michael Gaston) had told his wife, Mindi (Amelia Campbell), that U.B.B. was “a ticking time bomb.”

4060,4060,SumHighFalls,"This is just some thinking through the practicalities of this issue in the current National political context and the snap judgments people make about issues.

I wonder if people who have not experienced this issue would react differently to framing it as “unpolluted water” instead of “clean water.”

I think it should be self-evident on its face that the desperate need for “clean water” exists because one or more entities negatively altered the water.  But, I wonder if “clean water” has a connotation of people asking or expecting someone (usually taxpayers) to solve their problems.  ‘They want us to come in and clean their water for them.’  Maybe it creates a mental distancing from the fact that, whether legally or illegally, someone polluted this natural resource to the detriment of hundreds of thousands of people.  

Federal, State, and local governments either were complicit in making this pollution legally permissible or by failing to hold accountable those who violated laws when polluting water sources.  Accordingly, these governments bear responsibility for remediation so that the water no longer is polluted.  And, these governments should have the authority and responsibility to recoup these costs from those who polluted the water.  

If there is a question as to why taxpayers should bear, even temporarily, the cost of remediation, one answer is that it is a shared cost resulting from taxpayers permitting or encouraging ‘shortchanging’ environmental regulation and enforcement in the past.  Another answer is that allowing entities to pollute water in ‘Coal Country’ essentially made energy prices artificially low by making the ‘Coal Country’ residents bear the environmental costs.  This cost-shifting ultimately equated to ‘Coal Country’ residents subsidizing energy prices for consumers.  In the absence of a better system for tracing who benefitted from the costs avoided by polluting waters, it is logical for consumers to repay that subsidy via taxpayer-funded services to stop and remove the pollution of water sources.

To me, it’s not just semantics, it’s the need to accurately describe the problem and identify its causes.  No offense to owners of beachfront property, but this is not a case of people engaging in risky behavior, like buying property in the path of hurricanes and flooding, then looking to the government (and other taxpayers) to bail them out when the inevitable storm hits.  This is a case where residents lives and homesteads are at risk because entities were allowed to pollute natural resources.

It seems to me that some Americans hear or read “Clean Water” and make the mental leap to the “Clean Water Act” as a regulatory effort.  These tend to be the same Americans who have an aversion to regulation.  This issue isn’t the people of ‘Coal Country’ looking to someone else to make things easier for them or solve problems they created.  It’s more like “you broke it (or let someone break it on your watch), you fix it.”",1583681415,fjxr6zy
4061,4061,SumHighFalls,"I would have preferred more aggressive environmental enforcement during the Obama administration.  As it was, though, the very people the administration sought to benefit or protect responded with a backlash against Obama and Democrat candidates for office.  He also faced Legislative and Judicial branches stacked in opposition to regulation and enforcement of environmental standards.  

It’s possible that, in the political climate, the Obama administration took what it could get from negotiating with violators to achieve some sort of resolution, rather than letting things drag on through quasi-judicial executive branch processes and then through the judicial system.",1583681919,fjxrxhe

4190,4190,doubledYou,"I will say from experience that this bill faced some legislative hurdles from the start. 

It was introduced halfway through the session and passed the Senate unanimously on crossover day (ie, the last day it could possibly leave the senate with enough time to gain passage in the House). That leaves pretty much **no** wiggle room for any setbacks in the House. The House took it up for immediate consideration, too, which suggests it was generally willing to move forward with the idea in theory. 

Ultimately, for a large bill such as this, some set backs *have* to be expected and accounted for in the timing of the legislation. The late introduction date suggests either: (1) this legislation was conceived and drafted *far* too late in the process; (2) the lobbyist did a poor job greasing the wheels and introducing the bill; or (3) this bill was a relative low priority for the medical marijuana lobby.

Given the breadth of the bill, I suggest the first option was ultimately it’s downfall.

CONS: Drugs and everything they bring (especially theft), lack of well-paying jobs, lots of newcomers have trouble making friends, the political situation (conservative) can be uncomfortable to those from more progressive areas  

The people who move to WV and thrive do so because they got involved (church, Kiwanis, D&amp;D at the hobby shop, etc) and because they didn't resist adjusting (or at least tolerating) the culture. The people who stay for a year or two then move on just I feel didn't try. Granted, many tried but they would try once or twice then give up.

4243,4243,LittleSpiderGirl,"Okay.  I was just wondering because generally speaking, WV doesn't have a lot of jobs.  But there is a need in the professions and that is because many young people who go out of state for a degree never return.

Given the fact that fracking is running rampant in WV, I have to wonder just what the heck you would be doing?  There's a modicum of sarcasm in this thought, but I also wonder what kind of professional frustration you would experience.  

I am 62 years old and left WV nine months ago.  My 31 year old son left 2.5 years ago.  Neither of us have plans to return.  I miss friends and coworkers, all the wonderful people who stood by me when I lost my husband.  

But the state is awash in an opioid crisis.  My own home was burglarized three times by 15 year olds who were already professional criminals.  Law enforcement are overworked, understaffed and burn out is unreal.  Cops shrug their shoulders, apologize, and tell you to get a home security system.  

I lived in one of the larger cities with a user fee (additional tax) but the roads were a joke with axle breaking potholes, the streets were full of trash and weeds, and boarded up storefronts and abandoned houses were de rigeur.  If you like honky tonk bars and going to the movies, you'll have something to do.  Otherwise there is little in the way of cultural events.  State and local politics everywhere are governed by Bible belt thinking.  There's a lot of covert racism.  Confederate flags on bumper stickers.  People talk about immigrants taking jobs but there are practically no immigrants around.

I could go on.  And on.  No where is perfect.  WV is beautiful geographically.  The people can be wonderful, but mostly to their own.  It's my home and always will be. But I wouldn't recommend it.  Somebody there has my late husband's wedding ring that they bought in a pawn shop after it was hawked.

The first thing you will notice are the road conditions. Coming from VA (and a short stint in IL) the roads of WV are crazier than ever and so much worse than VA. 

Pot holes have pot holes and your vehicle will feel their wrath. Interstates are ""ok"" for the most part but unless you buy a house right next to one, you will find yourself traveling on our secondary roads.

4257,4257,ohmicorazoninwv,"Hi there. I’ve lived in WV now since 2012. I initially
Moved from the Midwest, and landed in Elkins, WV which was an absolute culture shock. I was raised in Kansas City, and just was not prepared for the change and living in a small,
Isolated town. It’s gone down hill since I was there, as mentioned above, due to the large opioid epidemic the state has endured.
Also people in WV are poor. I mostly
Worked with individuals who were not from the state of WV, but loved Elkins, and were committed to making it a great place and destination, so my interactions were not with locals. Also, remember this is the mountain state, and We literally had six feet of snow from about November to March. If you’re into the outdoors, a town like may be ideal for you, as it’s in the Allegheny mountains and close to hip towns like David  and Thomas, WV. Lots of skiing and hiking and beautiful country. I would I would take a road trip and check out the towns where the jobs are posted. You need to do this. Some areas are remote. In Elkins, you are literally over half an hour from the closest interstate on ramp. The towns are small and you are not going to have the choice of coffee shops, stores, etc. in most places in the state, unless you are in Morgantown. I live in wheeling now, but have lived in Morgantown and Elkins. Things like good Asian food and indian food don’t exist here. We he one is mostly white, except maybe in Morgantown. Morgantown was my favorite, just a fun city to live in and a mix of locals who are from there, and college kids who stuck around. If you’re liberal, it’s a nice place to be. Remember this is a very red state,
You may have a hard time finding people who share your beliefs, this is trump country. The people are nice, but very religious and the person who said “Bible Belt mentality” is mostly 100% correct except maybe in Morgantown. Be prepared for this. Even in wheeling, everyone goes to Pittsburgh for everything because there is nothing to do here and we are not close enough really to take advantage of outdoor recreation opportunities like in some other parts of the state for a day. I have enjoyed living here for the most part, but I personally want to leave the state as soon as we can due to the education system being poor, lots of drugs, poverty, ignorant people, lack of services and good high paying jobs, lots of cancer and  health problems, and would just feel better raising my child in a more progressive area",1583937922,fk7jt6a

4263,4263,Broman3am,"We transplanted here to WV (Wet Virginia) and have enjoyed it immensely minus all the rain. Lol. Yes, there are dope heads that look for opportunities to steal stuff, but I’ve found that my neighbors look out for me.  My hallow where I own property is protected by a number of good neighbors. That is hard to find in many places.  I’ve lived a half a dozen states along with multiple foreign country trips and I’m convinced these really are the salt of the earth people here in this state. I love them. 
I’ve also come to love the outdoors here. There is hunting, fishing including trout, atv trails that you can stay a week camping/riding new trails, creeks galore, lots of twisty roads if you are a biker, waterfalls, scenic hikes, spelunking, rafting/kayaking, aviation, mountains, FREEDOM and not a heavily populated state. Oh and just for you—NO GATORS!  Lol. 
I wish there were an initiative to maintain the roads better and bring more industry here. I would def vote for that candidate.  I also would like to see them improve property (vehicle) tax laws. Those just suck. 
Overall though, this state is one of the best kept secrets and I hope you come to enjoy it as much as I have. Nothing like sitting on the front porch with a glass of tea listening to the mocking birds/song birds prepare for the night as the whippoorwills say good night to the dusk lit woods.

4268,4268,BeerMantis,"Saw on down in the comments that your career field is environmental engineering.  Working in engineering will somewhat limit where you live, based on where the jobs are - small town WV (or anywhere) doesn't tend to have tons of engineering jobs.  So you'll be in a larger population center, Charleston (most likely), Huntington, Morgantown, etc.  I am a civil engineer, I grew up in the southern part of WV but now live outside of Charleston.

You didn't really mention what you enjoy doing with your life.  You work your 40 hours, but how do you like to spend the other roughly 70 waking hours each week?

What's to like here?  Well, do you like the outdoors?  We've got more of that than you'll have time to enjoy your entire life.  Hunting, fishing, hiking, kayaking, rafting, biking, climbing, camping, skiing.  Stuff tends to be cheap here, compared to other places.  There's good food, but someone who's looking will find that anywhere in America (if you move here, come back and ask about food specific to the place you end up).  If you like history, ours is rich and unique.  Though we've often been a little behind, we're catching up quick, and many of the amenities you'd find in more populous places have now reached us here.  We're well located, a reasonable drive from DC, the Carolinas, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Louisville, even the farther midwest cities and the northeast aren't out of reach for an overnight trip.  From Charleston, I can (and have) done the Columbus Zoo as a day trip.

What's not to like?  Well there's a drug problem.  But anywhere that struggles with unemployment and poverty experiences this.  That sort of stuff will come and go.  There aren't a ton of jobs, but certain fields always seem to present opportunities.  We don't have a lot in the way of public transit, we tend to be drivers in this state.  America's obesity epidemic is on full display here (another symptom of economic issues).  Lots of mentions of the road conditions, but the roads are crap all over America - people either complain about road conditions, or they complain about construction zones.

I have seen every region of this state traveling for work and pleasure.  There is no doubt in my mind that if one part of the state catches your eye, you could make it anywhere in the state that you could find a job - I could find fun things to do, good food to eat, cold beer to drink, and friends to be made from Bluefield to Wheeling to Charles Town and everywhere between.

It will pretty much ONLY be those who live and/or work there full time that come back. Everybody else is going to stay home. 

Short of completely quarantining the town, you're never going to completely prevent any chance of somebody spreading the virus there, but cancelling classes for a week and moving to online only after that is going to be a big help in at least limiting it.

4516,4516,EraDarby,"I wouldn't be surprised if on the test triage with the CDC we're in last place.

West Virginia is one of the most homogeneous states in the country and we come in last with tourism. We have no international airports. We have one of the most insular populations in the country and don't have any major industries that attract migratory work.

Simply put, we are, by far, the state *least* likely to be affected by a global pandemic. Not that we can't be affected, but that we are likely to be the last and the least affected and there is no reason the CDC doesn't recognize that. That's why we only received one test kit.

It's a good thing we have our own testing capability, however. I'm willing to bet the reason we had such long delays for our previous tests is because we are the CDC's last priority.

We can't depend on the CDC to address the pandemic in our borders.

Fortunately, everyone so far has come back negative, and since we have only been testing the worst cases... I think it's fair we don't yet have endemic community spread. It is here, but it's not everywhere yet.

Despite the state's poor availability of resources, it seems like the powers that be in our state, public and private, have recognized that Coronavirus is going to come and *will* spread in our community. There is no denial here, just an unfortunate lack of testing. That fact that West Virginia isn't denying the possibility of community spread and implementing social distancing is a very powerful thing. The state government and local health authorities have been meeting and planning for weeks now. we have a centralized effort not built on fragile egos.

Ironically, West Virginia is the best state to ride out a pandemic despite our lack of money and goods - and despite the fact we are the oldest state in the nation with very high commodities.

We have the benefit of a slower spread and the retrospect of worse hit communities working in our favor. We see what hasn't worked and we see what actions they've taken to stall the spread... and we're doing it *before* the virus is endemic in our area.

For once being a West Virginian is at our advantage. We have seen the harbinger of doom and acted accordingly. We live under Mothman protocols now.",1584121736,fkevtu5

Yes, it's a serious situation and it needs to be taken seriously, but it is not doomsday. You do not need months worth of supplies (like a closet full of toilet paper) in your house. Maybe a couple of weeks worth of food if the government does decide to implement a mandatory quarantine. Even if they do that though, they're not going to leave people for weeks without any way to get food/water unless their plan to fight the virus is by letting everyone starve to death. 

Frankly, for most of the population, even if you get it it's going to cause you a minor cold. If you're not immune compromised, your biggest worry is spreading it to someone who is. Just wash your hands, don't touch your face, cover your mouth when you cough, and stay home if you're sick.

Think of a Pigouvian tax then convert tax into an all-out prevention of sale. Because in this case you cannot tax the sellers you must add a barrier-of-entry to the marketplace. 

While I am a conservative republican, my vote tends to gravitate towards what is economically best. I believe that this is a case where certain buyers in the marketplace are removed from that marketplace. Like monopolies, if a few people remove the ability for natural competition then they can set prices above market value. This creates a shortage. Look outside for proof. 

The only time that I believe that the government should get involved (this is where the rest of you probably disagree with me) is when external forces stall competitive returns to the equilibrium.  Regulation is a great tool to prevent unfair trade, but when it removes competitive advantage, i.e. benefits of economies of scale, then it overreaches its benefits and becomes a strain on the marketplace and must be limited itself.

The way markets get out of equilibrium is when the government gets involved.

Increases in prices (due to increase demand) are the market returning to equilibrium.

4968,4968,badkarmavenger,"Pigou postulated that market needs and social need do *sometimes* differ. I believe that in most cases you are correct. People/individuals will sometimes use their buying power and attempt to circumvent market equilibria. Sometimes governments can cut these people off before they create market shortages. In most cases governments make a total mess of this, but here I believe that banning profiteering in a crisis is a good thing.",1584334205,fkmo1ic

3/15/20 - Statement from the Mayor Jim Auxer:

This statement is to address the current rumor of the confirmed case of Covid-19 and the possibility of two others in Shepherdstown community. I spoke with Dr. Reidy at 2:55 p.m. Sunday, March 15, 2020, Health Officer of the Jefferson County Health Department, who stated the Jefferson Health Department is unaware of any any positive cases of the Covid-19 virus in not only Jefferson County, but in West Virginia. 
Dr. Reidy reported that the Jefferson County Health Department will notify the Corporation of Shepherdstown if an active case is confirmed.

The Shepherdstown community will be provided with information as we receive it. Please be mindful of the seriousness of this crisis. Please take care of your neighbors and support the local business community. We need to come together for the common good.

5043,5043,lizzitron,"Here’s some advice from experts in Washington state that I found useful and have tried to share:

Coronavirus Pep Talk!  It’s hard to strike the balance between freaking out and under-reacting.  It may help to remember a few things:

1.	⁠Public Health and your personal health are not the same thing. The health of individuals and the health of the population are connected, obviously, but the focus matters.  The response to coronavirus (covid-19) in King County is a public health response.  The goal is to protect the community as a whole.  Your role as an individual is to do your small part to cooperate in the larger project, for the good of the whole community. Think of it as part of your civic duty. A war effort without the war.
2.	⁠As an individual, you don’t have to be any more scared of this new virus than you were of the viruses you already knew about.  If your immune system is not compromised, if you do not have a health condition that puts you at risk, if you are not part of a particularly vulnerable group, then you are probably going to be fine. If, on the other hand, you are already at greater than average risk from something like the flu, then this virus is probably also more dangerous for you.
3.	⁠If you are individually at risk, the recommendations for you – stay home; avoid large gatherings; vigilant handwashing – are to protect yourself from getting sick.
4.	⁠For the rest of us who are not worried about getting sick: your individual risk of getting sick is not the point. The point of “social distancing” (work from home if you can; stay off public transit, especially at busy times; don’t hold large gatherings) is to slow down the rate of transmission of the virus in the general public. We know the covid-19 virus is circulating in Washington State. We can assume lots of people have been and will be exposed to it.  Every time you get on a bus or go to a meeting, you increase the odds that the virus gets passed from one person to another.  Again: it’s not about preventing you from getting sick.  It is about giving covid-19 fewer opportunities to multiply.
5.	⁠So, if this virus is already out there, and most people who get it have mild symptoms, why does it matter if it spreads slowly or quickly?  For one thing, if fewer people get sick then fewer people will get dangerously sick, and then even fewer people will die. Second, slowing it down buys time, and time really matters, especially at this early point in this outbreak. Remember that this virus is brand new in humans. There is no vaccine. There is no treatment. There is no natural immunity in anybody in the population. There is still a lot we don’t know about exactly how it moves and what it does. Buying time means delaying a massive outbreak until we are closer to having effective treatment and closer to having a vaccine. Buying time means avoiding massive stress on the health care system that could affect many more people with all kinds of health needs. Buying time might mean that some natural immunity builds up – people who have been exposed this year might be less vulnerable next year.
6.	⁠For most of us, this is serious, but not dangerous. Your role is critical because protecting public health is a group effort that takes massive cooperation. The way you think about this and talk to others about it can either encourage or discourage cooperation. Please try to encourage each other. Find a source of information you can trust. Ask questions. Listen to science. Use common sense and compassion. Don’t let fear make you cynical. Don’t let cynicism numb your sense of responsibility to other people. Stay connected, just not too close. Hang in there. Wash your hands.",1584411245,fkpixs6

5061,5061,lizzitron,"This title is spot on. I’d add that the healthcare “system” in WV may become overwhelmed quickly. 

Here’s some advice from experts in Washington state that I found useful:

Coronavirus Pep Talk!  It’s hard to strike the balance between freaking out and under-reacting.  It may help to remember a few things:

1.	⁠Public Health and your personal health are not the same thing. The health of individuals and the health of the population are connected, obviously, but the focus matters.  The response to coronavirus (covid-19) in King County is a public health response.  The goal is to protect the community as a whole.  Your role as an individual is to do your small part to cooperate in the larger project, for the good of the whole community. Think of it as part of your civic duty. A war effort without the war.
2.	⁠As an individual, you don’t have to be any more scared of this new virus than you were of the viruses you already knew about.  If your immune system is not compromised, if you do not have a health condition that puts you at risk, if you are not part of a particularly vulnerable group, then you are probably going to be fine. If, on the other hand, you are already at greater than average risk from something like the flu, then this virus is probably also more dangerous for you.
3.	⁠If you are individually at risk, the recommendations for you – stay home; avoid large gatherings; vigilant handwashing – are to protect yourself from getting sick.
4.	⁠For the rest of us who are not worried about getting sick: your individual risk of getting sick is not the point. The point of “social distancing” (work from home if you can; stay off public transit, especially at busy times; don’t hold large gatherings) is to slow down the rate of transmission of the virus in the general public. We know the covid-19 virus is circulating in Washington State. We can assume lots of people have been and will be exposed to it.  Every time you get on a bus or go to a meeting, you increase the odds that the virus gets passed from one person to another.  Again: it’s not about preventing you from getting sick.  It is about giving covid-19 fewer opportunities to multiply.
5.	⁠So, if this virus is already out there, and most people who get it have mild symptoms, why does it matter if it spreads slowly or quickly?  For one thing, if fewer people get sick then fewer people will get dangerously sick, and then even fewer people will die. Second, slowing it down buys time, and time really matters, especially at this early point in this outbreak. Remember that this virus is brand new in humans. There is no vaccine. There is no treatment. There is no natural immunity in anybody in the population. There is still a lot we don’t know about exactly how it moves and what it does. Buying time means delaying a massive outbreak until we are closer to having effective treatment and closer to having a vaccine. Buying time means avoiding massive stress on the health care system that could affect many more people with all kinds of health needs. Buying time might mean that some natural immunity builds up – people who have been exposed this year might be less vulnerable next year.
6.	⁠For most of us, this is serious, but not dangerous. Your role is critical because protecting public health is a group effort that takes massive cooperation. The way you think about this and talk to others about it can either encourage or discourage cooperation. Please try to encourage each other. Find a source of information you can trust. Ask questions. Listen to science. Use common sense and compassion. Don’t let fear make you cynical. Don’t let cynicism numb your sense of responsibility to other people. Stay connected, just not too close. Hang in there. Wash your hands.",1584448460,fkqk67i

We may have a lack of supplies, but our state is taking this *very* seriously and has been for weeks. That's in start contrast to other states. I think we might even be taking the most proactive approach of all the states or very close to it. I'm not even hearing politicians and companies getting into fights about it (I'm sure they are, but publicly not so much).

Combined with our geographical and community factors of isolation... we have a head start advantage almost no other state has. And we have used that advantage to our benefit.

However, we have tested 80 people... and we have a test kit capable of testing only 400-500 specimens. It takes each person 2-20 times for their specimen to be tested. I think we already ran out of tests - and that's why we haven't gotten new numbers in a day.

Simply put, the CDC does not prioritize sending us tests. Until there are more private tests, we are waiting with bated breath.

I suppose it's fortunate that we have so many negative tests. Since we only tested people in the most vulnerable criteria, it's possible our community spread isn't serious yet and we might be able to contain it to clusters and reduce catastrophic numbers.

There is a very real possibility that West Virginia might make it out of this with the best numbers in the country. However, if we don't, I don't think we'll have even close to the worst numbers in the country per capita. I think we were too proactive with social distancing for that to be true.

Our biggest problem right now is sick workers and high grocery store occupancy. I'd like to see a system where the elderly shop first and we reduce entrance to loyalty card number or street number by day. We also could also simply not let in more than a few people at a time and everyone else has to wait in their cars until it's their turn.

With the asymptomatic nature as well though, I'd expect faster growth for a while until people start isolating themselves. Not knowing the geography of WV personally, perhaps the situation in Oklahoma is representative of what to expect. First case found on Friday, up to 7 on Sunday and now up to 19. That's closer to 90% growth. 

These numbers are dependent, amongst other things, upon how many tests are being performed along with how well people/businesses/government follow best practices. Hope I'm not causing alarm, but thought I'd share as I'm in an area that's been dealing with this for a month or more now. 

Btw, as I notice that many people need to share why it's important to take action with loved ones especially older folks, other examples of exponential growth occur with fire, cancer and mold. All are easier to extinguish, treat or remove earlier, before they get out of control.",1584490464,fkshw8s

It's borderline wasteful to have an entire group of people dedicated to a single job they'll likely never have to do, and it's just bad luck the team was disbanded so shortly before the outbreak. You can disagree with me on that but that's just me explaining the logic behind the decision. By the way, the idea that Republicans have called it a hoax is extremely misleading. President Trump has not said COVID-19 is not real. As far as I'm aware, nobody has said it isn't real, just that it isn't as much of a threat as people (particularly the MSM) have made it out to be. Whether that's true or not is a moot point, and given that the necessary precautions are being taken, it doesn't really matter because the goal is to prevent further spread of the virus.

What strikes me is that you're willing to ignore the fact that Dems wanted to _keep borders open during a growing pandemic_ , all while trying to support their agenda that the GOP is racist.

Many WV border county residents cross over the border on a weekly or even daily basis, especially in the panhandles.

To get from Weirton  WV to Morgantown WV, one drives through rural PA to get to I-79 south (through counties that all have reported cases at this point).  To get from Wheeling WV to Parkersburg WV (or Charleston WV) one usually drive FIFTY MILES DEEP  west into Ohio on I-70 before catching I-77 south and driving ANOTHER 40 MILES through Ohio before crossing back into WV at Marietta.

Before: (1) know what a pepperoni roll is, and know some people are super picky if it has cheese or not; (2) learn “County Roads;” and (3) know that people are not necessarily welcome to outsiders, but if you show you’re a decent an honest person, people will welcome you with open arms. 

After: (1) go to all the small town festivals (e.g. Mothman, roadkill, buckwheat, etc;) (2) travel around the state and talk to people. WV, while small is like three different states;  and (3) get involved in your local town, everyone knows everyone. You will be asked later in life once you travel and people learn you live in WV where, and if you know X. 

Also as a personal request: Addiction runs rampant throughout our state. It is easy to hate those effected by this disease. Just always remember they are our neighbors and it takes a full community effort to help these people. No one as a child says they want to be an addict when they grow up.",1584740775,fl21e9z

I haven’t lived in Charleston, but can see some similarities between the two towns.  Charleston isn’t dominated by the presence of a University the size of UT, but it is the State Capitol.  The two probably each cast a similar-sized influence on the town, just with largely different groups (students vs. government employees and lobbyists).

Both are fortunate to have massive riverfronts that have been home to industry, but are being utilized for their scenery.  I don’t recall any equivalent to Calhoun’s in Charleston (but the idea of having a boat and taking it to a restaurant seemed pretty cool to me).

Most people have not changed their lives that much but I am seeing fewer people over 60/70 getting out. Dr appointments are being rescheduled and that's giving them fewer reasons to leave home, which is good but its concerning too. Bright side is that their generation has gone through a lot. They always stay prepared for the worst. Many of them I've talked to have, and always have had, a few weeks supply of canned food and staples.

Secondly, having a reporter dedicate time to political correctness when there's a huge pandemic going on that needs everyone's full attention is very much out of line.  I'm just saying, she could have addressed it later after all of this is over instead of bringing it up when our attention needs to be on important things, such as keeping people alive.

6038,6038,SumHighFalls,"I wouldn’t use “redneck” as a synonym for “hillbilly.”  They’re not the same and they weren’t used interchangeably when I was growing up in WV.  

I’ve lived in places where “redneck” is a common term.  The people to whom it applies (or who use it to refer to themselves) wouldn’t be considered “hillbillies.”  

Speaking only for myself, “redneck” has more a racist connotation to me.  WV has a complicated status as a border state that stayed with the Union (and dropped the other Virginia), mid-Atlantic State, and in some ways the Northern-most Southern State and Southern-most Northern State.

Hillbilly and mountaineer (regardless of whether a WVU alum) are the terms I heard most often.  Sometimes heard Mountain folks, and country (or country boy / country girl).

“Hick” was used sometimes, generally pejoratively.

Many people in GenX have reclaimed “hillbilly” as a positive term.  Baby boomers from WV are mixed on the term.  I know some who hate it, and who hate that others self-identify as “hillbilly.”  They grew up with it as a teen outsiders used to look down on WV and its people.

Frankly, I’m still so peeved by JD Vance’s appropriation of “hillbilly” that I bristle a little at the thought of someone searching for terms to use in a book, even fiction.  Not doubting your intentions or skill, just have seen WV and Appalachia mined for stories told from imagination but taken as real.  It sounds like yours is a labor of love for your adopted State and that you’re trying to get it right and be authentic.

A Hillbilly would be someone who enjoys the simpler things in life and would live off grid by themselves or with their close family and friends (a lot of times because they do live below the poverty line, not always). A hillbilly is more old school. Also hillbilly is pretty Appalachian specific. 

Rednecks can be found all through Southestern America and it’s more of a modern descriptor, almost like a brand. It’s like what your interests are, how you dress, your worldview is what makes you a redneck. Specifically with WV rednecks, I think of people decked out in camo, boots and jeans hanging out in a Walmart parking lot blasting country music.

- mountaineer would be a safe choice (it’s really one of the only descriptors for all WVians)

And is similar to 'hick', also an insult -- both redneck &amp; hick mean backward &amp; ignorant, hick is more Appalachia specific.  Hick is short for 'wood hick' which originally referred to loggers &amp; those who worked in the woods in the early days of the lumber industry.

In all seriousness this is a pandemic for a reason. That is not something 'leftists' or 'righties' did. This is incredibly infectious and sinister in the fact you can have it and be asymptomatic meaning it can spread quickly.

Recent trends have also shown that it can be fairly deadly to young people and people in good health. These are the exceptions to the norm but you can read articles online of how the Coronavirus has wrecked healthy people.  Going about doing your daily business is problematic especially if you have the virus and are asymptomatic. People not listening and going out will spread the virus and keep it going. Maybe you didn't care if you got it, but consider who you may unwillingly give it to. 

What do you intend the democrats to pay for? Advocating a relief bill that supports employees and not Wall Street? I encourage you to read the legislation that McConnell was advocating. It would do little for the state.

For all you know it was someone out of state that crossed the border to the many border cities here in WV, did business and traveled home like so many thousands do in WV every day.

Today, NY state and NYC argue that they are the epicenter, with the highest number of cases, and have a more urgent need for PPE and tests.

6491,6491,AmazingSpidey616,"Some solid news for those that may require care but are wary of physically going to urgent care due to Coronavirus concerns. 


To help lessen the spread of COVID-19, all WVU Medicine Urgent Care locations are now offering virtual video visits at no cost for adults and children ages 5 and up.

WVU Medicine Urgent Care locations include those in Charles Town, Fairmont, Inwood, Morgantown (Evansdale and Suncrest), Parkersburg, and Spring Mills in West Virginia; Marietta, Ohio; and Grantsville and McHenry in Maryland.

Adults and children ages 5 and up can video chat with an Urgent Care provider via a smartphone or webcam-equipped computer from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday. This service is for patients who have minor medical conditions and not for emergencies. Those with emergencies should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency care location.

Patients must be physically located within the state of West Virginia at the time of treatment, due to licensure regulations. Until May 15, 2020, WVU Medicine will waive all personal pay fees, including deductibles and co-payments.

Video Urgent Care visits are not intended to replace routine appointments with regular providers for needs such as annual physicals. A referral is not needed to see a virtual Urgent Care provider.

With virtual urgent care, adults and children can:

receive an examination, diagnosis, and treatment from a WVU Medicine provider
be treated for a variety of minor medical concerns, such as cough, sore throat, rash, allergies, and pink eye
receive an after-visit summary containing a care plan and any follow-up instructions, including referrals for a specialist visit or diagnostic imaging
have WVU Medicine Urgent Care notify their primary care physician to contact them about their visit
have prescriptions recommended by their virtual Urgent Care provider sent to the pharmacy of their choice
Video visits can be scheduled through a patient’s MyWVUChart account. In order to complete the video visit by smartphone or tablet, which is the preferred method, the MyChart app must be installed prior to the scheduled appointment, and the patient must have access to a good internet connection or 3G/4G network.

To complete a video visit through a computer, patients must ensure their computers have a working web camera, microphone, speakers, and high-speed internet connection. 

Video visits can be completed by following the steps listed here.

Those experiencing flu-like symptoms should call 304-598-6000 option 4. 

For a more detailed list of conditions that can be treated with a video visit, click here.

6498,6498,SumHighFalls,"Yep.  I hope it didn’t come across like the sarcasm was directed at you.  I absolutely (and sadly) agree that there are far more cases in WV than have been diagnosed (or will ever be known), in part because WV doesn’t have the necessary testing resources.  I posted a link to the news story about the struggle one couple had, when WV still was listed as having no confirmed cases.  Some younger family members in WV were disappointing in choices they made about travel to/from cities and States already known to have a high per capita number of cases.  Pretty damn selfish, given the number of senior citizens in WV and those with lifelong or work-related lung issues.  WV would end up with cases anyway, of course, but doesn’t need avoidable transmissions just because someone had vacation or Spring Break plans.

I also agree with you that NYC is in serious trouble.  My opinion is that they Mayor and Governor waited too long to order schools to go to distance learning and to close non-essential businesses (perhaps while allowing to-go/curbside/delivery of food and beverages).  But, just my opinion.  I know there are a lot of factors at play and it’s not an easy choice in the moment.  Westchester and New Rochelle may end up fortunate that they were forced to take action early because of the Manhattan attorney who unintentionally was the vector for dozens of exposures.

I understand NY city and State leaders’ concern for local, State, and the National economy, which is an issue everywhere.  But, the economy will suffer just as badly if the Nation gets shutdown by total spread of the virus.  If pre-emptive action can contain or mitigate the spread, it’s probably going to be less damaging to the economy.  Gov. Cuomo, for the most part, seems to be working this problem methodically and communicating clearly to constituents (and even communicating info that is useful to those of us nowhere near NY).

I’m glad WV moved relatively quickly with schools, even if it took until yesterday to issue a State-wide shelter-in-place.  Seeing footage of people openly flout common sense measures prohibiting gatherings, etc. has been frustrating, as you noted.  It’s obviously selfish to deliberately put oneself in high risk for exposure to such a contagious illness and then put one’s home community (and everywhere visited) at risk.  The assumption, based on data from other countries, that the young largely would be unaffected or have only minor cases is now in question for some of Europe and the US based on the cases so far.

Our household has taken ‘shelter-in-place’ seriously, even though it’s not been ordered for the State or County where we currently live.  It’s in place for the adjacent city/county.  My spouse works in an ‘essential business’ and I began working from home many years ago.  Neither of us wants to have to fight through having this virus.  And, maybe more importantly, neither wants to be the reason someone else gets it.  Seems like common sense (that’s unfortunately not common enough).

Hope you stay safe and healthy.  Thanks for your posts.

I don’t currently live in WV, KY, or OH.  Hadn’t heard of anywhere in the US requiring a specific flyer or letter.  Do you recall where that was?

I would be comfortable if I had with me something verifying where I live and where I work.  In theory, your drivers’ license has your current address.  Maybe you have an employee ID or badge that shows where you work. A pay stub (with confidential info blacked out) might show your workplace and home address.  That said, a lot of people will be out for things that aren’t documented, like going to the grocery or convenience store or checking on family who might need assistance.  

WV posted info about the State-wide order and exceptions yesterday after the announcement.  KY and OH likely have similar postings.  I’d check all 3, and maybe keep a copy of each in my car for reference while out, or to review with an officer if stopped.  I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the course of regular traffic stops, officers asked drivers their reason for travel.

So I’m at risk out here as well keeping the parks open for visitors. I’ve never seen so many people in the parks, on the trails, and at picnic tables. Most these people are coming in multiple vehicles which to me says they are meeting with friends and goes against what this stay at home order means. Yesterday there where a group of people all in different vehicles tailgating in the parking lot. Also these are people that do not use the park regularly. Most of them are new faces that never been here which could mean they are coming from out of town or other infectious state. Don’t get me wrong it’s awesome to see ALL these people using the park but I don’t think it’s appropriate to have all the different groups of people gathering during and pandemic. They definitely are not following the 6ft rule and the stay at home order, putting me and I family at risk spreading this virus around the parks. Plus, these visitors are going to have to stop somewhere and get gas and get their drinks and snacks for their tailgate or picnic. Which makes even more non essential trips to the gas stations or grocery stores potentially infecting other workers there and then bringing the virus to the park. Stay at home and stay safe.

I would encourage you to continue to try to find internet access, if-when-and where practical.  Also follow up with your school's administration, and Wirt County, and even WV Dept. of Ed. if you need to.  Give your best effort to follow up regularly, and document those efforts by making notes regarding dates, conversations, etc.

From what I understand, the WV Dept of Education is mostly focusing on maintaining lunch programs (for now) so they don't miss out on Federal assistance next school year.

If you have friends with decent internet who ARE able to do their online work, and you have access to a messaging app via cell phone, maybe you could get a few of them to message you screenshots from their online work for various classes.

I wouldn't put too much into that statistic, lets hope its true. But the problem is unless people stay the f**k home (as you point out) we might need way more. 

Even if 100's of thousands suddenly showed up, we still have the problem of needing medical professionals to manager people on those ventilators.

Therefore, I am going to move to China to teach English ASAP (this is already what I planned to do as I’m doing my masters in Teaching English to Speakers of other Languages), as China actually cares about its citizens enough to do an actual effective lockdown. I no longer trust this government to protect me in the face of a more deadly plague. I might go as soon as it’s safe to fly or I might finish my masters first.

Here in Teays Valley, they delivery from Kroger and Aldi (and CVS and Petco) - and I feel sure there offerings are similar in Morgantown.

7288,7288,Ribonacci,"That’s more why I called it “back of the envelope” rather than considering it a hard and fast “this is going to happen”. From testing, at this point in time, we’re finding out of all total tested, 3.38% of people are coming back positive. 

If we tested more people by opening up the criteria to more than just those who are symptomatic, and there’s a difference in the percentage, it would mean either there is not as much underlying transmission if the percentage was smaller, or it would mean there’s a lot more underlying transmission, if it changed to a larger percentage than what we have now. 

The percentage as of right now by itself doesn’t say too much other than a possible infection rate, but that’s not terribly accurate because of our strict criteria on who can be tested. 

And I had said that the 75k figure for the future seemed excessive. It might be possible to get worst case and best case scenarios if I decided to chugalug things in excel or R, but that takes a lot of work and I’m not an epidemiologist :).",1585487060,flttvjw

Also I said this was back of the envelope, and that the 75k seemed excessive as a rate of total infected versus uninfected. Doing something more in depth in excel or R would produce better results, especially using data we already have from other countries.

7300,7300,jeff0,"I'm not saying that this is a bad estimate. I'm saying that it doesn't even make sense as an estimate. For two reasons:

1. Sampling Bias. You've mentioned this, but I think you're failing to account for just how much error this is bringing to the table. I think all we can say with relative certainty is that the number of infected people lies somewhere between 113 and 4% of the state population. And that infected rate is lagging behind reality because of the time it takes to get test results.

2. The number of infections is growing exponentially and likely will continue to do so for a while. The positive rate based on current tests has nothing to do with the future infection rate, because people who tested negative today could become infected tomorrow.

""Chugaluging things in excel or R"" will not help in the least bit. If you start from faulty premises, you're going to get incorrect results, no matter what methods you bring to bear.",1585493945,flu2tuz

At first before mitigating actions are take single person infects ~2.5 other people. Of course we know the Chinese got that number below 1 because they have eliminated most of their cases.

I guess the bottom line is that you can't predict 'total number of cases' with the calculation you used, because those numbers are at one point in time. The total number will be the daily sum of new cases. We can only hope that early actions will minimize that number (in the last 3 days there have been 26, 21, and 17 new cases - a promising trend).",1585499080,flub4x3

7345,7345,eaglescout1984,"On the plus side, it's a beautiful state. There's lush green forests, mountain vistas, and winding rivers. It's also very quiet and peaceful in the country. As pointed out elsewhere, the cost of living is low. House are cheap compared to neighboring states and even it the cities nothing seems overpriced. Crime is also relatively low with the exception of a few neighborhoods in the bigger cities.

Some negatives include the opiod crisis, which has led to a large population of homeless and increased crime in areas mentioned above. There's also a struggling economy as the one mighty coal industry continues to shrink and no major corporations seem interested in making WV their home because of the lack of reliable high speed internet. Speaking of the internet, your only option is cable in and around the cities or crap DSL elsewhere. Finally, owning to itd rural nature, there is a strong redneck presence. So, just be ready for guys driving their jacked up trucks with a huge Cummins sticker on the window laying into the throttle causing black smoke to come out of their tailpipe and makeing a noise that will make you wish for ear plugs.

There's also some aspects that depending on you POV can go either way. First, there's not much of a nightlife scene. Obviously there are some bars around the colleges and downtown Charleston had a pretty cool area and a Friday night concert during warm months, but the former are more for the college kids and the latter is family friendly, so if you 30 and looking for a night out, your going to be disappointed. There's also no major entertainment venue, you really have to go to places like Cleveland, Louisville, Pittsburgh, DC, etc. Although we do get some acts that come through here, for example Jim Gaffigan will be in Charleston in August (hopefully).

7477,7477,wwwalonedotcom,"So it’s not illegal to be driving anywhere.  Whether you’re out of state or not.  Unless you’re driving to go to a party with over ten people you’re basically fine.  “I’m going to go climb this mountain, I’m going to the grocery store, I’m going home, I’m going to work(if essential)” and more, are all valid and legal reasons to be out driving.  

The cops have been given impunity on pulling people over, and while that has always been the case, I feel like this will just take them to an entirely new level of harassment.  Now it’s written that they have an excuse to pull anyone over...because...coronavirus.  But hey while we’re at it, “here’s a ticket for an expired inspection.

I read an article the other day that was talking this, at the time of the article, they did not know if it would be longer for patients with more a more severe case. The article speculated that it was not out of the realm of possibility. 

&amp;nbsp;

How does this relate to ""restricting the freedom of movement"". You will need to refuel your car, gas pumps are not cleaned in between customers. Though some customers may take the precaution of wiping down everything before getting gas. But not everyone will.  How many people touched the pump? Or ran into the gas station for lotto or something else non-essential? Or is within the shedding window after recovering, that has now touched handles, merchandise, the cash they just paid with --- that now is the change in your pocket. 

&amp;nbsp;

The big problem, as of right now, there is no medical way to defeat the bug, covid-19 has an alarming transmission rate, the long incubation period, etc...

&amp;nbsp;

The big question to ask yourself during this time.... Should I go out, what is the real big deal? 

&amp;nbsp;

Say you go out. You accidentally get infected -- the bug is airborne after all, do you want to live with the guilt of infecting a family member, that dies as a result of complications, lack of resources, etc ... because, they can't restrict my freedom of movement?

&amp;nbsp;

This is not a national problem it is a global problem. It is going to take sacrifices from everyone. As shitty as it is, we need to slow down the infection rate. Virginia were I live, was just put under a stay at home order until June 10th. We have older parents, one that is recovering from a stroke that just got sent home, we are not visiting, because the risk is too high. My kids are driving me nuts, trust me I would like nothing more, than to be bullet proof and 10 foot tall ... but I, like you, are not. The kids are stuck to our little back yard for now. We try and make every day the best we can.

To your point.  I agree completely.  We all have to take precautions.  I wipe down everything before pumping gas, sanitize sanitize sanitize.  In Pittsburgh I have all of my groceries delivered to my flat and wipe everything down before putting it away.  We’ve had stay at home orders for about 10 days longer than WV.  I’ve been working from home for 3 weeks now - fortunately.  

Being in the heart of the city, with thousands of people living just in a two block radius, it’s hard to safely practice social distancing, while trying to get some fresh air.  So on the weekends I carefully pack what I need.  Leave my flat, get in my truck, and drive straight into the backcountry and spend my weekends there far away from people on the side of a mountain.  When I leave, I get in my truck, get gas (again sanitize) and head straight back to Pittsburgh.  

My point is that this is allowed.  Should you be extremely careful to protect everyone in the world?  Absolutely resoundingly yes!  But for my own sanity I need to get outside still.

I take all of the precautions I can.  But I still need to make sure I’m healthy mentally.  Going out to the woods for me is therapeutic.  I specifically go to the most remote Mountain Hollars I can find.  I hike the least traveled trails.  I camp hundreds of feet off trail.  I leave no trace.  I get back in my truck, drive straight back to the Burgh, and straight back into my flat where I work 40 hours mon-fri.  Rinse and repeat.

&gt; The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets.

&gt; There is better airflow outside than in confined spaces. That air flow outside reduces the risk of one person transmitting the virus to another through droplets in the air, says Albert Ko, the Yale epidemiologist. ""So if you're going out and you're hiking or biking or running and you're not within, say, six feet or 10 feet of another person, I would consider that a healthy, safe practice.""

&gt;Ko also points to the significant mental health issues that can be caused or exacerbated when people are cooped up.

If the student is driven and willing to put themselves in harder classes with better teachers (honors/AP) courses they can certainly get a quality education. However, there are some teachers that are allowed to get away with certain things, coaches, sleeping with administrators, and so forth. If a student chose these classes and more “bone head” classes then they won’t receive the same education.

8085,8085,ghostofwiglaf," Ten years ago, on April 5, 2010, 29 men who worked at an underground  coal mine in Raleigh County, West Virginia, lost their lives. [The Upper Big Branch Mining Memorial Group, Inc.](https://www.facebook.com/ubbminersmemorial/)  has placed wreaths at the monument in Raleigh County on April 5 every  year since. But this year, they aren’t encouraging family members to  visit, due to the spread of COVID-19.  

Family members are memorializing their loved ones in their own ways.  While the annual events at Marsh Fork Elementary, the Upper Big Branch  Monument and other places across the region can’t happen as they usually  do because of the spread of COVID-19, loved ones still have social  media as a way to remember. Some of them keep photos up throughout the  year as their cover photo on Facebook, and some remember them with old  photos on their birthdays or sharing memories.

In this episode of  “Inside Appalachia,” we remember the men who died and explore some of  the ways family members, artists and communities memorialize one of the  most tragic mining disasters in modern history. We’ll also hear from  artists who wrote a play, featuring the music of Steve Earle. The play  was inspired by stories from the family members.",1586090012,fmhq2wg

It doesn't really matter in my household though, because my wife works at the juvenile day report center and the state deemed her job essential, so even though me and the kids are home self isolating, if my wife is exposed she'll just bring it home to us.

You will receive $600 a week from the signing, even if you haven't been paid yet. Meaning if it arrives next week, you will receive it for at least last week too (so $1,200). It will last until at least July 31st... so about 17 weeks - or $10,200 total. That's assuming you are already receiving your normal employment - otherwise I think you need to wait an extra 1-2 weeks for your claim to be processed.

*It's possible I read the guidelines wrong on the news articles and we won't be paid for last week at all. However, we will definitely be paid for this week on and retroactively to that. The matter is when it's going to be released to us.*

I doubt it will be released this week, to be honest. I'm seeing *very little* information about the possible release date on this. Hunting down information on news articles is a journey with a destination that seems like complete conjecture.

Now it seems possible it will be released this week. Perhaps the federal government is prioritizing unemployment payments over stimulus and tax refunds. But I think it's more likely we will receive it around the middle of the month or May.

And let's not forget the federal government isn't releasing it to us directly, but sending it to the states. That means a further delay by at least a few days.",1586147085,fmk87kn

When I graduated college, I moved away and have been living in a fairly progressive state these past 5 years. However, distance can make the mind wax objective. I now look on West Virginia with less contempt and more....pity, I guess. I pity that this beautiful state has been exploited by coal operators; I pity the people who were taken advantage of by the same. I am angry that billionaire corporations have had a stranglehold over our environment and economy for so long. I hate that education systems in our state are given so little support despite the fact that out people are so susceptible to misinformation precisely because of the failings of our education systems. I am pissed off at pharmaceutical companies for pumping Oxytocin, fentanyl, and other opioids into our state, and I am upset that when outsiders think if West Virginia's problems, they envision the victims of the pharmaceutical companies and not the companies themselves.

There is a time, as you grow up, for resenting the hand you were dealt. Totally.

Growing up in WV, if you are not part of the dominant (proudly redneck) culture, you are a minority, and often in danger of social alienation and even potential physical danger for not being so. From that position, making fun of the loud proud majority is “punching up”, which is ok. 

But when outsiders or people who only lived there a short time make fun of it or talk about how bad it is, especially if they come from a place of greater wealth, education, or privilege (which isn’t hard to achieve, sadly) then it’s “punching down” which is gross. 

Lastly, fwiw, even when I was at my most vulnerable and felt attacked and threatened by the culture I grew up in, it was never “poor people” or “miners” that were targets of my hate and ridicule, just mean small mindedness, the crabs-in-a-bucket mentality, that won’t allow anyone else to better themselves. Actively choosing ignorance and stupidity even when given alternative options. 

I get that there are an endless lists of ways the people of WV have been fucked over, but in my opinion, there’s also a perverse pride in the backward culture that people choose to embrace that keeps them continuing on that track no matter what.

If you click on the above link, you can view WV Can't Wait's platform items and see for yourself just how people are trying to save the state.

However. One thing I would really like to see change though and that is the major issue of Grandparents raising their kids kids. WV is very close to the number one State in the US that has a higher chance of Moms and Dads loosing custody and Grandparents having to raise their grand-babies.  This is a big Dope issue.

This article states that it will *begin* Tuesday. However, I suspect not everyone will see that credit in their bank account until the end of the week depending on how it is being processed.

According to user reports on twitter from New York, this distribution happens as a separate deposit from your normal unemployment, so they may not occur in the same transaction or possibly even the same day if it will be done in a similar way in our state.

I suspect putting the national guard on staff to help with claims has really helped the general backlog, but again depending on how it is processed there may be a manual component which will result in spaced payments in the population.",1586279535,fmperac

I did a little bit of research, and it looks like in WV there will be an initial deposit this of a lump sum bringing the unemployment claims up to date. For example, if you filed last week and got a $200 benefit deposit on Monday then you should receive an additional deposit of $600 sometime this week to bring your claim current. Then starting next week you should only receive one deposit per week with your normal benefit amount plus the $600 addition (following the example, from here on you should receive one deposit per week for $800).

348,348,zaxophone_bswv,"VeryBigGnome said it well, but to elaborate:

West Virginia has decently-sized cities, tiny villages, areas of absolutely nothing, and everything in between. Basically any kind of living environment can be found somewhere around here (though the majority is definitely rural). I know people who live in a house in a small clearing in the woods, have a house in the middle of a field that used to be a farm, run their own hobby farm, live on a town plot (me), own a trailer on rented land, own a trailer on ancestral land, live in an apartment, above a shop, etc. The transition between urban and rural can be pretty sharp though. The towns and cities are largely confined to the valleys and hollows while the surrounding hills are wooded.

Electricity, running water, and internet can be brought to your home in some form or another anywhere in the state, though if you want to live off-grid, this is a good place for that too.

Professions depend highly on region. Technology can be found in the Kanawha Valley metro area, the Morgantown and Fairmont metro area, and the Eastern Panhandle. Manufacturing and chemical plants are around the Kanawha and Ohio rivers. The southern part of the state is largely coal mining. Education and healthcare are important and critical sectors, and Morgantown, Huntington, and Shepherdstown among many others have lively college-town atmospheres.

Not sure what else I can say. West Virginia has a lot of rural life but you can find a bit of everything, like most states. Hope this helps.",1586405420,fmv3var

I have replaced multiple outlets and light fixtures - I have a strong suspicion that there's still knob and tube in the attic, I just murdered rats who were living in the wall, it's a 2 story with 13 foot ceilings, I've covered every window and laid stripping in every door - it's a beautiful 1920s construction with bizarre 1970s upgrades, my electric runs $100 dollars in the winter, $170 in the summer with window AC units, $250 gas in the winter at 62 degrees central gas heat. I just feel like the repair costs to the foundation, electric and plumbing and roof would have gone miles to mow it down and build something that consumed less. Maybe a nice concrete block single story. I'm no architect either but us poor folk are being drained in the utilities in these 100 year old rentals.",1586559538,fn1d4h2
448,448,zaxophone_bswv,"As much as I love historic interiors, often the best thing to do is simply take it down to the studs inside and redo it from the insulation to the drywall. Essentially a new house in the shell of the old. While it's a large undertaking and a lot can get thrown away, reusing the shell and structure of the old house is a major saving in resources and environmental impact versus taking it ALL down and starting fresh. Especially considering the continued prolongation of those existing materials' lives. And, a concrete block 1-story would not only be a less efficient use of land than a 2- or 2-1/2-story house, but they tend to be shorter-lived as they are susceptible to moisture penetration and such. (and the production of concrete is not the most environmentally friendly process, especially compared to sustainable lumber farming.) But, every house and land is different, and the same solution won't be perfect for all of them. That's one of the reasons why I love historic preservation, every project is a new set of decisions and solutions, and I can't just simply sit here at my computer and tell you what's best for your house.",1586560332,fn1ehj2

They probably spread it by touching the nose, mouth or eyes, then touch objects, then the same objects are touched by others who touch they nose, eyes or mouth.

So washing hands after handling things like newly purchased groceries is probably as important as wearing a mask.

* Lobby hard for manufacturers wanting to come back to the United States to build plants here. Even if they go towards automation, they will need employees like engineers to oversee the line, and that's good money for West Virginia families.
* Set up a self-employed insurance system. If we can create an option for the self-employed, gig contractors, and freelances to put money into a secure system and get benefits out depending on what they put in, we'll have more flexibility with employment. This fund should cover unemployment, retirement, and health insurance. There could be options within the system, but there needs to be a reliable system that workers can just go online and log into to.
* Use our holler line infrastructure to our advantage. Most states have cities that branch out like squares, but we branch out like rectangles. This has an advantage in public transportation and delivering infrastructure upgrades in our dense areas. We can create central, highly efficient lines along the main roads of trains and then mini bus shuttles at the stations to help workers get to places of employment. We can also create central lines of utilities like internet to service the urban areas and then branch out like spiderwebs based on private demand.

There is also not as much bickering between the parties and politicians as you would have expected (though I bet it's happening behind closed doors). That tells me everyone who has power has checked their egos and are just working through this.

I was watching and reading the news for weeks before the shut down and I saw the state and local governments preparing for the pandemic despite our lack of resources and money. They got together and hashed out their response.

Most people don't realize that governments in other states were in denial about the coronavirus and reluctant to do anything until pressed. That wasn't the case with West Virginia. We knew it was coming. We accepted we would have community spread. And we planned, because we knew what was at stake due to our risk factors.

People are angry about him switching parties, and rightly so, but he has shown since he was elected that he's willing to listen and make meaningful compromises for the good of West Virginia - even if it was unpopular with his new party.

I honestly don't get the sense that he's only in this for himself. He bumbles sometimes, but to be honest, I get the sense he just wants to do right by the people of his state.

The health department advised us to work from home, so I’ve been able to do that, with the rare exception of responding in person to emergencies, and occasional shifts at our shelter. I am much, much more fortunate than most. 

I flat-out refused something else they were trying to make us do, so this incident was more of a “compromise”. If I didn’t love this job so much, I’d have had no problem with “go ahead and fire me”. But I caved, and my decision to put my clients/work over my and my family’s safety isn’t sitting well with me.

I'm not going to question whether this was racially motivated, since China was still a hotbed of the disease, and there was (and still is) debate over the effectiveness of the measure.

I *do* maintain that it was too late to do any good, that closed borders historically do little to combat the spread of disease, and that any time the action way have bought us was squandered by the administration's continued denial and incompetence.

As for Biden, his words on January 31st were:
&gt; The American people need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it. In moments like this, this is where the credibility of the president is most needed, as he explains what we should and should not do. This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.

While that was probably inspired by the travel restrictions, it's a broad statement attacking Trump's behavior and leadership, which I'd say is justified.

What *is* racist, though, is Trump's insistence on referring to COVID 19 as ""the China virus"" or similar terms, and constantly trying to draw focus back onto China to paint them as villains in this situation.",1586778666,fn9mqnd

Third man he's killed in just a few short years.

The article leaves out a few key points. Although it states he was not wearing his uniform he was in fact not even on duty nor was he even in his jurisdiction. He also arrived in his own personal vehicle. The men were neighbors. He was charged with nothing, walked free and is still working as an active duty LEO to this day. The man is a serial killer and he will kill again. He murdered a man for spinning up a bit of gravel, a man laying on the ground and unarmed, by blowing half his head off with a shotgun on his day off, and walked, retaining his job. He did this in front of the man's wife, in his parents front yard. Please tell me again how this is West Virginia and there's no corruption.

If you've got property and like to keep to yourself, your only real concern would be a good internet connection from the sound of things. Now I wouldn't trust the claim of good internet on the property you're looking at without doing some research or testing yourself, and each property would need it's own looking into in that regard.

Even if you're an interracial or minority couple it's not like you're going to have a horde of Klansman show up on your door for no reason. I've had some black friends down in Durbin which is absolute middle of buttfuck and they managed just fine to not get harassed or assaulted by locals. 

Drugs are an issue, if you're not into drugs it really shouldn't be your issue though. 

I don't think many if any of the issues in WV are unique to this state, they're just more prevalent in some instances, if you live remotely you need to know how to protect yourself and your property from some threats, but those threats are not necessarily different than what you'll find in any other rural area.",1587149693,fnppmu8

But the first verse is inaccurate, the second verse is nonsense, the third verse is highly effective although now anachronistic (few West Virginian's seem to remember what it ever referred to).

As for the chorus, for most native West Virginians, the 'country roads' that take us home are through Belmont, Meigs &amp; Monroe Counties of Ohio, Beaver Washington and Greene Counties of Pennsylvania. or Loudoun, Augusta (etc) counties of Virginia.  Obviously the 'country roads' of West Virginia do not lead to West Virginia. That defies logic.  In fact they lead OUT of (or around) West Virginia.

the best version of this song, and the only version I can love unconditionally is the instrumental performed by the WVU Marching Band, but I can of course understand not everybody in WV is a WVU fan.   The recently introduced 'tradition' of singing it at the end of college sporting events kinda irks me.  ruined a good thing.

It was a song about Massachusetts that got reworked by some songwriters getting high in a D.C. hotel room who had never been to West Virginia.  Maybe move on folks.",1587220847,fnsg20j
