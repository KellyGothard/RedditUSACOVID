4 3/4 cups flour
2 cups cornmeal
2 cups sugar
3/4 tsp baking powder
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 cup mayonnaise

Listen, I’ve seen the development and where Charleston is going. I work in construction and I’ve worked on over a 100 projects within the past nine months. 

So far, we are in the process of building over 800+ new homes

We have new trade centers (each over a million square feet) and one is currently being expanded to another 500,000 sqf

Isle of Palms is rebuilding a hotel and it’s gonna be BIG 

Several new schools/add one’s to schools are being built to account for new population growth 
(Moultrie Middle, Camp Road Middle, Montessori Elementary, C.E Williams Middle, West Ashley Highschool) 

Highway 78 is being expanded to a four lane highway (I did some geotechnical work on that) and so are multiple highway projects. 

Plenty of new businesses and apartments are being built (Floor and Decor, Mixson Apartments).

Charleston is a literal boomtown it feels like. Charleston is going through a few growing pains since we are springing up like a teen goes through puberty- we essentially went from 5’0 to 6’0 within several years. 

I have firsthand experience on this, Charleston is *booming*. 

Downtown Charleston is also working on public transportation, and so are the various suburbs. Also, many roads are being repaved, and some even being totally redone (such as removing bad soil). 

South Carolina as a whole? Yes I’d agree. To say Charleston is in shambles would be a ridiculous claim, especially after all I’ve seen.",1578004811,fcvlqly

For context, the block had many homes with many street parked cars and I had decals and PA tags on my car so clearly I’m a visitor. Interestingly it was one of the few conflicts I had throughout the trip.

Otherwise, cool little state. Really I just went to Columbia and Charleston, and maybe a few roadside attractions along the way that don’t ring a bell. The Angel Oak was impressive. Similar tree in Jacksonville, but SC’s is older and larger. Didn’t really have a preconceived notion about SC, but interestingly I have a tenant that just moved here from SC (I live in Philly) and he’s a military guy that works on helicopters, so that’s really all I had to go by. And my sister’s been to Charleston a few times and loves it. 

Unfortunately I didn’t get into regional foods until I made it to Florida. SC was state #5, Florida was 7. Then I started hitting 1- 3 locally known foods and/or restaurants per state.

Thanks for sharing. It proves that judging someone before given a chance will most of the time come back to bite you where it hurts. It also shows everyone that Graham does stand for what is right and does have a mind of his own. He's not ashamed or ""embarrassed"" to say he was wrong. Sometimes all it takes is opening your eyes and putting yourself in someone else's shoes before life makes sense. 

This political nonsense reminds me of Carolina/ Clemson rivelry.  Some Gamecock fans would never admit that Clemson has fought hard to be where they are today and most of that credit is due Dabo. He took over and promised to make Clemson great again. And he has!!
Now the Gamecock fans that can admit that doesn't make them a traitor. They will always be Gamecock fans and there is nothing wrong with that.  But if Carolina had the chance to have Sweeney has their coach, would they?  If you're answer is no then you wouldn't want what's best for your team. So then would that make you a loyal fan?
You don't have to like President Trump or L. Graham but to not give credit where credit is due and see who is trying to do the right thing, I would have to guess that means you are not truly an American. 

And that my friend is what is wrong in our Country today.  We forget where we come from. It also makes us a spoiled and ungrateful. Because I promise there are worse places in this world to live.

&gt;  
&gt;**They also can't receive an occupational license from the SC Department of  Labor**, Licensing and Regulation. That means they aren't eligible for over 30 professions that require licenses.

Hellman’s is a bit tangier than Duke’s and the texture is fluffier. Kraft’s is the whitest in color, the creamiest, and really not bad—has a lot of flavor. Both Hellman’s and Kraft’s are good on sandwiches. 

If you like thick mayo, Heinz is the most emulsified and is now made with cage-free eggs—tastes yolkier to me. It’s also the brand that is most often on sale, even here in the south. It’s bland which is why it works well in salads, where you add seasonings, vinegar and mustard. I pick the very affordable Heinz because it works well in salads and casseroles and it’s a good thick base, that goes a long way. 

Mayo in USA was much better, fresh-tasting, years ago when it was sold in glass jars as opposed to plastic. Hellman’s was definitely the best back then.",1578838528,fe2i0n7

If anyone ever wonders why the town of Kershaw isn’t in Kershaw county, part of it was due to unfair practices in appropriation of school funds.  Other towns tried charter schools to get out from under those same practices but the school board did everything in its power to kneecap those efforts.

592,592,ScrollButtons,"Somewhat. We're looking for about 20 acres we can get on the cheap, expand it or renovate it to fit our needs now, empty the nest, then early ""working"" retirement.


I grew up on a 50-acre working farm in Texas, he grew up in Summerville/North Charleston. I'm going insane in the suburbs but I'm not about to go back to the ""gas station/grocery store/drive-in/feed store"" at the only stoplight for miles life and he's open to the idea of more space and no crosswalks.


We're also not so flush we can just buy some land with our spare cash and build something fast or buy a trailer and make do until we can build bottom up. If we buy property, we've agreed that we'll move there within a year and rent out this beast we have now, dip our toes in real estate but do it right and do it as financially safe as we're comfortable with.


So, we're looking for _something_ on 10-20 acres that's at least 50% cleared or with enough good timber we could break even or profit from clearing. We've accepted that most of the upstate that might even have timber worth clearing and selling at that small of a scale is just disqualified for one personal reason or another. 


By something I mean some kind of home we can either renovate within a year to make it livable or expand to fit our family relatively quickly. We have 3 kids and he has a big family who visits often and one of the compromises was we either stayed close enough to drive here and back when we host or we need to be able to accommodate as best as possible. So either 3 finished bedrooms we can expand to 5/6 or 5/6 that needs renovation or 4 mostly finished with a second building we could convert to guest housing. You get me.


On top of ALL THIS, if we move more than a reasonable commute to Clements Ferry or that side of 526 where most of my potential employers have offices then I need to have the resources to work reliably and at the same pace at home as I can at the office.


Anderson, Aiken is out for personal reasons. Myrtle Beach is out for the obvious ones. The coast is out because it defeats the purpose of moving away from hurricanes to at least somewhat reduce their risk.

It also wasn't under enough threat from the motherland to make it a primary motivation for our first revolution.

Admin post: “I'm not resharing the story, just making this statement.  If you have been following the story about Scarlet the Opossum, who was severely beaten and will be blind from that beating, on a golf course on Hilton Head.    LISTEN.  This IS being investigated.  There is not a cover up happening.  The DNR and officials are looking into this.  The rehabber who has her is taking good care of her.  The golf course is cooperating.  Her medical bills have been paid.  She does not have her broken jaw wired shut as the vet didn't think it needed that.  

THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY RUMORS surrounding this incident.  Investigations take time.  This has taken on a life of its own.  IF you would like to make a donation in her name to the wild life rehab then by all means.  People have even threatened the rehabber who is helping her.  

Clearly emotions are high over this BUT COME ON.  Can we please say a prayer for her recovery, be grateful people do the work of taking care of them 24/7, be happy she is alive, and pray for the investigators to figure out EXACTLY what happened, who is responsible and that they are found.  PLEASE?  No more threats or name calling or rumors please.  Not on this page!  

Thank you!”

Ok me again- hi! Last time I checked, over $5,000 has been raised for her, and she’s going to be kept in a life of ease &amp; luxury as an “ambassador possum” at the wildlife rescue.  There’s no proof that it was golfers- just that she was found near a golf course.  This was an act of incomprehensible cruelty by a human(s)- and the stories have been difficult to read, so in this case I’m following Mr. Rogers advice to “look for the helpers.” There have been so many helpers, from the people who are donating money, the DNR folks investigating, to the rehab now caring for her.

The terrain can also affect my eta. It takes longer to drive 500 miles through mountains than across the plains.  It takes roughly the same time to get from NYC to Baltimore as to get from Dallas to Houston, even though the NYC to Baltimore trip is 50 miles shorter.  I also usually have to add a few hours to each mandated 10 hour rest break to keep my sleep schedule consistent otherwise I'd be waking up 2 hours earlier than the day before, every day. Within a week I'd  be operating at night instead of day. I'd constantly be exhausted. I did that when I first started. It sucked and was extremely unsafe.

1024,1024,Condo-World,"Unofficially, Black Bike Week, also called Atlantic Bike Week is originally focused in Atlantic Beach, a township of its own ""in"" North Myrtle Beach between Windy Hill (near Barefoot Landing) and Crescent Beach (where Condo-World is located). Atlantic Beach is historically where a lot of bikers go for that weekend. 

But they also tend to frequent Myrtle Beach, which is where the Bike Loop has been set up. The Bike Loop goes up Harrelson Blvd (near the airport), up a small stretch of 501 onto 31, back off of 31 onto Robert Grissom Parkway, making its way to 17 bypass, to 29th Ave N, to Ocean Blvd until it would turn into Farrow Parkway (Market Common), then back up 17 Business to Harrelson Blvd and repeat. 

By and large, Murrells Inlet will probably not have much of the biker traffic that week. Harley Week a couple of weeks earlier will primarily take place in Murrells Inlet.

People will joke about your safety on here because /r/SouthCarolina tends to talk down about the Myrtle Beach area almost any chance it can get and there are certainly examples of violent crimes occurring that week. With that said, I've personally never not felt safe during those weeks and I currently and have in the past commuted through Bike Week traffic just to get from home to work or vice versa.

The officer made it seem like selling marijuana laced with meth was, infact, dealing meth. I realize he is technaically correct but they are not the same.

I figured theyd pop the guy i got it from and thats about it. That wasnt my intent at all. I had two purchases light up hot so it was obviously a recurring problem.

I had to quit smoking because of that shit. I used to smoke like a freight train due to chronic pain from a wrecked spine from a severe accident years ago.

"" In South Carolina there are over 60,000 public road miles. SCDOT  maintains over 41,000 miles of those roadways. The remaining miles are  maintained by local governments, private businesses or individuals.""

You can use this tool to search for addresses and see what entity maintains the road:

It's actually pretty crazy in some places. I live in the country in Spartanburg County and my road is SCDoT maintained, but it connects to a road that isn't, until it crosses the Tyger River and then suddenly it is state maintained.

Whether or not I want Bernie to win (I do) has nothing to do with the fact that he's got a better record on marijuana than any of the other Democratic candidates. The purpose of my post was to suggest that Republicans in SC who are in favor of legalizing marijuana might consider voting in the Democratic primary as a means to affect that end, at least in the event that the eventual Democratic nominee does win the presidency.

While it's true that I probably wouldn't have posted this if I wanted Biden or someone else to win the nomination, that still doesn't change the facts of the matter.

I think something to keep in mind, and I guess this comes down to personal opinion since there is nowhere to get facts on it, is whether you believe state legislators are personally invested in marijuana prohibition, or if it's something they rally behind because it's what their core constituency believes in. Of course in reality I'm sure it's a mix of both.

In the case of the latter though, I think there's a chance we'd see a relatively quick turnaround, as it'll give legislators an easy out from their current stance. In the case of the former, I agree with you about needing pressure from land owners and farmers. Just look at how Kentucky's hemp industry has contributed to Mitch McConnell's stance on both industrial hemp and marijuana policy.

Of course, as we've seen elsewhere, a lot of those cashing in on growing operations in rec legal states are not individual farmers and landowners, but large out-of-state interests. In Oregon, small growers have been decimated by the supply glut here, and it's become a classic get big or get out situation.

1904,1904,Crystal_Pesci,"End-to-end encryption: 

""End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a system of communication where only the communicating users can read the messages. In principle, it prevents potential eavesdroppers – including telecom providers, Internet providers, and even the provider of the communication service – from being able to access the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation.

In many messaging systems, including email and many chat networks, messages pass through intermediaries and are stored by a third party, from which they are retrieved by the recipient. Even if the messages are encrypted, they are typically only encrypted 'in transit', and are stored in decrypted form by the third party. This allows the third party to provide search and other features, or to scan for illegal and unacceptable content, but also means they can be read and misused by anyone who has access to the stored messages on the third party system, whether this is by design or via a backdoor. This can be seen as a concern in many cases where privacy is very important, such as persons living under repressive governments, whistleblowing, mass surveillance, businesses whose reputation depends on its ability to protect third party data, negotiations and communications that are important enough to have a risk of targeted 'hacking', and where sensitive subjects such as health, and information about minors are involved.

End-to-end encryption is intended to prevent data being read or secretly modified, other than by the true sender and recipient(s). The messages are encrypted by the sender but the third party does not have a means to decrypt them, and stores them encrypted. The recipient retrieves the encrypted data and decrypts it themselves.

Because no third parties can decipher the data being communicated or stored, for example, companies that use end-to-end encryption are unable to hand over texts of their customers' messages to the authorities.

The witnesses were shit - at least the ones they paraded out of the public hearings (which were televised by the way). But for arguments sake let’s agree that these additional witnesses are 100% necessary to be heard from. Why didn’t the house subpoena them and have them testify? This was an iron clad case the house put forth right? Nadler and Schiff didn’t gather all the evidence they needed? I guess like most other problems it’s easier to blame these short comings on someone else too. They rolled the dice - rushed a partisan shit show of a case they claimed was so strong - and once again lost, and now you are butthurt. 

As for the President calling witnesses - why does he have to? Surely you know (I know this isn’t how the democrats like to present their cases) but you are innocent until proven guilty. You don’t need to prove you are innocent - they need to prove you are guilty. Fifth amendment - you have the right to not say a thing - and it’s the accusers job to present the evidence. Sorry you bought into another half baked scheme that was going to be “the end of Trump” - just to lose again. 

There is the appearance of corruption with the Biden case - something the media briefly exposed back when it first came out that Hunter Biden had taken the job with Burisma. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/europe/corruption-ukraine-joe-biden-son-hunter-biden-ties.html I guess asking the Ukraine to look into the matter is “highly illegal” - I guess what the President should have done is funnel funds from the RNC to a company like Fusion GPS to hire a foreign spy to look into the Bidens right? Then we could just call it “opposition research” and that’s completely fine right?

But hey - at the end of the day the President won again, and is about to be acquitted of the whole sham. I’ll take it. We’ll be having a state of the union party Tuesday if you are looking to celebrate.",1580668587,fgc2zbn

You fought like hell to stop the second - the rape claims were coming out of thin air. But you lost - the house meant nothing.

Then the whistle blower came out and the house dropped the Russia nonsense and began holding hearings - both secret and on live TV - broadcasting the best bits and keeping secret the others. The Republicans weren’t able to call any witnesses - you had successfully rigged a scheme that couldn’t fail. Within a few months it was case closed and heading to the senate. 

But you’ve lost again. 

You’re best shot fell short, and by Wednesday will be a footnote in history. Meanwhile the Presidents approval rating has only gone but - and your best chances in the election are a senile old man, a communist, and a fake Indian - and you are looking at getting blown the fuck out again.

You, like other Republicans, have no answers for the questions posed about investigating the conspiracies you are committed to. There is no investigation of Biden, and no supporting evidence.

Barr is not committed to this as nothing is there, just like the Clinton emails, just like the birth certificate,  just like the Ukrainian server was proven to be Russian propaganda.  

You will only continue to dig your head deeper in the sand.  Good luck with that, blue wave is coming. When it does, please don't snowflake out like Trump has on this issue.

The answer is no. Posts saying ""YALL WE ARE NICE DONT FORGET!!!"" don't move our state forward. They just spread a glossy veneer over conversations in hopes of getting them to stop.

Walmart, Target, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, etc etc all get screwed. It also harms the small local businesses who have to pick up the slack all over the state. Why? Because they don't have the clout to do anything about it and the people that pay are the citizens of the state. 

And those local businesses and business owners are companies, they're just not multinational companies.

2200,2200,captnich,"The wealth tax has several fundamental issues. Let's look at Jeff Bezos for example. His net worth is around 173 billion. 4% would be almost 7 billion. He gets paid by Amazon about 81k a year as salary, but his annual income is around 1.6 million for security services and other expenses. He doesn't have 173 billion in cash, or even that 7 billion for that first year of this wealth tax. He'd have to liquidate 7 billion worth of stocks which would actually greatly reduce the value of the stock and thus his wealth. When is the final calculation of his wealth determined? 

The other side of the coin is, because he's the head of Amazon, he could announce something that would greatly reduce the value of his stock right before the wealth tax is calculated, and pay substantially less. He owns a large enough portion of the company where he could just announce the sale of all his stocks, and then the value would tank. Then he would pay his much lower tax, and leave everyone with the Amazon stock to clean up the mess while he just waits for the price to go back up. Now imagine everyone with millions and billions of dollars doing this every year. 

Of course, this wouldn't happen because anyone with billions of dollars of assets would just expatriate to somewhere else before paying billions of dollars in taxes a year. It doesn't matter how much it costs to leave because they would never be able to sustain ownership of their companies if they were subject to this tax.

When we look at net worth, we need to understand that it's not money sitting in a bank. For the ultra-wealthy, it's mostly partial ownership of corporations. In the case of Amazon, there isn't even an annual dividend, so his 1.6 million is what he gets a year. Most of the net worth calculation is a figure for how much their share of the company is worth if all shares were sold at the current price, which doesn't happen.   


Say we did implement a wealth tax, all the millionaires and billionaires stay, and they pay what they're supposed to. It would be about a decade before they all fall below the threshold of the wealth tax, and then the whole thing becomes a moot point. The well will run dry, and everyone in the middle class with a 401k or IRA lost their retirement.

However, the wealth of these people is already being taxed. The corporations and its employees pay income tax. Their revenue streams produce sales tax. Their holdings produce property tax. Most wealth isn't liquid assets, but projected values of what someone might purchase it for, so it's not money sitting around collecting dust because it's not even money.

I think the wealthy should pay more, but the wealth tax is economically unsustainable model.",1580960935,fgo6g8q

2203,2203,Kruggdk,"Looks like you’re getting a lot of personal bias in the other comments. Also the Clemson/Carolina rivalry clouds people’s judgments, which I think is trivial. But I’ll give you my 2cents on the three questions you asked:

- 1)  Columbia has a lot to offer but I think Greenville is the winner here. I feel a much larger cultural presence in GVL (Peace Center, Children’s theater, art/art galleries/art festivals, music scene, and food festivals. The food scene in Greenville definitely beats Columbia’s.  Not to mention the large multinational companies based/located in Greenville, have brought lots of people from overseas and their cultures with them to the upstate - my own family included ;)

- 2) Greenville is very much a haven for young families. I think the single scene in Greenville is not the greatest. But I can’t say with certainty if Columbia is any better. Hard to say. 

- 3) Purely based on personal preference alone, Greenville is where I would want to live. Its a great balance of quality of life and big city amenities without the headaches of a larger city (traffic, cost of living, etc). You’re less then an hour from beautifully mountain hikes/parks, 3.5 hours to Charleston/coast. 1 hour to CLT and 2.5 to ATL. GSP is also an excellent little airport (easy access/fast security times) with competitive prices. Columbia just doesn’t seem to have the same buzz and excitement that Greenville has been experiencing the last 5-10 years. Columbia has a larger bar scene, but Greenville wins in the foodie arena. Both have great breweries. Columbia’s downtown is larger but (dare I say) Greenville’s is much nicer and growing rapidly.

Feel free to ask if you have more specific questions, otherwise good luck on your decision and move. 

(Full disclosure I grew up in Greenville, and know Columbia quite well. I’ve lived in 4 other states since graduation but have been back in Greenville the last 2 years - moving again in the spring for work. I feel like I have a pretty good point of view of both GVL and Cola)",1580964660,fgobeze
2204,2204,redogsc,"I've lived in the Irmo area for a few decades now, and find it to be a great place to live.  Close enough to downtown Columbia, and close to Lake Murray.  We have some of the state's best schools, if that will be a factor for you.  In the more distant areas (more towards Chapin) you'll find the opportunity to own land and have livestock.  The closer in stuff is more subdivision living on 1/4 acre lots.  You might expand your thinking to the Chapin and Lexington as well.

Downtown Columbia is growing and changing considerably.  Plenty of festivals and events.  15 years ago Columbia entertainment centered around University of South Carolina events and athletics, and maybe a trip to Riverbanks Zoo or The State Museum - but there has been considerable growth in other activities.

I would think job opportunities should be pretty good in both of your fields, but you seem to have that covered.

If you're frustrated by traffic - that might be more of a negative in the near future.  We're on the edge of starting a complete overhaul of the I26 / I20 junction, with about 10 years of construction, not only at that interchange, but with all of the other nearby exits.  This area has been called ""Malfunction Junction"" for years, and needs to be addressed - but construction tends to be a worse before it gets better proposition. They're also going to be adding more lanes.  Columbia traffic is more based on interstate useage than many other towns.  I hope it isn't as bad as I think it will be.  I joke that they'll be done about the time I'm too old to drive. 😐  You might want to search for ""Carolina Crossroads Project"" to see the plans.

I do think that most places are what you make them, at least to a degree, when it comes to meeting people. One thought I have/had is that Columbia might have the edge here because of the presence of a large, flagship university campus. It doesn't look like Greenville has a public, large four-year program within it. I know USC Upstate isn't far away though, so that's a plus.

Location is Greenville's greatest appeal to me. So much else of what it seems to offer rides on that. I've never lived within reasonable driving distance of a major city like ATL. I'm very much a take off and go places, when I want to/where I want to kind of person. My car's mileage attests to that. I'm glad to hear good things about GSP. It's also appealing to have ATL and CLT nearby for options GSP may not have. That wouldn't be a new thing to me either. It isn't unusual for me to drive to another city from where I am to get better deals or timing for direct flights.

I'm not a religious person but have spent most of my life in the Bible Belt. I've learned with time how to find good common ground with people who think differently than I do. SC does seem to skew a little differently in terms of which faith traditions reign supreme but that doesn't worry me.

I was surprised 2.5 years ago at how alive Greenville's downtown area felt. I've never felt drawn to live downtown where I am, but have wondered if I ought to give it a go if I end up there. Seems like something that'd be good to do at least once, even if only for a year or so.

Two trips to SC in the space of six months, first to Edisto and then to the Upstate really got my attention. I'm also trying to make sure I don't focus on the appealing parts to the degree of overlooking the flip side. What don't you like about Greenville?

When I was reading up on Spartanburg, I realized it's got a rep as ""Murderburg."" I question that because I've lived in areas thought to be horrific by neighboring communities, but weren't too bad if you didn't go looking for trouble. What is your take on that? It seems to be more accessible if you're looking to buy a decent home without having to go too far away from a population center.

I wouldn’t recommend Harbison or Lexington due to the traffic. 

Avoid looking at any type of student housing. You don’t want to live in those. Most have student sounding names, but just check their websites anyway for any references to USC. If they’re there, it’s a student type complex.

2260,2260,greenrbor,"If it's alright I ask - Did you come across Greenville, like it, and choose to move there, or did something else have you end up there and it's a good fit? It appears to have a lively city center as opposed to comparably populated cities where downtown dies after 5 PM and and on weekends (e.g. where I live).

Good hiking is a huge plus. Weather there appears generally milder than both where I currently live and the coast - heat is another reason I pause about Charleston. I admit to preferring colder weather to extreme heat, but hot summers aren't enough to deter me.

Would you agree Greenville's crime tends to be in the same general areas/risk can be managed by personal awareness? After some of the spots I've lived in, I don't tend to pause over the same things most people will (especially going at this solo), but am trying to be reasonably diligent in where I look.

Being several hours inland appears to be a definite plus for diminishing storm force. It's wild to me I hadn't really noted the area before about 3 years ago.

With Columbia, the downtown scene is just kinda meh, and the main big thing in the area is Lake Murray. If you’re going to move here, you’re going to want to know a way to get to spend time at the lake.

For the record, while both are hot in the summer, Columbia is hotter. If you’re into snow, don’t come to Columbia because you’ll never see it. If the beach is your thing, Columbia is only two hours from the coast. If you’re more into the mountains, just do Greenville because you’re practically right there.",1581036844,fgr2rc7

They took us downtown to falls park and it was like a Norman Rockwell scene. Beautiful park by a waterfall, families playing. We were sold!!  There are many smaller towns in the Greenville area to live like Simpsonville, Greer, etc. the coast of living is definitely cheaper than Florida. As for the weather it does get hot here in the summer but nothing like south Florida. Also lots of mountain biking, hiking, outdoors stuff to do.

Do you have specific recommendations for a visitor?

No joke, I was just looking at pictures of Lake Hartwell before reading your reply. It's one thing that sticks out when I look at a map of the region. I actually prefer swimming in lakes. I know Greenville has several relatively close as well.

If I had to pick between a beach nearby and mountains/lakes nearby, I admit I'd pick the latter. Though since 4 hours or less is ""close"" in my book, it seems like vast swaths of the state fits. One of the most compelling things about it to me.",1581037689,fgr43g2

Concerning cost of living, I was typing ""I don't understand how my Florida friends afford it"" but truth is they really don't. Everyone my age I know there is looking elsewhere - none of them, or even most older people I know, can afford living apart from roommates or family. That's great when it works but I couldn't imagine not having the option to live alone if I needed to.

Side note- I also tripped out the first time it clicked that you don't really ""do"" a lot of Florida lakes because of what's in them. It is a fun place to visit but definitely a different culture than I'm used to.

The first time I went to Falls Park, I probably stared with slight head turns to take it all in for a good half hour. It was late morning on a Wednesday, so there were people out and about, but it was by no means crowded. At least when I was there, it was super clean, which was enough to really get my attention.

I've always figured I'd do smaller town/bedroom community when buying a house for cost per square foot, taxes, land space, etc. It seems like the setup there makes doing so and being able to get to Greenville for work manageable overall, especially because you've got other town/city options still within the same county.",1581038507,fgr5aqa

Crime in the United States has been recorded since colonization. Crime rates have varied over time, with a sharp rise after 1963, reaching a broad bulging peak between the 1970s and early 1990s. Since then, crime has declined significantly  and current crime rates are approximately the same as those of the 1960s.Statistics on specific crimes are indexed in the annual Uniform Crime Reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and by annual National Crime Victimization Surveys by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In addition to the primary Uniform Crime Report known as Crime in the United States, the FBI publishes annual reports on the status of law enforcement in the United States.

The economic policies of Bill Clinton, referred to by some as Clintonomics (a portmanteau of ""Clinton"" and ""economics""), encapsulates the economic policies of United States President Bill Clinton that were implemented during his presidency, which lasted from January 1993 to January 2001.

President Clinton oversaw a very robust economy during his tenure. The U.S. had strong economic growth (around 4% annually) and record job creation (22.7 million). He raised taxes on higher income taxpayers early in his first term and cut defense spending and welfare, which contributed to a rise in revenue and decline in spending relative to the size of the economy.

Here’s a the key points since you can’t/won’t read:

The stock market has added $6.9 trillion in market cap since Donald Trump was elected president.

That is already nearly half of what the market grew by in all eight years of the Obama administration.

Trump’s performance, as measured by the S&amp;P 500, is up 23 percent in the year since his inauguration, much better than the 13 percent average of first-year performances since 1928.

* Eliminate incarceration for drug possession, reduce sentences for other

But if someone is transitioning or transitioned they are taking hormone pills and I don’t know what other medicines but i have researched it a bit. The hormone therapy which completely changes  your body composition including muscle mass/muscle strength (as you mentioned.) as well as well as fat cell size and cardiovascular function. Also if the person has hormone therapy before they hit puberty it just completely changes them to the gender they prefer. You stated that their body still makes male hormone but if they are on hormone therapy it completely stops the hormones being made so it stops testosterone completely, i don’t think people realize that in that comments. I hope you read over this and considered why it could be wrong for them to enact a law like this.

Investigators said the young girl's death is being treated as a homicide and no arrest have been made. Investigators also did not say if they have identified any suspect or person of interest in her death.  


""This is a fluid situation, and we're working diligently on it,"" Cayce Director of Public Safety Byron Snelgrove said.  


During the search, investigators found the body of a man in the neighborhood. A new investigation is underway for that case, and Snelgrove did not say if the two deaths were connected.  


This case began Monday afternoon. Swetlik was seen on surveillance video getting off her school bus like normal.  


But then, suddenly, she was gone.  


Investigators released an image Wednesday showing two vehicles known to be in the area where Faye was last seen, Cayce Public Safety Department said tips helped them identify and locate the people in one of the vehicles.  


Investigators questioned the occupants of the SUV, but did not release any specifics from what they learned. Officers did say they still need help identifying the people in the car.",1581621520,fhibi6l

They already have it. All the programs SC loves so much are socialized. He's not calling for a socialist economic system, he's a social democrat, he supports a capitalist ideology. His Medicare for All bill would save us trillions of dollars over the next 30 years.



&gt; “We want to know how you are going to get things done and how you are going to pay for them

You can easily look that up [Feel The Bern](https://feelthebern.org/)


&gt;  Bernie’s proposals to raise taxes on almost everyone is not something the Lowcountry wants and not something I’d ever support

That's not what Bernie is proposing at all. Unless you make millions, you would not see any significant changes to your taxes.

&gt; “Bernie Sanders will not be the nominee,” he said.

2976,2976,p4lm3r,"This is why therapy is always the first step with a transitioning child. It isn't like one day they say ""I am x gender"" and then criminal parents force hormones down their throats. Hell, therapy can go for 2 years before the first hormone blockers are prescribed. Rates of suicide almost stop completely for trans boy on hormone blockers, therapy, and in some cases a ""low T"" dose. With therapy alone, suicide rates are cut by 65-75%(this data is still hard to track in a state that doesn't capture the reason for all suicides).

Hormone blockers are meant to stop puberty. It is a pause button, but 100% reversible when stopped. This is the first step after blood work and a visit to an endocrinologist are finally established. Hormones are not introduced in this state until 16 years old, which for some trans people is 4-6 years after they came out. Only blockers are used for those under 16 in SC. 

Again, blockers stop puberty. This stops women's bodies from developing and men from getting hairy and their voice dropping. Blockers can save tens of thousands of dollars in surgery down the road, and again, the affects stop as soon as blockers are stopped. 

One of the things therapists are treating is called Gender Dysphoria. Gender Dysphoria is when you can't identify with the body you are in, and it can get so severe that anxiety disorder and PTSD tend to spring from it if not treated. Some Trans people won't shower or look in a mirror because of how bad it is. 

Mental health is absolutely an aspect taken into consideration for trans kids. That's why there is so much time spent in tharpy- usually with a psychologist that specializes with gender, and a separate psychiatrist who follows up. 

People who feel that transgender people are just pretending to be the other gender have a very misinformed view of what trans kids actually are going through.

Yes blockers put a pause on everything. If the child never receives the intended hormones how would they know what they are supposed to be? The pause button stopped them from growing up. The thing I want is to protect the children and wait until they are developed enough to know whether or not they agree with their body and are able to make mature rational decisions. Let’s call that age roughly 18-21. That’s not to say stop psychological treatment but rather promoting it to continue but I disagree with hormone use of any kind that is not medically necessary.

The thing I want is to protect the children and wait until they are developed enough to know whether or not they agree with their body and are able to make mature rational decisions. Let’s call that age roughly 18-21. That’s not to say stop psychological treatment but rather promoting it to continue but I disagree with hormone use of any kind that is not medically necessary. Edit go fuck yourself

The problem, most trans kids will kill themselves by 18 if they aren't in treatment. They almost assuredly will without supportive parents. The suicide attempt rate for non-binary male to female trans kids is 51%- over half of female trans kids try to kill themselves. Female to male is lower at 39%, or over 1/3. The baseline is 9.8% of male kids attempt suicide, 17.6% of female kids attempt suicide. This is from the American Academy of Pediatrics. 

My goal was keeping my kid alive. My goal was not judging my kid. Our job as parents should be to keep our kids from killing themselves. If this means we have to be flexible with our perceived understanding of the world, so be it.

3111,3111,MoreInternetPlease,"I'm really glad you responded with this article. It's a good example of how politicians capitalize on the fact that most working Americans know absolutely nothing about how taxation works. I own 3 companies, 1 of which I pay zero federal income tax with, and there's a good reason:

&amp;#x200B;

Tax incentives are designed to encourage citizens (and the businesses they own) to do what the government NEEDS people to do more of. If the population is low, we can make tax incentives to encourage more production. If we are in a war and need ammunition factories, we can create tax incentives to encourage more production. In my case, we have minor housing shortage WITH tax incentives from the government. WITHOUT these tax incentives, we would have a MAJOR housing shortage. So by investing my money in something that is helpful to our economy, I get to keep my taxes so I can do MORE of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's too easy for a politician like Bernie or AOC to point at that article you shared and say, ""LOOK! They've got all this money and you should have more of it! It's not fair for you to pay taxes on your $20k-60k income while they don't pay taxes on BILLIONS!""

&amp;#x200B;

But this is absurd. Amazon does pay taxes. Read:

 [https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniedenning/2019/02/22/why-amazon-pays-no-corporate-taxes/#ec3319d54d5a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniedenning/2019/02/22/why-amazon-pays-no-corporate-taxes/#ec3319d54d5a) 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize, Amazon is doing what the government wants/needs them to do. When you do this, you get a tax incentive/break for doing it! They don't have to invest in R&amp;D, Real Estate, and pay their employees with more stocks... But since our government sees these activities as being vital to our long term success, they are willing to let Amazon (AND ANY TAX PAYING CITIZEN) have a tax break for choosing to invest their time, energy, and capital into these areas of production.

&amp;#x200B;

Bernie and AOC know this, but this article and narrative is just too ripe to not peddle. Gullible voters who actually believe the government can solve all their problems and hand them the American dream they have thus far failed to achieve eat this crap up. It's an easy thing to want, and an easier thing to vote for. But the reality is, Amazon pays all kinds of taxes, except federal tax when they decide to align their business practices the way the government wants them to for the benefit of our nation at large. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's the same for me. When I spend more time on my business that provides affordable housing, I pay no taxes. When I spend more time on other businesses that don't have tax incentives from the government, I pay more taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Show me a single business doing the same things as Amazon and choosing to forfeit their tax incentives... It makes no sense. That money doesn't get spent on strippers by selfish billionaires. It gets reinvested into those very things that brought about the incentive in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not the type to base a ton of logic on one article, so here's another for those who are interested in learning the truth about ""big bad Amazon,"" one of the companies doing the MOST for our country. 

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://www.accountingtoday.com/articles/tax-law-didnt-help-amazon-pay-zero-taxes-in-2018-it-was-just-savvy](https://www.accountingtoday.com/articles/tax-law-didnt-help-amazon-pay-zero-taxes-in-2018-it-was-just-savvy) 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, for those of you who honestly don't get ""taxes,""  doesn't it sound like common sense to you: The companies that perform the things our government deems most vitally necessary should get the biggest tax breaks, right? And why not!? Tax incentives are how governments guide our economy. It's how governments increase or decrease population growth. It's how governments guide the increase or decrease in food production. All of a sudden, Amazon gets painted as a big bad billionaire owned company that skips out on its taxes. No. Wrong. They are doing so much good for our country that our government is allowing them to keep SOME of their taxes (federal only, and only to an extent) in order to re-invest in the departments we NEED more companies investing in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Amazon = Good. Tax Breaks For Doing What Government Needs More Companies to be Doing = Good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Break free of this silly ideology that if we just remove tax incentives (that all governments have always used with great success), then we will all have more money and pay less taxes ourselves. It's so stupid, I almost wish it were true, too! But it's not. It's not that simple. That's not how the world works. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any politician who knows diddly squat about stimulating an economy would be PRAISING any company like Amazon, not demonizing them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want a president who helps working citizens become small business owners and who helps small business owners become BIG business owners. ESPECIALLY those who are running the types of business that help our country the most... Not a president who paints successful people as bad people. To be fair, we haven't seen such a president in my lifetime. Maybe we never will to that extent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Amazon deserves praise and respect. The more they invest the way our government wants, the better. However, any politician that can't publicly respect what Amazon is doing is just a jokester using a strategy that they hope will obtain the most votes.",1581692256,fhkw38g

3214,3214,felipefadora,"There are a lot of people who have moved here from the Northern states and I’m one of them. I’ll tell you about my experience for the past 1 1/2 years. This state is starting to fill up with semi/retired people and the housing construction reflects that but the roads are very far behind. Prepare to see a lot of dirt roads and traffic is miserable in a lot places around Columbia,Lexington and Florence as expressway are few and two-lane roads are the norm. A few native residents have expressed their dislike for so many people moving here to me.
There are a TON of military families, like holy shit, if you’re military then you’ll fit right in. I cannot stress this enough: RELIGION is everything to a lot of people down here. You’ll see churches around here everywhere. I am an atheist and the amount of eyerolling and judgement I feel when I tell people that is unreal. 
The worst is the job market. If you’re young and just starting out your career, it is not the best place to build that career. The wages down here are very low. Temp agencies seem to have a monopoly and any decent job opening seems to be staffed though on of them. I would recommend networking heavily if you seek a decent salary job. Once the boomers start retiring, that could be a different story. 
Schools are lacking. The houses aren’t as cheap as I was expecting but the property taxes are less. The schools really reflect that. I think SC is rated 49th or 50th for education. I make my kids do supplemental school work, so when we eventually move back to north, they won’t be so far behind. I remember attending college in PA with a couple of kids who won scholarships who were SC, and they were extremely far behind in curriculum. 
Seeing generational poverty is pretty common down here. I have never seen so many abandoned properties as I see down here. 
The majority of the state is black, which was surprising, I thought I was coming to a redneck hellhole, there are its pockets with majority white people but very few. Diversity is lacking otherwise. 
The weather is pretty nice year round, there is hardly snow but it can be chilly at times. Hurricane season can bring some seriously beautiful storms. The summers are hot and very humid, you’ll get used to heat eventually, though and 70 degrees will have you feeling like you’re freezing. 
The state could go either way in the next 10 years, it could either be an investment or it could remain to be behind the times. 
I’m just stating my personal view on the state. I think this state is really enjoyable  for those who are retired and live along the coast. For myself and my family, we find the state to be extremely boring and my career has taken quite a hit, considering I’ve been laid off twice since moving here. 
I’ve lived in quite a few states and SC has been the worst. Again, this has been my experience.",1581766566,fhonnrd

I would say if you’re looking for better deals on home prices - check out Simpsonville (not Five Forks), Easley, Powdersville, Mauldin or Greer 

To answer your question about what I do not like about Greenville: it is very much my personal preference, but I prefer a larger metro/city. Greenville is a bit small for my taste. Since college I’ve lived in Atlanta and DC. I’m moving to South Florida in a few months (all for work). But living in Greenville again the past 3 years I’ve come to appreciate Greenville - it really hits a sweet spot for big city amenities, quality of life and cost of living. Can’t beat that. I also prefer a city that has a larger lgbtq population. Other than those personal preferences there isn’t much I would complain about in Greenville!

That's my line of thinking for the most part. I consider a number of factors and don't hinge everything on what's available on Indeed or what figures the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases. Upstate SC has about the same metro population as the metro I live in now, and the industry seems similar, so it seems to be the best choice based on a 1:1.

Florence also seems pretty isolated where having other population centers/amenities nearby is concerned.

The trip to Moscow (and other Soviet cities) was part of a trip that President Reagan was also participating in.  While Sanders did criticise American policies to a Russian audience, which caused a Republican he was traveling with to leave the room, Bernie felt that honest criticism of his own country helped the Russians respect and appreciate his equally critical comments about the USSR.  This trip also gave him a better perspective regarding his previous views on communism and helped him reign in some of his more radical beliefs.


From The Hill article referencing the Washington Post report of this:

'David Kelley, a Republican who helped arrange the trip for Sanders and accompanied him to the Soviet Union, told the Post that the former Burlington mayor's remarks at a banquet in Yaroslavl made him uneasy enough to leave the room as Sanders was speaking. Sanders rebuffed Washington's intervention in other countries in the remarks.

""When you are a critic of your country, you can say anything you want on home soil,"" Kelley said. ""At that point, the Cold War wasn't over, the arms race wasn't over, and I just wasn't comfortable with it.""

Another person who accompanied Sanders on the trip, Howard Seaver, told the Post that he saw the visit as influential to the senator - an experience that showed him ""the downside of the Soviet system"" while shaping his views on social welfare and economic equality.
 
""I suspect that what Bernie saw in Russia probably affected his views that you see today, where he is not anti-free-enterprise or capitalism but he wants to have a safety net and give a fair shake to all, but certainly not to have a command economy we saw in the Soviet Union,"" Seaver said.

Upon returning from the trip, Sanders held a news conference in which he made clear that he did not hesitate to criticize the U.S. while in the Soviet Union. But he also pointed out the poor quality of housing in the communist country.

""The fact that we were willing to be critical of the United States ... I think that made them maybe more appreciative of our criticisms we made of their own society,"" Sanders said at the time.

""We were saying, 'Yeah, in our country, we also have a housing crisis. Our housing in general is better than yours, but people are paying 40 percent of their income for housing. The quality of your housing is not good, but we appreciate the fact that people are paying 5 percent. The quality of your health care is not good, but in the United States, believe me, we have enormous problems in terms of our health care system.' ""

Sanders's trip overlapped in part with a historic summit in Moscow between then-U.S. President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev - a meeting that Sanders hailed at the time as ""a major step forward for humanity.""

The trip also took place just a day after he married his second and current wife, Jane Sanders. The trip was described by Bernie Sanders as ""a very strange honeymoon,"" according to the Post's report.'",1581808768,fhqq5ho

I really like Burrell's Ford for the isolation, but the mountains are just going to be cold in March no matter what. You might want to consider looking for some options at the coast. 

One thing to note is that in maintained campgrounds that have actual reserved spots and all you are more likely to have other people around, so having a big party might not be the best idea. Most national parks offer some sort of backcountry camping which means you can walk in and camp wherever. You might want to do some research on spots where that is possible so y'all can have a good time and not be bothered by anyone. But then you run into the issue of a lot of places not allowing fires in backcountry camp spots.

I grew up car camping /pop up rving. 95% if our trips were to the same state park in the NC piedmont where my parents slept and I read mad magazines, punctuated by cooking and the occasional game of uno. The other 5% were trips to KOAs and the like to see major attractions or family. Needless to say my impression of family camping as a kid is that its pretty lame.  
   
I've been slowly collecting gear to go car / tent camp, but being unfamiliar with camping down here,  any unique hazards to be aware? Up in NC it was copperheads, black widows and brown recluse, but they generally stayed clear of camp sites.  Bout the same here?

3373,3373,OldMedicDoc,"To start, we always use the [South Carolina State Parks](https://southcarolinaparks.com) website for information and reservations. Some sites you pick will have a picture of the site. If not I recommend going to [Campsite Photos ](https://www.campsitephotos.com) to see most of the sites. 

We have found that not all bath houses are created equal. You will find some that are still old as the day they were built all the way up to modern brand new with heat and a/c and instant hot water. 

We have two small kiddos ourselves who love being outdoors. We find that as long as we set a perimeter around our camp site they do just fine. There are various camp grounds with different things for the kiddos and adults alike to do. We like to bicycle together and like to ride around in some of the campgrounds that have paved and level bike paths. Most campgrounds have a kid playground and we even found a putt putt course on one of them. There is also fishing and most campgrounds even rent out equipment to use. There are paddle boats, swimming lakes with beaches, tennis, volleyball and of course a small store at most check in spots that carry all your basic needs for camping. 

We have also noticed that if the camp store doesn’t have it there is Dollar General Store always near by each h State Park campground. 

As far as growing up camping it sounds like you and I may have grown up in the some of the same campgrounds. I remember KOAs and various other campgrounds with their all metal playgrounds tent camping and then eventually moving up to a pop up camper. I camped all through cub scouts and then Boy Scouts and then fell out of camping for some time. Then one day I was given a lot of camping gear by a friend and well got back into it again and have never looked back. 

As far as unique things to look out for... we have about the same wildlife to watch out for as NC. 

We keep our kiddos busy by bringing the things they like to do at home with us on our camping trips. Books, coloring books, word search books, outdoor games and of course making good use of the park’s amenities that are available like playgrounds and kid friendly events. 

I feel all the perks have been kid friendly for our kiddos. As far as extra friendly we look for the ones with a lot to see and do. One of our absolute favorites is [Hunting Island ](https://southcarolinaparks.com/hunting-island) and for our favorite non state park we really enjoyed [Pirateland Campgrounds ](http://www.pirateland.com)

There’s tons of advise online for activities and such. My best advice would be to take them to visit some parks on day trips and see what you like. Take them to James island county park, Huntington Beach, or other ones near you and get them used to hiking. Once they’re used to it, they entertain themselves, sticks, rocks, and bugs are all they need for an afternoon of fun. 

Once you’re ready for an overnight trip, start close to home and easy, you need to be able to retreat home if you have to. Pack plenty of home comforts, toys, books, etc. Lots of their favorite food.

Now. When we look at the electoral map. Trump annihilated Clinton with 304 electoral wins compared to Clintons 227. A complete landslide. Not even close.

I'll say it again since you seem to have missed it last time. I'm not taking any issue with the data you've provided, I'm taking issue with how you're interpreting it. You're taking a high level data set and drawing low level conclusions from it. It makes no sense. You say you've lived in Charleston, and in the same breath say Mt. Pleasant is a violent/crime ridden city. That doesn't square with reality, and pointing to the average crime rate of the entirety of Charleston County to draw that conclusion is objectively ridiculous. Obviously areas with extremely high crime like North Charleston are going to skew the results of much safer areas.

Here's some lower level data to help us draw the appropriate conclusions: [https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/south-carolina.xls](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/south-carolina.xls)

From the table, you can clearly see Mt. Pleasant is one of the least violent cities on the list. Isle of Palms and Sullivans Island (both suburbs of Charleston) are #10 and #11 safest cities in the state respectively. Interestingly, the five most violent cities in the state are Yemassee, Ware Shoals, Batesburg-Leesville, Jamestown and Estill, all with populations at or below 5,000 people. In other words, your methodology sucks and the conclusions you are drawing are meaningless.

I said you were coming across as ridiculous not because you were so blatantly wrong (I'm wrong all the time that's no biggie) it's your sanctimonious and belligerent attitude *on top of* being so demonstrably incorrect that's getting you downvoted.",1582394750,fifzpz7

Again. I never said that. Feel free to quote where I said that. What I said was crime levels are indeed rising in Mt Pleasant and that the Charleston area (That includes Mt Pl.) is one of the most violent places in the country.

The fact you need to invent a narrative to to play the ""bad attitude"" bullshit victim card is sad. I'd refer back to South Carolinas declining educational system..

Argue facts  are wrong  all you want. It still doesn't change the fact that OP stated some of the most violent areas in the state.

The only person misinterpreting data is you. Mt. Pleasant is in Charleston county. One of the most violent places in the entire country. That's that. Until you can prove the FBI and Sled data wrong. Again. Keep blowing hot air.

So you’re not saying Mt. P is a violent city, you’re just saying it’s one of the most violent areas in the country? Give me a break. The FBI data (city level crime data) in no way backs that opinion up. You’re either ignoring data you don’t like, or ignorant to how statistics work.

The original point was that urban and suburban areas are more violent than rural areas. City level data makes it clear that simply isn’t true. Using county level data makes no sense because county level data blends rural, suburban and urban areas so making individual claims about individual areas within the larger data set is ridiculous when we have more precise city level data to reference. 

You are correct that Mt. P is located in Charleston County, but Charleston County isn’t even in the top 20 most violent counties in the state *according to the data you provided*. SC as a whole doesn’t even make the top 10 in most violent states, so I’m scratching my head trying to figure out what data you think backs you up.

Daniel Island and the city of Charleston buffer it. 

Also, look at the quote you posted: ""*Mt Pleasant and the Charleston areas* are some of the most violent crime riddled areas in the entire State of South Carolina"". The crime FBI crime stats you're referencing do not support that statement in any way. North Charleston specifically has a very high crime rate. Mt. Pleasant, Sullivans Island, Awendaw, West Ashley, Hanahan, Summerville, etc. demonstrably do not have high crime rates. The Top 10 most violent areas in order based on the FBI crime statistics are: Estill, Jamestown, Basteburg-Leesville, Greenwood, Ware Shoals, Yemassee, Latta, Marion, Hartsville, Swansea. Notice North Charleston isn't on that list. 1 being the worst, North Charleston is number 33.

Lots of people in Canada with money come to the US for treatment so they don't have to wait 6 months to see a doctor or get a treatment they need. Talking to Canadian friends and family (my 3 half siblings are canadians) Canadas system would fall apart if they didn't have the US as a pressure release valve, since those Canadians would have to get their work done in Canada adding to the costs and making wait times even longer.

 Also, there is no way that we're going to suddenly cut are costs to the Canadian levels. From the left wing Vox.

  [https://www.vox.com/health-care/2019/4/29/18518215/medicare-for-all-costs-adam-gaffney](https://www.vox.com/health-care/2019/4/29/18518215/medicare-for-all-costs-adam-gaffney) 

&gt; I think awareness of the fact that every dollar spent on health care is being spent on something, so you have to be willing to put your finger on where do I want the reduction to come from. We can eliminate profits. Fire departments don’t have profits, schools don’t have profits. We can get rid of advertising, we can get rid of bonuses, about 50 percent of administrative spending. But beyond that, I’m not going to claim they can produce the same amount of health care for less. I can’t say when that will happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

and the whole program will likely cost significantly more than what Sanders is suggesting At least twice as much. 

Here's another article from left-wing VOX

[https://www.vox.com/2016/1/28/10858644/bernie-sanders-kenneth-thorpe-single-payer](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/28/10858644/bernie-sanders-kenneth-thorpe-single-payer)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They're also apparently malleable. When I pointed out that the yearly savings numbers they were presenting on prescription drugs were literally impossible, the Sanders camp revised the number to $241 billion — huge and arguably implausible but not larger than total annual spending on prescription drugs. A follow-up email also revised down the assumed administrative savings from 16 percent to 13 percent and the savings on utilization up from $216 billion to a whopping $660 billion.  
&gt;  
&gt;""They are just throwing things against the wall to see what sticks,"" Thorpe says.

 

&gt; Under Bernie's plan private insurance can still cover extras like cosmetic surgery that Medicare for All won't cover. 

Medicare which is what sanders plan is based on already covers cosmetic surgery if it's medically necessary, same with most private insurance, and since private insurance can't legally compete with his M4A they won't be able to unless you're talking about elective cosmetic surgery like boob jobs...which already aren't covered by anyone, because how the fuck could they be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, no country has a system like he has, the closet is Taiwan and even they have co-pays, there is no way to create the system he wants and not get overuse and abuse without putting some kind of co-pay into the system. 

Overuse is actually a serious problem worldwide.

[https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/journal-article/2017/feb/combating-overuse-and-underuse-health-care](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/journal-article/2017/feb/combating-overuse-and-underuse-health-care)

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't true. 

&gt; So, what will happen is that the public plan will have all the sick people and costs will balloon. This is a bad system because health insurance works best when the pool is universal with healthy people offsetting the cost of sick people. 

Nearly all countries and all of our peers have private insurance coverage, and many have direct competition. Hell, some basically don't have a universal system at all and are basically exclusively private insurance like the Netherlands.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;The Netherlands and Israel are good examples of this type of system. In both countries, citizens are required to purchase coverage from a private plan. Somewhat coincidentally, the Netherlands and Israel both have four dominant health plans in their private markets.  
&gt;  
&gt; “They compete on what other benefits do they offer, and the price of the premium too,” Osborn says. “Generally, though, people don’t switch insurance very much. They tend to stick with their plans for a long time, even though they have the option to switch each year.” 

Sander's plan is probably the least financially viable and the least practical.",1582446600,fijgafi

Also, yes, Canadians may may have to wait for non-emergency procedures, but you know what? I've had to wait for my doctor for months too if it wasn't an emergency, here, in the US. 

&gt;Also, there is no way that we're going to suddenly cut are costs to the Canadian levels. From the left wing Vox.

Since we spend about twice as much (in your article), even if we don't cut to their level, it would still be an improvement! It is still a reduction as t[he latest study](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/02/15/sanders-applauds-new-medicare-all-study-will-save-americans-450-billion-and-prevent) says, we can cut $450 billiion and save 68k lives. Besides we never quibble so much about our bloated military budget, which is greater than the next top 7 nations combined. 

&gt;Also, no country has a system like he  has, the closet is Taiwan and even they have co-pays, there is no way  to create the system he wants and not get overuse and abuse without  putting some kind of co-pay into the system.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overuse is actually a serious problem worldwide.

And no country has abandoned their system. Your assertion that there is ""no way"" is simply an assertion. Allowing private insurance to exist will certainly ensure spiraling costs because, as I explained, the private sector will offload the sick people. Right now people lose their insurance when they stop working because they are too sick to work. [""In practice, public-private competition means that private firms carve out the profitable niches, leaving a financially depleted public sector responsible for the unprofitable patients and services.""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2099512/pdf/bmj-335-7630-ac-01126.pdf)

Yeah, the insurance companies say this too as if just repeating it will make it true though study after study tell us that we will save money. They are deathly afraid of losing their cash cow.

Well, you can assert that I guess, but the data does not bear that out.

&gt;A vast majority — 70 percent — of  Americans in a new poll supports ""Medicare for all,"" also known as a  single-payer health-care system.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Reuters–Ipsos [survey](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-progressives/) found 85 percent of Democrats said they support the policy along with **52 percent of Republicans**. [source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/403248-poll-seventy-percent-of-americans-support-medicare-for-all)

And yeah, I recognize that South Carolina is red, but here's something interesting. Bernie flipped a US House seat that had been Republican for 55 of its 57 years and then he flipped a Senate seat that had never been non-Republican for 152 years since the party was formed. So, there's still hope for SC. Ideology takes a back seat when practical things like people's lives are on the line. 

&gt;  
The same people that decry that the government is a corrupt racist institution now want to expand it

You're not listening closely. They are not decrying ""government"" per se.  They are decrying the *people in the government* at present and the people buying the government.  They want to get rid of the corrupt people IN government, like Trump, but there are others in both parties. It depends on who is in the government. You think somehow if we don't have these programs,  government will be ""small.""  No, when government pulls out, there isn't a vacuum; some other power takes its place. That power is the corporate sector -- they control the government. The corporate sector screams about 'small government"" because they don't want to be restrained and want to do whatever they want to make money no matter who they hurt in the process. Asking for ""small government"" therefore is asking to be ruled by the corporate sector that we as ordinary people have NO WAY OF CONTROLLING. At least with the government, we can vote people out, but can you vote out the board of directors of Amazon? The corporate sector only screams about ""small government"" when it wants to do something for the 99%. It has no problem with ""big government"" when it wants to give handouts to them. For example, the bailouts of banks and auto companies in 2008. And most recently Trump's multi-billion dollar give away to [corporate farms](https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-trump-farm-bailout-20190528-story.html). The sensible thing to do is for people to take back the government from the corporate elite, so that we can use it for all our benefit as it was meant for in a democracy. So, I'm wondering, why on earth are you defending ""small government"" -- the propaganda of the elite. Unless you are part of the billionaire class or their minions?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nobody wants to subsidize your life. You are free however to move to one  of these other countries that will - if they’ll take you.

Nobody is subsidizing my life. I just want my taxes to go to me and the 99% and not to a bloated military budget and endless wars in the MidEast and to defense corporations like Lockheed Martin.

&gt; I know Canadians too! And they love their healthcare and they wouldn't trade it for the US system, not for the world! They think our system is crazy.

That's not an assertion on my part, that's all the experts who are PRO universal health care, being quoted in articles written by a far-left news site Vox. They're the ones saying it. Not me.

&gt; And no country has abandoned their system. Your assertion that there is ""no way"" is simply an assertion. 

Also, that's not true, plenty of countries have robust private insurance and don't have cots that spiral out of control. One of the articles lists several. Including Australia, which has both, the Netherlands and Isreal which have ONLY private care. 

&gt;Allowing private insurance to exist will certainly ensure spiraling costs because, as I explained, the private sector will offload the sick people 

It's not the insurance companies that determine costs, it's the providers, the hospitals that do, they're the ones that determine costs. 

I'm not against a Universal system, but I like Sanders the least, I think Tulsi's plan which mirrors Australia is far better. 

It's not the insurance companies that are overcharging us for treatment and medicine, it's the hospitals and the pharmaceutical companies.

And I grant you that the providers and hospitals are also to some degree responsible for spiraling costs, but it is in part because they have to cover the administrative overhead of having to deal with private insurance. Furthermore, the government, as a single-payer will have more bargaining power with the providers as is the case now with Medicare.

Because I'm willing to pay extra to have more control over my medical care including my choice of a primary caregiver or ability to get procedures I need done quickly rather than have to wait for a long time, like poorer Canadians have to deal with. Rich Canadians travel to the US and get health care they want. Poor Canadians wait in lines. 

  
If I VOLENTARIALLY want to pay a little bit extra of my income to get the care I want and someone is willing to provide that...I don't see what the problem is, or why the government should get involved. MY health care is MY business. This is why I prefer Tulsi's plan.

We passed Obamacare with a very slim margin, very slim, without any votes from the other side. The result was cycle after cycle of new energized candidates pledging to tear it apart. The opposition was so bad, that the Congress couldn't even amend the law to fix its flaws, or convince every state to implement it. The movement that sparked eventually ended in what we have now. If we want real enduring change, then it will need to be slow, incremental, and with a wide base of support. The country has to be brought to the point together.

3853,3853,joez37,"&gt;For the same reason, every other country has private insurance...because it's unfundable without it. Think of it this way, Bernie's M4A is going to cost 32 trillion over 10 years (assuming his figures are correct, and I'm not sure they are)  but lets say I need knee surgery and rehab and the whole thing is going to cost 10k, the govt is going to choose my doctor, tell me when they can schedule it, etc etc, well that 10k is coming out of the yearly pool of money we have, and I have to wait in the same line as everyone else. If I pay an additional portion of my income to have private insurance, and they cover my  knee surgery, then that's money not taken from the over pool, and I'm not in line blocking someone else.

You keep ignoring my sources without providing any sources of your own that his M4A will SAVE MONEY. Also, the government will not tell you which doctor to go to. You choose your doctor, the only difference is the payor -- the government will pay instead of your insurance. You have more choice with M4A because now, you are limited in your doctors by your insurance company. If your doctor is not in their network, you have to go to another doctor. So, now, it often happens that when the employer switches insurance plans you can't use your doctor anymore -- this has actually happened to me more than once! And I told you that I and others have had to wait months under private insurance as well. And actually I know of a lady who could not use a particular hospital, which was a really good research hospital because she did not have traditional Medicare. She had one managed by private insurance and it limited her choice. In any case, what I like is that Bernie is firm on M4A whereas the other candidates have back pedaled -- already -- meaning that they will very likely cave to the private sector as happened under Obama. It's not good to back off even before any negotiations have started.

&gt;If I VOLENTARIALLY want to pay a  little bit extra of my income to get the care I want and someone is  willing to provide that...I don't see what the problem is, or why the  government should get involved. MY health care is MY business. This is  why I prefer Tulsi's plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;I mean  what argument are dem's making here, that things like Abortion are  intimate health care decisions that the government shouldn't be involved  in, but the government should be involved in EVERY OTHER kind of  medical decision.

You seem to be under the misunderstanding that you can't use the doctor that you want. But this is wrong. With M4A only the PAYOR changes. You make all your medical decisions, in consultation with the doctor of your choice. M4A only pays the bill. It does not interfere in what kind of medical care you decide to get.",1582497075,filaaf1

I never denied it would save money, but so would a single-payer option that lets us keep private insurance. 

Tulsi Gabbard's model would save money too. I'm concerned that their 450 billion might be on the overly optimistic side, usually, when people put info like that out and it only includes one number, it's the number that best supports their cause. What's the expected range, like 200-450 billion? 100-450 billion? While 450 billion could be the conservative estimate on the savings it's unlikely that's the case.

I'm not against universal health care, I never denied it would save money, but I'm very skeptical about their numbers. 

The reason why...

Well from the vox article before.

&gt; Sanders assumes $324 billion more per year in prescription drug savings than Thorpe does. Thorpe argues that this is wildly implausible. ""In 2014 private health plans paid a TOTAL of $132 billion on prescription drugs and nationally we spent $305 billion,"" he writes in an email. ""With their savings **drug spending nationally would be negative**."" (Emphasis mine.) The Sanders camp revised the number down to $241 billion when I pointed this out. 

As far as private insurance is concerned, if I want to spend my money on private insurance along with a single-payer that I'll be taxed on, I don't see why you should care, it's my money, if I feel like I'm getting a good service I'll buy, if I don't then I won't.

In the same way that a Ponzi scheme or chain letter initially succeeds but eventually collapses, socialism may show early signs of success. But any accomplishments quickly fade as the fundamental deficiencies of central planning emerge. It is the initial illusion of success that gives government intervention its pernicious, seductive appeal. In the long run, socialism has always proven to be a formula for tyranny and misery.

A pyramid scheme is ultimately unsustainable because it is based on faulty principles. Likewise, collectivism is unsustainable in the long run because it is a flawed theory. Socialism does not work because it is not consistent with fundamental principles of human behavior. The failure of socialism in countries around the world can be traced to one critical defect: it is a system that ignores incentives.*

&gt;President [Donald Trump](https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump) returned to [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.huffpost.com/topic/mar-a-lago) on Friday evening for the 29th golf-related trip of his presidency to his for-profit Palm Beach, Florida, resort, raising his total taxpayer golf tab to $133.8 million.  
&gt;  
&gt;That figure translates to 334 years of the presidential salary that Trump and his supporters frequently boast he is not taking.  
&gt;  
&gt;During [Barack Obama](https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/barack-obama)’s presidency, Trump frequently claimed he was playing golf too much and at too great an expense to taxpayers.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I play golf to relax. My company is in great shape. [@BarackObama](https://twitter.com/BarackObama) plays golf to escape work while America goes down the drain,” Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/152814332915363840) in December 2011.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Can you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf. Worse than Carter,” he [wrote](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/521813597799067648) three years later.  
&gt;  
&gt;As he began his own run for the White House, candidate Trump repeatedly promised that golf would never make it onto a President Trump’s schedule. “I love golf, but if I were in the White House, I don’t think I’d ever see Turnberry again. I don’t think I’d ever see Doral again,” he told a rally audience in February 2016, referring to his courses in Scotland and Miami. “I don’t ever think I’d see anything. I just want to stay in the White House and work my ass off.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet after three years in office, Trump has spent two-and-a-half times as many days on a golf course as Obama had done at the same point in his first term. If Trump plays golf both Saturday and Sunday, he will have played 248 times. Obama by his 1,123rd day in office had played 92 times.  
&gt;  
&gt;And because Trump insists on playing at courses he owns, the cost to taxpayers has been nearly four times as high as it was for Obama. More than two-thirds of Trump’s golf outings involve seven-figure trips aboard Air Force One, mainly to Florida and New Jersey, but also to Los Angeles, Ireland and Scotland. Obama, in contrast, played most of his golf on courses at military bases within a short drive of the White House.  
&gt;  
&gt;What’s more, Trump’s insistence on playing at courses he owns and profits from has put at least a few million taxpayer dollars into Trump’s cash registers in the form of hotel room and restaurant charges for the White House staff and Secret Service agents who accompany him.  
&gt;  
&gt;[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-has-paid-rates-as-high-as-650-a-night-for-rooms-at-trumps-properties/2020/02/06/7f27a7c6-3ec5-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html) found recently that Trump’s business has charged the Secret Service as much as $650 a room per night at Mar-a-Lago ― more than three times the normal rate that federal employees are supposed to spend in South Florida ― and $17,000 a month for a cottage at Trump’s Bedminster, New Jersey, resort. During an early Mar-a-Lago visit, White House employees ran up a [$1,006 bar tab](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-taxpayers-covered-liquor-bill-for-trump-staffers-and-more-mar-a-lago), which taxpayers also paid.  
&gt;  
&gt;How many taxpayer dollars precisely are flowing into Trump’s pocket is not known because the White House refuses to detail how many executive branch employees stay at Trump properties and how much they are being billed. The White House on Friday did not respond to HuffPost’s queries on the matter for this weekend’s trip.  
&gt;  
&gt;The president is the sole beneficiary of the trust that now owns his family business. He promised during his campaign that he would separate himself from the Trump Organization should he win, but reneged on that pledge even before taking office.  
&gt;

It seems to be source for your 300M claim, since I couldn’t find anything else that gave any figures that high. As a response, Democide does not mean a death from communism. According to that source, more than 100M of those deaths were specifically from colonialism, and putting that on the shoulders of communism is a gross misrepresentation. Communism is not “when government does things,” it is a specific system of governance under a particular ideology. 

As far as the black book of communism, the beginning of [this article](https://medium.com/@discomfiting/debunking-communism-killed-more-people-than-naziism-7a9880696f67) provides a good breakdown on many of the exaggerations and even outright lies about deaths under communist regimes.

This makes sense because the ideology of communism, and it’s economic counterpart socialism, hold a root ethical premise called collectivism. This is when you view the individual as having value only insofar as it relates to the group. Obviously, this type of ideology will eventuate in authoritarianism and, as history has demonstrated, mass murder by government of its own people outside of armed conflict.

It’s not a controversial claim that the communist and socialist regimes are oppressive. History has demonstrated that governments that implement those ideologies have citizenry with less liberty. It might be worth researching Hitler, Mao, and Stalin with an objective eye.",1582534412,fimkjjq

If you look at some leftist theory, like mutualism, the end goal is actually the abolition of the state rather than having a super oppressive one. Though, while this is nice in theory it’s very easy for greed to take over, which is why I think we’ve seen a lot of failed communist states. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t good ideas in there that we could incorporate without a complete change ideology. 

I just find that people often throw out huge numbers of deaths as a reason that we shouldn’t even try anything socialism-like, even when there are other countries trying these things that aren’t descending into dictatorship and authoritarianism (see the social programs in most of Europe)",1582555963,fin52h7

The ideas within these philosophies are flawed and incorrect, as there can never be abolition of the State under either, as there must be an enforcement class to implement and uphold the economic slavery required to uphold the system.

The reason why the places I’ve mentioned have failed is not because of improper implementation, but because communism/socialism are bad ideas. Bad ideas have bad results. They are both rooted in the premise that the individual only holds values insofar as he can serve the group and idea of a “greater good.” Majority does not equal majority and you cannot pick and choose portions of ideologies you like then mix and match. Ideologies are rooted in fundamental premises. In order for an ideology to work it has to be philosophically consistent without contradiction within itself.

No, he is playing golf and tweeting. Maybe you mean the low unemployment numbers and the stock market? As trump himself has said when he was running for president, those unemployment numbers are a joke. If you deliver pizza 4 hours per week you are considered ""employed.""

That's why 500k Americans go bankrupt every year from medical expenses.

1) I am just restating what Clyburn recently said. You don't have to like it.  It seems like you are making excuses for homophobia because you don't want to see it. 

2) Assuming you haven't been completely whooshed, do you even see the hypocrisy of this statement?  Rushing to defend one group from accusations of homophobia while rushing to accuse another group of homophobia. I'm guessing if this were a bunch of white conservatives who booed Buttigieg, and the headline accused them of being homophobic, you wouldn't rush to defend them.

The Trump presidency has done nothing to target any group. And no one in the administration has come outright and stated their constituents are homophobic like Clyburn did about black South Carolinians.

They literally never mention anything about homophobia, and are actively complaining about minimum wage. It has nothing to do with not wanting to see it, there was literally nothing at all in the article to even remotely indicate there was anything homophobic.

\&gt; *Assuming you haven't been completely whooshed, do you even see the  hypocrisy of this statement?  Rushing to defend one group from  accusations of homophobia while rushing to accuse another group of  homophobia.*

I don't think I buy your legitimacy argument, either.  US Presidents are often elected by margins in the low single digits, sometimes actually losing the popular vote! They are still treated as legitimately elected heads of state by the engines of government, foreign states, and the US populace. Even if the voter participation rate drops by 10% (which would be huge!), whoever wins the election is going to be the president, with the full panoply of powers that go with the office.

Besides, there aren't any great options, **ever**.  Even if you happen to like one of them in a particular election cycle, at the end of the day they're all politicians. This year is looking particularly bad, sure, but this country has survived bad (even awful) presidents in the past, and will continue to do so.

Checking out of the process is counter productive. Not casting a vote at all is **not** just as powerful as casting one.

Americans are currently paying for their healthcare which gives them choices and options. Paying for a service yourself vs. paying gargantuan taxes to a centrally-planned federal government which will then redistribute those funds to healthcare of which you will have very little options in return is drastically different things. 

Have you seen the rate of which medicare pays medical bills? I work in a field where I can see that a $10,000.00 ER bill will receive about an $800.00 payment from Medicare and the hospital has to write off the rest. John Delaney mentioned this numerous times in the early debates, but no one is sophisticated enough to understand his point, in that hospitals and doctors CANNOT survive on current medicare rates. 

Then the flip side of that is, if you raise the medicare rates, the cost will become even more astronomical.  This plan would be absolutely disastrous for this country. How about the residual effects? Less money for healthcare services being paid = less salary for doctors = less people who actually want to go into the medical field = downturn in overall nationwide healthcare services. Taking away market incentives and replacing it with a centrally-planned program destroys ingenuity and results.
 
On top of all of that, you could seize every dollar from the ""1%"" and you still wouldn't even begin to pay for all of these plans. This is nothing more than fantasyland economics.

Efforts are ongoing to repeal the Affordable  Care Act which would exacerbate health-care inequities. By contrast, a  universal system, such as that proposed in the Medicare for All Act, has  the potential to transform the availability and efficiency of American  health-care services. T**aking into account both the costs of coverage  expansion and the savings that would be achieved through the Medicare  for All Act, we calculate that a single-payer, universal health-care  system is likely to lead to a 13% savings in national health-care  expenditure, equivalent to more than U.S. $450 billion annually** (based  on the value of the US$ in 2017).

&gt;**The entire system could be  funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and  households paying for health-care premiums combined with existing  government allocations. This shift to single-payer health care would  provide the greatest relief to lower-income households.**

It’s very similar to Bernie’s performance thus far. To address your second point, the reason you don’t see more down ballot progressives is the DNC refuses to adequately assist those campaigns with funding, choosing instead to push middle of the road centrist candidates who don’t have much success rate in getting elected either. However, like you say at the beginning of your post, the progressive agenda of legalizing pot, m4a, etc are popular on their own. You are correct, it is a high risk, and right now we are at a major turning point for the Democratic Party. If a progressive can make it to the White House on these issues, regardless of how many can actually be realized within 4 years, it puts forward the idea that you can run on and win these ideas, which would do a lot for down ballot progressive candidates.

You're seriously routing me to his own website? Do you actually think that he has any incentive to provide legitimate math, rather than pie-in-the-sky wishful thinking?  For instance, his spending on the ""green new deal"" would, in a residual affect destroy our economy. Do you understand that the majority of energy used in the US is fossil-fuel oriented? What would happen to our economy if you replaced that with even more costly provisions? The price of virtually every item or service would rise exponentially and most major corporations would crash and or have to lay off thousands. But hey, here's how we are going to pay for it! 

Here's an example from his website under how he's going to pay for this Green New deal.

&gt;\- Raising **$2 trillion** in revenue by making large corporations pay their fair share of taxes.

Oh we are just going to raise taxes! It's just that simple! Once again, no accounting for the thousands of jobs that will be lost accordingly. 

&gt;Collecting **$2.3 trillion** in new income tax revenue from the 20 million new jobs created by the plan.

Because it's just that simple! Of we will create 20 million new jobs, just like that! lol this is bafoonery. 

Now for Medicare for all:

&gt;In 2018, the typical working family paid an average of $6,015 in premiums to private health insurance companies.  Under this option, a typical family of four earning $60,000, would pay a 4 percent income-based premium to fund Medicare for All on income above $29,000 – just $1,240 a year – saving that family $4,775 a year.  Families of four making less than $29,000 a year would not pay this premium.

First of all, this assumes that we pay at current medicare rates, which are basically nominal compared to healthcare COSTS. Hospitals and practices would not be able to survive on medicare rates. This is why many doctors do not see patients with medicare or medicaid already. A private insurance pays more money to the doctor. Hospitals and clinics would most certainly shut down if they had to only accept these payments. What does that mean? Higher medicare payments? Welp, then that's more taxes. 

Via the Atlantic, not exactly a right-wing outlet:

""The Urban Institute estimates that a single-payer plan would require $32 trillion in new tax revenue over the coming decade. That’s slightly less revenue than its projected cost, because it would generate some offsetting savings by eliminating certain tax benefits the government now provides, such as the exclusion for employer-provided health care.

How big a lift is it to raise $32 trillion? It’s almost 50 percent more than the total revenue the CBO projects Washington will collect from the personal income tax over the next decade (about $23.3 trillion). It’s more than double the amount the CBO projects Washington will collect over the next decade from the payroll tax that funds Social Security and part of Medicare (about $15.4 trillion). A $32 trillion tax increase would represent just over two-thirds of the revenue the CBO projects the federal government will collect from *all* sources over the next decade (just over $46 trillion.)""

You see, the per-person cost of health insurance decreases for each person on that insurance plan -- not to mention that the number of people on an insurance plan determines how much bargaining power the insurance company has.  The optimal arrangement, then, would be to have everyone on the same plan.

Also, the tax increase on most Americans would be lower than what they currently spend on healthcare, once you add in co-pays, monthly payments, cost of prescriptions, etc.",1582730046,fitv3zb

4275,4275,ScroteyMcBallhair,"I’m just going to quote parts of your point and give my opinions on those issues you raised. All fair and valid apprehensions, and these are just my take on it as some guy with a job and a family.

&gt; I dont doubt that Bernie can win I only doubt that he can build the support he says he can because he has never demonstrated that he can actually do it. Will moderates flock to Bernie the way Trump pulled the whole GOP along with him?

Bernie can build the support to enact get elected and enact good policy. Right now he is outpacing everyone in the primary as far as funding goes, and has been performing very well in the contests thus far, and also polls very good nationally. I think moderates would flock to Bernie in the same way those same moderates flocked to Obama and then to trump. Obama ran on a progressive (albeit vague) message in 2008 and had an excellent grassroots ground game that won him that election.  Bernie is running a similar progressive campaign but actually campaigning on progressive policy rather than some vague idea of reform. The difference between him and Obama is Bernie actually has experience in government, and experience reaching across the aisle to enact good policy (the recent war powers act to stop funding The Saudis genocide in Yemen is a recent example). Which brings me to your third point (I’m addressing the out of order sorry)

&gt; The last democratic president was a moderate and was overwhelmingly popular and I think added more democrats to the party by giving young people an example to look up to and contrast to the current catastrophe. My point though it that people need to understand what we are looking at in this election rather than just saying Bernie will win because he brings people together when that is clearly not true.

Obama was overwhelmingly popular in 2008. He won in 2012 but nowhere near his 2008 numbers. The ACA was nationally a failure, largely because he is a moderate. He capitulated too much to republicans and insurance lobbyists giving us reform that was essentially dead on arrival, which many republicans ran against (including and especially trump) and won. Like it or not, trump ran a populist campaign that utilized people’s anger at the status quo and weaponized it to beat a centrist democrat and essentially end her career in politics. He is running an issues based campaign that highlights why the status quo is not working for more and more people.

&gt; On your second point moderates won the house in 2018 those backed by Sanders and Justice Democrats largely lost. I think we need to run candidates that best represent their districts but you also cant blame the democrats for not bankrolling DSA candidates. If you are only a democrat when it serves you dont expect them to fund your campaign to oust people who are active in the party.

Moderate democrats BARELY won the majority in the house, and the blue wave ended up being more of a blue trickle, largely below expectations. And this is after they lost both the house and senate during Obama’s presidency, who in your words is largely popular and should have easily been able to campaign for centrists and hold both. Centrists can only go right because they start at such a weak weak point to begin with, getting us to where we are now with Trump.

Sanders winning the nomination would be a real turning point for the Democratic Party and would give it a real chance to be a party for the people rather than the corporate neoliberal party it is now. If a centrist gets the nomination, not only will they lose, but they may as well just lose because it won’t get us anywhere different than where we have ended up anyway. The party will either change or cease to exist after 2020.",1582730813,fitwdzh

4283,4283,Dbrown15,"FDR's New Deal was implemented during the great depression, a time of economic disaster. Not to mention how studies show that such programs prolonged the great depression. 

Your point doesn't take into account the quality of healthcare. Cheaper =/= better. As I've said, you can enslave healthcare providers to do healthcare for free at zero cost, but where would the quality go? This is the exact same principle to a less exaggerated degree. People spend 10 years in school to make a great living as a doctor. They will not continue to do this if we cut the rug out from under them. The number of people that would run away from working in the healthcare industry would be exponential. 

Denmark has less than 6 million people and they tax middle class incomes at 50%, yet you're telling me that people, on average, will pay less in tax than they do on healthcare? In order for such plan to work, mathematically, I don't think so. 

Any service, whether it's healthcare of education should be ran with an incentive for competition to drive down costs. It is simple economics. Centrally planned economies fail. The only reason we have such ridiculous costs now in healthcare is the rapid expansion of Medicaid as doctors have making pennies on the dollar for more and more patients so all the costs have to be offset from people who make a living, and Medicare pays at rates barely above Medicaid. 

Bernie knows his plan has no chance of being implemented, so of course he has an incentive to put out the most ridiculous explanations of how it will be paid.",1582731806,fity2zw

Changing who pays the doctors / hospitals doesn't turn doctors into slaves, and while ""medicare for all"" shares the name ""medicare"" with the current plan, that doesn't mean the currently negotiated prices will roll over into the new plan.

In 2016 Trump ran as a populist and a peoples candidate. I think most people knew he was a terrible human being (though maybe not quite to the degree he's proved himself to be) but they voted for him as a big middle finger to Washington. Turns out he's a hardcore big business conservative and even crazier than expected. I'd expect this same voting block to say, ""OK, that didn't work, lets try the opposite."" At least with Sanders you know what you're getting and he's still a big middle finger to Washington.

The current Medicare prices are pennies on the dollar, which means that the ""negotiated prices"" can only go up in order to actually keep hospitals and clinics afloat. So when you see projected medicare for all costs, they're based on the most favorable current low medicare pay rates. Those rates cannot stay that low.  If they go up, that means it's more taxpayer money that will be required to pay for the services. 

Bernie is proposing wealth tax, higher tax for anyone making over $29k, higher capital gains tax, higher payroll tax, market speculation tax.  Whether or not the tax brackets change is meaningless if you stack that dozens of other hidden taxes onto incomes and business.

Because there are a lot of horses in the race still.   
In 2008, 3 people got 97% of the delegates, in 2020 that percentage was spread between 5 people. The top 3 only took 70% of the delegates this year. 

And while Obama did well in Iowa, he lost NH and NV. Bernie is the only candidate to win all three of IA, NV, NH.    


As far as delegates go he has 45% (45/101). If everyone but the top two (Pete and Benie) dropped out and we re-distributed their delegates based on leaning - giving all the Six centrists' votes to Pete and Warren's to Bernie - Bernie would still be beating Pete by 5 or 7 delegates (53/54 vs 48/47).",1582744833,fiunmjw

4429,4429,PedanticallySemantic,"&gt;Under a centrally-planned program, there's ONE provider, the federal government.

Have your read the bill for Medicare for all? It’s a single payer system. Instead of companies and individuals paying large sums of money to healthcare insurance companies so they can keep some for profits and determine what to pay for and how much to pay, that money will go to a government that will then pay for our healthcare. When the single payer bill is implemented, hospitals, clinics, urgent care centers, va facilities, etc won’t disappear. We will be able to go to any of them. Vets will also be able to go to any of them as well. And the these facilities we visit (I stead of fighting with multiple healthcare insurance companies, will submit the bill to only one.  Just like how Medicare billing currently work. 

&gt;How can you guarantee that most healthcare practices (including hospitals) will even be able to survive on medicare rates? 

The same way Medicare currently works. Medicare pays less but most doctors still accepts it because of the hypocrite oath. And most icu nurses like me are will to take a pay cut to stop seeing patients dies as a result of them avoided care because they can’t afford the deductible, or they were rationing or skipping their medications because they can’t afford their copays,

&gt;Maybe we can all be like VA members where you might have drive 2 hours to the nearest provider for an appointment scheduled 6 months in advance because that's the next available appointment. That's the sort of care you can expect when the only game in down is the federal government.

4435,4435,PedanticallySemantic,"&gt;There’s a reason rich Canadians and British flee their countries and come to the United States for Medicare treatment (Mick Jagger most recently) rather than stay in their own country which offers this free single payer health program you speak of. Cheaper is not always better. 

I can list people who have gone to countries with single payer systems to have healthcare. [Rand Paul recently went to canada and has surgery in their single payer system](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/14/rand-paul-canada-surgery-neighbor-attack-1099485).  But I hope this makes your realize who goes where for healthcare is a bad way to compare healthcare systems.

&gt;What happens when the single payer program decides that you are not worth the cost of the Medicare treatment you need due to your age or other defects in children? But it will be freeeee right?

I’m an ICU nurse. I hope you know we currently do that, and under our current private system we have a second layer of non-healthcare people putting more limitations on us, private health insurance companies.

&gt;Freedom being lost is not only the extra tax on the money I earn (in reality a higher tax to get a shittier service), but also the loss of the freedom to choose. If I wanted a different insurance plan I could get one. If I wanted to pay more - I could. If I want to pay less - I can.

This libertarian argument of taxation has been shown to be invalid, Ie debunked. The president you vote in with a taxation system I don’t agree with but I choose to live under the system and pay the taxes is not taking my freedom. I choose to stay and pay taxes. 

&gt;I guess on the bright side long wait times for medical service might have been exactly what we needed when ol’ Bernie had that heart attack. Might have been one less communist around.

Long wait times is also debunked.  Germany and Netherlands has a single payer systems similar to Medicare for all with close to the same wait times. And the studies that show Germany and Netherlands has longer wait times does not include the wait time a patient is waiting for doctors to get approval from insurance companies and it definitely does not include the wait times people place on themselves avoiding procedures because they can’t afford their deductible and copays for pain meds. If these are included in the wait times study, America would definitely have longer wait times.

4443,4443,PedanticallySemantic,"&gt;Paying for a service yourself vs. paying gargantuan taxes to a centrally-planned federal government which will then redistribute those funds to healthcare of which you will have very little options in return is drastically different things.

Please post here the taxes you would pay, under your income bracket, for Medicare for all? and please present a source?

&gt;Have you seen the rate of which medicare pays medical bills? I work in a field where I can see that a $10,000.00 ER bill will receive about an $800.00 payment from Medicare and the hospital has to write off the rest...Less money for healthcare services being paid = less salary for doctors = less people who actually want to go into the medical field = downturn in overall nationwide healthcare services. Taking away market incentives and replacing it with a centrally-planned program destroys ingenuity and results.

The VA, which has a similar pay structure, have they gone out of business? Has the lower rates of reimbursement in the VA caused the VA to go out of business or nurse and doctors who have lower wages than nurses and doctors in other facilities to leave the VA?(I’m not talking about the quality of care or the limited facilities in the VA, so please done straw man this argument). In countries with single payer system, when it was first implemented in those countries, did the nurses and doctors flee the country, or did facilities go out of business?  Again stick to you point about low reimbursements affecting single payer systems in the US or other countries. Do not engage in a strawman fallacy.

&gt;The man praised USSR for its first communist revolution and he knows that 

I can praise hitler  for being the at manipulating people and still think he’s a horrible human being for manipulating people. If you did catch his last debate. He did point our that is not communist and has spoken out against authoritarian regimes, but still admire their healthcare and education systems as a socialist.  And if yours a capitalist, your argument here is the same thing as me saying: you praise a system that has had child labor and indentured servitude.

&gt;Americans are currently paying for their healthcare which gives them choices and options. Paying for a service yourself vs. paying gargantuan taxes to a centrally-planned federal government which will then redistribute those funds to healthcare of which you will have very little options in return is drastically different things.

Choices of which insurance to buy does not equate to “I can see all doctors now”.  Medicare for all does give you access to the largest choice of which doctors you can see without being in or out of network.

&gt;On top of all of that, you could seize every dollar from the ""1%"" and you still wouldn't even begin to pay for all of these plans. This is nothing more than fantasyland economics. Denmark has 5.6 million people and middle class earners have half of their incomes taxed to pay for their programs. Tell me how a country of 330 million is going to make it work without having to tax at the same rate.

You just finishes saying reimbursement rates are lower and I just finished saying nurses and doctors are willing to accept lower pay for healthcare for all, I’m one of them.  Plus Medicare for all is a larger risk pool than any insurance company, which gives them leverage to have a lower reimbursement rate.  You may not realize the exorbitant amount your are paying for healthcare now and how much you will pay for it later.",1582777974,fiw8mkk

And being “unequivocally” opposed to corporate interests, despicable though they are, also means he makes powerful and influential enemies.

When it comes down to real dollars and cents, it would be inevitable that people, in large swaths, will choose to go into a different field than the medical field of salaries are cut. To what degree, we do not know, but it could be substantial.

Reimbursement rates are not juts lower, they're drastically lower.  For a $20,000.00 surgery, BCBS may pay $12,000.00 of that, write off $5,000.00 and patient left the rest.  Medicare may only pay $4,000.00 and the rest is written off (or patient left with $200.00). That's a typical pay rate for something similar. I still contend that there is no way this works in the long run as it was result in less doctors, less clinics, with the end result being healthcare rationing. 

Your comment of ""Medicare for all gives you the largest choice"" is purely speculative. And that doesn't account for the inevitable loss of providers over time. 

On taxes, I don't know how much I would pay, but I know my taxes would go up. My income is higher than the average income in the US and Bernie says that middle class taxes will have to go up. I'm *SURE* they'll go up by more than what I currently pay for my health insurance, which is around $200.000 per month. I also know that my 401k would likely struggle due to the excess taxes on corporations and Wall Street speculation taxes. I also know that the company where I work may have to lay people off because of more payroll taxes. And furthermore, as I've mentioned, at least Denmark is honest about the taxes that takes to pay for their programs, which is roughly half of middle class incomes.  If they have to pay half and only having 5 million people, there's no way we can sustain free college, free healthcare, free child care, elimination of college debt, AND a complete transition to carbon-free energy and ONLY tax middle class and above by small percentages. And I don't care what Bernie's website says. What he is proposing is mathematically impossible, and would residually destroy our economy. 

Bernie Sanders has said that he is against the profit-incentive model in economy. He wants to eliminate competition. This is an actual quote of his. He is *at best* a communist sympathizer.",1582809085,fix03ix

Sure, I’ll give you that people go to these countries for health care and vice versa. Research shows that between 100,000 - 200,000 people come to the United States for health related reasons and between 150,000 and 320,000 people leave the US for medical treatment - however only 15% of the US travelers head to Europe (the majority - 23% head to South America), but yet 24% of the inbound traffic is from Europe (trailed only by the Caribbean at 44%). (Source : https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/executive_briefings/chambers_health-related_travel_final.pdf) The numbers won’t show - and we can debate this all day - but to me the numbers seem to show those leaving the US are just seeking cheaper care - wherever it can be found. Meanwhile I think we can both agree no one is coming to the US for cheap service - so it must be the quality. 

Currently insurance companies deny treatments for people? What instances does this happen under? When has an insurance company removed someone from life support? Even when the insurance coverage is denied - does the patient/family have other avenues of treatment to research? You are going to have to do a little better than a blanket statement of -oh yeah that happens anyway - to prove a point.

I’m glad you choose to pay your taxes. Unfortunately I don’t think they give any awards for that. Once again stating something is debunked is not valid (or at the very least close to a good argument). I am in favor of lower taxes (note that I said LOWER, not none) and smaller government with less regulations. Your agreement seems to hinge on - I already pay taxes so I might as well pay more and increase government services/protection. In the same mind set - do you give money to charity? Why aren’t you giving 50% of your pay? Do you not care about poor people/bad situations? Are you an animal? (Obviously not - but hopefully you see the retardation of that argument). 

Long wait times are certainly not debunked! In Canada the median wait time to see a specialist in 2018 was 19.8 weeks! (Source: https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/waiting-your-turn-wait-times-for-health-care-in-canada-2018 ) Don’t know how you “debunk” that. The UK also has extended wait times placing a burden on the system. (Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/europe/uk-national-health-service.html) In 2017 193,406 people did not have surgery after 18 weeks of being referred. (Source: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/13/193000-nhs-patients-a-month-waiting-beyond-target-for-surgery) in fact emergency wait times in Wales have hit a record of over 12 hours just this month (source: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-51564205). So hardly debunked - you might want to do some research before you claim things are “debunked”. 

I’ll be happy to discuss the German health system with you - but I think it’s important to note that this system is vastly different than the “Medicare for all” plan being put forth by the collective dumpster fire that is the democrat primary candidates. I will agree with you that the long wait times that plague Canada and the UK are not found in Germany, however Germany has other problems that will also be problems for the Medicare for all plan - as I will lay out below. 

First of all Germany is not a “single payer program”. Health coverage is mandatory in Germany and citizens have two options - statutory health insurance (SHI) and private health insurance (PHI). As you can assume the PHI is very expensive. The SHI is not run by the government - it is privatized in the form of non-profit agencies - however it is strictly governed by statues that restrict pricing and the costs SHI healthcare providers charge. This is funded half by the citizen, and half by their employer. There are also co-payments required for medications, prescriptions, and treatments (probably losing half of the Bernie crowd here with any type of responsibility.) roughly 86% of the population is covered in SHI. (Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/us-single-payer-debate-comparisons-to-canada-uk-germany-2017-6?op=0#germany-a-non-single-payer-idea-5) 

Meanwhile those who can afford in can opt into PHI, and receive treatment at a mix of for-profit and non-profit facilities that cater to the PHI crowd. I wonder which one offers better treatment? If you are going to argue that all Germans receive the same treatment - why are there two different plans with two vastly different cost prices? 

Meanwhile - the control of prices has caused certain medications to be pulled from the market. Drug makers who cannot agree on a price with the insurance companies have simply removed the availability of the product. Diabetic and cancer treatment drugs are two of the main drugs that pharmaceutical companies price too high for the SHI to provide.(Source: http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/bms_and_az_pull_diabetes_drug_in_germany_527806?SQ_DESIGN_NAME=2&amp; and https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-health-care-systems-on-life-support-special-report-drug-pricing-medicines-public-services/)

While the cost to continue providing the SHI continues to grow - to the point Germany now spends 10% of its GDP (4th highest among OECD) with the main problem being more people on the plan than workers supporting the plan. (Keep this in mind when you remember the open borders policies that would allow whoever wants to seek treatment to have access to the system - another terrible idea). (Source: https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/how-germany-is-reining-in-health-care-costs-an-interview-with-franz-knieps) 

Germany’s major problem is continuing to pay for its healthcare coverage - a problem that Medicare currently faces. Under the current program Medicare is currently projected to be insolvent by 2026, if no changes are made to the current system. (Source: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-will-medicare-social-security-run-out-of-money-to-pay-all-obligations/#) that doesn’t exactly sound like the program I want to expand and have be responsible for my primary source of health care. It will require more funding just to continue to cover those who are Medicare eligible now - how much more funding will be necessary to cover the entire nation? Trillions of dollars? No thank you. That simply is not a solution - especially when you couple it with the “student debt forgiveness” and high tax rate proposals that will stunt( at the very least or destroy) our economy.",1582810344,fix1o5s

He negotiated and compromised quite well during his thirty years in Congress. He was known as the Amendment King for the number of amendments he managed to pass; and sponsored or co-sponsored many pieces of legislation with Democrats and Republicans alike. There have been many presidents who have never been ""on the world stage."" I'm happy with 30 years in U.S. Congress and forty years in politics as enough experience. For someone who supported and helped him campaign in 2016, you are suspiciously pointing out non-issues.  My apologies if I can't help suspecting your entire post. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;but if he is elected and Congress doesn’t play ball, it actually might cause the opposite effect of what you intend. 

Fearmongering about what if ""they"" don't go along is the kind of attitude that ensures that we never make progress. In the fight for change and progress, there will *always* be opposition. As Nelson Mandela has said, ""It always seems impossible, until it's done."" 

&gt;If those big moneyed interests can convince enough people to ignore or sidestep him, he will be seen as weak and ineffectual

That's why we the people must stand behind Bernie and help him in the fight. As he always says, he can't do it alone. We have to help him by standing behind him and demanding the changes that we want. If that means voting out members of Congress, so be it. His gaining the presidency will help with that.  Further, he is neither weak nor ineffectual as his consistent record of fighting for the same causes shows and the *fact* that he has single-handly changed the political discourse in this country such that now people know and are demanding what they need. He has already done so much in that alone. Always cowering in the face of those moneyed-interest IS being weak and ineffectual. 

&gt;Bernie can’t accomplish jack shit without coalitions and the ability to  persuade. All the lofty ideals in the world are wasted if he can’t get  people to go along. Give me 120 or so Justice Dems and BNC candidates, and then we can talk about Bernie as a viable candidate. I

While Graham isn’t perfect - he talks big game about things he is going to do and get started - and to date has failed to begin much of his promises - he has supported President Trump with an important vote to pass legislation - and more importantly - the continued approval of judicial nominees. 

While there is certainly much more he could do to advance the President’s agenda - the last thing I would want to see is someone elected who would balk at legislation or prove to be a liability or uncertain vote. As we’ve seen with Cunningham (a “impartial moderate”) he can talk all he wants but when Pelosi cracks the whip he jumps in line. 

I would expect any democrat - when it comes down to the final vote - on important issues such as protecting the second amendment, tax cuts, or other important legislation put forth by the President/Republican leadership that they would vote along with the rest of their party. For example Cunningham went from signaling he would vote against impeachment to agreeing that the case was absolute overnight. The last thing we need is more leaders who pretend to be “moderate” but in reality lack the balls stand up what South Carolina wants. 

I couldn’t be convinced to vote for any democrat running for either of the houses of Congress (or really any other position right now). The best they have to put forward is stopping the Presidents agenda out of spite, opening our borders and raising taxes. I would like to see Republicans gain seats in the Senate so we do not need to rely on RINO’s like Romney, Collins or Murkowski, and retake the house so we can put an end to the wasteful bullshit the democrats have put our nation through for the past 3 years and actually move forward and continue to Make American Great.",1582814307,fix77sk

[Tax Calculator for Norway here.](https://skattekalkulator2018.app.skatteetaten.no/?aar=2020&amp;alder=25&amp;alderEF&amp;kommune&amp;locale=en_UK&amp;sivilstand=UGIFT&amp;tolvdelVedArbeidsoppholdINorge=12&amp;tolvdelVedArbeidsoppholdINorgeEF=12&amp;vilHaTolvdel=false) You have to get closer to 500 Million NOK / 60 Million USD in order to get to the 40-50% mark. Or if you have a secondary employer, that will be taxed 50%, but again, you shouldn't really need that second job here. Paying for this is absolutely possible and is done by lots of nations already. The little extra in taxes still leaves plenty to live on to lead a comfortable life without the stress and worries of not having access to elementary services.

When it comes to healthcare, we have to pay at most \~$530 out of pocket before it becomes free for the rest of the year: [Read about it in English here.](https://helsenorge.no/foreigners-in-norway/exemption-card-for-public-health-services?redirect=false) But for regular doctor's visits that is \~$260. Considering a pretty minimum wage job in retail will net about $16-18/hour you can cover that in about two days of work. Everyone has 3-5 weeks of paid vacation during summer (you get 10% of last year's income in June) and most people will be earning more than that. In December taxes are cut in half so people can enjoy the holidays, and most of the time you'll get tax returns too.

When everyone contributes a fair share we can all live comfortably with all basic services provided, but with the choice to pay for more or different services if you want to. But you still contribute to the pool. This allows everyone to pick an education they want, regardless of background as long as they put in the work to be admitted. People are given a chance to succeed. As a student, you get a \~$400 grant monthly, with an option to borrow an interest-free (until you land a job or about 6 months after you complete your studies) $400 extra per month, and an extra $2000 in August / January to cover equipment and extras. Exchange students who come here can attend for free too.

While our current government is more conservative and is currently cutting taxes for the rich at the expense of the poorer, it's still very livable. Same with dentists and braces, if you need that it'll be covered (current government making it harder to get braces funded though).

Focusing on costs is disingenuous. We are already paying for most of these programs privately. Bernie's plan is to redirect the payments which is different than increasing the costs.

There are more or less two different definitions of socialism. The first is from Marx's theory in which socialism is a transitionary phase between capitalism and communism characterized by social ownership of the means of productions. None of Bernie's plans increase social ownership of the means or productions. However, this is the socialism you are referring to. The socialism of rural Africa, USSR, North Korea, etc.

The second type of socialism is gov't intervention in failing markets. We already have this. This is why we have interstates, public schools, an army, and firefighters. Bernie's plans are under this category but are designed to benefit poor people (though I'll accept your critique that this may not occur). This is why he calls himself a Democratic Socialist.

Ah, yes, the same people who promised that Obamacare would cut costs are now promising that an even bigger government program will be even cheaper.   And we should believe this nonsense because.....?

When has any government program come in anywhere near the projections of the Socialist Supporters?

&gt; Focusing on costs is disingenuous. 

No, it's not.  When you have a government that already has more debt than GDP, costs is the biggest issue they should worry about.

&gt; We are already paying for most of these programs privately. 

Exactly.  Private transactions are always cheaper, because you care more about your money than people who want to use your money to buy votes.   You know your needs better than distant unelected bureaucrats.

&gt; Bernie's plan is to redirect the payments which is different than increasing the costs.

Yes, redirect the money from private transactions between families and doctors who care about them to well-connect donors to powerful political campaigns.  We tried that with Obamacare, and costs have risen faster than any time in history.

Reality matters.

&gt; This is why we have interstates

Interstates were created for defense purposes, and had nothing to do with the needs of regular drivers.

&gt; public schools,

Which, when handled at the local level, were the best in the world.  Since the federal Dept of Education was created, our world rankings have dropped every year.  Just a coincidence, I'm sure.  Always, always, just a coincidence.

Government's are instituted for the common defense of people, so this one is no surprise.  Without the need for protection from baddies, government would not even exist.

Also because it's intuitive. One payer eliminates redundancies in the insurance companies and in the health providers. Try reading the science before you criticize. Facts matter.
2. Yes. The New Deal was full of a wide variety of socialist programs which rescued the economy and more than paid for themselves. Even some of the recent corporate socialism worked out. The auto companies repaid the government bailout with interest and the US made money. Facts matter.
3. Debt to GDP ratio is irrelevant according to modern monetary theory and doubly irrelevant for the US ever since Breton Woods. Facts matter.
4. Costs are irrelevant because there will be no increase in costs. We are already paying for these programs. Now we'll pay the government instead of profit-maximizing insurance companies. Also, you'll be paying for health care that you can use instead of health insurance which you may not. Facts matter. Old people get socialized health care. Soldiers get socialized health care. Poor people get socialized health care. Facts matter.
5. The Affordable Care Act slowed the growth rate of health care costs. There are dozens of peer-reviewed papers on this. This is despite the public option getting stymied in Congress which would have made insurance providers compete nationally. Facts matter.
6. Private transactions are not always cheaper. In fact, private markets are inefficient several different scenarios. This is covered in pretty much every Principles of Microeconomics class. However, many markets can achieve the efficient outcome with government intervention. Facts matter.
7. Governments provide defense because it is a public good and not suitable for private markets. Health insurers assert market power and health provision is full of externalities, incomplete pricing, and information asymmetry. Intervention would really help. Facts matter.

No, they don't.  They have rationing.  If we passed a law that said each person could only have one pizza per year, we would spend less on pizza, but it doesn't mean pizza is cheaper.   Instead, we'd have federally subsidized pizza that cost $10,000 each.

&gt;  Also because it's intuitive.

No, it's not.  It totally denies reality.  Look at the things that have free markets and lots of competition: computers, cell phones, shoes, food.

Look at the things where government spends the most or most heavily regulates: medical, telecommunication, education.

But just a coincidence, right? Always, always, just a coincidence.

&gt; Debt to GDP ratio is irrelevant according to modern monetary theory and doubly irrelevant for the US ever since Breton Woods.

This is obvious nonsense, as world history shows again and again.  Every heard of Greece?  Venezuela? Zimbabwe?

Reality matters.  Stupid academic theories don't.

&gt; he New Deal was full of a wide variety of socialist programs which rescued the economy and more than paid for themselves.

More obvious nonsense.  When Roosevelt was elected, the economy was on the road to recovery, as it had every other time in history.  Then, the New Deal was passed and we had the longest, worst economic downturn in history.   And the next time the government expanded wildly?  The LBJ/Nixon expansion -- the second longest and 2nd worst downturn in our history.   The next biggest expansion?  The Bush-Obama spending spree.  Care to guess when the third longest/worst economic disaster was.

Just a coincidence, though.  Always, always, just a coincidence.

&gt; e Affordable Care Act slowed the growth rate of health care costs.

More nonsense.  Medical prices have climbed faster since Obamacare than at any point in history.  You don't just get to make shit up to support your failed ideologies.

&gt;  Health insurers assert market power and health provision is full of externalities, incomplete pricing, and information asymmetry. Intervention would really help.

The only reason those things exist is because of government intervention.  In the areas of medicine that government isn't closely involved in doctor's decisions -- cosmetic surgery and vision correction -- prices have dropped dramatically and quality has gone up exponentially.   Same tech, same doctors, same schools, opposite result.

Probably just a coincidence.  Always, always, just a coincidence.

&gt; Governments are also instituted to provide for the common welfare. 

Which is why the Constitution tried to prevent people from voting themselves benefits from other people's labor -- because collectivism is the exact opposite of ""common welfare"".

&gt; Now you are saying the governments intervention as good as long as it's not federal government. Ok.

All decisions should be pushed to the most individual level -- individuals first, then families, then voluntary associations, then city, the county.... etc.     The people with the most knowledge and most accountability should make every decision possible.   This is why the federal government fails at everything.

&gt; Again, you are confusing dictatorships with socialism. 

Every socialist dictatorship BEGAN with the same promises Bernie is making: ""This time, we will be kind and for the people and everyone will be better off"".   These socialist dictators were elected.    But then, it turns out that socialism can't exist without violence, and this attracts the worst elements of society to power.

This experiment has already killed 100s of millions of people in the last 150 years.  

Do you really need to kill another 100 million to find out that the promises are empty and the result will be the same?

Part 1

&gt;The numbers won’t show - and we can debate this all day - but to me the numbers **seem** to show those leaving the US are just seeking cheaper care - wherever it can be found.  

One of the difficult things as a healthcare worker is teaching people how to interpret studies and not reject concepts not addressed by a study.  Although the study does present cheaper care as the most common reason Americans cite for going abroad for health treatment, it does not mean these countries do not have advanced care.

&gt;Meanwhile **I think** we can both agree no one is coming to the US for **cheap service** - so it must be the quality.

Another of the difficult things as a healthcare worker is teaching people how to evaluate methodology of studies to determine its quality.  The study does not evaluate the number of charity cases that medical facilities are bringing people over for **free care**.  

Another of the difficult things as a healthcare worker is teaching people how not to interject their own beliefs. The  study does not evaluate the inferior or superior nature of the care in America compare to other countries. Although the study asked people why they are leaving or coming is for cheaper care or quality care does not mean it is actually so, because this “survey” study does not evaluate the quality and cost to determine what the travelers are saying is true.

&gt;Currently insurance companies deny treatments for people? ...You are going to have to do a little better than a blanket statement of -oh yeah that happens anyway - to prove a point.

No I don’t. Because that’s how logical argument work. the person who makes a claim in an argument has the burden of proof.  You stated “I guess on the bright side long wait times for medical service might have been exactly what we needed when ol’ Bernie had that heart attack. Might have been one less communist around.” I presented information on how the studies you are alluding are not accurate. And if you provide facts to support a premise in your claim that helps to show your conclusions is true, and I show that your facts are not accurate,,then this results in an unsupported premises, and an unproven conclusion, and an invalid argument. 

Not only do you have the burden of proof, but also asking me **why** there were wait time for healthcare is irrelevant to addressing wait times in studies being presented as evidence that single payer systems have longer wait times, because these studies do not evaluate **why* there are wait time and its correlation to why there were wait times in the us or in countries with single payer healthcare systems.  So even if I do present the reasons there where wait times in the us, you would not be able to use the data to compare countries to the us in these studies that only evaluated wait times.

But if I were to indulge you and provide reason why claims were denied...

[Together these issuers reported 232.9 million **in-network** claims received, of which **41.9 million were denied**, for an average in-network claims denial rate of 18%.  Reasons for denial: 1-Determination of medical necessity. 2-Limits (e.g. day or visit limits) on covered services. 3-Degree to which issuers’ automated claims processing systems routinely deny certain claims. 4-Provider knowledge about which claims will be covered and how to properly submit claims. 5-Issuer reporting methods, for example, in how to count partial approvals](https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/claims-denials-and-appeals-in-aca-marketplace-plans/)

[Also, as I said, people who are under insured and uninsured delay their own care because they can’t afford care, and they cant  afford time out of work.](http://files.kff.org/attachment/The-Uninsured-and-the-ACA-A-Primer-Key-Facts-about-Health-Insurance-and-the-Uninsured-amidst-Changes-to-the-Affordable-Care-Act).  This information is definitely not included in the wait time for the US when compared to single payer systems.  

How many people in single payer systems are waitlisted because they don’t have insurance or can’t afford it? **0**",1582898323,fj0ez60
4716,4716,PedanticallySemantic,"Sorry it got long

Part 2

&gt;I am in favor of lower taxes (note that I said LOWER, not none) and smaller government with less regulations. Your agreement seems to hinge on - I already pay taxes so I might as well pay more and increase government services/protection. In the same mind set - do you give money to charity? Why aren’t you giving 50% of your pay? Do you not care about poor people/bad situations? Are you an animal? (Obviously not - but hopefully you see the retardation of that argument).”

An argument from analogy can get lost from the main argument after addressing differences in the analogy compare to the original argument, but I’ll attempt to explain the original point of why you haven’t lost freedom from paying taxes. your freedom is not lost on money you earned under presidents you didn’t vote for, with tax policies you don’t agree with, just like my freedom is not lost in paying taxes for money I earned under President with tax policies I don’t agree with.  I freely choose to stay and pay taxes I don’t agree with, but I’m also free to leave if I don’t agree with those taxes of a president I didn’t vote for.  you are free to stay and pay, or go and don’t pay. Where is your freedom lost? Nowhere.

&gt;Long wait times are certainly not debunked! In Canada the median wait time to see a specialist in 2018 was 19.8 weeks! (Source: https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/waiting-your-turn-wait-times-for-health-care-in-canada-2018 ) Don’t know how you “debunk” that. 

No need to debunk this study because it’s not a comparative study of single payer systems and the American system.  Because this study says the Canadian system has long wait times and it doesn’t compare it to the American system using their same methodology.  a study sayin* a number is big but does not provide a reference to compare it to does nothing for comparison of two healthcare systems.

&gt;The UK also has extended wait times placing a burden on the system. (Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/europe/uk-national-health-service.html) 

Sorry I can’t get past the pay wall. But if this article cites study only showing the UK’s what time, then similar as above, if it’s not a comparative study, there are extreme difficulties in comparing numbers based on different methodologies and definitions.  Also, the UK nationalize their healthcare infrastructure, which the Medicare for all would not do.  There are many other European and the Canadian system that is closer to the Medicare for all design, Such as Germany and Netherlands. 

In ‪2017 193,406‬ people did not have surgery after 18 weeks of being referred. (Source: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/13/193000-nhs-patients-a-month-waiting-beyond-target-for-surgery)

This study is irrelevant because the Medicare for all program would be closer to Germany or Netherlands with mixed systems and not the NHS (in the study you presented above) because NHS has nationalized infrastructure and Medicare for all is not designed as such. Also [this article that you presented](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-single-payer-debate-comparisons-to-canada-uk-germany-2017-6?op=0#the-basics-1) literally states the uk system and the German system are designed differently. If Medicare for all has more similarities to the German system, then don’t compare it to the uk system.

&gt;in fact emergency wait times in Wales have hit a record of over 12 hours just this month (source: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-51564205). So hardly debunked - you might want to do some research before you claim things are “debunked”.

Again, NHS is irrelevant. And agin [this article that you presented](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-single-payer-debate-comparisons-to-canada-uk-germany-2017-6?op=0#the-basics-1) literally states the uk system and the German system are designed differently. If Medicare for all has more similarities to the German system, then don’t compare it to the uk system.",1582898513,fj0f8j3

Part 3

The debunking comes with single payer systems that Medicare is more alike, such as Germany and Netherlands, which have similar wait times as many states in the US, plus wait times in America does not include how many people in America are placed on self imposed wait times because they can’t afford care, or they can’t afford medications required post procedure, or taking time off. Plus how many people in Germany or the Netherlands have a self imposed wait time because they can’t afford care, or they can’t afford medications required post procedure? **0**.  Also since we don’t live in all states, some states have extremely long wait time when compared to the US average, and when compared to Germany or Netherlands.

The debunking continues with: Does any studies show that Germany and Netherlands wait time is longer than the American system, while taking into account wait times because of insurance denials, and insurance delays, and patients’ self imposed wait time because they can’t afford healthcare? If not, then there is no studies that support your argument that Medicare for all will have a longer wait time than the current us system wait time average or the German system.  

The debunking continues [although German and Netherlands has comparably similar wait times for an appointment for a specialist doctor across all states](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/___media_files_chart_maps_chartcart_survey_2013_international_survey_schoen_2013_ihp_survey_13.ppt), the [wait times for an appointment with a specialist are worse in some cities in the US compares the average German or Netherlands wait time](https://www.merritthawkins.com/uploadedFiles/MerrittHawkins/Content/Pdf/mha2017waittimesurveyPDF.pdf).  Yes you can point out that there are differences compare us cities to Germany or Netherlands, but nationals us wait times in general are not dramatically different from Germany or the Netherlands to say we should not have a system similar to Germany or Netherlands (not wait time in Netherlands is less than the US in link provided above.) especially when we take into account that that [the German and Netherlands system cost about half or ours](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#item-average-wealthy-countries-spend-half-much-per-person-health-u-s-spends).

&gt;First of all Germany is not a “single payer program”. Health coverage is mandatory in Germany and citizens have two options - statutory health insurance (SHI) and private health insurance (PHI). As you can assume the PHI is very expensive. The SHI is not run by the government - it is privatized in the form of non-profit agencies - however it is strictly governed by statues that restrict pricing and the costs SHI healthcare providers charge. This is funded half by the citizen, and half by their employer. 

Yes. Germany does have supplemental health insurance. And Individuals from other countries that have a single payer system also allow their citizens to purchase supplemental insurance.  Similarly, Medicare for all, a single payer system (which is comparable to SHI)would not ban anyone from purchasing supplemental health insurance.  there will be a market for supplemental plastic surgery market for rich people.  A new insurance company for rich people may also have a market to attract rich people, compatible to PHI.  countries with heath care systems we label as “single payer” can have supplemental insurance.  Also the SHI covers 86% of the public which includes all of their poor and middle class.  Medicare for all would also cover all of the poor and middle class. 

&gt;I wonder which one offers better treatment?

Between SHI and PHI, I don’t know. But likely the PHI for rich people.  And rich people will always be able to buy their own private healthcare, even under Medicare for all. 

&gt;If you are going to argue that all Germans receive the same treatment -

I’m not arguing that all Germans have the same treatment.   I’m arguing all the Germans under SHI have the same care actually have care, and Under our current system, 10s of millions don’t have healthcare insurance and millions can’t afford their deductible and avoid seeking healthcare.  The German system SHI single payer system does not have poor people without healthcare coverage and in SHI the poor and middle class people with deductibles they can’t afford. Similarly, America under Medicare for all, all people in Medicare for all will actually have care, including dental, eye, pharmaceutical coverage of a very large risk pool. I’m not saying everyone will have the same care in America when Medicare for all is implemented because rich people will always be able to buy their own additional care.  I’m saying everyone covered by Medicare for all will the same care (there will be no one without healthcare insurance and expensive deductibles).

&gt;why are there two different plans with two vastly different cost prices?

probably because they designed it that way. But SHI is comparable to Medicare for all.

&gt;While the cost to continue providing the SHI continues to grow - to the point Germany now spends 10% of its GDP

Is it growing faster than our current system?

&gt;There are also co-payments required for medications, prescriptions, and treatments (probably losing half of the Bernie crowd here with any type of responsibility.) roughly 86% of the population is covered in SHI. (Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/us-single-payer-debate-comparisons-to-canada-uk-germany-2017-6?op=0#germany-a-non-single-payer-idea-5)

There are many aspect you can compare Medicare for all bill, but you have to stop comparative aspect of Medicare for all and the German or Netherlands system when the Medicare for all bill specifically designs that aspect differently. This pharmaceutical aspects, dental, and ophthalmology aspect of Medicare for all, it would all be included under the umbrella of Medicare for all without copays and deductibles (read the bill). This is not the case for the German system.  Evaluating the pharmaceutical aspect of what Medicare for all would be like is comparable to the current pharmaceutical aspect of the Medicare or VA system.",1582898563,fj0fb0f

4755,4755,DerekWoellner,"I was running as a down ballot candidate last election. When Bernie was still in the race, was when young people were excited about my campaign. When Hillary became the nominee, it was like the floor fell out. All the optimism and energy just died instantly among new voters. Living in a right leaning area, I was depending on Bernie's ability to attract new voters into the process, the independents and young people that normally don't vote. I couldn't do it without him.

The current democratic establishment has lost hundreds of seats at all levels. Look it up, they're failing miserably. 

Bloomberg can claim the Dems took the house because he bought 40 moderate candidates, and those moderates can claim they can't support Bernie in their area, but let's be real. What is the platform that all these people ran on? It's the Democratic platform that Bernie got passed in 2016 at the convention. It's the very platform that we were told was too radical pre-2016. 

We've already accepted his platform, the establishment just pretends he's still far off in some imaginary radical land, when really he hasn't changed his stance at all, in like four decades. 

Trust me, the only way the Democrats start winning again is with Bernie. Otherwise the party won't attract enough new voters and it will die. The writing is on the wall, the polling shows very clearly that young people see Bernie as the future of the party. He's the only one that can bring downballot victories.",1582917011,fj1c5mq

4785,4785,Knerrjor,"Solar and wind requires a lot more material to generate equivalent amounts of base load continuous power. Let's say a solar panel generates 500 We (this is a made up rough number) then it would take roughly 2,000,000 panels to make the 1,000 mWe produced by some gas and nuke plants. Furthermore there is a useful life deficiency, where a solar panel might last 20 years compared to a gas plant for 60 years or nuke plants being extended to 80 years of life. 

The plus for energy companies is that we have most of the power needs already so you can implement a 10,000 panel array and batteries in batches at a lower cost than the investment in nuke or gas. 

But then there is the cost factor. That material, land and upkeep all have expenses, and a quick look at wiki levalized cost by source shows that solar would be $200+ /mwh vs $95 for nuke and $74 for gas. Wind is cheaper than all of them on this front but it relies on geography making it more difficult to implement.

Another major factor on this is that baseload. A wind or solar plant may simply not produce occasionally due to weather. This is where combined cycle gas becomes extremely valuable. If power demand in another state or area cant be met, someone needs to turn a switch and generate more. A combined cycle gas plant can start up and generate in about 20 minutes, where coal and nuclear take atleast a day. If company A turns on to save company B they can make massive amounts of profits for the support.",1582946091,fj2kl7j

I took out loans to pay for my undergraduate degree that I'm still paying off today. I started off making 7.25 an hour working F&amp;B at the zoo during my senior year of undergrad and worked my way up to manager, a job I did throughout law school. Then I became a full-time bartender after learning the trade as a barback. I'm still a full time bartender to this day.

If you aren't making the most of your opportunities, it's on you, not the city of Columbia. I turned a 7.25 an hour job into a management job and a 7.25+10% tips barbacking job into a $35 an hour bartending job in this very city, while going to law school full time.",1583093699,fj7micz

Greenville is a great city with a good balance of urban amenities and rural resources.

The spirit of public-private partnership is very strong and the business landscape is robust, with a wide range of industries (manufacturing, aerospace, healthcare, services&lt; education) and sizes (startups through fortune 100). 

The town surrounding Greenville are booming as well. Travelers Rest (15 minutes N) is experiencing growth in commerce, population and arts/food. Spartanburg (30 minutes E) is also seeing lots of investment and growth, with an international airport between Greenville and Spartanburg (GSP) and the inland port nearby. 

Clemson (30 minutes W) is a great college town environment, especially with the football team winning nationally. Their business school is housed in a great new building in downtown Greenville.

The same data suggest that a single death penalty trial costs South Carolinians around $415,000 more than a noncapital murder trial. Over half of all death cases in the state are reversed because of error at least once during the appellate process, the center says.""",1583274743,fjen45d

5201,5201,Tech_Bender,"Yes I did, because the truth and gaining knowledge is what matters to me more than being right. Like I said I didn't know one way or the other about the costs associated with this. 

The idea that it costs more to execute a prisoner than it does to house them for the rest of their life sounded incorrect to me. This is most likely due to the conservative background of my childhood that I heard people always complaining about how expensive prisons are. 

I also was not aware of how much legal battling back and forth there was for a prisoner to be executed. I just thought that it was decided by a judge based on certain criteria such as the severity of the crime and that the person was such a danger they couldn't be kept safely even in prison. I was already against capital punishment, this gives me an even more compelling argument against it. 

Picking a side on an issue and then trying to defend that position is how you can learn about something. Being aware of your bias is also important to understanding how you can be blind certain information. Confrontational bias can also make you more likely to accept certain types of information without vetting it properly.

5203,5203,Tech_Bender,"I believe that all life is sacred and should be respected. Sanford prison experiment demonstrated that we are all susceptible to evil. Children don't start out as murders or rapist. Their interactions with the world lead them down a path that takes them to that place. Certain genetics make people more resilient or more susceptible to various mental illnesses, but a healthy normal brain doesn't suddenly develop a desire to murder someone. Unfortunately our current justice system, (just like a lot of our governmental based systems) does little to actually help rehabilitate people.

Look at how DSS in SC works for example. Kids that go in to the system actually suffer more trauma than they did before they entered it. I tried to be a foster parent, DSS lost custody of my son because they failed to comply with a court order from a judge that he needed therapy. My wife and I even offered to arrange the appointment and transport him. They actively fought us about it saying that they would handle it, and we kept hounding them to get it scheduled but they kept delaying. 

The guardian ad litem reported this to the judge and he had to be placed with a therapeutic foster care family. They took him while he was at school and I never even got to say goodbye.

CDC was saying the same thing, but the logic doesn't make sense to me. The only way to know if you've got community transmission is if you test for community transmission. Just asserting there is none, and therefore you're not testing for it, seems backwards. They did the same thing in California, finally convinced the CDC to test, and turns out, there's community transmission after all.

This is the sort of thing that leads people to doubt that ""preparedness is high"". Combined with the [botched testing kits](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/02/feds-allow-state-public-health-labs-test-covid-19) and [medical supplies](https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233725785283932160) not getting to healthcare workers, it kinda seems like there's no preparedness at all.

Current protocol is to only test for covid-19 after other, much more common diseases have been ruled out (or the patient meets the criteria for immediate testing).  So, if a patient theoretically does not meet the criteria for testing initially, but all other bacterial and viral infections on the differential have been ruled out, then the test for it can be run.

Right now the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes the covid-19 disease) is expensive and is bottlenecked by supply and limitations in the amount of labs rated and equipped for it.  Faster serology based testing is in the works and will be rolled out in the coming weeks, but right now using those resources on high suspicion cases is the best option.  

Even if theoretically we had an unlimited supply of test kits and were not bottlenecked by the lab turnover... Think about the cost of administering the test to all patients who displayed symptoms.  It's so much easier to work down the differential diagnosis list starting with the most likely; and way more efficient from an economic perspective to make sure the patient doesn't have a bacterial respiratory infection or the flu before we swab them for coronavirus prematurely.",1583383564,fjj51tt

- A literal ton of non chain restaurants and hangout spots downtown.  Food is great.

5417,5417,But_who_really_cares,"LOL... it's about policy changes. 
Trump's tax cuts (that you think were just for his rich buddies) stimulate the economy which is term creates consumer confidence. The intangibles that spur small entrepreneurs to invest their money in new businesses. On average since the TRUMP tax cuts, 40% of new small businesses (small business being defined by 'Less than $2M in gross revenue') start ups are by minorities. Why now and not during the Obama years when that number averaged about 18%. What changed? 
Trump rolled back an Obama regulation on the definition of wetlands. Big deal, right? Yea, it is because it opened up a lot of land to new development that otherwise was blocked. YOU think that's nothing, but the developer who wants to build 100 houses thinks it's huge. In turn, all those sheetrock contractors, the brick masons, and the roofers think it's great. All those independent small businesses that it takes to build that house will argue that that one single, tiny policy change had a huge impact on THEIR lives. 

I live about an hour from the second fastest growing county in the US and I literally can drive you to the entrance of a area being developed that previously was off limits. They are projecting to build over 1,200 new homes that will sell for in the range of $250K. When you add in the cost of the utilities, roads, and sub structure, that over $310,000,000 worth of new growth from one tiny piece of legislation in one county in one state. Now multiply that across the country and add that up.

Here's the problem with people like you... you won't step aside from the pure evil hate that resides inside of you to take an objective look at what's happening in our economy and what's on the horizon. Instead, you just keep finding new excuses to bad mouth YOUR President. 

Here's an example. If I say, ""We're experiencing record low unemployment"" you'll come back with either of two things... It's Obama, or ""yea, well, it's not a living wage"" You're just never happy and you never will be and that's your fault, not mine",1583583727,fjrc1at

**First two bullet points for those to lazy to click.**

""Last week, members of OPEC, a cartel of 13 of the world’s major oil-producing countries, and Russia met in Vienna to discuss industry-wide supply cuts aimed at alleviating the dramatic drop in demand for oil caused by the global coronavirus epidemic.""

""Russia did not agree to the cuts, leading to speculation that it acted intentionally in order to drive prices down, gain market share and punish the growing American fracking industry; others dispute that theory.""

It is also important to point out that fracking oil starts to lose money around the 45/50 dollars a barrel mark. So what is good for you at the pumps, is actually bad for our native industry.",1583892286,fk62bp6

If you’ve never been evaluated using telemedicine, it is actually really cool. You’re basically FaceTiming with the doc, but they have equipment that allows them to remotely listen to your heart and lungs, look with a camera in your ears, nose, and throat.

I’ve personally been evaluated using telemedicine in North Carolina where I live now. I had a cold last year and wanted to rule out flu. I was able to see the inside of my ear on the screen, just like the doctor, and it was clear as day. She listened to my heart and lungs and they could turn up the volume as much as she wanted. It’s really not as complex as it seems. 

Even without the specialized equipment, like if you just have people videoing in from home, there’s a lot of value in just explaining your symptoms to a health care professional and having that immediate feedback/question&amp; answer session. 

Is it as ‘reliable’ as seeing a doctor in person? Maybe not, but there’s no way in hell you’ll reach as many patients that way — which is more important during an outbreak like this.",1583897281,fk6akwi

HSCD also does a job fair at some point - it's mostly aimed at recruiting college students but it's not limited to first year teachers.

Tell me fill in the blanks. In 2018, Trump fired then Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Bossert. Bossert is a lawyer and held an additional degree in Political Science (which BTW is not real science) 

Then, a month later Tim Ziemer left his post as Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense at the National Security Council. Ziemer was a former Navy pilot with a History degree from Wheaton College.

Ziemer was not fired, but retired, in what was described as part of a plan to streamline the NSC and merge duplicative offices in order to reduce bureaucracy. The effect of the change was that there was no single official at the highest levels of the administration who focuses only on global health security.

The judge asked us if it was illegal in the state of SC to drive after drinking. Most of those there stood up, indicating ""yes"" it is illegal to drink and drive. 

That is incorrect. 

""South Carolina law prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol to the extent that the person’s faculties to drive are materially and appreciably impaired. If you have a BAC of 0.08 percent or higher, it will be inferred that you were driving under the influence. If you have a BAC that is at least 0.05 percent but less than 0.08 percent, your BAC level may be considered along with other evidence to infer that you are under the influence.""

This is a bullshit paragraph that fucking lawyers came up with so they can win DUI cases and fleece as much money as possible.

""A 2019 Mothers Against Drunk Driving survey of 323 law enforcement officers across the state found that 71.1% of respondents listed “S.C. DUI laws were largely written by defense attorneys” as one of their top five reasons for decreasing trends in DUI enforcement, a reference to the profession’s healthy representation in the General Assembly.

The state’s DUI laws offer defendants stringent procedural protections, requiring the arrest, from the moment the officer activates their blue lights to after the driver has undergone a breathalyzer test at the police station, to be captured on video. And higher courts have interpreted the law to demand strict compliance for a successful case.

“No video in South Carolina, pretty much no conviction,” said Steven Burritt, MADD’s executive director in the state. Judges across the state have thrown out cases where a drivers’ foot left the frame, or [the video’s audio skipped during a key moment](https://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article216727400.html).""

&amp;#x200B;

It is ridiculous that all the officer’s other probable cause he developed during this case was thrown out for a rounding error. All his observations of the offender’s driving, his observation of the offender when talking to him during the traffic stop, and all the other clues he may have observed during the other SFSTs.

Both the WHO and CDC assume 70% of the population will eventually become infected if drastic measures are not taken. Like stop crowding into grocery stores for instance or even worse the massive crowds returning from Europe right now at international airports. 

Here’s the math. Let’s assume 70% of the population in the US (300,000,000) gets infected. That’s 210,000,000 cases. 

With a 96% survival rate, that equates to 8.4 million dead in the US. Shame on certain news organizations for downplaying this (looking at you Fox News, who by the way is now isolating their hosts from the public from “the hoax.”)",1584286984,fkklwv1

This is not speculation. This is what played out in China and is happening right now in Italy. The real risk is that a spike in demand overwhelms our healthcare system and sick people (with covid-19 or anything else) fall through the cracks.

It tapers off due to isolation and social distancing. What you think everyone can keep their borders shut and disinfect everything for a year on end with social distancing.

Even the most draconian policies will struggle with this. That's what pandemics are. Maybe you should go read a book and then come back. Our nation?

Were a fucking joke so far at handling this. There's no vaccine and a lot of cases with double infection. That means great it tapered off eventually after drastic measures of social distancing. Then one super spreader fucks it up a month or two later when everyone gets comfortable again and reinfects the entire population again.

Patient 31. 80 percent of South Koreas cases were from one person being a dick and infecting dozens. Our entire nation is full of patient 31s. We're an incredibly stupid and arrogant populous. 

Yes. Over a year. Best case. That's how vaccines work dumbass.

Even if one does work. It enters phase two trials. Then human trials. Then regulations. Then it has to be mass produced. 12 to 18 months best case.

The only officers that routinely win are those that do a lot of DUIs. Also, the hearings I went to were almost always on my days off. As a city cop i just had other priorities and so most people got their license back.

Yes you have a temporary license, but that's because you have a right to a hearing before any rights or privileges are removed. The DMV hearings in the last few years have been within 2 months, though you can get extensions. They are also difficult to win when the police show up because the law says if they made a valid stop and demand, you are required to take the test under penalty of losing your driving privileges. Even a DUI 1st is prosecuted by the arresting officer if you haven't requested a jury trial. 

The defense attorney isn't guaranteed a win in the admin hearing either. They only get a guaranteed win if they show up and the cop doesn't and didn't request a continuance. Those hearings aren't very hard for the cop to win if the even get moderately close to following procedures on them. The DUI case is a different matter, but your license issue is pretty straightforward and easy for a cop to win without much fuss. 

What you're saying is you didn't care enough to show up about someone you thought committed an arrestable offense. That sounds like a personal issue rather than a systematic one.",1584477667,fkrwx00

From what I understand, though: It slows down the spread of the virus rather than completely stopping it. Most likely, the majority of the population is going to get the virus, but the hope is that we don't overrun hospitals by all of us getting it at the same time. Sure, you personally might get sick from someone else preparing and delivering your food (though it's less likely), but you are way less likely to pass it on to other people (who will then pass it on to even more of the population) if you aren't going out into public to eat. Also, it is much easier to track the source of the virus if a bunch of different people get sick from ordering takeout/delivery from one common restaurant; that can be dealt with easier and quicker than if we did not limit restaurants to delivery/drive-thru. 

Of course, it's not fool-proof. If you are sick and order delivery, you risk infecting the delivery driver, who can then infect others. But it should still slow down how fast it's spreading by limiting the amount of contact people have with each other. This gives hospitals more room to ""breathe"" so-to-speak.

Personally, I want to cook at home as much as possible during this time. Sure, I still have to go out and get groceries (or have them delivered, if it gets to that point). But that limits interaction with the public probably the most, for the average person.",1584493806,fksn26q

I want to say right now that mega churches that are clearly for profit should be taxed. You don't get to hide behind the classification if you earn a salary. Equally a majority of churches (because there's far more small ones than big ones) are local community non profits. The difference is the ones in other countries have hundreds of attendees where as the average in the rural South is closer to 30. Not all churches are good but that doesn't mean we should damn them all.

Church funds can obviously go towards noncharitable things like evangelizing, getting pews, etc. just like a charity can buy non-essential equipment and take out ads. The problem is megachurches where their preachers drive 47 Caddilacs, have private jets and yachts, and take home 100k a year trying to trick people into sending thousands of dollars for salvation.

6470,6470,JessiFay,"They are both still employed. We've always offered them the option of paying half cash / half labor. Hubs needs help will stuff around the property. They've never followed through with tasks they agreed to do in exchange in the past. And now our roommate helps my husband an hour a day for rent. Anything over that we pay him, so we don't take advantage of his help. 

In the past, the wife has gone for a month on vacation in another state. Twice. Quit her job. Her hubs didn't work either time she left except a day here or there with his dad so he could buy his weed. He ate down at his parents. It took a couple months after she got back before she started paying rent again. She had to find a job, catch up the electric bills, their cell phones, etc. 

They've gotten tattoos. They order take out / get fast food multiple times a week. Then say they are broke and cant pay rent. 

Now, there is nothing wrong with any of that. It's not my place to say how they spend their money. But it does make me less sympathetic when they claim to be broke. 

My husband was friends with their dad/father in law. We didn't want to be assholes. 

But eventually we got fed up. And we were told it would not cause an issue if we had to evict them. They knew we had other people wanting to rent from us. Even their middle son was interested in renting the place. He'd stayed with us right out of high school for a couple of years. 

Our roommate now is the Uncle. 

Both of them are still working. In my opinion, they need to be planning to cover bills if their hours get cut. And they need to be willing to help hubs with the garden if they are short on money.  (It's in the front yard with a side walk so hubs can do a lot of it from his wheelchair. He can't kneel with his prosthetic. So it's just a small area, but it will help feed us. )

Here's some data to illustrate:

There are 3.12 million registered voters in SC. The last Senate election was in 2014. Around 1 million people in SC voted (1/3). 600K voted for Lindsey Graham - again. 

He wormed himself into office in 1993 and won't leave because he has NATIONAL GOP financial support. These GOP &amp; Dems use millions and millions of corporate dollars to subvert the political process to garner enough support to remain in office.

The 2014 United States Senate election in South Carolina took place on November 4, 2014, concurrently with a special election for South Carolina's other Senate seat, as well as other elections to the United States Senate in other states and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections.

Incumbent Republican Lindsey Graham won reelection to a third term. He faced Democratic state senator Brad Hutto and Independent Thomas Ravenel in the general election. He defeated both of them by a 10-point margin.

6749,6749,cyndessa,"The toilet paper ‘shortage’ is a bit more complicated.  These companies make two types- commercial (for offices, restaurants, businesses, etc) and residential.  

Commercial sells a ton- many folks are out and about most days and not using residential TP.  And not everyone buys residential at the same time.  And a few rolls lasts a household much longer when everyone leaves the house 5 out of 7 days of the week (school, work, etc)

Now you have several issues.  Folks are using residential TP more (bc they are home) and what would previously suffice now needs replenishing.  Going to be home all day and not using bathrooms outside of the house adds a ton of more usage.  

Secondly, stores stock according to typical needs.  Everyone going to get some at once is not sustainable because they never stock enough for everyone all at once.  

Next, TP companies now need to ramp up residential manufacturing and ramp down commercial.  That does not happen over night.

So this is a perfect storm of issues.  People need more residential TP because they are using it more at home.  Stores do not stock up enough to make up for folks no longer using commercial.  And it takes time to shift manufacturing.

Depending on the onset of symptoms, fast being more flu-like and slow being more COVID-like we tested either way. The amount of tests we did last week was unnerving. And there was more positive flus than testing for corona. They are both viral  in nature, so either way you should be self- isolating. We tell patients to monitor their symptoms, keep in touch with the doctor, and if respiratory symptoms worsen, contact their local ER for instructions.
Until the materials for testing and manpower to run tests is ramped up, there is a longer wait time for results. The university hospitals are getting or have gotten the formula to create the tests, so the turnaround time will be shortened.",1584895933,fl77ifj

I know this sounds dramatic, but I think it’s important for to educate everyone that they could have COVID even though they also have flu.

This issue goes beyond a simple choice.  It is a systemic problem.

If you are making $25/30 per hour on unemployment compared to $15/16 per hour then what would be your incentive to go back to work and that goes for ANYONE!!! 

I agree with that. Plus they want to make the eligibility for this unemployment to go until the end of the year whereas this lockdown may not last anywhere near that! We should not make it easier to not work than to just be made whole because it is not anyone's fault that they aren't working. It isn't just Lindsey Graham that feels that way and if you want to be made more than whole then isn't what this is about! This is about being made whole so that no one is suffering because this isn't anyone's fault that a virus shut down businesses. It wasn't the collapse of the economy it was a virus.

Third, we exist in a debt economy, and adding to it in an acute event is no where near as bad as the slow addition we've been doing lately. National debt isn't the same thing as personal debt, and to treat them the same shows a fundamental misunderstanding of economics.

“SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If you're a nurse — aide — making $15 or $16 an hour, you're on the front lines here. A lot of doctor's offices are going to have to roll back because elective surgery's no longer a source of income for a bunch of doctors.

So, you're going to have all these well-trained nurses, they're going to make $24 an hour on unemployment. You're literally incentivizing taking people out of the workforce at a time when we need critical infrastructure supply for the workers.”

Is he trying to say a nurses AIDE who makes $15-16 an hour, (which here in Columbia at least is not the case unless you’ve been an aid for many, many years) that if you go on unemployment you’ll be making $24 an hour? That hourly figure is starting pay for a new grad NURSE in this city (actually a little under depending on the hospital). Is he trying to say that doctors offices will close and put those nurses out of work? Is he suggesting a doctors office nurse go work on a COVID unit? Or even go to work on a typical medical unit? You can’t just throw any nurse into the hospital and tell them to go to work—there’s a lot of training and prep that go into these positions.

If **an employer** cuts an employee's hours, UI may be available that employee, but not the other way around (again, unless there is good cause. ""I don't want to work"" isn't good cause). State law specifically dictates that to receive UI your underemployment should be at no fault of your own.

In addition to that, most state laws require you to be available to job-hunt and work full time if a position is offered. If you're working a contract, freelance or part time job, you're presumably not available to work full time if you're offered a job. Secondly, earning income while collecting UI results in deductions to your benefits. In SC you can earn up to 25% of your weekly benefit amount before deductions, but after that your benefit amount is deducted on a dollar for dollar basis.

This policy change isn't impacting much at all. The Governor has called on law enforcement to disband groups of 3 or more on the beaches. That hasn't changed. People going to beach houses is essentially the same as them being in their home. They're just in a different house. 

Have you been to the grocery store? Have you been in public at all? How is what you're doing very different from what people in Folly Beach are doing?  

The spread of a virus stops one of 2 ways:

\- Herd immunity, which happens when 70% of the population has had it and recovered from it. We have absolutely no idea how many people have had it. We know it has been here for months, so it could be millions. It could be more than that. But we don't know.

\- A vaccine. And that would also create herd immunity. No one has any clue when that will happen. So waiting on that isn't good policy. 

For there to be herd immunity, people need to get it. But for our health system to be able to handle it, we need it to be slow.

The entire point of social distancing is to ""flatten the curve"" and we don't know where we are in the curve when you are asymptomatic for 11 days. The hospitality rate and deaths are constantly 7-14 days behind decisions that are made. As you said",1585419545,flrg77a

And other than necessary obligations at work (I'm a doctor) I keep my butt at home. You are correct in that we don't know who has it, but rushing to herd immunity is moronic when it inevitable overwhelms the healthcare system, so that people who would otherwise live from normal disease and injury end up dead because they couldn't get access to care. It's not just the Coronavirus people who will die, but many others. 
It could be millions who have it or more, you could be right. It also could be much less, which gets back to my point. UNTIL WE HAVE ADEQUATE TESTING, STAY THE FUCK AT HOME.
Look at Kentucky v. Tennessee. Kentucky implemented early, enforced social distancing and closure of businesses, Tennessee did not. They have roughly the same demographic population and distribution. Tennessee has FOUR TIMES the number of cases that Kentucky has.
My point has never been to stop everything, but we need to stop everything all together now, so that we can ramp up testing, increase healthcare capabilities (hospital beds, vents, PPE, continue ongoing studies on treatments) to combat the larger number of people who will get it so we can deal with it correctly at that time. Once we are able to do that, then we can move forward.

And to your freedom comment, that is true in a utopia, which isn't where we live. You have free speech but are not allowed to shout ""fire"" in a crowded theater or ""bomb"" on a plane. You have freedom of movement but aren't allowed to drive the wrong way on a street, trespass on other's property, or walk into an operating room without proper protection and a need to be there. You have the right to life, but the government can put you to death. Our society is surrounded by limitations on ""rights"" in ways that are generally considered to be for the betterment of the public as a whole. Is it ideal? of course not. We live in a world full of Humans, and nothing is perfect. Of note and to my previous point: show me where in the constitution you have the ""right"" to medical care, go on, I'll wait.

The basic idea is that people find satisfaction in a good days work, and prefer to be part of a team achieving goals and advancing the community, and would naturally gravitate towards working any ways.  The biggest difference would be that people would know that they can maintain a sensible living without a job, and they would be less likely to put up with some of the garbage that the average worker has to tolerate now.  So really the only people who would suffer would be those companies that under pay team members or abuse them; Walmart, CVS, Amazon, etc...

&gt; Dear Friend:
&gt; 
&gt; Last night I voted in support of the CARES Act, more commonly called the ‘Phase III’ stimulus bill. The legislation passed the Senate unanimously. Soon, the House of Representatives will vote on the legislation and send the bill to President Trump’s desk to sign into law.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to be clear – this bill is far from perfect. **However, I realize that as an overall piece of legislation the CARES Act will do a lot of good for people in South Carolina who are under tremendous stress and financial pressure due to coronavirus.** 
&gt; 
&gt; I appreciate the President and his team for working with like-minded Republicans and Democrats to help get this bill over the line. My Senate colleagues and I did our best to shape this bill and keep it focused on the problems at hand.
&gt; 
&gt; The legislation:
&gt; 
&gt; * Gets financial assistance to Americans.
&gt; * Brings relief to small businesses and the people who work there.
&gt; * Stabilizes the economy.
&gt; * Supports healthcare workers and patients.
&gt; 
&gt; **The CARES Act does contain a particularly egregious provision which I strongly opposed. The provision allows some individuals to make significantly more from unemployment benefits than they would working at a 40-hour a week job. I coauthored an amendment with Senator Ben Sasse to alter this provision to ensure that those who were forced out of work by the virus were made whole, but would not make more than they were making while working. Unfortunately, our effort to correct this provision was defeated by a vote of 48-48. I will continue working to correct it in the weeks to come.**
&gt; 
&gt; We are facing a public health crisis unlike anything we have seen in recent memory. The CARES Act does not solve all our problems, but it does help address some of the most pressing.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; 
&gt; Lindsey O. Graham  
&gt; United States Senator 

No fucking shame at all, going completely out of his way to say ""Hey South Carolinians, I signed this because a lot of y'all would be screwed otherwise, but also want you to know that I fought tooth and nail to ensure that you got a shittier deal.

7865,7865,DGBD,"&gt; Elimination just delays the problem until a later date.

This isn't technically true, since other illnesses like SARS have been successfully eliminated and haven't stuck around. But yes, COVID-19 (AKA SARS 2) probably isn't going to be able to be eliminated like that, so slowing is the name of the game.

However, I think you're overstating things to make a point. Someone who is *only* going to the grocery store or doing other *essential* things in public and then otherwise staying home is different from someone who goes out into public for *nonessential* things like beach time. You could argue that saying that going out onto the beach in small groups with proper social distancing between those small groups is not significantly adding to risk, but they're not the same as people who are only making essential trips into public spaces.",1585488596,fltvn1g

The current situation will probably last longer than one paycheck. The economy is in shreds and pushing a bunch of cash into it will probably help. There are additional expenses cropping up as a result of this crisis (for instance, having things delivered instead of going out). It may keep people off unemployment (and keep from overwhelming that system), as they can ride out a few weeks while setting up a new job. It is definitely not enough to discourage people from working - I can tell you right now if I lost my job and had $1200 I would only be using that to get by until I got a new job, and I would be incredibly thankful.

But do you wear a full fire suit and helmet every time you ride in a car? It would probably significantly increase your chances of living through a crash but would be much more of a inconvenience than it's worth when you weigh the likelihood of dying in a car wreck.

And you probably have better odds of dying in a car wreck than from dying of this virus unless you are over 60 or already have a health issue, which would also increase your chances of dying in a car wreck.

So it's a risk vs reward thing really.

I do think the word “destruction” is a bit hyperbolic. The economy will recover, as it always does. And that’s not the risk. The risk is *people dying*. And you have one note of being correct, I hope that “the overwhelming majority of people will be okay at the other end of the sickness,” but we still can’t say that for sure. And it’s not about the overwhelming majority, it’s about everyone. This isn’t going to go away after the pandemic ends, just like the flu hasn’t gone away.

People do die everyday, and we have measures in place to reduce those deaths. While not wearing fire suits, seatbelts are a requirement in cars, as well as airbags (a bit more pragmatic); soon we won’t even be allowed to drive our own jeeps. 

The virus is contagious, and hospitalizes around 20% of the people that contract it. Those hospital beds take away from those other people that die every day. The best way to reduce deaths and hospital bed usage is to reduce the spread.

We have few cities that are generally spaced out and don’t serve as major transportation hubs for the nation. Of course Atlanta would get hit faster and harder. The GA governor is issuing a stay at home order. McMaster has consistently attempted to use an “incremental” approach that instead of steadying is has led to people still trying to meet in small groups. After all at one point the president said groups under 50 were fine. Small churches across SC thought they were in the clear. Then the governor said no more than 10. People tried going outside and to the beaches thinking that as long as they were “trying” to keep less than 10 they were cool. Boats across the state became filled and hey what was the harm in only meeting up with a few more boats. They were staying close to the 10 “rule.” They could continue on with life as relatively normal. Then he saw the stats saying this approach wasn’t working so let’s try closing the beaches and public access points for lakes and rivers. This is textbook reactivity rather than being proactive.

It goes a little like this: “metro good! all else *bad!*


It manifests in other ways as well, “DAE all non-major metro = racist lulz?!!!???!!!”


I see it all the time. 


I’m from South Carolina. I moved to NYC, I’m back home in SC because of this plague. And I’ll tell you, there isn’t much difference in the *people* in either place. The lifestyle is vastly different and sure New Yorkers speak differently, but the themselves, largely similar. 



When it comes to places like South Carolina, Wyoming, Georgia, Colorado, New Mexico, you know states that *don’t have huge population centers* people are going to have to move around more. We’re more spread out in the first place. 



My family’s home in SC is more than two miles away from anything! Whereas in Brooklyn, there’s a grocery store 1000 feet from my apartment’s front door. 


So quit attempting to tar metros and rural areas with the same brush. If people in rural areas *actually could* limit their travel to “less than 2 miles” (a ridiculous and arbitrary number, IMO) they would.

8684,8684,Nurse_Hatchet,"&gt; I just hate seeing half my neighbors out of work, some of which have more than their own mouth to feed, when other options are on the table.

The government can take measures to mitigate the impact of unemployment but cannot to anything to reverse the consequences of a mass death event in the nation.  (By the way, having millions of citizens die is also extremely bad for the economy.)  But what exactly are the other options on the table?

&gt; If the symptoms are mild for low-risk people, how is this any different than the flu other than acknowledging that the high risk folks would have a higher mortality rate if they caught this thing?

Again, there are not really “low-risk” people here.  If you look at the numbers you’ll see that lots of younger and middle-aged people have died (not to mention that even if you survive there’s a lot of lung scarring that has life-long effects,) as well as some children and infants.  It’s just that older people are more likely to die.  Also, the flu does not put thousands of people in the hospital all at once and completely drown the system.  The flu is not nearly as contagious.  The flu does not do lasting damage to the lungs or cause cardiac issues.  Need I go on?

&gt; I'm not worried to much about myself, my wife, my children or the folks I hang out with except our parents. Should they quarantine themselves? Absolutely. Should we be shutting down businesses because of this? Hell  no.

You should be worried about everyone in your family because chances are if one of you gets it you all will and again, *people of all ages are suffering severe consequences and even death.*  It’s also pretty clear you don’t understand the importance of social distancing.  If you leave everything open the disease will continue to spread.  End of story.  It sucks, but all around the world countries have been ravaged until they bit the bullet and shut everything down.  Why do you think it would be different here?

You seem to think that the economy would function just fine if we all ignored the pandemic and just kept working.  You’re very wrong about that.  Things are going to suck shit for a long while no matter what we do, but it’s going to be a lot better for us in the long run if we do what we need to do to beat the disease and then get the economy up and running again.  Lots of people will have to use social safety nets like unemployment and welfare for a time.

Push for high-risk to quarantine themselves, keep the low-risk folks working, but protected (masks, gloves, disinfectants, etc).

&gt;there are not really “low-risk” people here.

From an ""how incapacitating would this be for me and those in my home/work"" standpoint, there are. If I get it (mid 30s, otherwise healthy) I'm laid up for a few days or at most two weeks on sick leave. Still employed, and still have funds to feed my family and pay the mortgage. If the draconian government decides to shut us down, then I'm out of work, not paid, and potentially lose my home and can't feed my family. Which is worse?

&gt;You should be worried about everyone in your family because chances are if one of you gets it you all will and again, people of all ages are suffering severe consequences and even death.

I am! That's why it's important that in my home we have no high-risk people and don't go visit elderly relatives during this time.

&gt; Also, the flu does not put thousands of people in the hospital all at once and completely drown the system.

New Orleans, for example, is overwhelmed yes, and due to the majority of the folks that are getting this have preexisting conditions. It doesn't seem that's being factored into people's paranoia:

Yes, so you can see how doubling that number would be problematic.

&gt; Push for high-risk to quarantine themselves, keep the low-risk folks working, but protected (masks, gloves, disinfectants, etc).

Again, EVERYONE IS HIGH RISK.  Everyone can and will catch and spread this disease.  As for protection, we nurses can’t even get enough protective gear to treat out patients.  How exactly do you intend to get enough protective gear for the workforce and the medical community (who will now need a hell of a lot more since everyone will be out and about spreading infection?)

&gt; From an ""how incapacitating would this be for me and those in my home/work"" standpoint, there are. If I get it (mid 30s, otherwise healthy) I'm laid up for a few days or at most two weeks on sick leave.

You seem to think that the two options are minor illness or death.  Wrong again.  There’s a wide spectrum of severity that people are experiencing.  A large number of people are being hospitalized for long periods of time and requiring oxygen long term after that.  Think that’s cheap or good for the economy, having medical bills cripple a huge percentage of the population?  Also, healthy people in their mid-30s are absolutely dying.  Your assumption that you’ll be fine is extremely arrogant and naive. 

&gt; I am! That's why it's important that in my home we have no high-risk people and don't go visit elderly relatives during this time.

Did it escape you that the scenario I described is how a person’s health could be severely impacted by the pandemic without ever getting sick?  When hospitals are overrun the entire community suffers because they can’t get the care normally delivered and simply going to the hospital is begging to be infected.

That’s actually wrong.  China has stopped the spread and is now trying to figure out how to stop a second wave from reinfecting them from the outside world.  South Korea kicked its ass.  Italy is starting to see their new cases fall off because they finally locked down.  Locking down is how you contain the spread.  End of story.

Speaking if logic, if you think if that was enough these other countries wouldn’t have just done that instead of total lockdown?

Instead of continuing to shout into the void I’m just going to provide you a source.  This shows you the numbers of infected and dead with various forms of prevention/containment.  Instead of using percentages you should try using the number of dead bodies and try to remember that these are family members and loved ones that you are tossing on the pyre for essentially nothing, because letting the disease run rampant will be devastating to the economy as well.

A shelter environment for cats is survival of the friendliest- if the cat is shut down due to learned helplessness or is aggressive, the people in charge of determining who gets euthanized will put them on that list. Again, after they've already sat in cages freaking out for a few days. If they have any health issues, chances are they'll be euthanized almost immediately, because the shelter needs to save resources for adoptable animals.

The point I'm getting at is that the owner making the decision to euthanize isn't inherently the worst thing that can happen to them. I'd say knowing that your cats aren't adoptable and surrendering them to sit in cages alone until their euthanasia is a bit worse. If you know they're unadoptable for whatever reason, it's arguably more responsible to have them euth'd on your own time/dime than to pass the buck off to someone else.

For instance. The sherwin williams paint you get from Lowe’s isn’t the same stuff you get from sherwin Williams. It’s not near as good. 

We bought a dewalt pressure washer from Lowe’s and it literally blew up the second time we used it. Fire was coming out the exhaust. 

My dad got a kobota lawn mower. And something broke on it. He went to the kobota store near his house and they told him they couldn’t get that part. The tractor my dad got was made specially for Lowe’s. 

The craftsman stuff there is terrible. I’ll never buy another craftsmen tool in my life. Bought a saw blade and from the first board it was trash. Burning the wood and everything. I put my four year old Diablo blade back on and it cut much better.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How is this so hard to understand?

I answered this one by stating that no one is actually staying at home despite your insistence that we have ""almost a stay at home order.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  and I'm not sure which restaurants you think are open? 

I explained that restaurants are still open for takeout and that people are congregating in the parking lots. Sitting on tailgates with friends etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Please explain how a formal stay at home would change anything, be specific. 

No question marks here but lets cover all the bases. My entire response to this comment was answering the questions. The specifics being that a stay at home order would bring seriousness to the situation for most South Carolinians. Presumably, a strong stay at home order would also influence business' decisions on whether they should stay open or close.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Please tell me which state is arresting people for going to a friends house. Please tell me which state doesn’t have restaurants open for pick up. Please tell me which state doesn’t have grocery stores open. Are you really that ignorant? 

Did you miss the arrests over the weekend in Charlotte? I'm not here to do your research for you. Many states are enforcing their stay at home orders. This isn't about closing the restaurants. It's about getting the message across to people like you who just don't understand the consequences that YOUR actions have on others.

If being sensible to protect our most vulnerable citizens is seen as ignorant. Then sure. I'm *that* ignorant.

Now which question did I miss?",1586170137,fmkvefp
9528,9528,rustyshakelford,"I can't tell if you're trolling or just ignorant.  Go back to my original question, which was asking how a stay at home order would change anything.  Restaurants would still be open for takeout.  You could still go over to your friends house.  Grocery stores and home improvement stores would be open.  

  The arrests in Charlotte could have happened here too because groups of over 3 in public spaces are already banned. 

  You see, instead of critically thinking you're try to play to people's emotions and imply that I don't care about vulnerable citizens or that I don't understand consequences (I've left the house twice in 4 weeks).  People like you aren't able to have a logical conversation without insulting others.",1586170592,fmkvtmv
9529,9529,NotAWorkAlt,"Ha. You have called me ""ignorant"" multiple times but yet you cry about being insulted. Poor thing.

You keep telling me to read but have failed to do so in how many comments now? Perhaps you can count better?

For the third time, a stay at home order **brings seriousness to the situation.** Just like last week, the POTUS said masks we're useless and no one was wearing them. Fast forward to this week, his stance has changed and I'm seeing old ladies with plastic bags over their heads here in South Carolina.

It's worth a shot. If it stops even 1% of people from going out, in South Carolina, that's \~50,000 people!

Look at the masks usage. The POTUS said not to bother with them and no one wears them. Now he's changed his mind and everyone is scrambling to find or make one. I had a photo sent to me from Food Lion of an old lady covering her entire head with a clear plastic bag tied around the neck yesterday.

McMaster issues mandatory 'home or work order' that goes into effect at Tuesday at 5 p.m. McMaster said you must stay at home unless you are working, visiting family, doing outside recreation or obtaining essential goods.

I almost feel like those are all reasons to leave my house any other day. Outside Recreation? That is a very vague statement.  And what is essential goods? Any place still open is saying they are essential so any shopping would still be allowed under this correct ? Just wondering if this will have any real impact on day to day life.

“Mueller declared that since “collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code,” he instead focused on the word “coordination.” ""We addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign ‘coordinat[ed]’ — a term that appears in the appointment order — with Russian election interference activities,” Mueller wrote, adding that ""we understood coordination to require an agreement — tacit or express — between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

If I knew this would be two weeks and be done I’m all in. A few months? Sure. But this will drag and drag until either a.) herd immunity with millions dead or b.) a vaccine or antivirals in a year at best. Are we gonna shut this country down each time a wave spreads on the Hail Mary prayer a we developed treatment through next winter? 
The government is asking me to sacrifice months of my life because over the past two decades they wasted trillions over in the Middle East over our education our healthcare or our infrastructure. The government had months to prepare for this crisis and sat by. Now that this shit show is here and now that it’s spiraled they are blaming Americans not sacrificing six month over their errors? 
  Bullshit the Americans who will die even my grandparents will be blood on the states hands not mine. I wear my mask outdoors and keep to my peer groups. But no way in hell am I gonna sit inside for the spring. Like I said. I’ll continue my hiking my fishing my adventures and exploration till this shit show ends.

So, you know how for some diseases it's really easy to tell when you're infected and contagious?  Tuberculosis has a horrible cough, dysentery will have you sitting on the can with the runs, ebola will have you bleeding out of every orifice - that kind of thing.

Coronavirus though, doesn't do that.  With it, you can be spreading the virus to anyone you breathe on even though you yourself aren't showing any kind of symptoms.  That's why social distancing and staying away from other people even if you think that you are perfectly healthy.  And even if you think that they are perfectly healthy.

However, it's my opinion that every single store should either slap together pickup/curbside, or close. 

If you can't work remote, you shouldn't be at work, unless you maintain actually critical infrastructure like water/power/internet (needed to coordinate healthcare/police/fire). No one's profit is worth anyone's life, and you take the risk for everyone you're around when you go out. No one is going to than your house or cut off your ac, and there are a shitload of places giving out free food.

As far as recreation/exercise/visiting family, absolutely go and fuck yourself. The risk to everyone else is inexcusable, especially since if your dumb ass gets sick, you'll take up a hospital bed that could be used for someone who deserves it, like a doctor or a nurse.

If one infected person makes contact with that attendant, then we are increasing the chances that this virus spreads. Sure the risk is smaller than the risk you would take by going to a sit down movie theater, but the risk is still there. 

I know we can't completely eliminate the risk. People still need to buy groceries, and other necessities. But the drive-in is not an essential business or service, it is purely for recreation.

But I do think it's worth noting that, having worked in quite a few restaurants, there are almost no feasible ways of taking safe measures. Where I work we're wearing masks and gloves, but I had a lady today cough directly into my eyes. I then had to go back to working in very close proximity with my coworkers. We can't practice safe distancing, we have to interact directly with a very dirty general public, and there's not enough masks to go around. We're trying very hard but there's only so much we can do. I assure you that your food is being breathed on, your bags and packaging are being touched, and if I get sick cuz of that lady, I'll have exposed 200 people a day for a week until I realize I got it.

It's also important to know that, even though we are open, me and my coworkers are still not making enough to pay our bills, so whether or not we are open, we workers still can't pay rent.

Nature: We have nature. Nothing special though. Again, same as most states in the southeast. 

Location: We have access to the beginnings of “mountains”, and the beach which is nice. Limited highways making drives longer though. They are 5 hours apart (250 miles). Compare to Los Angeles. 

People: People are nice if you are white. Lack of education means racism is very prevalent compared to other places. Many people still stuck in the past. 

Food: Good BBQ here, but Atlanta probably has the best food in the region. Charleston has restaurants but is over hyped as far as food goes. 

Flag: Yeah it’s a nice flag

Economy: most people here work at Walmart, or other retailers. Not many white collar jobs. No innovative companies want to move here because of the lack of education. Companies do move their manufacturing here tho because of the cheap cost of land and labor. Our minimum wage is $7.50, which would not allow you to live anywhere but the middle of nowhere if you want a car and place to live. 

Compared to neighboring states, it’s nothing special. If you want to live in the southeastern US, there are other states that would be better options regarding most if not all of those categories.

Weather: it's hot as hell here for 70% of the year. And there are hurricanes every year. Not what I'd consider cream of the crop weather wise.

Nature: Hiking is pretty weak, especially if you live in the lowcountry. It's a 4 hour drive to anything decent. Some pretty good fishing i must admit.

Location: Not sure what you mean by this. The only weekend trips close enough to drive to are savannah, atlanta, and asheville. Not bad, but certainly not enough to convince someone to move here.

Friendly people: Every area has it's collection of great people and assholes, SC is no different. It's not as bad as the northeast, but as someone who didn't grow up in the south, the ""southern hospitality"" feels fake as hell most of the time. 

Great food: This I can't disagree with. The food is incredible. 

Best flag: it's okay, but i'm not moving for a flag. 

The state is far too conservative with McMaster and Graham leading the charge to entice young professionals. Some horrible history as well, which several people refuse to let stay in the past. We're bottom 10 in the country for education, which tends to push families away. Tourism is a huge pull, especially in the Charleston area, but people typically don't like living in a tourist town.

My coworker designed that highway and rail road tracks so it’ll be a optimal route in regards to traffic and the like. Think about that, to even build a new manufacturing plant itself, excluding all of the other jobs that go with it- they had to make new highways and bridges, which plenty of engineers designed, and many trade workers take part in.

1113,1113,-Pin_Cushion-,"&gt;Overheated critics of President Trump accuse him of being an authoritarian. Of not caring about checks and balances, civil rights, and constitutional limits on executive power. And yet, today, many of these same critics demand that he nationalize supply chains, deploy the military on our shores and shut down every town in America. It’s a curious thing.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The coronavirus presents enormous national challenges that call for a strong federal response. But we should not lose sight of the essential role that states and governors must play. America is better served when presidents respect the diversity of states instead of dictating uniform solutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As a governor, when you take the oath of office to serve your state, you don’t know what will come your way. During my six years as governor of South Carolina, I dealt with a thousand-year flood, damaging hurricanes, a racially driven church shooting, a white police officer who killed an innocent black victim, and a school shooting.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;When times were calm, we would try to get ahead of the curve, holding regular meetings with my emergency team to make sure we were up-to-date on supplies, procedures, logistics and technology. We learned the importance of planning and to control what we could.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I was a Republican governor with a Democrat in the White House. We disagreed on most policy matters, but we put those differences aside to serve the immediate needs of our joint constituents. You don’t serve your people if you let politics get in the way.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If you know a crisis is coming, one of the first things a governor will do is reach out to the White House to coordinate F.E.M.A. relief before it hits. Then, when the trouble arrives, everyone is on the same page.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;F.E.M.A. typically sends a liaison who coordinates efforts and assesses vulnerabilities. It’s technical stuff. It requires knowing your own state and building a relationship with those on the federal level who apportion resources. It takes time, effort and foresight.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Once a crisis hits, state responsibility is primary. The federal government can provide crucial resources, but the burden is on the governor and her team to distribute them. No two states are alike, and blanket approaches won’t work.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In today’s crisis, governors from both parties have exemplified strong leadership. They know their residents and their state’s needs better than anyone in the federal government. In the state-federal partnership, governors are in the best position to control what happens on the ground, better than any president could be.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Governors know their state’s mayors and local officials who facilitate aid distribution. They know their local national guard leadership, which in many cases provides essential logistical support. They know their business leaders, who are being called on to uproot their production and services while keeping as many people employed as possible. They know their hospital administrators, who have eyes on the front-line heroes in this war. And they know the leaders of their faith communities, who often spearhead life-saving humanitarian projects.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As our highest nationally elected leader, of course President Trump has enormous responsibility in this unprecedented crisis, and he is marshaling the federal response on a massive scale. But in implementing plans to save people’s lives and keep our economy afloat, look no further than the governors.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;They have complicated and difficult jobs. In this crisis, as in any, some are showing their competence and leadership, while others are revealing their shortcomings. It’s true that states shouldn’t have to compete, to bid against each other for supplies at inflated prices. And party politics shouldn’t factor in disbursing federal resources to states. But, most often, this is not the case. Governors who complain about the Trump administration are, in some cases, attempting to distract from their own failures to plan and execute.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;

And the hospitality thing is totally fake- old boys networks rule and people will smile while stabbing you in the back. At least in NY they’ll tell you they don’t like you so you can be prepared to defend yourself or change. I also agree about the weekend trips- not bad options here, but when I lived in upstate NY I was 3 hours from Boston, NYC, the shore, and 5 hours from Canada (a whole separate country! Though Florida can feel like another land depending...), and I had a choice of hiking the Adirondacks AND the Catskills.

1128,1128,Knerrjor,"Probably will get buried, but I will give 3 major factors.

1: land - South Carolina has a problem with its foundation. It goes from rocky to sandy to swamp and that means it wasn't as easy to cultivate and farm early. Hence why in a nation of agriculture it was primarily slave farmed. Also, we are just a little smaller is size which limited the amount of land for agriculture further. That being said certain crops have done well, and we are home one of the only (if the only) tea plantations in North America.

2: civil war - South Carolina was the first to leave and the first shots fired, and while not the capital of the south, Charleston itself had the image in many northern minds. The interesting thing is that after the civil war South Carolina was one of the first to have black representation, due to former slave voting. This caused massive white flight and later some of the worst racism seen in the nation. For this reason it quickly gained a reputation of a terrible and repressed part of the nation, and causing a massive lack of industry in an area that had been a major industrial sector prior to the war. 

3: heat and AC: with the invention of AC in the middle of the century the south once again regained some of its former glory. For years most of the nation's population was in the north, but with the invention of home ac and industrial ac, jobs and people have been flooding south. Unfortunately our neighbors in Georgia and North Carolina have more mild temperatures that meant their populations were larger prior to their shift. Because labor in those areas were equivalently cheap with larger labor pools, industry and jobs were more attracted to those areas earlier and as such we are still the last to receive the attention. 

With that being said we are slowly turning around. Great tourism mixed with a beautiful landscape and relatively cheap land is changing the influx but we still have one major issue, crime. There are unfortunately still large portions of the state that are reminders of the antebellum south and with little resources or opportunities crime has become a prevalent issue that still holds back the state from gaining new residence and businesses in some of the depressed areas, particularly in the middle of the state. 

When the population is small and crime is high, it is extremely tough for small buisnesses to develop and new wealth to enrich an area. This has unfortunately led to constant stagnation outside the major metropolitan areas.",1586389847,fmuejbr

Atlanta and Phoenix have had substantially larger populations over the years that give them a larger tax base and therefore more money to put towards growth projects. If you are in atlanta or charleston it's roughly the same dollar amount to widen an interstate, but a dramatically different portion of the budget. 

Atlanta's greater population in 1920 was in the 600,000s while Charleston-Summerville are was around 120,000. That gap has mostly just grown.

Add to that, that charleston isn't one city. You have to get each municipality on board (which dont get me wrong, it is infuriating) if it affects them and you have the rivers and swamps all around making bypasses and new routes incredibly expensive to build. 

The arthur rav bridge in charleston was $700 million alone. I dont think there any one structure in atlanta or Phoenix  that would come close to that figure. With that money you could probably fund 2/3 of MARTA. 

And despite this they have done some awesome things for the city of Charleston. For example,it's not perfect but the fact that you can almost run or bike from Folly Beach to Sullivans Island is just awesome and not something to take for granted.

1266,1266,amalgamatedson,"&gt;On March 26, two days after Trump said he wanted the country “raring to go by Easter,” Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin ushered in a stay-at-home order for South Carolina’s capital city.  
&gt;  
&gt;But GOP governors were reluctant to institute these measures statewide. Many backed weak restrictions or voluntary social distancing instead. By March 30, the trend was clear; of the 11 former Confederate states, only the three with Democratic governors issued firm stay-at-home orders.  
&gt;  
&gt;Edwards speculated that the resistance to strong preventative measures was out of fealty to Trump. Kemp, he said, acted in “lockstep” with Trump on the virus threat. “You’ll see Brian Kemp retweeting everything Trump says. You’ll see him praising Trump at every last opportunity,” Edwards said. “I don’t know what’s going on in Brian Kemp’s head. But it has the appearance that he’s simply Trump’s lackey.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, said he faced some resistance from business leaders, but was confident that stay-at-home was the right move after consulting with hospitals. “It was clear, looking at the data, that this was going to be a Cat-5 storm hitting everyone at the same time,” Benjamin said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not everyone got the weather forecast. Some Republican state officials weren’t content to simply stand by while mayors one-upped them. Instead, they intervened to reverse local restrictions.  
&gt;  
&gt;After Benjamin passed the Columbia order, South Carolina’s attorney general issued a legal opinion that only the governor had the authority to force people to stay cooped up inside. Gov. Henry McMaster praised the legal opinion and one city briefly tabled its plan for a stay-at-home order.  
&gt;  
&gt;Benjamin announced that his city’s order was going to go into effect on a Sunday regardless. He added that he was prepared to defend it in court that Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;“In moments of crisis like these, clarity is so important,” Benjamin said of his public stand.

&gt;ABOUT US
TO KNOW US IS TO LOVE BLENHEIM
Family Owned &amp; Operated

&gt;Here at Blenheim, we continue the long history of making ginger ale the old fashioned way. Our passion spans the generations from the drinks creators, Dr. C.R. May and A.J. Matheson, to the third generation of the current owners, the Schafer family. Blenheim Ginger Ale is a Southern tradition that dates back to the 1800’s when Dr. C.R. May advised his patients with stomach ailments to drink the local mineral water flowing from a Blenheim, South Carolina natural spring. When these patients complained about the strong taste of the water, Dr. May added Jamaican Ginger to it to conceal the mineral taste.

&gt;Blenheim soon became so in demand that the original bottling plant was opened in 1903 to accommodate all the local folks who simply could not get enough of this delightful concoction. In 1993 the Blenheim Bottling Company was acquired by the Schafer family, who also own the South of the Border Tourist Complex. They quickly renovated the original plant in Blenheim to meet new quality standards, and began bottling this unique ginger ale.

&gt;Soon it was clear that the antiquated plant could never fulfill the demand that existed for Good Ole’ Blenheim, so a new plant was built on the South of the Border complex with a larger capacity and a modern bottling system. Currently Blenheim is the oldest continuous independent soda bottler in the world, and a cult favorite among locals, visitors, spicy food aficionados, and celebrities alike.",1586453106,fmwu71m
1305,1305,the_cnara,"Why are they messing with the cities? Let them make their own decisions. Isn’t that the point of having a mayor? The governor shouldn’t have to take care of every single thing, right? Let the local people manage their own stuff.",1586453928,fmwvtk2

1307,1307,agirlandhergame,Mine says Lay Off - Pending Resolution since March 26th.,1586454347,fmwwntf
1308,1308,voidthursdays,People are reporting in other parts of the state that the peddlers are part of a home invasion ruse but nobody's believing them. It reminds me of everyone who says the dog fighting rings here are a hoax even though I feel like everyone knows people whose dogs were stolen and our PD busts dog fighting rings every few months.,1586454928,fmwxtmj
1309,1309,DanReach,Very cool. Seems like the redness does not grow linearly if that makes sense. Is there a reason you chose to not just grow the redness in proportion to some set number of cases? Or did you do that and it's just an illusion?,1586455097,fmwy612

1313,1313,poisonkat,Almost all of the questions i can't answer accurately. I can't self isolate bc i have to go to work 5 days a week. This survey is not applicable to essential workers.,1586456350,fmx0muz
1314,1314,khuul_,"We didn't let them inside to scope anything out. Again, I have no idea why I even answered the door. After seeing how eager she was to get inside and a second person just about to get out of the SUV, we told her to get bent in the nicest way possible then called the local sheriffs office. Doubt anything will come of it, but we'll definitely be on our guard for the next few nights. 

They saw we have two big dogs and not that they could see it, but we're also gun owners. Why these dummies try to pull schemes like this in such a pro 2nd amendment state is beyond me.",1586457357,fmx2m9y

1320,1320,Flucks,"As someone very very familiar with the data around this from a certain hospital, this isn't entirely true across the state. Some hospitals are armed with a plethora of good data that is helping A LOT.  There are rapid changes to workflows inside the hospitals to account for this that are causing issues from the reporting side, but are being remedied and back filled quickly. 

Now if we want to talk about DHEC...there's a reason they're being used less now for testing. I have always said, if you're competent, then you're not in government work.",1586458806,fmx5h0y

1322,1322,Ungrateful_bipedal,"I live in SC and regularly travel to NC. Border is open; however, I traveled across two days ago and there was a SC state trooper parked on 77, right at the border. Likely just eating a donut, chillin'. C'mon up good buddy. Coast is clear.",1586459199,fmx67vi
1323,1323,coppergato,"I got a facebook message from the Pickens County Sheriff's Office, telling people that they will NOT be pulling people over at random just to see where they are going.

1325,1325,bigboilacroix69,"About the same here. I work in a phone store, which one could argue that SOME of our functions are essential like bill payments, but people have been coming in to “browse” or let their crotch goblins play with the phones. Our DM finally got tired of us asking for more supplies because we have to clean all that shit off every time a display is touched and he said that we can kick people out and tell them to go online if they’re not here for an essential reason.",1586459344,fmx6hvf
1326,1326,ProudPatriot07,"I'm in the Charleston area and some similar cleaning product peddlers were in my neighborhood maybe 4 weeks ago? It was right before the stay-at-home order in Charleston took effect but people were already starting to stay in more, so it was a bit suspicious. Needless to say we did not answer the door for them, especially because our neighborhood Facebook group gave everyone the heads up.",1586459613,fmx70gl
1327,1327,EmpathyFabrication,So we're really looking at a snapshot of about a week ago when we look at the SC data. Unless they are pushing the critical tests to the front of the line. I have not yet heard from anyone in SC that has been hospitalized and discharged.,1586460137,fmx80lw
1328,1328,khuul_,"Yeah, we called as soon as they left. I edited my post with a link. I forgot where they said they were from at the time, but after my cousin sent me the link the name rang a bell. Kirby Vacuum.

Seems like an old established scam, they're just putting a new face on it for Covid-19. Truly scummy.",1586460464,fmx8nar
1329,1329,khuul_,"Yup, from now on, unless you're wearing blue and got a badge, you can get right the hell off my porch. I edited my post with a link my cousin sent me. Kirby Vacuum, that's where these jokers said they were from.",1586460543,fmx8st3
1330,1330,onelousypetunia,Wow! I honestly thought these were all fear-mongering fb rumors. Do you mind saying what area of Chas you’re in? JI here.,1586461144,fmx9yl8

1332,1332,ProudPatriot07,"Kirby Vacuums is a legit company, but I'm not sure that was the same one who was here. These guys weren't wearing any sort of uniform or driving a car/truck with a logo on it, etc. Unless I know someone is coming to my home, or it's say, a uniformed officer, I'm going to assume it's a scammer.",1586461913,fmxbga5

1336,1336,Planet_Coco,"I can’t edit my post, but I just remembered it wouldn’t let me file with my legal name. It kept saying that didn’t match their records so I had to file with my name given at birth. I’m sure that has something to do with it.",1586463334,fmxe7le
1337,1337,khuul_,"Oh, I don't know enough about Kirby Vacuums, but the scam with people saying they are representing or from Kirby seems to be an established one. 

The two wonderful individuals that showed up on my porch also weren't wearing any uniform, were driving an unmarked white SUV and weren't wearing and protective gear (gloves, masks, etc). 

Like let's say hypothetically they were just out here legit, but unfortunately still legally can and have to work, can't afford not to right now. I'd understand that and sympathize, but there is no excuse to not take some kind of protective measures if that were the case.",1586463975,fmxfevr

&gt; Like let's say hypothetically they were just out here legit, but unfortunately still legally can and have to work, can't afford not to right now. I'd understand that and sympathize, but there is no excuse to not take some kind of protective measures if that were the case.

Agreed- especially since your encounter was so recent. The guys in my neighborhood were also in an unmarked car, no uniforms, etc and not wearing protective equipment, but that was several weeks ago and people weren't worried then. It's hard to believe because it seems like we've been socially isolated forever and it's only been two weeks!

Still, letting even a legitimate sales person into your house right now is kind of a risk. You don't know if they've been ill or around someone who is sick. Aside from a close friend who came over to help my husband with a cabinet project, we haven't had anyone outside of our family at our house in the last three weeks.",1586464469,fmxgcfr
1339,1339,khuul_,"Yeah, it's gonna be rough for a while. Even after current world events subside though, I've learned my lesson. If you weren't invited and aren't carrying a badge wearing blue, please get off my porch. 

This is the second time something like this has happened. First time it was solar panels quite a few months back. The solar panel people may have been legit, but there are scams going around for that too it seems. I should have learned the first time. Fool me twice and all that, I guess.",1586465450,fmxi6od

1343,1343,peachykeen1104,Yeah I think our place should be online orders for pickup to contractors only. I don’t honk the fool enter public should be coming around. One person today wanted us to basically bring everything out to her to decide if she wanted to take samples home but she was a general homeowner. That was the type of person who should be following orders and staying home. What they were doing was not essential. It’s so frustrating.,1586466901,fmxkvyo

A couple of years ago here over the summer some Russian girls were in town selling magazine subscriptions door to door.  Of course the Facebook groups went nuts saying they were part of a child abduction ring, police checked them out and whaddya know they’re just selling magazines.   Those girls got a good dose of our paranoid society.",1586468310,fmxniu7
1346,1346,innerlemons,"Mine says there's a delay because of ""able and available"" too because I mentioned that public transportation was on limited hours, therefore I wouldn't be able to work the same shifts. 

The next week, I changed it, but the delay is still there and I'm receiving $0. It's been stuck at that spot for two weeks now.

Although, I highly doubt they’re out during a time like this.",1586469505,fmxpr6b
1350,1350,Bladewing10,"That's the problem with anti-""home rule"" states and the conservative governments in general. They decry the federal government getting in their way, but when it comes to ""state's rights"", they treat their state like their own little kingdom. The power doesn't trickle down, just like wealth doesn't trickle down. They think giving local municipalities power means decreasing their own power, and they can't have that.

1427,1427,franksvalli,"Thanks!  Yep, that's intentional.  The downside to using a linear scale is that the outlying high values (e.g. 91 cases in Kershaw) would outweigh all other values.

Imagine case counts for 10 zip codes.  A linear scale would be fine if the ""case count"" data looked like this:

&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

(with 1 case in one zip code on the very left, and 10 cases in one zip code on the very right).

But in this case the data distribution looks more like this:

&gt; 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 8 9 10

The strategy I used is breaking this data into even segments (quantiles), so what that means is each color represents the same number of zip codes.  Quantiles are still not perfect, and lead to the phenomenon you mentioned, but I think it fit the bill well for this color-coded map.

Their website says you can earn up to 25% of your weekly benefit without a reduction in benefits. The maximum weekly benefit in SC is 
 $326 so the maximum you could earn without a reduction is $81.50. 

Again I'm not an expert and could be wrong, but all information is cited below so I'm curious where you got the $250 figure as I've been helping my employees with this as well. 

https://dew.sc.gov/individuals/apply-for-benefits/weekly-benefit-amount/earn-wages-while-receiving-benefits

Can I earn wages while receiving unemployment benefits?

Working part-time or odd jobs while receiving unemployment is acceptable and even encouraged. However, you must report the amount you earn each week when filing your weekly claim. To learn more about how to report wages, click here.

If you physically worked during the week, you must report your gross earnings, which is the amount you earn before taxes or any other deductions; even if you have not been paid yet.

You may earn up to 25 percent of your weekly benefit amount without receiving a deduction in payment.

I confirmed this from several law enforcement agencies, State Newspaper and Post and Courier. I also worked corrections before YouTube and journalism. I kinda already knew this. 

That's just one category that I find to be ridiculous. The goal should be to encourage employment so you can garnish wages for child support. Giving that person a jail record in this economy is certain doom for them. That's why the SC supreme court announced a ban on all child support enforcement for 30 days. I think they'll take this time to evaluate the family courts.",1586664158,fn5gdod

Jekyll Island was a true jewel.  Only a few hotels and places to eat. It was more expensive but so worth it.  With one way on and off and 0 crime.  I could look forward to a week of true bliss.  When my daughter was in her early teens, she was allowed more freedom there than at home.
But sadly like every good thing.  The secret got out.  They tore down buildings and streets to build shopping centers and hotels and Villas.
Driving the mom and pop stores, with a charm all their own out of business.
Still a nice place, still a quieter place than others, but the new price tag makes it hard to vacation there yearly as we had done my whole life.
Progress! You still can't buy property there, but you can still lease it to build on for 100 yrs.
Everyone should go at least once, if you can.
I loved going in May when the loggerhead turtles come ashore to lay their eggs.  Such big beautiful creatures, an amazing sight.

1691,1691,DionysusSpring,"That's because the site has talked to more than 30 of them already. The article is about news that was brought across suddenly. I'm with that site. I know that on average since January I've either listed in an article or talked to small business owners. 

But that isn't the same as a bias. If we didn't talk to small business owners than my 2nd amendment article wouldn't have over 19 thousand views for a site that has only really been around for 5 months. Not only did I talk to every gun store I could find I even quoted some gun store owners who are running for local office. If someone reports something that happens they don't need to talk to a business owner for that. It's nice but the point of the article is to report the news. 

Again, I'm just trying to get to the point where this falls under the definition of bias. I thought the counter was unlike other publications and isn't spreading hysteria. I know Nic Knight got alot of grief for putting out that article questioning if the mainstream media is promoting this and promoting the erosion of personal rights and personal liberties which is what I've mostly focused on. We aren't doctors so I made the call that unless the CDC or a doctor says it we don't print it in terms of the virus itself. We have focused on how the virus and reaction has changed the lives of everyday americans. 

I'm asking for the biased points for constructive criticism. I'm not concerned if someone doesn't like coverage. That'll happen regardless.

1749,1749,DionysusSpring,"What you're saying is true for the 2nd paragraph. But given my responses here I think you've misunderstood the purpose. Remember the Columbia Airport and Charleston International Airport? I'm the guy who wrote that article about the airports not being ready. I knew this would be bad. 

And what you said in the first paragraph is confusing. We talked to the business owners and that's obvious given that some of those same business owners such as Sandhill Shooting Sports and others are sharing the articles they were mentioned in. But I'll take your criticism to heart that maybe we should mention more businesses directly since this is one of the first times we haven't. I'll chat with Nic about it but I think I already know what his response will be. 

The point and purpose of the article as the title suggests was to disseminate information given from a politician. It isn't to take sides on an issue. One of the business owners we talked to just left a comment on the article. Again, I'm no doctor. I have no suggestions for how to handle a virus. I do want the constitution respected and I don't want people suffering. At the same time we need to take this virus seriously and perhaps the next time when I make a YouTube video telling us that our mass incarceration would help spread a virus back in October 2019 maybe this time someone will listen. I try to get out ahead of stuff and each time I do, or at least in the case of The Daily Counter, I end up being right but it doesn't matter if nobody heeded the warnings. 

I told people the airports weren't ready. I'm glad the few legislators I talked to listened to me when I called them about it. Granted, I shouldn't have done that because that's getting too involved in the story but this affects me too. Lol",1586791064,fna4v0u

1897,1897,coastal_bv,"I worked for SCDEW in Unemployment Insurance out of college about a decade ago, so take everything I say with a grain of salt - the filing and claim system has changed somewhat and some of the terminology has changed, but the crux of UI and the legislation that guides it hasn't changed very much, so I'll try to help you out.

To actually receive benefits you have to meet all three of the following criteria - 1) meet separation requirements based off your last eligible employer 2) Financially qualify for a claim based off of total earnings regardless of employer 3) be able, available, and seeking work...  2 of those 3 won't work.  You have to meet all three to receive any type of benefit.

1. Separation requirements are pretty simple, but they can vary state to state.  At the time I worked in UI, you had to have worked for a employer and received some amount of wages ($2608 or more) for a certain number of weeks (8 iirc).  Note: this could have changed, or Oklahoma could have a totally different requirement, but since your last employer would be in OK and they're essentially who laid you off then that's who they should be checking with.  They generally give them a couple weeks to respond re: the separation, and if their reply matches your reasoning when you filed then you get approved.  If they respond that you quit or were fired for some reason, chances are you will not be eligible right away.  If you did not work w/ your last employer long enough (again depending on requirement) or earn at least $2,608 then it will fall to your previous employer in SC and the separation with them.  If you didn't work there long enough either, or didn't earn enough it goes to the next last employer, so on and so forth.  Based off of your move it sounds like your last employer in SC could possibly be your last liable employer, and if you voluntarily left to move to Oklahoma then it could get tricky.  Not saying it's impossible; circumstances matter, like leaving for compelling family reasons or harmful working conditions, but generally speaking voluntarily leaving a job automatically gets you disqualified initially until you appeal that decision and it goes through the appeals process.
2. Financially qualifying means you have worked enough to establish a claim.  At the time I worked in UI, you needed two quarters of the past 5 w/ at least $2,600 or so to establish a claim amount.  This claim amount determines how much you qualify to draw in total unemployment window of 20 weeks and your weekly amount that you're eligible to receive within it.  I've seen some qualify for as little as $20 a week, and I've seen airline CEO's and college football coaches qualify for the same maximum as most middle class workers, at the time $326/week.  This is why 1099 employees and business owners, and ppl who live off of tips basically get screwed, because their wages or lack thereof do not count in the formula establishing a financial amount.  With yours being an interstate claim, you may have to provide payroll stubs to qualify or get your full weekly amount, but if you worked continuously in SC during 2019 I'd imagine this won't really effect yours, since Q1 2020 just ended, they have all the 4 Qtr's of 2019 to establish your claim with.
3. Being able, available, and looking for work.  With the coronavirus they are waiving many of these requirements, but these 3 things are a usually a requirement in every state.  You can't say you're unable to work because you have kids at home w/ school out - that's a childcare issue that prevents you from working.  You can't say you're not able to work because you have flu-like symptoms - that's a medical issue that prevents you from working.  You also can't refuse regular work for any of these reasons, or quit a job for any of these reasons, without going through adjudication and you won't receive benefits during that time.  In general, for any question where your unemployment benefits are concerned, it's important to state that you are able, available, and actively seeking work.

As an interstate claimant.  Part 3 will be done in Oklahoma.  You'll be using OK's Workplace job portal (in SC it's SCWORKS) to search for jobs once a week.  I do think this part has been waived amid the coronavirus but I can assure you it's temporary and as soon as they do away with mandatory closings you'll be expected to at least utilize the job search feature and maybe post a resume, even if your employer intends to bring you back.  Part 2 is where SCDEW comes into play.  You'll most likely be filing in SC, since that's where the taxes were paid that establishes your benefit amount.  If that amount is showing $0, then you may have provide those more recent payroll stubs from OK..  But again, if you worked regularly in SC in 2019, you should at least have enough to establish an initial claim amount, and if you aren't satisfied it's enough you can always dispute that but get some benefits for the time being.  Part 1 is what usually delays the entire process, because state law provides the employer ample time to dispute your claim since they are inevitably who pays for it via unemployment taxes, and because states look to court big business by having semi-lax unemployment laws but that's a topic for another day.  In your specific case, it all comes down to whether or not you worked at that OK employer long enough for that most recent separation to be the deciding factor in terms of eligibility.  If so, and you were laid off, you should be entitled to benefits fairly soon.  In the meantime file every week and remember part 3 of this manifesto when doing so.

That got very long winded my apologies.  I hope if nothing else it helps your understanding of the process.  UI is a real pain in the ass, and the entire system needs reforming, but it's so complicated at this point even the legislators don't know how it works.

General Eligibility
Eligibility for benefits can only be determined after you have filed a claim for benefits. There are several factors that affect your eligibility for benefits. They include but are not limited to your wages during the base period, your reason for separating from your employer, your availability to work, and more.
Eligibility under the CARES Act
The CARES Act provides PUA, which expands the pool of potentially eligible Claimants as follows:
o Individuals who file a 1099 o Self-Employed Individuals o Church Employees
o Independent Contractors o Gig Economy Workers
o Claimants who have exhausted their regular UI Benefits
The CARES Act also provides for FPUC, which allots $600.00 weekly in Emergency Increase in Unemployment

Opening up too soon now is short sighted and will result in a resurgence along with having to do this again in six months. Getting through one round will be hard enough.

2075,2075,DionysusSpring,"I'm pretty mixed on both to be honest. I get the panic but I also understand that the government is essentially bankrupting these businesses. If they aren't going to open businesses then I say lawmakers who are millionaires should loan or give those businesses money. Luke Rankin is a prime example. The man made millions in his legal practice as a lawyer despite the fact he sits on the Judicial Merit Selection Committee that picks judges. Essentially, he got millions from the same judges he picks. If you're going to have that level of corruption and nepotism then give up some of that money. Rankin is asking business owners to hunker down and bear the burden. He should bear some financial burden as well because that's only fair. 

Then of course earlier this year and back in December 2019 you had lawmakers funneling tens of millions of taxpayer funds right here in South Carolina. We could be using that money right now. Where is it? The same people ordering these shut downs without giving business owners adequate funding are some of the same politicians who funneled that money. From.that perspective and angle the business owners have a point. Its wrong that politicians got rich off of ill-gotten gains but it's the hardworking business owner and S.C. citizen who is struggling.

That's the part that pisses me off. Where the fuck did all of that money go? Tens of millions would keep a lot of these businesses afloat and they won't have to be like Bummz on the Beach and fire practically 100% of the staff except for the owner.",1587049604,fnl9m89

2113,2113,DionysusSpring,"It does help to have a press badge. But only shills post things like what you just posted when all I did was share something that most here haven't seen yet. Shills tend to stay on these sites and wait for someone to post something that violates their political beliefs or criticizes their favorite politician. Shill behavior isn't being an actual journalist who has done nothing but post things like this to inform people. 

But yeah, you're right. Politicians don't talk to me at least 5 days out of the week. It isn't like I got tagged in yet another mass email and have been making those emails public for the past 2 months.",1587059680,fnltyhp

2115,2115,DionysusSpring,"Take note ladies and gentlemen. All I've done here is share a letter and now the shills have appeared. I told you all that some here care only about politics. I specifically made the point about legislators paying to help businesses and certain people paid no attention to that. All they could do is criticize the businesses and they don't have much to say about politicians. Note these people when this is all over. Ask THEM to fund your businesses since they don't care to address S.C. political corruption that left the state with a lack of funds to help people. Earlier this year, though a FOIA request, I personally confirmed what the State Newspaper reported about politicians funneling tens of millions of dollars into pet projects. Some of the funds were for sports events that are surely cancelled eight now. Where the hell did all of that money go? That was tens of millions aside from the much larger part of the budget. Every cent should be accounted for because people need help right now.",1587060140,fnluvwt

2123,2123,ChefGeddis,"That is a long way off, but at least there is an end in sight.  Even if they were to open up all businesses to the public right now, I'm not sure that it would change public perception. I dont think many people will feel comfortable going places where there will be a large crowd for a good while.",1587061618,fnlxu44
2124,2124,DionysusSpring,I think the concerns the article pointed out was the millions of taxpayer funds that have been swindled in the past 5 months. If business owners are asked to do something I think it's more than fair to ask legislators to do the same in return. Its the lack of care from legislators that appears to have these people upset. Math is simple. Their businesses aren't gonna survive. Perhaps politicians like Luke Rankin who represents some of these businesses in term of senator coverage should give up some of the millions he has made while in office. Is that fair? Seems fair to me.,1587061777,fnly5i8
2125,2125,DionysusSpring,This is just preliminary. This date isn't set in stone and likely isn't. I don't know what's gonna happen but they need to do a session right now to come up with funding to keep these people afloat. All the millionaires we have in the general assembly should open up their personal funds to help their constituents. Goodness knows Luke Rankin has the funds.,1587061916,fnlyf9k

I can barely find a time where people aren't just swarming the grocery stores and Wal Mart, I've had people use the social distance space to just cut in line when I've been there. I have no faith this will get better soon.

I hope relief comes to the small business owners, the cruise lines should have been left to go to bankruptcy. Relief money should be given to those who pay American taxes and employ Americans. We absolutely should not open too early and sacrifice our elderly and people with pre-conditions on the altar of the economy. Some of that effort that's been put forth to hold the stock market aloft in spite of reality should go to those suffering and facing risk.",1587062833,fnm09qz

2133,2133,DionysusSpring,That's been my main focus and that's why I've been so harsh to politicians. I was a soldier. I know that the true measurement of leadership isn't when times are good but when times are bad. It's a tough situation but this is a prime example of why citizens need to get involved and stop politicians from stealing YOUR money. You'll need that money later like right now for example.,1587063493,fnm1l9o
2134,2134,DionysusSpring,It isn't. But I'm starting to get the picture about the different camps here. I'll keep doing what I'm doing because as I'm being told I'm effective at what I do. Especially given the amount of shills here. Given those analytics lately I think I've got something good going. Most people seem to trust us. It's mainly because despite the massive analytics none of us will take pay.,1587063704,fnm20d5
2135,2135,p4lm3r,"I totally believe you are legit, don't let the trolls get to you. I am a lowly nobody, but incredibly well connected politically. It's possible to be both! 

Anyways, along those lines, I have heard things won't even begin to return to ""normal"" until November- at best. Non-profits are going to die this year. I know of dozens that already have shut down. I know a few really large ones that are on the brink of shuttering their doors for good. 

This has become a bizarrely bi-polar issue- those who are terrified about further spread/a second wave if we try to start the economy, and those who are terrified for the long term damage of shuttering businesses. I'm not smart enough to be able to calculate the damage economically vs. the death toll, and I don't know who is. [Michael Burry](https://fortune.com/2020/04/07/big-short-michael-burry-subprime-mortgage-coronavirus-lockdowns/), the guy who shorted the housing market, is adamantly against a flat 'stay at home' order, but with sensible suggestions. 

I don't know if he is right or not, but there likely has to be a middle ground somewhere.

Full disclosure: I am a liberal, I have been unemployed now for 6 weeks as my market sector is usually the first to get cut under any turmoil. In the 6 weeks, I have gotten 3 unemployment payments.",1587064085,fnm2rj1

2138,2138,Tell_em_Steve-Dave,"I don't know what fight you're on about. But the article I read wasn't proofread, and the site's description says:

2139,2139,DionysusSpring,"I'm actually a constitutional Republican but the strange thing is people think I'm a partisan. I just wrote yet another article this morning with the faces of Republican politicians on it. I come from the Rogan school of thinking. I expect the other side to do things I don't agree with. Since I know I lean right I intentionally criticize mostly Republicans so that if anyone accuses me of being biased they're lying. I can prove that they're lying and especially if Senator Katrina Shealy personally asked me to take down that article thumbnail with her face on it.

2146,2146,DionysusSpring,I must stress this is just a letter I got in an email from a legislator and confirmed with several others. Rep. Johanthan Hill was posting about it on Facebook so I snagged his copy which was clearer. This shutdown can last longer. We don't know. I'll do my best to keep you guys posted.,1587064743,fnm433z

2148,2148,DionysusSpring,They don't like that my publication questions the government response. What you're seeing here is a political divide.

I'm not even getting calls or bookings for June-August and those months are typically half booked by now. People do not lay out money for deposits in this kind of uncertainty.

He doesn't mind fellow Americans being dyed because they wanted to come outside. This is the kind of extremism that concerns me.,1587065320,fnm590p
2152,2152,p4lm3r,"Like I said, don't sweat it. Life is far more nuanced. I was a member of perhaps one of the most connected *very conservative* leaning business organizations in SC until I was let go from my previous employer. I was actually the first to receive an award of the kind from the organization and they all knew I was a far left leaning liberal, but the jokes were always light hearted and in good fun.

2156,2156,DionysusSpring,"What upsets me about some Republicans is how they behave. I expect to disagree with Democrats. I don't expect that I should have to convince a Republican to support gun rights. I hold my party accountable. I leave heavy criticism of democrats to others on my team. Sometimes, I can't help myself but like I said most of my criticism is almost always directed at a Republican to prevent bias. 

I don't mind discussing things with lefties. I agree with them on a lot of issues and disagree with some. I think that what I have in common with the left are things I should focus on such as ending the drug war and mass incarceration.",1587065622,fnm5uwx

2162,2162,DionysusSpring,That's one of my other worries. I hope the general assembly creates an emergency session for emergency funds for businesses and citizens. If the money isn't there then ask some of the many multimillionaire lawmakers to pick up the slack with their wallets. We ask soldiers to give their lives so asking politicians who sent those soldiers to war to come up with money doesn't seem like a big ask.,1587066599,fnm7tnh

2164,2164,z3r0turn,It's hard to tell which way it will go.  I understand that to some affect getting it is almost unavoidable.  At least a limited plan on how to shield the elderly at this point should be taking shape.  Hard to say let's just open er back up without a strategy.  I'm not classified as elderly but I wouldn't like the odds on that dice roll.  The overall complacency of the CDC doesn't give me much faith in what they are saying.

Got wounded in combat and had to sue to get benefits. Watched my roommate from combat have a fucking cyst on his heart and it took the VA months to get this man a surgery. What makes it worse was that we were deployed when Don't Ask Don't Tell was still in effect. He was punished just for being gay. I roomed with him by choice because I didn't care for how my guard unit was treating him. I told my representative about this treatment and it took this woman a year to call back. That pissed me off and made me realize I can't just be a youtuber. Video making is all good and well but there is work to be done. 

I don't do this to start trouble. I do this partially because I know if I didn't certain lawmakers and judges wouldn't be as pissed right now. These people are parasites. I've met very few lawmakers who are good people. There are some good ones but the only bias I got is that I'll look for reasons to side with the people over the government. 

If you ever talked to a politician off the record you'd know that these people are some of the worst frauds and hypocrites in America. It's the judges too. I sat through and recorded a house judiciary committee meeting where At-Large Judges or judges that move around as needed were complaining about having to move around so much and were asking for a pay raise. On average, these overpaid clowns make around 178k a year. I was a soldier who went wherever I was told and I was NEVER paid that kind of money. Former Judge and S.C. Rep. Gary Clary said he thought you just went wherever you were called to go and that these judges were already paid pretty well. 

How can this state send national guardsmen to a combat zone to potentially lose their life but have judges who piss and moan because they gotta do their job? You can't make this stuff up. When you see this everyday you'd get why I'm almost always filled with rage.",1587068713,fnmc11d

Regardless, Champagne absolutely is not a liquor. It involves no distillation. It's a wine not very different from the others on the shelf with it.

Democrats on a federal level had to play the money game in order to continue relevancy, and so it began.  States soon followed suit.

No we shouldn't be leaving in fear. We need to stay aware of what is going on and be knowledgeable of the facts. There is no cure for this virus yet. Our only way to slow it down is for everyone to stay home. That's it. Yes, we are getting bored and anxious about the near future.. but we gotta hang in there. 

This is something we are going to have to wait out. It really really sucks. It is going to take a mental and financial toll on all of us. 

We need to stick together be helpful towards each other. 

As much as it sucks, everyone needs to stay home as much as possible. Maybe a way to visualize how far your cough/breathing can spread is to think about how far cigarette smoke or vape spreafs... maybe?

Right now our country is the most infected country in the world. Over 34,000 people have died in the USA. In 4 months thirty four THOUSAND people have died. That's around 8,000 people dying each month since January.

Sure SC has had 107  deaths . 107 numerically isn't  much compared to 8,000. But we are talking about 107 people.

The reality is that the federal government has very little say over whether states issue stay at home orders or extend them. The Trump administration may request that governors take certain action, but federal government power to respond to this type of situation is limited: It is primarily up to state governments to manage disaster response. 

The federal government generally lacks the authority to issue nationwide stay at home orders or to order states do so. The federal government's ability to restrict movement rests in the commerce clause to restrict inter-state travel and business. Beyond that, it's up to state governments. A governor may issue a former disaster declaration to receive federal assistance through the Stafford act, but even so states reserve decision making power over their populace.

2443,2443,TzuDohNihm,"So let's look at this logically following the [White House guidelines for reopening the country](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/). McMaster is quite likely to follow those. The Phases are 14 day increments. To satisfy an end to Phase One you need 14 days of this [criteria](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/#criteria).

Schools are to remain closed in Phase One. So even if SC started a downward trajectory two days ago when these guidelines were released you would still have to add 14 days of Phase Two. Phase Two has to be satisfied in order to open schools. If SC was on a downward trend and met the other criteria that would put the end of Phase Two at May 14th with a presumed opening of schools May 18th. This is three days past when Seniors should be ""finished"" with their requirements to graduate.

However the biggest problem with meeting the criteria is the requirement that you have:

 *Robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing* 

Even if healthcare workers are being tested extensively, antibody testing is nowhere near being robust for any jurisdiction. This criteria will hold back most locations from moving forward.

That is all assuming SC began a downward trajectory in cases the day the President announced these guidelines. Last I checked we were still trending upward with a peak around the first week of May. That necessarily pushes 2-3 weeks before we even begin to count Day 1 of Phase One. Lets say that is May 4th. That puts us satisfying Phase Two at June 1st at the earliest. June 5th is the last day for my school district and probably roughly the last day for most districts.

As I told my kids the first week they were out for school closure, ""You are most likely not going back to school this year."" I haven't wavered on that and the criteria for opening all but cemented it.",1587241669,fnthckc

As I got closer to the shadow thing, the temperature dropped, hair on the back of my neck started standing up, I got goosebumps, and I could see my breath. As soon as I ""hit"" the spot that the shadow thing was at, the chain on my bike EXPLODED. Not just like a simple pop, but the whole thing came apart, leaving links all on the road. 

I didn't care. I was filled with fear. I picked up my bike, and sprinted towards the house. I was petrified. I got home and started crying. I told my parents I was attacked by a ghost.
