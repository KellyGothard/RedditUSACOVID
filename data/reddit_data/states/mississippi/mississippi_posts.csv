I am married and have tried being friends with my husband's friends but so far it has not worked out like I would like it too. Most of our friends have children now and they usually hang out with other moms and dads. I moved to my current town about 3 years ago. I joined a church and a small group from church thst mert once a week. I have never felt like I could open up and be myself with the church group. Plus, the other couples in the group now have kids and me and my husband are the only ones that don't. Our only other friends live 2 hours away but I don't have much in common with them. I would like to make friends with someone in my area. Someone I can myself with. Is this a weird thing to want? I'm not sure what exactly to do about this. If something were to happen to my husband, I would be alone with no friends. I don't speak to my family much because there is a lot of drama with them.

&amp;#x200B;

* Date of Birth: 1974 - 1980 (22 to 28 years old) 
* Sex: Male
* Location: Hattiesburg, Mississippi
* Date of Death: May 1, 2002
* Body Discovered: December 1 or 12, 1998
* Manner of Death: Complications from a hit and run accident
* Height: 5'9"" (1.75m) - 5'11"" (1.80m) 
* Weight: 170 lbs (77kg)
* Race: Caucasian
* DNA: DNA, dental records, and fingerprints available

&amp;#x200B;

1. Artistic renderings of the victim by Barbara A. Martin: [1](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/649UMMS.jpg) and [2](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/649UMMS1.jpg)
2. [Actual photo](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/649UMMS2.jpg) of the victim while still alive   


Notes:

* In December 1st, 1998, a man was struck by a drunk driver while hitchhiking on I-59 just north of Highway 49 on the ramp to I-59 northbound in Hattiesburg.
* The drunk driver left the scene but was later apprehended by police.
* Before losing consciousness, the victim told responding paramedics that his name was Steve Hex (Hicks) and that he was from West Virginia.
* Earlier reports stated his height as 6’2’’. It was later changed to 5’7’’-5’9’’. I suspect this is because coma patients are at a higher risk for osteoporosis and can be hard to measure due to the way their limbs contract. They may have measured him at over 6 feet at the time of the accident, and under 6 feet after three and a half years with a brain injury. The redditor who suggested this case says he has sources stating the height is definitively 5’7’’-5’9’’
* DoeNetwork had the date of discovery as December 1, 1998 in December of 2008. DoeNetwork then changed it to “December 1 or 12” NamUs has it as December 12. It is unclear which one is correct. The redditor who suggested this case says he has sources stating the date is December 12th.
* He had red hair.
* He had hazel or blue eyes.
* He wore a red mustache and beard.
* He had freckles.
* His blood type was B negative
* He didn’t have any scars or tattoos.
* He passed away on May 1st, 2002, from complications that were the result of the hit and run accident.

 My husband and I live in rural west TN, two hours north of Memphis, with our 4 year old. We are both in low paying dead end jobs right now and know we can get better jobs elsewhere, daughter is not yet in school, nothing really tying us down, so we started thinking about moving to the MS beach. Open to Gulfport, Biloxi, Pass Christian, etc.  Before this idea, our best option was moving to Memphis. But this sounds way better. (Reason for MS rather than, say FL, is cost of rent)

He has a lot of factory and customer service work experience. I have 15+ years in the food service industry, certified expert lol, with my latest being management, and I also have a bachelor's in english and thinking about becoming certified to teach in MS. Also have lots of admin assistant experience. 

We've looked online at homes for rent, they seem to be in the same price range as where we are now, as well as Memphis. We have about $6000 saved to head down there with next month. We think we can stay in air bnb for about a week and hopefully find a job or two within that time, at least serving or bartending or maybe through a temp service. 

 Question is how difficult would it be to find jobs? Anyone have any advice on how difficult it might be for me to snag a teaching job with no experience, once I become fully certified? 

Would it be hard to find a place to rent to us considering we would be brand new to town?

There has been talk in our Mississippi State Legislature about allowing wine to be sold in grocery stores, especially in large box stores throughout our state. Now, a Mississippi lawmaker introduced a bill to the legislation, converting talk to potential action. The reason for a “wine in stores bill”; convenience to the consumer, a popular trend, generate more tax revenue and no effect on the over licensed 600 package stores throughout the state. 

Mississippi does not have large metro markets like New Orleans, New York City, Miami and alike. Reality, private and family owned package stores, some owned and operated for generations, will close because 50% of their revenue will be lost. No increase in tax revenue, only dilution of the current revenue. Box stores buy bulk which means massive competitive price reduction, local package stores can’t compete. And when you need to know which wine to choose for a dinner or special event, you will have only a row of shelves to talk to.

Small and independent business men and their families who own and operate package stores in Mississippi have lived, worked and given back to their community for decades. Have hired local individuals, been good stewards in their business judgement and followed in good faith the covenants and guidelines that were established between the wine and spirit business and the State of Mississippi. Why should they now have their livelihoods be jeopardized or lost based on a whim or a trend.",mississippi,“We Could Lose Our Businesses”

537,amr318,1585598283,frxzic,Nan,"I don’t post on reddit much, but some recent news regarding some virus outbreak or something has got me thinking. 

With all the talk of states and countries taking various measures to contain the spread of this disease, I’m curious about y’alls opinions on locking down the state. Or locking down cities or municipalities or what have you. Tate Reeves (and Kay Ivey, Alabama’s governor—I’ve been a resident of both states) has taken flak for not issuing lockdowns or shelter in place orders, and I’m wondering why. 

Obviously the case can be made that social distancing is a valuable tactic for preventing (or at least mitigating) the spread of the virus. Nobody knows how many people will eventually become sick, and the issue is more about flattening the curve, rather than dictating its eventual objective height, so to speak. So in all honesty, staying home and limiting contact with people is generally a great idea for the largest amount of people, since there are only so many beds and ventilators and manpowers.

But how do we balance that with people’s freedom in this country? A lot of people want to see state-level crackdowns on movement and assembly, and I can see why, but I’m concerned that we haven’t thought through what that could mean for all of us, long term. What amount of power do we want to give the government in order to keep people from going places and doing things? How long do we want the government to enforce those powers? When, if ever, will we ask the government to give up that power, and can we expect the government to comply with our wishes?

Do we prevent people from going to church? That’s a big sticky first amendment lawsuit waiting to happen, and I’m betting politicians don’t want to see that. Do we keep people in their homes under force of law? How long before that turns into the police using deadly force to ensure compliance? Does it ever get that far?


I think smart people will stay home. I think they’ll wash their hands and avoid unnecessary contact with people. I think they’ll avoid touching their faces. If they try hard enough, I think anyone could avoid catching the disease, given they didn’t catch it before they knew how to avoid it. 

But I’m afraid that smart people don’t see what could happen after all this calms down. I worry that power will corrupt, as it always does.",mississippi,Honest questions about Lockdowns ᵀᴹ

I expected to see  most african americans living in shacks or decrepit housing

I expected hony tonks with delta blues all over the place.

What I found:

Lots of churches, I call them Fortresses of Gods..lots of them.

Perhaps because of the large number of church going people, I see a lot more politeness and care for each other in everyday transactions.

In my town the care goes across color lines. I conistently see politness and patience with elderly people especially. I see neighbors just taking a small care for each other. It is great and different than other parts of the country,

I found african americans  are just like everbody else, not all downtrodden and afraid of vicious racists. Of course there are exceptions. Housing wise and education wise, just like rest of country. Some upper class, some middle, some lower class.

I had to travel about 50 miles to FINALLY see a cotton field!

Eh the blues mainly seems to be popular in memphis and clarksdale. Not noticed a vibrant music scene here in desoto county.

I live in a  typcial suburban type of place. Not a shack to be seen lol.

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

597,hastingshome,1585921777,fu8qnx,Nan,"I see a few comments about hospitalization rates and about how they are skewed because MS is only testing visibly ill people, not doing enough testing, we should look at the infection rate per 1000 people etc. 

Our government is failing at testing its people, so we only have a sliver of data to look at.

Within that sliver, what can it tell us?

For starters, the hospitalization rate is the % of people hospitalized compared to the total number of people who tested positive. While MS may only be testing strong candidates for COVID, we are not alone in this. The lack of testing is a national issue, and more states are like us rather than not like us on this. So yes, it is quite likely MS will be #1 in the country for hospitalization rates, even when testing increases. 

Secondly, the hospitalization rate would go down, as it would in other states, if we tested more people and could figure out who has it or not. So the high hospitalization rate is also revealing that our government is doing a piss poor job at testing. 

Having a spread out population is good! But all it does is delay, rather than prevent, the spread unless extreme social distancing measures are taken.  

Now for some good news. MS has more hospital beds than most other states in terms of population, and its ICU bed rate also seems to be above average although the data is not widely available. For example, MS has 712 ICU beds whereas New York has \~3200 with a much higher population. 

So a silver lining to our overweight, health-caring hog of a society is that we are prepared with more hospital beds. We still don't have enough beds, we still need to flatten the curve, but we can rightfully be appreciated that we are not in New York right now.",mississippi,Hospitalization Rate
