216,Breaker_M_Swordsman,1580167764,euwl2m,Nan,"There is a growing discord of magic players that I wanted to share for others to join. We have commander players, local tournament interested players, old school, and casual players. We always have a good time when we gather and having more people would be great for the times when schedules conflict and opens more opportunities for people to meet others. 

I have plans to set up in group tourneys if a good number of people in the discord are interested. This would consist of food, drinks, trades, a good time and possibly small prizes. Group interests would determine if I organize this. For the players who likes to go to local tournaments at card shops we can also set up for a group of us to go together. 

Age ranges of those already in the discord range from 20-40 years old, both guys and girls, and different ethnicities so the group is quite diverse. 

There are about 11 of us so far in the discord but expanding the play group is something I'm very excited about. Any questions please feel free to ask and I hope to add some more people to the group!

Hello from Kentucky!

First off, fuck Mitch McConnell.  And fuck Rand Paul too. 

On to the news...

A medical marijuana bill has passed the House and heads for the Senate...but it's just 

&gt;a resolution asking federal regulators to speed up their research on Medical Marijuana

https://www.clayconews.com/news/15459-medical-marijuana-resolution-passes-to-senate

we're slow around here y'all

Braidy Industries, in bed with Russian oligarchs, has still failed to build anything yet. A press release went out saying Craig Bouchard, the CEO, had stepped down.  Bouchard disputed that so another press release went out saying the board had removed him.  

&gt;Bouchard claimed the disagreement between him and the board ""is my pursuit of foreign strategic partners representing patient capital that will stay with us for generations. Some of the directors want a focus on finding American private equity investment.""

Meaning he wants to be obligated to the Russians for a long long time, and the rest of the board is like YIKES to that.   

https://www.dailyindependent.com/news/bouchard-board-action-jeopardizes-braidy/article_b1d1c4aa-44f5-11ea-a23e-5b2555a3ea16.html

Today (that was Monday) in Louisville there will be a panel discussion on the recent proposed anti-sanctuary bill.

&gt;The bill has already passed out of a state Senate committee and would ban cities, state agencies and public employees from adopting policies that discourage them from cooperating with immigration officials.

&gt;University of Louisville Professor Riffat Hassan, an Islamic scholar and one of the event‚Äôs organizers, says the bill would create a culture of fear among Kentucky‚Äôs immigrant and minority communities.

oh and I had to add this quote because of the rich irony

&gt;Sen. Danny Carroll, a Republican from Paducah and the bill‚Äôs sponsor, said last week that it would be wrong for state and local officials to ignore federal law.

Has Senator Danny Carroll, Republican, forgotten about states' rights???  Sure looks like it.

In the United States alone, there is approximately 1,000,000 people with MS, with ~200 people diagnosed each week, and &gt;2,500,000 worldwide. There is also no known cure.

I am currently trying to raise $4,500, this money would go to individuals with MS and would help pay for house and car modifications, medication, therapy, and other things that they need to get through day to day life. While crossing the United States I am going to be performing service projects with them such as building ramps, cleaning gutters, trimming trees, and anything else that they have a difficult time doing.

Cycling helped turn my life around, and I want to use it to help other people now. I used to be [morbidly obese](https://i.imgur.com/s2MvHp4.png), struggling to go up stairs without being out of breath, being unable to run more than 10 seconds without feeling chest pains, and was on track for diabetes. Losing this weight has changed my life so much, and I can thank cycling for it.

Kentucky, this means a lot to me, and this means a lot to the people this money goes to. This is as important to me as what bourbon is to some of you (yes I know that's a really high mark to set). I look forward to seeing your beautiful state, and I can't wait to try some of your bourbon!

I'm currently selling miles to help raise money, for every dollar donated, you will get 2 miles! After I finish your miles, I'll tell you and can verify it on Strava!

I'm a military bratt. I've lived all over, including both sides of the pacific and the atlantic. West Coast, East Coast, E.U., Asia, etc. But I've been really nostalgic for Kentucky lately.

I wasn't born in Kentucky. I don't live there now. Was only there for a short spurt of 4 years in the rural areas an hour outside of Louisville during the late bush jr./early obama years. But they were still impactful on me nonetheless.

I miss the rolling hills, the greenery, the horses, the summers, the winters and this isn't meant as an insult I promise - how undeveloped it was. Yea, Louisville a ""city"" but it ain't one that sprawls if you know what I mean. Maybe 30, 40 minutes out and you're in proper country. There's very few cities like that, I find.

I was there when the recession happened, I was there during the ice storms that knocked out power several winters over most of the state. 

I was there when I was old enough I could be smart and understand the world and have my own adventures, but still hadn't hit puberty so I didn't care about what boys or girls thought of me yet. I would spend my afternoons riding my bike around the neighborhood, swimming in creeks, playing baseball by the ohio river, hiking in the hills or going to mammoth cave.

Key points about myself.

\- I am a Mechanical Engineer, however I grew up in a small Southern Illinois Town \[Latitude just above Louisville\] of just 300 people.

\- Avid outdoorsmen, love to hunt, I own several hunting rifles I've never got to use because Illinois is a Shotgun-Slug hunting state.

\- Conservative, however temperate and patient as I have several Chicago suburb friends. Extremely pro 2nd Amendment and Pro Conservation and Environment.

\- Bourbon and Whiskey collector; yes KY is Bourbon capital however I know some counties are still Dry Counties

Once upon a time I was in Eastern Kentucky for work when I happened upon a diner that was Greek themed. This diner had a giant hamburger that if you finished it in 20 minutes or less you'd win a t-shirt. 

It is with great pride that I can say I won that challenge. It might be my proudest moment. I did something few others have done or want to do. But then, tragedy struck. They told me after checking that no shirts were available. As quickly as I had become enveloped in a glow of success, and victory, I now had my breadth taken from me. 

The kindly waitress behind the counter looked at me with the deepest of sadness. She knew I was devastated, but in a positive note she took my me and promised that I could have a shirt that was owed if I returned

Years passed and now I wish to return and take what is rightfully mine... But I can't remember where it was or the name. All I know is that it was a Greek themed, kinda 50s style diner.

Reddit, can you help a lost soul find their t-shirt? Do any of you know of such a place?

Thanks",Kentucky,Sad Washingtonian ISO for Greek themed diner in Eastern Kentucky that had hamburger challenge

504,goldishspoon,1582924714,fb1t92,Nan,"On April 9th, 1989, human remains were found in a tobacco barn off KY State Highway 22; this was about 7.5 miles west of Dry Ridge near Williamstown, Kentucky.

https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/unidentified-persons/john-doe---grant-county-kentucky

The victim's hands were severed from his body, he was stripped of his clothing, and he was shot twice in the back of the head with a .22 caliber gun.

He had extensive dental work which included a ten unit porcelain fixed, porcelain to metal bridge with missing teeth replaced with porcelain pontics. His teeth would have looked quite perfect.

He is believed to have been a caucasian male of about 25 years old, 6'5 in height, and about 220 lbs. His medium brown hair was worn in a crew cut with short sideburns &amp; the PMI was estimated to be about 2 weeks.

Somewhat uniquely, John Doe had a condition called plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome) which can be caused by the baby's position in the womb or when a baby spends too much time on his back, post-birth; it's important to note that this has nothing to do with brain development. He also had a previously healed nasal fracture.

Until 2016, Grant County John Doe only had a simple sketch of what he might have looked like. https://i.imgur.com/sxklpsv.jpg. Kentucky State Troopers then created this likeness of him in the aforementioned year: https://i.imgur.com/AFcd9SS.jpg

Some sleuths have speculated that Grant County John Doe was involved in organized crime due to the nature of the killing but so far, it remains pure speculation.

------------

DNA Doe Project, which is a non-profit that has successfully identified many Jane and John Does using genetic genealogy (think of the Golden State Killer case) has recently taken on this case &amp; will need funding for DNA sequencing.

Our favorite areas are the Corbin-London-Monticello area in the southeast, as we have family there and the mountains are beautiful.  We've been checking out the Jackson Purchase region as well, especially around Mayfield and Fulton.  Both regions seem relatively safe (although Somerset looked a little higher on the crime charts), but I would like to know what locals have to say about both areas?  It's one thing looking from a distance, but I'd really like to know what it's like actually living there.  Are people and churches generally welcoming to outsiders?  Don't worry about the economy, that isn't a big deal for us, as we are self employed and work at home, and whether or not there is ""nothing to do"" isn't big either, as we are very laid back and just looking for a nice small town area to settle down and maybe get horses some day.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from outbreak zones such as Seattle, Australia, and the LA area. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now ready yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**Context:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its exponential spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted in China through stringent measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** COVID-19 has infected over [100,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) people globally. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep. That means there is likely silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186). 

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

#**Important:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets** (coughing/sneezing/breathing). But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and be mindful of everything you touch in public (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source2 ](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.**

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)--especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world and has [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients. [Toronto Star soberly warns hospitals can‚Äôt cope if coronavirus outbreak worsens in Canada: March 6th.](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/03/06/hospitals-warn-they-cant-cope-if-coronavirus-outbreak-worsens-in-canada.html)

* A surgeon working in the heart of Italy's outbreak gives a harrowing testimony and urges everyone to heed the warning that it can easily overwhelm hospitals ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffa2tf/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/fjx5tc8/) / [Original](https://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_07/coronavirus-bergamo-medico-humanitas-facebook-situazione-drammatica-altro-che-normale-influenza-4fdf6866-6088-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml)).

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

#**Psychology**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and make an effort to listen to your local health authorities. 

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper).  The public needs you to be clear, informative, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. 

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**Risk Reduction**

* Practice social distancing.

* Do not touch your face.

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). 

* Carry disinfectant with you.

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. 

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Consider pressing your boss to work from home. Many transmissions happen at work.

* If you have extra face masks, consider donating some to senior care facilities and hospitals, as there is a global shortage and they will desperately need them in the coming months. Masks in the right hands is to your benefit, as they slow the spread. Hoarded masks are actually detrimental to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitaizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Always remember the top three: Disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**Typical symptoms:**

(All direct from [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf))

People with COVID-19 generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days). As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases [in China], typical signs and symptoms include:

* Fever (87.9%)

* Dry cough (67.7%)

* Fatigue (38.1%)

* Sputum production (33.4%) (a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract)

* Shortness of breath (18.6%)

* Sore throat (13.9%)

* Headache (13.6%)

* Joint pain (14.8%)

* Chills (11.4%)

* Nausea or vomiting (5.0%)

* Nasal congestion (4.8%)

* Diarrhea (3.7%)

* Hemoptysis (0.9%) (coughing up of blood or blood-stained mucus from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs)

* Conjunctival congestion (0.8%) 

[Here is what those symptoms look like on a visual timeline, in Fahrenheit](https://i.imgur.com/6BSEg6n.jpg).

#**Comorbidities**

Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include those who meet *any* of the following conditions:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart, lung or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* People with weakened respiratory system due to [smoking/vaping](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure""**

Source: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html)

What does it mean for you if you fall into this bracket? A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) explains.

#**Mortality rate:**

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0 as of now
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%).

#**Additionals:**

* It's still far too early to know for sure, but the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is estimated to be 0.94% (0.37%‚Äì2.9% with a 95% CI) ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Though [here](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html) is a recent Slate piece that mentions a CFR between 0.2 to 0.4. South Korea, after doing 140,000 tests, reports a CFR of 0.6% ([source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-tested-140-000-031000719.html))

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, as SARS-like virus can have long-term consequences: ""Long-term bone and lung consequences associated with hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome: says a [15-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5)"". And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)).

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I'm a volunteer who's put countless hours into this document. Why? I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal--that and I've been following Covid-19 closely since mid January.

Now COVID-19 is upon my doorstep too. 

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it helped you. 
Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

Mods of communities are invited to link this post from the [source doc](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/femw1n/psa_regarding_covid19/) so that it's continually kept up to date.

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA.

His amendment would ""require a social security number for purposes of the child tax credit, and to provide the President the authority to transfer funds as necessary, and to terminate United States military operations and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan.""

The delayed [coronovirus relief bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201) provided ""paid sick leave for some workers, expanded unemployment compensation and nearly $1 billion in additional money to help feed children, homebound senior citizens and others.""

Senator [Mitch McConnell](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-holds-presser-on-round-3-of-coronavirus-legislation), also representing Kentucky, told fellow Republicans unhappy with the bill ""to gag and vote for it...to reassure the people around the country.""

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like, this is all part of life. This virus situation in general will change day to day.

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

i have resorted to posting on reddit because if i speak publicly about the things going on at chewy, i will lose my job. with the current state of the world, I can‚Äôt afford to do that. 

I don‚Äôt need to explain the seriousness of the situation right now. we all know about COVID 19. Chewy.com nearly pretends it‚Äôs not happening (save for handing out wipes periodically throughout the day and cleaning the shit out of HR and managements offices!)

we present as a pharmacy, but operate very much like your typical call center. our cubicles measure about 42‚Äù wide, and we‚Äôre back to back, with about 3‚Äô between you and your neighbors to the side, front, and back. when, not if, this thing catches someone in this office, we will ALL be sick in a matter of days. 

HR has closed and locked their doors. We aren‚Äôt allowed to ask questions. Management sends the same damn email every day as an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù but really it just tells us that nothing is changing... but they do now offer 40 hours of paid sick time for WHEN you get sick. how about prevention as opposed to treatment? 

if you utter a word about COVID19 management either pulls you into a meeting to scold you, or quite literally tells you to ‚Äúshut up.‚Äù 

we are not allowed to panic. we are not allowed to do anything but what‚Äôs best for the pet parents. but what about the parents who have live human children at home with compromised immune systems or other medical conditions which may make them high risk if exposed? 

to make things better, management opened up overtime for at least the next month, so there are WAY more people here at a time than usual.

people are trying to speak out but anything negative about the company is being removed by their dreaded social media team. if it‚Äôs on their page, they remove it. 

we are talking about a pharmacy distributing medication for pets. why are we prioritizing animals over humans? chewy.com is a great company, unless you‚Äôre working for them making all these things happen. 

please do what you can to spread this information. chewy.com does not care about us. we‚Äôre working on top of each other, we‚Äôre scared, and we have no voice.",Kentucky,chewy pharmacy in louisville

Now while none of us technically fall in the high risk category, I think any of us could have an undiagnosed condition that would put us in that category. I have been having chest pains on and off for months and I can't currently leave the house to find out why since our new insurance just kicked in right before all this started. So basically I feel that if we do get sick, any of us could die at home since we would never be tested. I feel doomed. I feel like he's putting this job ahead of our family, and I'm angry. I feel like every time he leaves the house we are taking a huge risk and he's putting us in jeopardy. I'm about to tell him if he doesn't want to quarantine then he can live in our detached garage out back away from us for the next 2 weeks. I think we are extremely lucky to have the means to quarantine without huge financial repercussions. But even if we lost everything over this, I wouldn't care as long as we come out of it alive. Our house, car, and his job mean nothing to me if my kids end up with one less parent or worse. I don't exactly know why I'm posting this here, I just need advice and thought you guys might actually care.",Kentucky,Husband is refusing to self quarantine despite having enough vacation time to cover it.

While I prefer Bernie at this point I think Biden will most likely be the democratic nominee so here is something I think he should do to win over people like me and to show himself a steady capable leader. Biden should do [fireside chats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats).

During the great depression and WW2 FDR gave a series of radio addresses in which he spoke informally about the state of the national crises and the actions being taken to address them. They showed FDR to be a strong steady leader and helped the public to work together and accept necessary sacrifices (rationing, military causalities etc.) during a tumultuous time. FDR offered the people a measure of his calm and confidence. During this period of uncertainty and crises with covid-19 sweeping the planet and economies in free-fall Biden has the opportunity to give a similar offering.

FDR gave 30 addressees over a period of about 11 years, obviously Biden will need to increase the pace a bit. I'd like to see a web address at least weekly but preferably 3-4 times a week. I'd like to see three things in each address. First a frank assessment of the situation. He should review numbers both in the US and around the world and he should address developments and news stories giving data driven information and the opinions of relevant experts to reinforce points and dispel misinformation. Second a public call to action. He should conference in an expert on a subject related to the health crisis and do an informal interview to give a more detailed look at one aspect of the situation that culminates in a call to action for large bodies (states, corporations, cities, government agencies, etc.) to implement at least one of the recommendations given by the expert. Last should be an individual call to action. It should answer ""What can I do?"" for some aspect of what the expert talked about in the interview and call for every individual to do some simple thing that helps them and/or someone else get through the crises.

I have a couple of topics that I would like to see done first. I know ""flatten the curve"" is out there but it's important enough that it shouldn't be ignored and more attention can always be drawn to it. The other is the psychological effects of isolation. People are going to have trouble dealing with quarantines especially if they drag on for months. It is a good idea to have someone telling people to pick up a hobby, get some exercise, and call their mammas. Is may sound silly but Joe Biden teaching people to fold paper airplanes to deal with stress could be powerful.

At the very least it is a potentially effective campaigning tool that could be used while covid-19 makes public events a bad idea. I would caution though that it shouldn't be used to attack Trump or the response so far. The addresses should be about giving the public good information and a strong reliable leader while playing to Biden strengths as a relatable person who's easy to spend time with.

What do you think? Is it something you would like to see? What topics would you want him to cover? Would you add of change anything about the format I proposed?",Kentucky,Biden should do fireside chats

My insurance is now requesting some documents to now total the car and give a value payout. One of the documents they require is the Title. Well I never remembered receiving it. 

After some digging, I believe what happened is that I found the paperwork ""Title Lien Statement"" that I am no learning I was suppose to file? In order to get my title. Anyone have any ideas where to go from here? Can I still file this to get the title, and would this just mean by never filing this that my loan holder still has possession of the title?

I just found out 4 years after buying the car that I was suppose to file this, and KY law says they can't hold the title from me. (at least from my googling today) So not sure if I never filed, that the bank still has the lease, and maybe I could just get them to release it to my Insurance. 

Sorry if none of this makes sense. Obviously this is a first for me. Even tried talking to family who stated they never had to file anything, just got the title in the mail. But I'm seeing that since I bought it in a different county, but registered it in another, that the paperwork to automatically send me the title was never put through, and It became my responsibility.....Kinda at a loss here.",Kentucky,Car Title

- Allows citizens to sue the state if they feel the emergency measures are excessive.
- It puts the burden of proof on the state to prove 'by clear and convincing evidence' that the order is as limited and short as possible. Of course, this will only be known in hindsight. We are all doing our best to analyze the situation but due to the lack of testing and basic stats about the virus such as mortality rate and R0, we are flying blind so we have to be especially careful.

1. It is a fixed-term lease. I know there is no statue in Kentucky law that requires a notice to vacate for fixed-term leases. The 60-day requirement is in the lease contract.

2. I've spoken to the manager at the apartment complex to try and come to an understanding and they are only threatening to charge even more if I do not pay immediately about another month's worth of rent.

3. I am currently still employed, and not ill, and am not in need of temporary housing.

I know evictions are being halted in a lot of places including Kentucky. Does anyone have any information if these vacate notices have been affected by any recent decisions of the local or KY state government or the federal government?

Now maybe they are actually donating the money, but after seeing so many news stories and posts of people making masks and sending them to hospitals or other places, I feel like this couple are scamming people.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

After seeing the graph for the umpteenth time, I started thinking about how this whole virus thing was going to wind down. Slowly things are going to start opening up and life is going to crawl back to normal. But I think Andy is going to take his time. Whether or not this is a good thing, people are going to start getting angry if other states start lifting their quarantines but Andy will say ""not yet"" because of the graphs. Again, whether or not it helps in the long run, this will be a little bit down the road when people are getting stir crazy and REALLY wanting life to go back to normal. And seeing the rest of the country opening back up but Andy saying we need to wait longer is going to piss a LOT of people off.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I think this is because every time he shows that graph he talks about the ""bump"" where things started opening back up too early and people started getting sick again. I can tell he is trying to prepare people for when he doesn't open things back up while everyone else around him does. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is just a thought and it will be interesting to see what actually happens. Maybe everyone else will wait like Andy is wanting and it won't be as bad, but if they don't, and other governors and the president start opening things earlier than Andy wants, it could get ugly.",Kentucky,Andy will go from the most loved governer to the most hated in a span of a few months.

To try and put this in perspective, I did some math, but I would like someone to double check it.

KY has approximately 4.5 million people. Using conservative estimates that around 40% of the population will get this virus, that means that 1.8 million KY residents will become infected.  Again, using conservative estimates, 80% of those infected will have little to no symptoms of being ill.  But 20% will have symptoms and possibly need emergency care.  20% of 1.8 million people is 360,000 people requiring treatment in a system that only has 18,500 beds available.
