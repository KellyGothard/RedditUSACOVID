Are you a non-traditional student? if you are a traditional student, this sounds very typical for a person your age. 

When I was in college I didn't make nearly as much as you did! Lord, I worked my butt off, too..

I guess I just see things differently- I don't sit and frump and say 'arg, there is only minimum wage jobs available here' I (did) work those jobs, worked my way up to better jobs, worked multiple places at the same time, etc.  Want to make good money? Either work your butt off or get yourself qualified to earn that money. We have Stennis Space Center on one end of the coast and Ingalls Shipbuilding on the other.  Ingalls employs almost 12K people! They train you as well. Stennis has a company that makes 3D printed rockets! The only company in the world to do that! If the grass is greener, states around us have great opportunities as well.

I don't think I had any luck, I grew up working on a farm milking cows.. Yet somehow I make it in the poorest state in the nation.. You can too! This is a great time to be alive, so much opportunity. At least that is the way I see it",1577804514,fcn6ge5

What if they became a cashier, even though they COULD have become an engineer? Should they be paid a higher 'living wage' because they had the capability (but never did) become an engineer? Why should the cashier get paid more than what they are worth for their skillset? (I'm not demeaning being a cashier!)  

Here is another view: I have a good friend who owns a FEC business.. based on average income, he can afford 6 employees and still pay the other bills (rent, power, water (he doesn't pay himself)). All his employees get paid minimum wage, but there is a path for pay increase. Everyone that works there knows this before they are hired, this is a part-time high-school kid type job.  SHould these employees get paid more than minimum wage? If he increased the pay to a 'living wage', he would have to let 2 people go. Is that a better scenerio?

I agree!  What do you consider basic costs of living?

*I would much rather business owners be responsible for their employees' incomes than to depend on tax payers to subsidize their incomes.*

I agree! The more people are on gov assistance, the more they are taking MY money!

Some people just know how to use the system, though. They actively make sure they don't earn enough so they will get gov asst. But for the others, there should be a path to success. Success for some is just having a job! success for others is $1M.

I was the floor manager at a Toys-R-Us for a while, and it was obvious some wanted to work and were glad to have a job and others couldn't care less. Should they be paid the same? Heck no. The slackers were always late, sometimes didn't show up, and complained the whole time. The ones with ambition came early, were eager to work, polite, and never complained about anything.

It's easy to say everyone should make more money, but it's different when YOU are in control of the money and who makes what.

Walmart starts their employees making more than that..! Yet people look down at working there, like it is bottom-of-the-barrel.. 

In fact, Walmart is a great example. If you are happy with the wage that you start with and have no ambition to ever do any better, no problem! You can simmer right where you are. But if you have ambition, want to COOK and do better, there is a ladder you can climb. My brother worked there an after several years not only was he making very good money he has stock options and insurance. Opportunity! Yet, people complain and say it isn't enough.

Yes! I agree! Skillset and merit should determine your earnings. The employer will know these and can hire the best candidate for the job. I totally agree.

We need a minimum wage exactly for the unskilled labor. Once you have skills and/or ambition, you should make more. But there is no guarantee, and if you try to go out on your own an be self employed, there is a chance you will fail (I did!).

I'm very sorry to hear that. Starting out can be very difficult and you are scared and don't know what to do or say. I would have suggested getting another job. It's not worth the mental stress to be in that situation. I have quit jobs before and it is a huge stress reliever. Sometimes, you just need to start all over! Being active in a church helps too.

*A wise person once told me if a company is paying you minimum wage they would pay you less if they could, and never have I encountered such a truer statement.* 

That is very true, most companies (especially smaller businesses) only have so much they can use for payroll. But usually this is all discussed before you are hired, there shouldn't be any secrets about how much you are making.

Life can definitely hand you truckloads of suckiness, there is no doubt about that. If you HAVE been dealt a load of suck, why not realize that has happened, assess the options, and work toward the next step up? I get that people get stuck in a have-to-have-this-job routine, but there are so many opportunites to help I would hope that those would give some hope if taken advantage of.  Even if it is just changing from this sucky job to the next sucky job, at least it is a change and may be mentally better.

But the administrators are also responsible to the degree that they can control or discourage violence. A few years ago, they found that violence went down when they took more people out of solidarity confinement. So if they start throwing more people in solitary confinement without justification, they are partly responsible for the accompanying increase in violence. 

Similarly, if the prison is such a hellish cesspool that it degrades inmates’ sanity, then the administration is responsible in part from the violence that flows from that degradation.

In 1910, the physician oligopoly was started during the Republican administration of William Taft after the American Medical Association lobbied the states to strengthen the regulation of medical licensure and allow their state AMA offices to oversee the closure or merger of nearly half of medical schools and also the reduction of class sizes. The states have been subsidizing the education of the number of doctors recommended by the AMA.


In 1925, prescription drug monopolies begun after the federal government led by Republican President Calvin Coolidge started allowing the patenting of drugs. (Drug monopolies have also been promoted by government research and development subsidies targeted to favored pharmaceutical companies.)


In 1945, buyer monopolization begun after the McCarran-Ferguson Act led by the Roosevelt Administration exempted the business of medical insurance from most federal regulation, including antitrust laws. (States have also more recently contributed to the monopolization by requiring health care plans to meet standards for coverage.)


In 1946, institutional provider monopolization begun after favored hospitals received federal subsidies (matching grants and loans) provided under the Hospital Survey and Construction Act passed during the Truman Administration. (States have also been exempting non-profit hospitals from antitrust laws.)


In 1951, employers started to become the dominant third-party insurance buyer during the Truman Administration after the Internal Revenue Service declared group premiums tax-deductible.


In 1965, nationalization was started with a government buyer monopoly after the Johnson Administration led passage of Medicare and Medicaid which provided health insurance for the elderly and poor, respectively.


In 1972, institutional provider monopolization was strengthened after the Nixon Administration started restricting the supply of hospitals by requiring federal certificate-of-need for the construction of medical facilities.


In 1974, buyer monopolization was strengthened during the Nixon Administration after the Employee Retirement Income Security Act exempted employee health benefit plans offered by large employers (e.g., HMOs) from state regulations and lawsuits (e.g., brought by people denied coverage).


In 1984, prescription drug monopolies were strengthened during the Reagan Administration after the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act permitted the extension of patents beyond 20 years. (The government has also allowed pharmaceuticals companies to bribe physicians to prescribe more expensive drugs.)


In 2003, prescription drug monopolies were strengthened during the Bush Administration after the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act provided subsidies to the elderly for drugs.",1578573240,fdn0aa7

Let me change the wording of some quotes slightly to show you how this isn't science but propaganda. 

&gt;The toxicology screen of mass killer Devin Patrick Kelley revealed [H2O] in his system when he killed 26 people at a Texas church last November.  A week after the killings in Texas,  California [""water drinker""] Kevin Neal murdered five people and injured eleven others.  [Water], or heavy use of [H2O] at a young age, is a common web between many mass killers....

&gt;Heavy or very heavy use of [water] at a young age links several gunmen and terrorists with or without ideologies:  Planned Parenthood shooter Robert Dear;  Aurora shooter James Holmes; Tucson shooter Jared Loughner, and the Chattanooga shooter Mohammed Abdulazeez.

&gt;[Water] was intricately tied to the Boston bombers, the Oklahoma City bomber and the Bastille Day terrorist in Nice. Brahim and Salah Abdeslam, who planned killing 130 at a Paris night club, and Cherif Kouachi, of the Charlie Hebdo killings, also belonged to the complicated web of heavy, chronic [H2O] users.  The perpetrators of bombings in Londonand Manchester were known to be heavy [water] users.

&gt;[Water drinking] mass killers often stand out because of the chronic and obsessive nature  of their [water consumption].   Planned Parenthood shooter Robert Dear appears to have [had a tap installed in his home because of his desire to be hydrated]

See how with no scientific evidence I can just substitute anything in there that these folks had in common and make that thing seem bad. You can just pick any common thing and put it in there and suddenly claim that the presence of that thing causes mass killers. All this article shows is these people were unafraid of dealing in black market substances and not that they caused any of their other behaviors. You could also say that their previously existing mental state drove them to seek out marijuana rather than the other way around using the evidence presented in this article but you can see it's written with clear bias. 

Your second article just seems to be a list of side effects but have you read the side effects of some of the things considered harmless like [caffeine](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/harmful-effects-of-caffeine) cause bruh... 

If you have science real science linking marijuana to violence (aside that caused by it being on the black market ie cartels, gangs, dealers) I really would be interested in seeing it. I've not seen any real scientific evidence linking this.",1578671583,fdqopic

That is if the distribution center is managed by Toshiba directly; if it's a subsidiary or contracted out it may be lower or higher (Ex: Arrow and Avnet pay $11-12 hourly while Digi-Key may be upwards of $17). These type of places actively take advantage of our [cheap labor and lax business laws](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/12/01/a-grim-bargain/); hence why so many manufacturing plants are starting to crop up in the south when partnered with tax incentives.

A large population that is low-skilled due to lack of education investment in their communities, which in turn get taken advantage of by those trying to improve their bottom line instead of the employee. The tax incentives additionally pull funds away from investing into education or practical work-training, and the small number of jobs these companies provide fail to offer high wages that recuperate that cost in taxed income. Rinse and repeat while the community fails to prosper.

Instead of celebrating this small accomplishment, why not push for a better educated populace that can attract high paying jobs that will in turn churn more taxable income for the state to improve?",1578676177,fdqxf73

That's about the crux of the issue. I think it's a good thing that these jobs will be created, but I also don't think that people should have to rely on companies moving to their state in order to have a prospective job or career- especially when these companies are only coming here due to the low labor cost and tax incentives and our state's history with labor unions.

Because the majority of Mississippians who achieve higher education usually have to leave the state for places like Memphis, Birmingham, Little Rock, (insert Texas city here), etc. **because** they usually can't find an entry-level job in their chosen career here in the state.  Furthermore, the state's infrastructure, and most notably network infrastructure is severely lacking, especially in North MS, where I am from.  AT&amp;T owns probably 90% of my area, and we're stuck with 5 mb/s down 0.33 mb/s up on a good day.  You can't run most educated self-employed businesses such as IT development, cloud hosting, etc. on that.  Finally, on that note, [we ranked 49th in internet speeds in the entire country.](https://www.djournal.com/news/study-shows-mississippi-ranks-th-in-internet-speed-for/article_eaffad5c-a40b-5c8e-a8e0-bd22b839c9be.html)

I'm the only person I know from my college program that has stayed in the state and that is only because my employer called me literally a month after I graduated, looking for someone with my skill set who would be willing to stay in MS and work, and after two interviews, well 1.5 years later here I am.  If any other employer had gotten me instead, I'm 99% sure I would not be living in Mississippi right now.  My situation is the exception, not the norm.

It's all fine and well that you want a higher educated, more skilled populace in the state, but when the state cannot incentivize companies to come here and provide those high paying jobs you're talking about, and when our network infrastructure discourages individual entrepreneurship, especially in the IT sector, then those people will simply leave the state.",1578681135,fdr91tu

Well, no. You just had to owe, not necessary borrow. You could have a tax levied against you which you couldn’t pay and end up in debtor’s prison, for example.

If the IRS determined that you owed them $13,000 tomorrow, I would not want them to be able to put you in jail.

No. I agree with you there. So she should have to serve time for theft. This is what we do. 

The question is whether she should also have to pay the money back and then if the state should be able to incarcerate and use a form of forced labor in addition to that time. 

I think (someone tell me if I’m wrong) that this is all being done as a form of parole. Embezzlement is usually five years I think. So they parole you after 1 year but you have to pay back the money as a condition. If that’s how it work I’m 100% good with that and do t think anyone’s right are violated.

Most conservatives strongly believe that our profit based economic systems around the world is what has allowed the world population to triple from 2.5 billion people in 1920 to over 7 billion today while lowering the total number of people worldwide in extreme poverty.

Thus we view attempts to do away with capitalism as the base of economies worldwide as highly destructive to humanities well being and continued progress both for the nation and the world.

This is a case of having the same goals, but completely disagreeing on how to best achieve those goals.

And even if you live here for 25+ years, if you aren't properly indoctrinated you never really belong and will be reminded of it.  As soon as I can manage it I'm going to sell everything and move back north.

The main reason for me personally is because the people of MS basically seem to show no interest in caring about their state at all.   For instance, a lot of my family lives in AR.   Beyond the fact that they already have medical marijuana up there (yes, AR did it a couple of years ago), they also tend to care about their wilderness areas.     For instance, you can drive through the Ouachita forest all day and probably never see a piece of trash.   

By contrast, most of MS looks like Mexico if you bother looking at the shit tossed out on the side of roads.   If there is a patch of wilderness that isn't federally protected it will be clear cut the minute somebody can make a dollar off it.    And I do not even understand how Jackson can be falling apart like it is while the Governor's mansion is right there in middle of it.   When the state government can basically ignore the state capital indefinitely, yet remain there, it doesn't make any sense at all.

This entire state is run by grifters and idiots basically.   And to be fair all of the state governments have this to an extent, but in MS they appear to have a monopoly.

MLK day became a Federal Holiday in 86 after it was signed into law by Reagan. 

Arizona rescinded the law in their state so it would not be celebrated in 1987 - the next year. **Not MS, AL, or FL: Arizona.**

New Hampshire didn’t recognize the holiday until 1999. 

Utah was the last state to officially recognize MLK day as a holiday in 2000. 

The REL birthday holiday existed in MS since the 1800s. Lee’s birthday was Jan 19th. King was born Jan 15th. 

I believe King’s birthday was added to the existing holiday. Was the irony of that lost on whoever set it up? I don’t know. I was too young to care 1983 (before the federal holiday and a lot of other states) when MS started celebrating it.

So when you complain about this, you complaint should be that MS celebrates REL’s birthday without any other attachments. If REL’s birthday happened to be in October or Kong’s at some other time, this would not be a thing (the fact that they share a holiday, that is.)",1579479678,ff1ic9t

May I ask why this is?

Look, I don't know how long you've lived here or why you are still here of you don't like it. But I like this state. I've been all over the country and there's no other place I'd rather be. Not everything is perfect and our government isn't the best but the positives, in my opinion, outweigh the negatives. The people, culture, nature, music, food, traditions. All good things. But Mississippi, and the south as a whole, is being unfairly targeted by outsiders who've never been here. 

You want to know what my angle is? Well I've told you the god honest truth. My family settled the lands where Neshoba currently sits before Mississippi was even a state. We have been here since the beginning. We still own the same 80 acres that my 4x grandfather bought way back in the early 1800s. My family going all the way back then lie in a family graveyard in Neshoba county not 45 minutes from where I currently live now.

My grandmother's side were sharecroppers all the way until the 1960s out there in Sebastopol where they worked their fingers to the bone to make a living in the hot Mississippi sun. Her great grandfather came here as an Irish immigrant in the 1850s and they've been here ever since. 

You wanna talk about civil rights? I personally knew several of the folks that were involved in the 1964 murders out there in Neshoba. I know all about it and about the problems this state has faced. Don't think that I'm ignorant or in support of some of the bad that's happened here. But I'm here to tell you that the good prevails. 

My point is, I've got a long history here. I know that Mississippi isn't perfect, but it's home goddammit. I'll be nowhere else. People who've never set foot in Mississippi in their lives love to come here and talk shit. Well fuck em. You want to believe that I'm some racist piece of shit? I don't give a fuck. I know I'm not, but I don't got to prove that to you.

So if we need to rely on public schools, how am I supposed to refrain from relying on the government to get a (decent) education, and why shouldn't I want and expect to hold them accountable if the quality of that education is inadequate?

Ditto for roads and bridges, widespread transportation infrastructure as a whole is pretty much nonsensical without centralized planning and public funding. And why shouldn't they be publicly funded? We all use the roads and bridges, no?

Nevermind that the expectation that we should all pick ourselves by our bootstraps pretty much guarantee that the rich will stay rich while the poor will remain poor. As nice a fantasy as it is that someone born into poverty can live the American Dream, it realistically doesn't happen anymore except in extreme situations, like pro athletes--so, to be clear, *maybe* 2,000 people in a country of 330 million?

This goes against some of the other discussions on here where people say 'all these incentives ($) need to go toward education'. I'm glad you understand that if there are NOT jobs available when people graduate, they will definitely leave and find them.

I agree with a lot of what you are saying and you make great points.

I know we are in the state of the blues, but continually saying we ""can't"" eventually sinks in whether it is true or not.

794,794,EmotionallySqueezed,"Northwest checking in! Our roads are great, and we just opened a new section of interstate (that admittedly began construction before the 2007 Financial Crisis). 

I’m not sure where you live, but maybe you should consider running for your town/county council on the issue of road repair. 

As for actually fixing the roads, you don’t need a fortune teller to know that there’s no money for extensive repairs. According to Google, a mile of resurfacing for a four lane road is $1.25 million per mile. To construct a mile of four lane highway would cost anywhere from $4-10 million per mile. 

There are alternatives however:

1. Toll roads. Toll roads do not exist in Mississippi, but are very common elsewhere. Toll roads are privately-owned roads that charge a fee for use, either flat or by distance. With increasing levels of automation, toll roads can be run with relatively minimal costs. I’m not certain, but I think that toll roads used to remain private for a period of time until being transferred to public ownership. I don’t know if that still happens, but it’s something to keep in mind long-term.

2. Increased public transportation.  More local/county/regional/statewide buses and light rail and mass transit will keep drivers off the roads, which will help them last longer, making them more cost-effective to repair. There will be investment costs, seeing as we have little to no public transit outside of Jackson, the coast, and a few towns here and there, but we can charge a usage fee, take out a loan, or raise taxes to pay for it.

3. Take out a loan. Yes, but let’s not. We have little in the way of expected growth and state reinvestment, so it’s not likely we’ll be able to accrue enough benefits to make the payments worth it. 

4. Raise taxes. No politician who wants to be re-elected will suggest this, but it can be done. So, it costs $1.25m/mile to resurface a four lane road, and there are 73,000 miles of paved road in Mississippi. Assuming every mile is four lanes, it will cost $125 billion to resurface the states roads, which is about $30 billion more than the entire state generates annually. The state government’s budget for 2019 was only $6 billion! But if we devote our entire 2019 budget to the task for 20.8 years, we can replace the state!...or we could slightly raise taxes from 7% to 10% which would raise state government revenue to $9.5b, giving us $3.5b more a year to use for roads, public transport, and to invest in neighborhood jobs.

5. There’s others, but I have laundry to fold.

2. Again, Ms is a rural state.  There aren't enough people to support any sort of public transportation system that would make a difference.  
3. Revenues are coming in from taxes, gambling and now a lottery.  
4.  I'm not even talking about resurfacing every road.  I'm talking about the much less ambitious goal of fixing broken pipes that are allowed to continue undermining the roads until they lead to massive sinkholes as well as the ever present potholes.  

How about 6. cut down on the corruption and graft and use current revenues for road maintenance.

I was also the first person in the state of Mississippi to be expunged for a DUI under a law they made a few years back so I got it totally expunged by a lawyer that did a really good job on my case seeing that there was yet to be any precedent for it. 

The requirements for expungment were that you had a license at the time of the DUI, that you took all your classes and paid all fees, that you plead guilty and blew on the breathalyzers, and that you blew under a  0.16 when you got the DUI. 

You must wait 5 years until after the DUI and not get any others for this to work. It is 100% worth it to get it expunged as a DUI can fuck up your background checks. It won't appear on background checks if you get it expunged. It won't even appear on the cops information about you when you get pulled over.

I don't think you'll get probation but I've only got experience with one DUI and it was in Lauderdale County. To be cautious, perhaps you should wait until after you plead guilty to smoke.

And DO NOT DRIVE DRUNK ANYMORE. Don't even drive high. Don't fuck up your life. Three DUI's and you go to prison. If you hit someone while you're drunk and they get injured or die, you go to prison.

975,975,Pyperman,"Let me ask you this: were they ANY statements in the speech that were fact-checked to be true? I guess not, since that article chose to only show the ones that were either directly or indirectly false. This is an excellent example of cherry-picking.  

For instance, in their fact-check one: if you read his whole speech, he specifically says 4th grade reading. But their fact check (although showing that that fact is true) not only goes on to show how it doesn't matter and the failure of everything else education related, but they don't use the exact quote so it makes it look as though he is wrong. He specifically said 4th grade.

In the second Fact Check, they quote him saying correction officers should be paid fairly, then 'fact check' to show how ours are not and are the lowest paid in the US. I don't think he was saying ours ARE NOW paid fairly, I think he was saying they SHOULD BE (much like the rest of his speech on corrections, closing Unit 29 (which should be HUGE news! Isn't this what everyone wanted?)). 

etc.

After listening to the speech I was fairly positive and hopeful for our state. Thank goodness these reporters brought me back to reality that no matter how you may view anything in MS as positive, it isn't and we are truly in the worst state in the entire universe.

You develop your research and base your arguing points in the factual context of that research. Those statements qualify into the ethos, logos, and pathos of your stance. They form the foundational triangle of an persuasive argument, and without properly forming one the rest crumble. 

An activist beckoning for a cause may use a lot of logic and emotion to sway you to their side, but it is the professional who has the credibility that brings the stronger argument.

Much in the case of this, I'm not denying that Reeves didn't say anything truthful nor does this article, but instead brings to note that he failed to establish his credibility and so we should question his logos and pathos of his reasoning.

Sir, I love our state for its beautiful nature and wildlife, musical culture, and incredible history, but to act as if we don't have numerous issues that require a massive overhaul in terms of government oversight (labor death rates in children and mothers, poverty, obesity, etc etc yadda yadda)... Well that's a falsehood. But shame on those reporters for daring to do their jobs and fact check our governor! 

I've noticed you post a lot of positive news stories to this subreddit, and that's a good thing. Lord knows we need positivity in this day and age. But to simply ignore such issues or only focus on the positives does a disservice to our state.

If your engine was knocking or misfiring, wouldn't you want to have it looked at? And to bring this back to Mr. Reeves, wouldn't you want the mechanic who fixed your car to be vettable?

I feel that I should be able to make note of issues Mississippi has. I feel that we should do our best to rectify such issues. And as much as I love good vibes, only referencing the positive aspects of this state will do nothing in terms of increasing the quality of life for those who live in it.

I was caught in a web designed by Mississippi’s poor commitment to the public’s quality of life. A poor education hadn’t prepared me for college, a bad economy kept me jobless, morally-guided laws kept me from having equal rights, a lack of opportunity led me to make poor choices, a for-profit legal system worked me over, and severe restrictions on welfare forced me to ration my meal to every other day. For years, I was caught in the cycle of poverty and socioeconomic inequality that is all too pervasive in Mississippi. During my experiences here, I always found people willing to help me make it through the bad times. With enough help I was able to afford community college, and do well enough there to win a full ride to Ole Miss. I‘m currently studying Mississippi and mastering the skills I need to make an impact here, because somewhere along the way my desire for a new start turned into a desire to reorient our society into one that values quality of life and diversity of thought and experience.

You ever have a really annoying friend that sometimes just eats at your skin all the time but for some reason when it’s Friday or Saturday night they’re one of the first people you’re calling to hang out? You know they’re gonna annoy you but you love them to death and love spending time with them anyways? That’s Mississippi to me. 

While it’s hard sometimes to think about the politicians that run the state and the people that support them, it’s easy to think about those late May nights right after school let out where you had been fishing on a creek bank all day with your buddies thinking about what the next school year might hold, whether the Braves were gonna make the playoffs this year, and looking forward to those Friday Night Lights in a few months. I think about all the bonfires we had in the backyard where the flames would get damn near 20 feet high and having some beers at 19 cause we had a cousin that was 21 that didn’t mind getting it for us. 

Another reason is I think about my hometown of less than 1,000 people and I think about how much I love that no red light town and what meth has done to half the people that live there. Everytime I’m home and see the run down houses I look around and tell my parents “If I ever get to where I make enough money this town’s gonna look a lot different.” But in the same breath I think it’s beautiful the way it is and I get tears in my eyes seeing that “Welcome to _______” sign. It makes me think of the oh so famous Faulkner quote “To understand the world, one must first understand a place like Mississippi.”

So just how I can’t tell you that I understand the world, I can’t tell you why I’m coming back. What I can tell you is that I am coming back and throughout my traveling days before I come back I’ll always make it a point to say that’s where I come from.

*If your engine was knocking or misfiring, wouldn't you want to have it looked at? And to bring this back to Mr. Reeves, wouldn't you want the mechanic who fixed your car to be vettable?*

That is not an honest question, because a knocking engine is something measurable. Saying whether or not Gov Reeves is honest can very well be an opinion. Most have no real idea of what is going on and (just like in this case) probably read a headline and think that is the whole story. Can we agree that some reporters have an agenda, and may skew their article based on their bias?

I agree, but the opposite argument is also true: only focusing on the negative and constantly belittling and being bitter about the state/government/religion will not fix anything.

Put simply, Socialism = workers owning the means of production. Think co-ops and unions.

Communism = A moneyless, classless, stateless society. This was Marx's end-game, basically his theoretical utopia.  

Also, you can have markets without capitalism, not sure if you know that or not.  The free market as a concept has to do with the trading of goods for money, whereas capitalism and socialism mostly have to do with how those goods are produced and who benefits from the selling/production of them.

It's important to understand that Marxist theory is a really really big umbrella, ranging from democratic-socialist-leaning social-democrats, to full on Marxist-leninist authoritarians, to anarcho-communists, etc etc.  Each group I mentioned has massive disagreements about fundamental issues.

Where do you get that stat? I'm not dissagreeing, I have just never seen it.

Minimum wage should be for people just entering the workforce: high schoolers, part-time college kids, etc. They have no skills, need a job, and are hopefully open to training. If they show apptitude and competence, they should get more responsibility and better pay. Completing high shool should let most employers know you have the basic skills do do entry level jobs. If you DIDN'T complete high school (for whatever reason), should you start at $20 an hour?

I have a friend who owns an FEC. For the amount of income the business takes in, he can afford 6 part time employees (mostly high school or college kids). It is a fairly simple job with low-to-no responsibility. All are interviewed and very well understand they will be starting at minimum wage. Some do well and work their way up, some do not (it seems crazy, but some kids do not know how to sweep). If he were mandated to pay a 'living wage' of $20 an hour, he could only afford to hire 2 or 3 employees. Is it better 6 people are working, or 3?

I worked with a local advocate and found them shelter and was working on getting them jobs. As I kept coming back, one by one they weren't at the shelter any more.

When I was in school I rotated with this vascular surgeon and he was great. He paid for all his employees cars, gave them good ass insurance, fed them every day, and paid them well on top of the benefits. I think if I remember correctly the most recently hired nurse made 60K before benefits and shit added. and he said that he did that because these are the people that made him wealthy and they deserve a nice chunk of it too

Now podiatry is  a whole different field of reimbursement and whatnot so I probably won't ever reach vascular surgery levels of money but if I had a small clinic and we were busy I'd do my best to make sure that everyone is ok,. rather me being rich and the others being in penury.

That is an interesting view. It is certainly not universal since there are definitely self made people, but I do think if someone didn't have those frameworks it would be easy for them to blame everything/everyone on their problems.

If you watch all of the Better Me Better Mississippi video, you'll see many cases where people are helped with the basic 'social and institutional frameworks'. There are lots of programs available to help (usually at no cost), I hope people take advantage of them if they need them.

1208,1208,Pyperman,"&gt;The point is not that this specific ceo or whatever is a nazi, the point is that prageru is a gateway drug for being far right.  I don't have time to dissect this shit, but if I sent you a link to Richard Spencer's think-tank, would you throw that out? I'm hoping yes.

That is not an honest comparison because Richard Spencer is an openly white supremacist pushing an alt-right neo-Nazi message. There is no question what his stance is. I don't agree with any of that at all, I am very much a 'judge a man on the content of his character' type person. 

But you believe ALL of PragerU is false/untrue/far right because mediabiasfactcheck says so..? The video I posted is from the CEO of a nation wide food chain (who probably knows plenty about hiring unskilled labor), how in the world can you compare that to Richard Spencer?

What about the other articles I posted?

*Also to even vaguely equate mediabiasfactcheck.com, an organization which I proved to you does not have some far left bias by showing you that they don't rate CNN as super factual and also rate them as being left-biased, to prageru, an organization with the sole purpose of poisoning peoples minds with numerous falsehoods, is pretty crazy.*

I don't think you proved anything, that is one guys site and everything there is his opinion just like any other site.

Here, I will use your own prageru argument: you found some debunked prageru videos, so ALL prageru videos must be bad/wrong, correct? I found links that said mediabiasfactcheck got it wrong, but somehow those don't count and everything on mediabiasfactcheck is correct.  Echh??

Regardless, I had hoped we could agree that BOTH of them probably have a bias. 

*I would encourage you to just Google ""prageru debunked"" or something. This is not opinionated stuff, they say things and signal-boost ideas constantly that are objectively wrong.*

Dude, I am TELLING YOU that pragerU has a bias. I am hoping we can agree that BOTH sites probably have a bias, is that too much? The links I posted to certainly think so. 

I specifically chose a video that has a CEO talking about his own company. If you see 'pragerU' and will not get past that, then we can never have a discussion.

However, I do see where you keep saying “There’s plenty of good paying jobs if you’re skilled enough!” to which I say yes, you are semi-correct.  The problem is that thanks to cuts to higher education and a general lackadaisical approach to college, Mississippi’s population isn’t educated enough for those jobs.  And thanks to poverty and tuition, most of Mississippi won’t be able to get a Bachelor’s degree anyway.  Mississippi has A LOT of problems.  Sticking your fingers in your ears and yelling isn’t the way to go about fixing them.

Jail is temporary holding until the grand jury hears the case. Sometimes the charges are high (murder) and they aren't allowed bail. Yes, they may have to stay in jail for awhile. Sometimes the DA wants to wait to get an iron-clad case by bringing in witnesses or more evidence. That all takes time. If the grand jury says there isn't enough evidence to move forward, the accused is released and the case is dropped. If the grand jury DOES vote that there is enough evidence to go to trial ( called ""true bill""), then the case moves forward and a judge/jury determines guilt/innocence.

So yeah, some people who could actually be innocent may stay in jail awaiting their case to be heard.

1280,1280,Apokolyptyk,"Well, poverty is everywhere but even Mississippi alone has a higher GDP than many European nations. We're poor compared to some of the other US states but you gotta fuck up really bad to starve to death in the US. Even here in Mississippi.

I would argue that racism is far more prevalent in other parts of the country than here in Mississippi. I don't know what kind of people you're hanging around to come to the conclusion that you do, but I would do my best to avoid them folks.

&gt;People also seem to live in fear; fear of the government, fear of God, fear of change.

A healthy dose of caution when it comes to government is healthy. Distrust of your government is one of the most American traits you can possess. It's when you put too much faith into government that genocide and human rights abuses happen.

Fear of God? I'll give you that one. Mississippi is very religious. I take no issue with this, even as an atheist. People are allowed to believe what they like. I understand their position, even if I don't agree with it.

Fear of change isn't always bad either. It depends on what you're trying to change. Most people have a fear of change if they are already living a fairly good life as it is. Would you say that it would be wrong for a jew in 1930s Germany to fear change? A fear of change, by itself, is not wrong. Context matters. 

I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that you just disagree with any kind of right wing politics and that this is really where your dislike for the state comes from. That's what it looks like to me, anyway. I could be wrong. I don't know exactly to what ideology you hold your allegiances, but I would like to caution you against believing that your ideology, whatever it may be, is the objectively correct one.

It’s really quiet and has an active retirement community. It’s a bit different culturally than other places I’ve lived in Mississippi because there’s a significant population of New Orleans transplants. 

If you want a little more action and scenery, Ocean Springs and Bay St. Louis are directly on the coast, on either side of Biloxi and Gulfport. Bay St. Louis gets you closer to New Orleans and Ocean Springs gets you closer to Mobile (another great option). Both are gorgeous historical cities with very active downtown areas and quieter beaches than their neighboring cities. 

I live in Hattiesburg now and I have lived in Laurel in the recent past, and I don’t recommend either of them. Hattiesburg isn’t bad, it’s just not close enough to anything for me – it’s like 2 hours from everything worth doing. The night life is all college kids. Laurel is swept up in the “Home Town” craze right now (don’t even get me started on that), and apart from that, there are a ton of people who come from old money who live in a perpetual popularity contest. When I lived there, I counted the days until my lease was up so I could get out as fast as I could. 

In my humble but biased opinion, the coast is just closer to more exciting things, has a better night life, nicer scenery, more variety of culture, and a little less suffocating religiosity (if that’s a concern).

Overt and covert racism is still a huge problem even in progressive areas most towns are still divided into 'the other side of the tracks' mentality. There is a large % of retirees there but it is not because they moved for retirement, it is because they stayed in the area there entire lives which means there is very little outside perspective among the leaders of the community(read, old racists). If the Midwest is the heart of trump country then MS is the perpetually moist butt crack.. If you are an insular person who just wants to enjoy the outdoors and doesn't mind absurd humidity year round then its the place for you. Otherwise look elsewhere. The gulf coast (south of 10) is more like a sprawling set of cities and suburbs, but again they don't have a real sense of community outside of churches, there are of course progressive people everywhere, mostly in the college towns, but the college towns don't offer much for older folks (bars and churches) not churches for the sake of community like up north.. These are churches for the sake of 'savings your soul from the devil' and they will push conservative views hard.

I have traveled the US quite a bit, if you could tell me what you are looking for i can help you find some places.. The south east is ok, less churchy. FL has nicer beaches, no income tax, retirement communities(but known to have drug problems) Areas with a drier climate are going to be further west like TX, AZ etc.

If it i budget based look for small towns within 30-45 min of major cities like Nola, Memphis, Nashville etc. Then you can drive into the city, museums, events, etc.",1581188615,fgyyb4o

Ocean Springs actually has a lot of retirees and a really awesome small downtown area with music, food, and the Walter Anderson museum, plus nice beaches, the whole nine, and it's not far from Mobile, Alabama, which in itself is a nice historic city but too large for retirees IMO.  Bay St. Louis is similar but closer to New Orleans (which you'll tire of very quickly but you'll still have people visiting you who will want to go), and between the two I personally think it's prettier in and around Bay St. Louis though others will surely disagree.  Also, NASA's Stennis Space Center is near Bay St. Louis, so you get some interesting people and local events around there.

Drug use and lack of opportunity lead to property crime, something an adult is usually concerned with.

A lack of opportunity for youth creates a social and monetary vacuum that any society needs in order to be healthy. New businesses, innovation, knowledge retention, etc. 

I agree with the clubs they do provide social opportunities outside of religion. I would still make the point that it doesn't mean there are 'things to do'. Bingo at rotory club on Tuesdays... forever.

Religion is ingrained into the society and has a strong influence over social policy that effects everyone. Also, a casual conversation topic IS 'so what church do you goto' MS is about 7 to 10 years behind the rest of the country when it comes to adopting progressive legislation.

That is simply not true, in fact the mindset that people are not leaving because they are too repressed is the problem.  At at time when black people were very socially and economically repressed, to the point that the KKK was a powerful force and Jim Crow laws were strictly enforced, 6 million black people left the South, especially from Mississippi.  It's called the Great Migration, you should look it up.  It was considerably harder--far, far harder--for those black people to migrate out of Mississippi than it is today. They were often sharecroppers, a system that effectively made both white and black people slaves to the property they farmed.  Extremely few had any family outside of the South (at least 90% of black people lived in the South at that time), they were traveling to places with no black churches or black communities, no support systems at all.  It was a monumental undertaking, yet they did it without government help or really help of any kind.  

Anyone who is unhappy in Mississippi or Washington or California today can leave, it is as simple as that.

I've met a few racists, sure, but have you ever been up north? I've never heard so much racist shit in my life than when I visited Illinois. That shit was on another level. 

I'm not deluded either, your opinion doesn't seem to be the norm. I've heard several black dudes tell me about the racism they've experienced in other parts of the country and that makes sense considering my own experience. 

What is racism to you? Because that Twitter link you sent didn't have any racism in it. If you think it does you are really reaching. I also don't see how any of it is fear mongering. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a republican, but I fail to see the issue with the Twitter post or the video.

I will tell you this though, the most racism I've seen in my life was actually *against* white people. I was denied foodstamps back in 2007 and the black woman at the desk straight up told me ""white folks don't need food stamps anyway"". I did report her, but nothing ever came of it. 

I've seen racism at the employment agency when black people would get taken more seriously for a job than whites simply because it was a government program.

When I was in school I often seen white kids getting bullied by black kids yet I've never seen it the other way around. 

And don't even get me started on the police. 

With that said, the vast majority of blacks are not this way but sometimes even when they aren't, they seem to be fine seeing this kind of shit happen without saying anything. I know this isn't the norm because some of the best friends I've had in my life were black and they were all good folks. Unfortunately, there are shit heads out there of every type.

When you go to that court date, I would say 'do you affirm that this ticket is a sworn affidavit, and everythign on it is true?' The officer should say yes because it literally says that on the ticket. You can then say ""well it says here I was going 25 in a 41"" and expand upon that ""is 25 in a 41 speeding? where is there a 41 mph area?"" etc. I wouldn't be a smart a$$ about it, but definitely point out ""If this specific data is incorrect, how do I know the rest of the ticket is correct?""

There is also the chance the officer will not show up. I have heard if they do not you automatically get out of it (not sure if that is true). Regardless, use the ticket as evidence that the information on it is incorrect.

I was a science teacher, though, and there's higher demand for that than there is for English teachers.

The coast school systems tend to be some of the better ones in the state, at least back then, so there's much more demand for teaching jobs from them. So I would: 

(1) Apply to be a substitute teacher at every district in driving range. You only need a high school diploma to qualify, and it gives you some contacts within the school system. Try to make contacts within the administration of the schools when you go to sub.

(2) Also look at the counties above the coastal counties, such as Pearl River, Stone, and George. Mississippi counties are relatively small, so you can easily drive between multiple counties. Beware: you need to balance the cost of driving to another county against the low sub pay.

It just seems more like a problem at MSMS because kids are doing it on school property, since they live there. MSMS is also super demanding. You do a lot of work. I had a higher workload at MSMS then I do now as a chemistry undergrad. You really have to be willing to work hard and seek help when you need it, especially if you want to come out with a good GPA.

I will be honest, it is nowhere near perfect. The dorms/cafeteria are not the best and some of the res life staff are questionable. Despite all of that, the teachers are AMAZING and the student body is also really great for the most part. There is a lot that could be said on these topics.

When it comes to college readiness, it has definetly helped me immensely. I come from a county school, so the opportunities alone made a huge difference. You will be able to be part of a multitude of clubs and assume leadership in them/attend competitions, which will be a cornerstone part of your college application. The possibility to do research is also insane and so far it has benefited me a lot in my college admissions/scholarships. Keep in mind all classes are a minimum of honors and are often at college level even if not explicitly said so, hence they will give you a great foundation and let you have an easier time adapting to real college. Due to MSMS, I am also able to enter college taking mostly sophomore classes so there is that.

I had a lot of hope for the future, but now I've realized that I just can't accomplish the things I thought I wanted to do. As for college readiness, there's an entire class dedicated to getting you ready, building up your resume. With all of that said, I have lost so much of my motivation since being here. I reeaaallllly struggle to make myself do work now. Before I came, I used to LOVE doing math. Now whenever I think about it I feel drained, it's like a chore.

There's a million reasons people can say, but as an animal owner, they are responsible for the well being of the pet, much like children.

Not everyone owns a car, and most poor people have health issues that in order to be addressed in an emergency like this, pets can’t be present (hospital, evacuee shelter).  

I would wager you’d be hard pressed to find some abandoned pets in the Eastover areas that are flooding for instance.

The muddy water is the Mississippi Sound, which is between the coastline and the barrier islands. It's shallow, doesn't get much wave action, and they dump street water into it - not sewage as some people say - it's just runoff from drainage ditches and such.

You can see a lot of historical buildings and markers that you wouldn't know about if you were on the main road. There's an old truss bridge down in Brooklyn, south of camp Shelby, that is right off the old road. But it has a boat launch down there and is a better place to get out, snap some pictures, and stretch your legs than stopping at the Kangaroo. I know we thought it was cool as kids because we had not seen an old one like it before. They just tore out the road during rerouting and left a bridge to nowhere.

And oh, if it's still accessible, Red Bluff in Foxworth (Marion Co) is a real cool place. Mississippi's little Grand canyon.

I don’t think it is myself. Unemployment rates don’t reflect underemployed or those who’ve left the market. I know a lot of unemployed but more underemployed folks. The local economy in my area is fair, but not great. It’s certainly not “good”.

Nope. Those are valid concerns and should motivate action, but whining. 

If your version of action is to go around Reddit saying “MS sucks” every chance you get, then you’re part of the problem. There’s nothing wrong with pointing out problems, just follow it up with solutions, not whining.

Hell yeah, I'll defend that comment. This proposal is dumb as shit, coming from a party that's dumb as shit, in a state that consistently votes for said party. It must be frustrating as hell, and voicing that frustration in a forum for their state is one way to feel that you're not alone, that other people share this frustration, hey then maybe we need to do something about that!

Yes. We have low in state tuition. We have junior colleges all over the place as well.

I don’t know, but it’s not because we have high cost universities or not enough of them. 

&gt; And if our public school system is so great why is our graduation rate less than the national average and our NAEP math scores are significantly lower too?

I didn’t say it was great. I said it improved in reading. It is improving in something. This is a good thing.

1905,1905,piZZleDAriZZle,"It is true that rape and murder are immoral, and we have laws that forbid those immoral acts. However, and this is the part that makes me lean a little towards the libertarian side of things, US law and our founders were heavily influenced by Natural Law. This is evident in the preamble of the Declaration of Independence. Natural law states that the government's main role should be protecting life, liberty and property, or the pursuit of Happiness, as it was changed for the preamble, but still holds the same sentiments. So, yes the legislation of morality does work when protecting your natural rights, however, when there is overreach we see it failing, such as slavery, prohibition and the war on drugs. These are an example of an overreach and we're doomed for failure. 

The best way to understand Natural Law is that it's our internal moral compass, that all humans pocess, regardless where they get their morality. Assault, murder, rape, slavery, and theft are examples of immoral acts that the government should prevent. These acts all hinder another person's rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and should have legislation to punish those who commit them. 

I should have framed my original comment as such. Any legislation, based off religious morality, that goes beyond protecting a person's natural rights is doomed for failure. It will be rejected by a large margin of the population. Is that better?",1582374881,fie3yj4

But if he's got a weapon on him, or invokes having a weapon on him, that's robbery in the first. It's gone from essentially a mugging to a further traumatization of thinking their life is in danger, and robberies gone wrong are i herently murderous affairs when deadly weapons are brought in by the assailant.

Smoking a joint as example is nonviolent. There's no violence. That's why it's called a nonviolent crime.

Oh, I see plenty or problems no doubt. But somehow SOME people are still able to succeed and overcome here in the (according to most) most racist backwards poor uneducated state. How does that happen? THEY choose that path, it isn't given to them.

*The problem is that thanks to cuts to higher education and a general lackadaisical approach to college, Mississippi’s population isn’t educated enough for those jobs.*  

That is a great statement ""general lackadaisical approach to college""..! That very much sums up many of the younger generation. If they don't see the value of getting skilled or educated, how can we continually blame government etc?

*And thanks to poverty and tuition, most of Mississippi won’t be able to get a Bachelor’s degree anyway.*

You can say that, but I know for a fact if you want an education you can get one. For instance: I have an adult student who's daughter dropped out of high school because she got pregnant (the standard stat). She was able to continue and get her GED at no cost, and go to a 2 year college FREE because of incentives and grants! If she can do it, anyone can!

*Mississippi has A LOT of problems.  Sticking your fingers in your ears and yelling isn’t the way to go about fixing them.*

I agree MS has plenty of problems. But the opposite is true as well: if all anyone ever does is sit and complain (and sing the blues, which we are known for here in MS), nothing will change.

I do actively try to help and make our state better! I really believe if everyone on this forum met in real life, we would find we have much more in common than we do differences. I'm sure we would all get along and could probably eat supper together.",1582411405,fihki4a

I studied crime and if I ran the system Id just make incarceration a last resort not a first resort. Smaller on the punishment and big on rehab. I dont really think threats of incarceration work if the offender believes they'll get away with it. Amd I wouldn't make my prisons look like the gulags it sounds like that's going on right now.

While violence is high risk behavior and violent individals likely need removed from society for a time depending  on the severity of the crime and their propensity to reoffend, it's ok to understand some of these individuals can be rehabilitated and rejoin society if they get somr coaching from a parole or probabation officer.

No. Never ran for an office, though I vote and I’m politically active in some ways.  Not sure why this is relevant. 

&gt; ... old school money, etc?  

What would that matter? Where would you get that idea from? 

&gt; All of your posts are down voted to heck and back, ...

Actually, I’m net positive on this thread at my last count. Maybe that changed. 

If you think I care in the slightest about magic internet points, you aren’t really paying attention. Right is right, whatever random internet voters think.

Frankly, just being from MS and meeting people from all over the world, I’m used to hearing ignorant nonsense about our state. It only bothers me when it comes from people who live in MS. 

&gt; ... and while the people are polite here and will generally help each other out, ...  

I agree. 

&gt; ... minus the holier than thow church goers, ...

I have not had this experience. In my experience, my church going friends are neither “holier than thou” or impolite. Not sure why you have problems with church people. 

&gt; ... the state itself is in a bad place ...

There are a lot of things which need work. We need a few smart people to stick around and help build a better state. Maybe a few less who whine about how bad it is without offering any suggestions would help too. We need to elect people who spend more time focused on the real problems in the state instead of nonsense like the point of this thread. 

&gt; ... and needs to keep some values, while advance in others, ...

I didn’t understand those words. 

&gt; ... especially in Healthcare and help to the poor.

I agree that we should accept the federal money for healthcare. What other healthcare problems do we have that you think the state is able to address but has not?

What is not being done for the poor that we should be doing?",1582524832,fimcc56

Jobs range from retail and fast food to warehouse work to potentially working at the Nissan plant or one of the other manufacturers in the area.  Depending on your skillset, there are many options.   


I would suggest reaching out to one of the local temp agencies as a good start.  Just some off the top of my head are listed below.  


Lexington is an hour away, so probably not commuting.  Cost of living isn't bad.  Depending on your skill set and if you can line something up before moving, there are plenty of good and safe options for housing, from Ridgeland to Fondren and Belhaven.  I've only lived at one in Ridgeland, so can't comment on the others, but it's been good enough for us to stay here for 5 years so far.  


Nightlife especially in the warmer months is still rockin, at least in my opinion.  Lots of choices for someone younger, again from the Rez area to Jackson proper.  Plenty of options for fun.

The key information to take from this:

&gt;• Respondents who experienced rejection by family and friends, discrimination, victimization, or violence had elevated prevalence of suicide attempts, such as those who experienced the following:

&gt;— Family chose not to speak/spend time with them: 57%

&gt;— Discrimination, victimization, or violence at school, at work, and when accessing health care

&gt;• Harassed or bullied at school (any level): 50-54%

&gt;• Experienced discrimination or harassment at work: 50-59%

&gt;• Doctor or health care provider refused to treat them: 60%

&gt;• Suffered physical or sexual violence:

&gt;— At work: 64-65%

&gt;— At school (any level): 63-78%

&gt;— Discrimination, victimization, or violence by law enforcement

&gt;• Disrespected or harassed by law enforcement 
officers: 57-61%

&gt;• Suffered physical or sexual violence: By law enforcement officers: 60-70

&gt;— Experienced homelessness: 69%

Discrimination heavily increases suicide chances.

HB 1523 is arguably one of the most extreme anti-LGBT laws in the entire U.S. Its not going to be the specific cause of any suicides, but it's the root cause that will lead to many.

If we only focus on the animation itself:

What software did you use for the animation?

Why does it start in white with no title?

Why does the music end early?

I thought the choice to use a mirror as the transition was clever, as it conveys worrying about what everyone else sees as opposed to what the person's personality really is

Showing the transition of innocence and honesty of a child to the weight of being an adolecence was clearly shown by grief, despair, and frowning that grew scene by scene

Without delving into HB1523 too much: the only discrimination that was shown was in a school from other students, which HB1523 would not protect against. If the person took their life from bullying at school, that has nothing to do with HB1523. Your main theme should have been anti-bullying, not HB1523.

By allowing a business owner to deny service based upon their beliefs the business owner is given power of influence. In layman's terms someone may be influenced to behave differently, or deny their own beliefs, just to conduct business.

Not at all, sir.

That can be anything. When the bum approaches you in the parking lot, do you grab your kids and safely go another way? That is discrimination. When the motorcycle gang member applies for a job at day-care and it is denied, that is discrimination.

*furthermore, how is seeking a product, or service, forcing your agenda?*

Normally it is not. But there are certain times where it could be. Would you go to a mosque with bacon? that would be very offensive and against their beliefs. Before this law, you could sue them because they wouldn't let you bring bacon into the mosque. 

The famous cake incident set a great precedence. The cake maker knew the couple well, were friends with them, and had served them several times. But in this one instance he said he couldn't. They had the option to go somewhere else that were more than welcome to make a wedding cake for them, but instead they chose to sue him and force him to do something against his beliefs. That seems like a huge win for the couple, but what about the cake maker? is he a racist homophobe who should be destroyed? No, he is a small religious business owner trying to do the best he can. 

*Neither. As it was before: it should be left to a tort/civil issue, and not warrant any amount of government protection for either IMO.*

Lots of small, independent stores have managed to exist along side those establishments.

I do agree with other sentiments that those retailers should also be allowed to sell beer. As a consumer, I find it aggravating that I have to make two separate stops if I want to buy beer and wine/liquor, and that sales should be allowed seven days per week.

While in Atlanta, Kroger and Walmart offered an ok selection, but if I wanted something special or unique I would visit a package store. Same thing in Texas, but HEB had a mad impressive selection yet package stores still were a thing. The key thing is differentiating yourself from the retailers. 


I buy wine or liquor from a retailer if I am having to grocery shop or get necessities, the convenience of having it there is how they make their sale.

On the contrary, if I want something more unique or for a special occasion I would go to a package store because they offer better variety.

Here's some additional things to consider:

1.) MS is very rural and has a lot of small towns that are still some distance from a box store. These communities have fostered their own package stores and I don't see these going away because they have built up the community rapport.

2.) The greater demand would reduce logistics costs of bringing more niche items out to more remote locations. This could help some package stores offer a more long-end of the tail in offerings that weren't normally available.",1583359559,fji2l5i

It is close to West Jackson which is statistically a higher crime area. There can be some bleed over of that, especially with police pursuits. That said, I never felt unsafe in the city, even hearing some colorful stories from the school resource officer.

I absolutely love Clinton because it is a small quiet town (less so now because of growth). It is rural and the brick street area is great but very small. Wyatt Waters is a great guy too.

Honestly I suggest you look at living in Jackson either in the Belhaven or Fondren area. A little grimier than Clinton but you’ll find many more progressive people there than in Clinton. Clinton is a Baptist town (the college there is a Baptist college).

Fondren, Belhaven, the Belhaven Heights, &amp; downtown are where the younger more liberally minded folks live.

I love Jackson because the young people who live there want to be there and are always working hard to make things better.

I now live in Memphis (moved last year) &amp; I miss my hometowns.

In summary: Clinton is a lovely town but conservative. Jackson is a dead capital city that is being brought back to life by hard working progressives. Madison is where white flight fled to and Ridgeland is the border between Jackson &amp; Madison. Pearl is...well...Pearl (no offense to those who love and live there but Pearl Trash is something you hear). Brandon is higher class Pearl &amp; conservative.

I recommend you look at homes in Belhaven (price is higher than elsewhere), Fondren close to State Street or Old Canton Rd., Leftover on the east side of I-55, or the Belhaven Heights (if you want a super cheap house that needs work).

Since you’re trying to decide between Vicksburg or Clinton, really you need to decide whether you want to live “in” something or “near” something better.

Jackson is about 20 minutes east of Clinton so now you are looking at two 40-45 minute commutes a day. 

To me it sounds like you’d fit in best in Jackson proper but your commute would be better served by living in Clinton. Hard to recommend one over the other. If you live it Clinton it would be more difficult to get your bearings &amp; make friends in Jackson but you also wouldn’t be burning up a nice chunk of your day.

A life in Mississippi is a pretty slow life wherever you live.

Edit: Now I see you’ll actually be working in Port Gibson. Dang. That really puts a damper on your options.

Natchez is pretty cool but I have no idea what it would be like to live there. Sloooooow. Some decent restaurants though &amp; it is a tourist destination so it can’t be terrible.

It's a Christian/Conservative city, what with the college and large number of churches.  But as a non-Christian, I rarely felt like it was being shoved down my throat.  People mostly keep to themselves.  

My favorite part of living in Clinton that I haven't seen mentioned are the events they do downtown during the summer.  They run a little market every weekend where people sell homemade crafts and home-grown produce.  And in August, they hold a concert series with a mix of local and national bands.  Again, they're gonna be ""sterile"" picks, but there were some genuinely fun bands there the last 2 years.  Not to mention the craft beer for sale and mobile wet bar during the event.

First of all, look at Bernie's programs. Even with his massively increased taxes(on just about everyone), his budget still has a massive shortfall.  The. Math. Does. Not. Work. 

Slash the military budget too.

I am in favor of keeping a system that allows people to keep more of the fruits of their labor. Is it perfect? No, crappy immigration policies, trade deals, and government regulation have done serious harm to working class families.  Open Borders  (Decriminalization of border crossing, and no deportations) will not help the American worker. It drives down wages.   The byzantine labyrinth of regulations strangles small businesses with compliance costs while big business can stomach the cost. Local zoning rules prevent the building of low income housing, and drive up costs leading to a housing shortage. 

No,  from average, thank you very much. I actually spent most of my life in poverty raised by a single mother on welfare. I am mixed raced, am a survivor of child abuse.

Don't really care to find accurate data that is up-to-date on this.. I'm already wasting my time on your post doing this, you can do it yourself really.

Honestly, most of these links that are 'forums' state statistics that you can you know, search yourself since you seem so inclined to keep bringing up your own 100 million, why not research more numbers lol...

I honestly can't care to continue this conversation since you seem not know how to go and actually find the dead links yourself.  I wasted my time actually doing your work for you.

Socialism: any system in which the production and distribution of goods and services is a shared responsibility of a group of people. 

Public schools, fire, police
1. Are they owned, planned, funded, and carried out by government entities, for the direct benefit of those who paid the taxes for them? 
**Yes**

As for education: to some extent I agree that education has been made more expensive by universities taking advantage of federal student loans and jacking prices up by a comparable amount. For increased student loan availability, there needs to be regulation on public universities gouging students for that cash. That being said, the private sector hasn’t offered much in terms of offering a better price for college education, which is generally the “small government” talking point. 

Healthcare: 
This is something I know a lot about. I am in this environment daily. 
The US expends a greater percentage of its GDP on healthcare than any other major country. [source](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#item-relative-size-wealth-u-s-spends-disproportionate-amount-health) 

This is chiefly due to insurance companies and [the administrative costs associated with hospitals interacting with them.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMsa022033) 

Because of the lack of low-cost care, a staggering 46% of people who use hospitals do so [because they can’t afford to see a primary care provider, and public hospitals are required to treat them.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/emergency_room_use_january-june_2011.pdf) 

This creates increased demand on hospital treatment, which is ideally secondary or tertiary care. Hospital treatment is significantly more expensive than preventative treatment given through a PCP, and these people having the ability to see a PCP instead of taking up hospital resources is[cheaper and more effective in the management of illness](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2008.0701) .

Right now, you pay for other people’s care. 

People that can’t pay for care receive it anyways, because they’re human beings and doctors rather like not killing people through lack of care. 
The costs are transferred to those that can pay—insurance companies and those paying out of pocket. 
Insurance companies have far more bargaining power than you do when it comes to agreeing over how much of these costs they will take. Plus, the costs that they *do* take on, do you think that they’re just gonna eat that cost? Of course not. They pass the expense on to their customers, resulting in increased premiums and deductibles, which further brings insurance out of the reach of more people, which increases the number of people who cannot pay for care, and the cycle therefore continues. 

By having a single-payer system, costs are spread across everyone covered (everyone) and the middleman who exists solely for profit is cut out. This is why systems with socialized healthcare pay less than half of what the US does on a [per-patient basis](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/how-do-healthcare-prices-and-use-in-the-u-s-compare-to-other-countries/#item-start) . Insurance companies are a natural monopoly who ultimately have no point, as the service could be better provided by a single-payer system.",1583863321,fk4mfc6
2662,2662,shortybytheriver,"Yo, I pay a lot more for my insurance monthly than I would with a tax raise to do away with insurance.

On the issue of healthcare, no they are not a natural monopoly(government regulation helped create them), and even if they were, they solution is not to give that monopoly to the government. Education is essentially a government monopoly, and look how that is going. Government regulations make it were it costs a few billion dollars and takes almost a decade to produce a new medicine. That contrives to cost. Lack of competition within states drives up costs. There are things that can be done with a free market system to reform healthcare.",1583867185,fk4tbkc

The group shares the responsibility of producing and dispensing the service or good and all involved have a stake, whereas in a corporation there is a vast inequality in who benefits from the production or dispensation of a service or good.

We’re like a lot of Americans: we’re angry and we’re tired of being told “Next time, next time.” Our preferred candidates fell to the desires of the DNC so now we’re ready the Bern. It. Down.

But let’s be real too: it doesn’t matter. Mississippi’s four electoral votes could be in play if all the voters who traditionally vote Democrat could get off work/afford to miss an hour/have polls open late enough/have transportation/have a govt issued ID/be allowed to vote by mail/etc. Facts is facts and these aren’t changing anytime soon—and why would they, when we only have 4 EC votes and states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Florida actually matter mathematically?

The parade and other big events bring lots of people to a concentrated space where they are all sharing the same facilities; it's a literal petri dish that has agar ready to make such a communicable disease thrive. Avoiding large crowds is the best way to avoid that possiblity. It's not calling for a full on halt, but to take additional measures if you have the means to do so.

The accompanying actions of sincerely held religious beliefs are not really protected under the First Amendment. That's why racial discrimination laws in the 60s were able to stay in effect. The question is when the government will decide it's a compelling interest to protect LGBT rights.

Racial discrimination and religious beliefs were especially intertwined in the South and across the country for a long time and continued on. My mom grew up in a church in the 80s and 90s that preached segregation is the law of God and that segregation will occur in Heaven (the mainstream view in the South until the CRA was passed in the 60s) until they finally got out of it. (They, they being the Heart of Atlanta Motel, even tried to fight the Civil Rights Act using the 13th Amendment.)

One example, Bob Jones University in SC lost funding for years because of its sincerely held religious beliefs against interracial couples because the federal government found that the compelling interests trumped religious freedom. The US prosecuted polygamy in the 1800s (even closer to the first amendment's incorpotion) in the Mormon church, and could because the Supreme Court found that religious duty does not preclude someone from prosecution. The Mormon Church was disincorpated by the federal government due to polygamy, and it's disincorporation was upheld. Regardless of how you feel about polygamy or racial discrimination, it was a sincerely held religious belief that these churches adhered to. And the First Amendment does not protect it. I would like to see the textualist Supreme Court address Reynolds v.  United States, considering it was unanimous and never overturned. Same with Bob Jones University v. United States, although there was one out of the nine who dissented.

In a situation not related to discrimination, it is why your child is getting a vaccine in Mississippi for a school, regardless of how your religious beliefs say God feels about vaccinations. Because your religious beliefs do not trump the our state's belief that the public needs to be protected.

TL;DR: the sacrosanct idea that religious liberty is a cherished American value is basically a reaction to the losses of the segregationists in the 70s 80s and 90s.

For instance, 65:

\- has no specification that the medical marijuana can only be used by the person prescribed. The patient can get up to 5oz/300joints a month. If they smoke 3 joints a day there is still 200 joints left over at the end of the month. What will happen to those?

\- does not prohibit legislature/doctors from profiting from medical marijuana

\-exempts anyone having to do with medical marijuana from being sued

\-gives total control of  medical marijuana to the msdoh, and all profiting from it can only be used within the medical marijuana program

\-has no legislation for any regulation of dispensaries. Plus, it give no limitation of licenses and also does not specify how much the licenses cost. When OK approved medical marijuana, 10K dispensaries sprang up overnight. We can not regulate that many. You may say there does not need to be regulation on dispensaries, but if farmer A puts out a product with 10% thc and farmer B puts out a product with 20% thc, how will the doctor know if the patient is properly managing their pain? When the doc prescribes an antibiotic, they know exactly how much the patient is taking.

\-will specifically put medical marijuana in the state constitution when alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs are not

\-if a doctor has prescribed you medical marijuana, how do you deal with people using it while working? Can teachers use it while at school? What about driving while using it? This would be different because unlike regular prescription drugs (that can have a warning label) or alcohol, medical marijuana would be on our state constitution

Understand that if they pass 65A only terminal patients have access to smokable cannabis. Everyone else gets Marinol or oil. The whole point of a medical marijuana program is to legally get medical marijuana to the patients that need it. That won’t happen under 65A. 

-Up to 300 joints/month argument is a joke. At my salary I could afford up to 10 car payments/month. Does that mean I have to buy 10 cars? No. I have a car for me and one for my spouse. I’ve smoked before. You know how much you need and buy accordingly. People set their own dose and don’t waste it. 

-A prescription isn’t an “order” from a doctor to a patient. It’s an order to a pharmacy to give you the meds the doctor says you need. You aren’t required to take it. Doctors don’t know how much antibiotic patients take, they know how much they need to take. You can opt out of taking prescription meds for anything, whether it is an infection or an anti-psychotic. 

-The inside baseball Constitutional arguments don’t persuade me. 

-I expect doctors and growers and dispensaries to profit from this program. People profit from every other stage of the healthcare industry. That’s how capitalism works. Why should this be any different?

-The taxes will pay the salary of the MSDOH staff and other expenses for the program just like hunting and fishing license fees support MDWFP. This way general fund money doesn’t go to a program that is (sadly) controversial in our state. 

-The invisible hand of the free market will handle the dispensary “problem”. OK still has a lot of dispensaries for a state that size, but more than 80% of those have gone out of business two years later.  Also note that Oklahoma is a very rural state with few large cities like Mississippi. Terminal cancer shouldn’t have to drive 2 or 3 hours to Tupelo or Hattiesburg or Jackson to get their medicine. 

-As for the efficacy/THC content question, dispensaries grow/buy different strains with different qualities. Some people need strains with more CDB and little THC, others need all THC. Some people just need oil. Patients will work with their dr and dispensary staff to find the strain and dosage frequency that relieves their symptoms. This is the same iterative process used to find the best prescription drug dosages for most patients now.  

-As for the work question we don’t know what prescription narcotics or other impairing people take now. 33 other states are already dealing with that issue.  Most MMJ patients are not able to work anyway. This argument about bus drivers seems like a scare tactic to keep it from passing.

I am glad you are well informed, most of the people I chat with about this are not.

I wish you would have called in during the radio broadcast, you could have asked some good questions!  

*Understand that if they pass 65A only terminal patients have access to smokable cannabis. Everyone else gets Marinol or oil. The whole point of a medical marijuana program is to legally get medical marijuana to the patients that need it. That won’t happen under 65A.*

Does Marinol/Marijuana oil help with pain management?

*Up to 300 joints/month argument is a joke. At my salary I could afford up to 10 car payments/month. Does that mean I have to buy 10 cars? No. I have a car for me and one for my spouse. I’ve smoked before. You know how much you need and buy accordingly. People set their own dose and don’t waste it.*

I think what they are saying is: we know people now are selling their over-prescribed opioids (or other drugs). Is there a way we can make sure patients get the correct amount so it isn't over-prescribed and medicinal marijuana ends up with people it wasn't prescribed to. At least that is what I think he was trying to say, I could be wrong.

*A prescription isn’t an “order” from a doctor to a patient. It’s an order to a pharmacy to give you the meds the doctor says you need. You aren’t required to take it. Doctors don’t know how much antibiotic patients take, they know how much they need to take. You can opt out of taking prescription meds for anything, whether it is an infection or an anti-psychotic.*

I agree, but (again) I think what they were saying was: people who ARE on anti-psychotic drugs can use that as an excuse if caught driving or doing something the shouldn't do (""I'm on these prescription pills"").. I think they are trying to make sure if prescribed people don't think they can drive and work while under the influence etc (although people do all the time). Again, I could totatlly be wrong (and yes you are correct that most will probably not be very active)

*The inside baseball Constitutional arguments don’t persuade me.*

I can understand that. I do find it interesting that ONLY medical marijuana would be in our constitution and no other drugs/alcohol/tobacco is..

*I expect doctors and growers and dispensaries to profit from this program. People profit from every other stage of the healthcare industry. That’s how capitalism works. Why should this be any different?*

I think what they were trying to say was: A doctor may readily prescribe more patients medical marijuana if he has a financial interest on the back end. It is the same with the legislatures: if they are already set up to open a dispensary and make profit, do you think they will vote against it? Usually anytime this happens people scream foul. They were trying to set it up so doctors and legislatures wouldn't have a financial interest and their support would actually be toward helping those who needed medical marijuana not just to make an extra buck.

*The taxes will pay the salary of the MSDOH staff and other expenses for the program just like hunting and fishing license fees support MDWFP. This way general fund money doesn’t go to a program that is (sadly) controversial in our state.*

I think he mentioned that this will be the only program like that, where MSDOH will be in total control of how much to tax it and where that tax money goes. While it does make sense on the surface, certainly there should be some accountability..? or else we end up with volleyball courts (that is just me speculating)

*The invisible hand of the free market will handle the dispensary “problem”. OK still has a lot of dispensaries for a state that size, but more than 80% of those have gone out of business two years later.  Also note that Oklahoma is a very rural state with few large cities like Mississippi. Terminal cancer shouldn’t have to drive 2 or 3 hours to Tupelo or Hattiesburg or Jackson to get their medicine.*

That is a great point and I agree, I hope if all this goes through it does help the people who need it quickly and with as little patient effort as possible.

*As for the efficacy/THC content question, dispensaries grow/buy different strains with different qualities. Some people need strains with more CDB and little THC, others need all THC. Some people just need oil. Patients will work with their dr and dispensary staff to find the strain and dosage frequency that relieves their symptoms. This is the same iterative process used to find the best prescription drug dosages for most patients now.*

Doctors iteravely prescribe to find the best dosages? That is a new one on me. When my father had back surgery, they put him on a pain management prescription that he is still on today 12 years later. The dosage never changed at all. Maybe they just guessed right the first time, I don't know. You are probably right.

*As for the work question we don’t know what prescription narcotics or other impairing people take now. 33 other states are already dealing with that issue.  Most MMJ patients are not able to work anyway. This argument about bus drivers seems like a scare tactic to keep it from passing.*

I agree, but certainly we can agree to ask these questions before passing it so the wording can be updated and solved before we adopt the bill..? I can see this as one of those things where someone does something stupid and their defense is ""well, it doesn't say I CAN'T do that"" etc..

*No offense but you either don’t seem to have a good grasp of the issue or are pushing a partisan agenda. Please educate yourself on the benefits and realities of MMJ and how it is prescribed, produced, sold, and used before you decide which amendment you will back.  Initiative 65 can be a huge benefit to the unhealthiest state in the country.*

I read both bills and then heard this on the radio and thought the questions he asked were at least valid enough to consider. I don't see that as partisan at all. Certainly we can have an honest discussion without getting mad like a fourth grader (I am generally talking here, not saying you have done that)? What bill has ever passed that there were NO questions asked about it? Most of the proponents who want this aren't nearly as informed as you and just want 'legal weed'. I'm not saying you are wrong and I am right (I very well could be wrong), we are just discussing the merits of the proposition.

Thanks for the discussion, I respect your opinion and I agree with you that in the end  we want the people who really need medical marijuana to be able to get it and use it to ease their pain. I think they are just trying to make sure the law isn't abused and suddenly everyone is smoking it everywhere whether they really medically need it or not",1584206610,fkhv9kc

Tall order but I'll do what I can! As for culture, it's small town, so lots of teenagers at sonic/walmart and old people at bingo. There is some small industry around Iuka, like TVA and the new silicon plant, but it's a very slow growing place. Most people would say they travel for recreation, such as to the tishomingo state park, corinth (30 min away) or florence (about an hour away). I liked growing up there because there wasn't too much trouble to get into, but I inevitably moved away after college because there is little economic opportunity.

The further north you go in the state the more people favor potatoes over rice, less sugar, less spices in food. Before my diet I had an unhealthy relationship with potato salad.

The inverse is true the further south you go.  The delta will favor rice because they grow tons of it.

There's not much to do around those parts unless you're into boating, hiking, camping, fishing, etc. Racism is alive and well in Mississippi, but for the most part it's what I'd call ""casual racism"". People here tend to be racist behind your back, not to your face, and most people aren't in the Klan or running around attacking black people in the street. 

Unless you have a better plan I'd say moving to Iuka to work is a decent idea. Save up some money for your future and start planning how to move on to bigger and better things.",1584371798,fknqj35

Au jus: 600mg

The Mississippi pot roast is relatively healthy when compared to fried catfish. Easier to cook, and I would be willing to bet that most anyone to have had a pot roast in the state has tasted this recipe. I’m honestly a bit surprised at the hostility towards it.

Growing up in the 70’s and 80’s and being poor (but not knowing we were poor), our favorite meal was white beans, stewed potatoes, and Johnny cakes.

Mama would boil white beans (great northern beans) all day with a piece of ham (not deli meat but a chincknof leftover baked ham usually). Stewed potatoes are just chopped potatoes also cooked for maybe two hours with a piece of ham until they are creamy and almost like a lumpy potato soup where the potatoes cook down to almost nothing.

Johnny Cakes are basically corn bread pancakes that aren’t sweet. Estimates: 1/2 cup of Martha White cornmeal, a teaspoon of salt and pepper (we like ours peppery), a glug of milk, a small dash of oil, and some water to thin it all out. Then cook in oil like a pancake and top with butter (that’s why you only use a mall dash in the mix).

Here’s how this would work.  You suspend collection of payment for whatever the timeframe is say 90 days.  During that time your loan does not accrue interest and you don’t make any payments.  You resume making your normal payments when it’s over but the term of the loan has been extended three months.  So it didn’t cost the lender any money and it didn’t save you any money, it just kicked the cab down the road a little. 

Here’s why it’s a good idea.  Most people have enough cash to get by for maybe couple or months if anything at all.  Even if you say have everyone $2k like some people are saying you should do, if you’re still making your mortgage, debt and car payments, that buys you maybe another month.  However, if all you had to do was get together enough money to feed your family for three months, you could last considerably longer.

The alternative is we do nothing, a massive amount of people default on their loans, leadings to massive foreclosures and repossessions which floods the market and leaves tons of people homeless.

The idea behind trickle down economics is that goal of creating large amounts of wealth encourages a business or a person who owns it to grow as much as possible which creates jobs for everyone else allowing them to support themselves.

But, on the other half of the capitalist equation--the consumer is still king, are they not?--does the rampant hoarding not raise any eyebrows for you, particularly with respect to ensuring the system efficiently gets certain resources to people who actually need them, rather than people who can just afford them? You so sure all of your elderly and infirm neighbors haven't had to make any unnecessary compromises with their daily routines or medical supplements while stocking up? 

And speaking of consumers, COVID has hardly been a poster child for capitalism because the enforcement of harsh price gouging laws is pretty much the only thing standing in the way of jacked-up prices that would force most of us to burn through our money much more quickly, if we could even afford much of anything at all.

The state Department of Health announced another 13 cases of the novel coronavirus in Mississippi on Wednesday, with new cases in Bolivar, DeSoto, Madison and Perry counties. 

The announcement brings the total number of cases of the virus in the state to 34.

There have been no deaths so far. The department says it has tested 510 people so far.


Wednesday morning marks the first full week since the first case was reported in the state on March 11.

The announcement also follows Tuesday's development in West Virginia where state health officials confirmed its first case, marking the spread of the virus to every state in the country, including Alaska and Hawaii.

3373,3373,MattadorD,"I agree and don't see the trickle down economics direct comparison between the two. I see it more closely related to the different welfare systems we have in the USA.

You said yourself that you're pretty conservative economically so I imagine that you're against welfare programs (or at least large ones or increasing them). I might be assuming and completely wrong, and if so then ignore this entire post. I'm a bit confused on how you agree with this program you propose. It seems to me like it would be very similar to welfare. 

In my mind, at least, this loan you suggest is very similar to welfare. I know there are a bunch of different programs that make up the welfare system, but for simplicity sake I'm just going to call it welfare as an over-encompassing term. You seem to realize that the majority of Americans are essentially living paycheck to paycheck, and that having 2k saved is not realistic for most people. You even say that even with that 2k saved it would only buy you another month if you still had to pay all your bills. So with all this said wouldn't it make more sense to increase the amount of welfare that a family can get? Also lessen some of the restrictions/criteria that make you eligible to receive welfare? In my mind it is similar, provide this loan/welfare and that will allow that person, family, whatever to be able to buy more and/or better quality food or items to boost their health and well-being. 

Doing some quick Google searching I found that the median in 2018 for two welfare programs where you receive money monthly (TANF and SNAP) was $486 and $129.97, respectively [Source](https://www.thebalance.com/welfare-programs-definition-and-list-3305759). I don't know about you, but $486 would only cover maybe two bills. It wouldn't even be all of my rent for the place I lived in Wiggins, and I can't imagine many other places having lower rent than Wiggins, MS! Also $129.97 can get me a lot of groceries yes, but not a month's worth. There are also other welfare systems that help but don't provide money directly to an individual (Medicaid and Housing Assistance), provide money only to an individual that has a disability (Supplemental Security Income), or a tax credit (Earned Income Tax Credit) so those don't really line up with the loan. I acknowledge that some of these would help lessen some other bills/costs of living, but ultimately I don't see how an extra ~$600 a month is going to really help.

Also I think that there are many people and families that face a similar effects that that this global health crisis is having on everyone either monthly or yearly. I see all these people saying they will need help from the government to pay their bills while they are sent home from work, and either can't work or are seeing their pay cut since they can't work as much. But what about the people that were facing that already or years ago? There will always be a person dealing with their own ""global health crisis"" at some point in time. I'm sure all of us have had a similar moment to this in our life already and/or most likely will face one in future. Some people it might be only a few weeks or a month or so, and for others it might be months to years. I just see this as an opportunity to reflect and see that many people face these hardships that everyone seems to be going through right now even when there isn't a global pandemic. So why not provide more systems and aid to others in similar situation you are now through all times.

I tried to keep my post concise and not be all over the place, hopefully I succeeded (looking at the length maybe not haha). I also don't want to seem like I'm ganging up or attacking you. I guess ultimately I want to understand where the disconnect is for you. Why is this loan plan ok, but the welfare isn't?

3383,3383,rebelfalcon08,"So a few things, first, you’re right in that I’m partially opposed to welfare and definitely opposed to expanding it.  Generally speaking, I don’t see a problem with helping people who can’t help themselves because they have some disability that prevents them from working.  I’d be adamantly opposed to giving any funds to someone who’s in a tough situation because they made poor choices at some point in their life. 

Second, what I proposed wasn’t a loan.  My proposition actually didn’t involve giving any money to anyone.  Basically what I proposed was to press the pause button so to speak and pretty much all bills that people gave to pay so that the only necessary expenditures they have over during this global health crisis is to feed themselves and their families.  

I think this is favorable to giving out money for two reasons.  First, it doesn’t cost anyone anything.  The government doesn’t have to provide any bailouts and it doesn’t have to send people money.  The banks and/or landlords just get their money a little further down the road.  Second, just giving people money is like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound.  Let’s say you make about $60k/yr, with a wife and two children.  You have a mortgage that’s about $1000/month, two car notes that are $500/month total and other utilities and bills that total $500/month so your fixed expenses are $2000/month.  Let’s say you it costs about $1,000 to feed your family a month (that’s high but it’s a nice round number.  You have about $5000 in savings you can access.  So if your total monthly expenses are $3,000/month and the government cuts you a check for $2,000 you can last 2 1/2 months.  If all your bills are suspended and you get nothing from the government you can last 5 months.  It’s a more economical solution that lets you last longer without any income.

Of course, this is because of an emergency situation that effects the entire country.  The reason it’s worth while to give this sort of relief to people is that to do nothing and have large percentages of people defaulting on loans would cause a Great Depression level economic crash which is worth avoiding.  That’s not the case when it’s day to day life and people have similar issues on a much smaller scale.",1584549903,fkui8gq

South Korea have a more homogenious society and can internally justify testing everyone in areas where a case is found. We have spent so many generation having those in power point the middle class into hating the poor that the idea of a blanket testing of everyone who might need it is alien. 

and the third side is shortsightedness in the logistics. We do not have a president who is able to coordinate an international response. We do not have a president who understood what was happening back in December when things started. If we had a better president even things like what happened in Italy and Spain could have been drastically reduced through World-wide effort and messaging.",1584557155,fkuvyj0

*If these tenants/homeowners are any good with money they should have a rainy day fund to pay their bills for a couple of months at least. Any person who can't literally go one month without income is just bad at saving/managing money.*

That's literally what you sound like to anyone who owns a relatively small business.

Utility companies may be abletocope, but I doubt rental companies are swimming in cash and individual landlords definitely aren't.

Businesses have two options generally for a competitive advantage:  cost leadership and differentiation. 

A renter or seller can sometimes differentiate by virtue of location (lake, riverside or beachfront property or just a better part of town) for those properties that are typically mid-upper end.  Those are likely to be companies and they tend to sell or lease to upper income individuals and families who won't be hurting to pay rent for a few months themselves if they have their own rainy day fund. 

Lower end options are usually not in a differentiating location or with any particular features to set them apart from each other. So companies and sometimes private individuals that own these properties have to adopt cost leadership to remain competitive and gain tenants. They would have very low or break even margins and so they can't do what you think they can without either cutting back staff hours or suspending any amenities (maintenance, pest control) to try and reduce costs to hopefully stay afloat. 

Companies are no different than individuals when it comes to finance and maintaining solvency with exceptions like Microsoft, Google, apple, e.t.c the big giants.",1584557310,fkuw8ug

I don't agree. I don't think they have razor thin margins like you claim. I personally know two people who own some lower income housing and their margins are fantastic. In case you haven't been paying attention rent has skyrocketed in recent years. I don't think any rental properties are hurting for cash.

If those property owners/ rental companies are also not paying mortgages and utilities, then that reduces a significant portion of their overhead cost. Just the same as my mortgage being suspended would significantly reduce my overhead. 

Also,

&gt;If these tenants/homeowners are any good with money they should have a rainy day fund to pay their bills for a couple of months at least. Any person who can't literally go one month without income is just bad at saving/managing money.

I would agree with you on this version if we weren't specifically talking about rental property owners and companies, and I should have clarified in the original comment. I know there are plenty of small businesses who need a constant revenue stream to survive (retail, restaurant, etc) due to the seasonal nature of consumer discretionary spending, but rent is not discretionary spending. So yes, if those businesses/owners don't have the cash to float the business for a few months (especially with no mortgage or utilities) then they are being poorly managed, and I don't think it's fair to compare that business model to your average American who has had stagnant wages for over a decade.",1584564413,fkv8vem

You’re assuming that the property owner is wealthy and simply can afford to shoulder the burden for others. This is often not the case. 

If a person worked hard for years, saved up their income and invested in property, how is it fair now that the person who has not saved their income in order to be able to afford to pay rent for a few months should be free to take from the other?

3541,3541,82ndAbnVet,"For all of you who are continuing to panic and just completely freak out, consider a few things.  First, worldwide (including countries with horrible medical care like China) the death toll among those infected is about 4%, with 96% of people recovering.  In the US, ""As of Thursday afternoon, the illness was confirmed in more than 10,750  people in the U.S. and had resulted in at least 154 deaths,"" which is a 1.4% death rate, on par with seasonal flu; stated another way, **98.4% of those infected in the United States recover**.

Second, the rate of infection so far is well below what would be expected in an average flu season, so it's not like everyone is going to get it.  Personally, I think this is because people haven't been taking seasonal flu very seriously, but damn, that's changed with this virus.  I think in the future we will be keeping our elderly citizens a lot safer from the flu because we'll finally realize that we should have been doing this all along.

Third, of the people who do become infected, there are higher and lower risk groups:  "" Up to eight in every 10 coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. have involved adults ages 65 years and older, [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said this week,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications/older-adults.html) with up to 70 percent of patients requiring hospitalization falling into the age range of 85 years and older.""

If 36,000,000 people are infected by the coronavirus, which is on par with the typical flu season in the US, we can expect 504,000 deaths.

The death rate for seasonal flu varies over time, but 0.1% is the widely accepted figure, however the infection rate is massive despite flu vaccines.  Regardless, yes, this is a valid comparison.  Also, bear in mind that the mortality rate is merely a function of the known infection rate versus the known death rate.  We are only just now getting a handle on what the infection rate is due to increased testing.  So, as we find more and more people who will not die with the virus, the mortality rate will decrease.

The issue, as always, is who gets infected, not what the sheer number of infections are.  This isn't like the Spanish flu, which targeted young, healthy adults, instead it is much more like a seasonal flu.

The state of Ohio believes over 100,000 in Ohio currently have the disease. Based on the number of Celebrities that have been diagnosed, the more tested a population is the higher the known rate of infection climbs.

But what is not climbing in lock step with the rate of infection is Hospitalizations and deaths. 

IF it is true that we already have millions of cases in America, it is also true that to date we still only have 217 deaths and 64 current critical cases and less than 600 have been hospitalized since the virus hit.

Those numbers are less intimidating if you believe we have had millions infected already but most have few symptoms. 

&gt;I am a presumed infected in Georgia. 60 years old w/asthma. Two weeks in same house with a much sicker but ok 30 year old daughter. (For her it’s like a lingering flu with fever and digestive problems.)

&gt;It’s been like a spring allergy season for both me and my 60+ wife who has COPD. Some additional tiredness maybe.

&gt;None of the 3 of us qualified to be tested, as my daughter was first symptomatic two weeks ago when test were in a critical shortage. Based on her symptoms and possible contacts she was presumed infected. No doctor visits (allowed) for anyone, just letting it self resolve as we isolate. We are not in any current COVID statistical counts.

I think there are already tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands like us in every state. I would have never thought it to be more than spring allergies.

3599,3599,82ndAbnVet,"The number of people who likely to die is governed by the infection rate and the mortality rate.  The ""mortality rate"" in the US is currently about 1.4%, but that rate is merely a mathematical function: the known death rate divided by the known infection rate.  You could have a mortality rate of 100% for a virus that isn't detected until the victim dies, this would be true even if one hundred million people were actually infected with the virus.

So as we do better testing, even if more people die the ""mortality rate"" is very likely to fall.  Also, now that the most at-risk populations have been identified and the nation is taking many steps to protect those populations, the infection rate will fall.  So overall, it's unlikely that the death toll will be that high.

Interestingly, we aren't just battling coronavirus, the steps being taken will benefit us in the yearly battle against the flu:

&gt;Flu season is hitting its stride right now in the US. So far, the [CDC has estimated](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm)  (based on weekly influenza surveillance data) that at least 12,000  people have died from influenza between Oct. 1, 2019 through Feb. 1,  2020, and the number of deaths may be as high as 30,000.   
&gt;  
&gt;The  CDC also estimates that up to 31 million Americans have caught the flu  this season, with 210,000 to 370,000 flu sufferers hospitalized because  of the virus. 

Think about that, 30,000 people dying just because of the flu, something for which we have a vaccine.  This is why I am saying that, while we should be careful with a novel virus like corona, there is no need to panic.  We have become very accustomed to tens of thousands of people dying every year from viruses, we don't panic every year and shut down schools because we aren't scared to death of them.

3752,3752,priznut,"You points are valid, but I’d caution to just dismiss the Spanish flu comparison.

The Spanish flu caused health care issues and many of the deaths due to the Spanish flu cake from lack of health capacity and lack of public awareness.

Most deaths came in the second and third wave (it lasted about 18 months).

The main difference is that the Spanish flu was far more dangerous to younger people because their immunity system didn’t have protections or exposure to similar diseases. The Spanish flu had a death rate of nearly 100% with pregnant women. While the inverse happened with Coronavirus. 

I think the point is that heath care systems have limits to care. Spanish flu stressed and broke it. Coronavirus did the same to Italy.

Let’s not be like the Philadelphia major in 1918 who scoffed and public warnings and allowed parades to continue. A few days later they had an epidemic and over 4000 people died in Philly due to ignorance.

More people are going to die because of this pandemic directly because he downplayed the issue. Some believe it was because of an attempt to protect self-interests.

If I were at high risk of dying from seasonal flu then every time it came around I would be taking appropriate precautions; I'm in the high risk group for Covid-19 because of my lungs plus I have an unknown rheumatological disorder that puts me in the ""better safe than sorry"" category, so I'm taking precautions.  What I'm NOT doing is robbing bread trucks, buying a year's supply (or more) of toilet paper or three pallets of wipes (like someone did at Cosco).  I'm not freaking completely out, and I don't see this as the apocalypse.  

Many people (many good and well-meaning people) unconsciously feel a need to ""belong to the crisis,"" and literally *want* to panic, people want to *freak* out, it's a way of reacting to and thus trying to deal with their fears.   So they watch 24/7 coverage and take in all of the negatives and get themselves into a fight-or-flight frenzy, but there is no way to fight and nowhere to take flight to.

We are rapidly approaching a point where even drastic action will not suffice in preventing a significant number of deaths as hospitals become overwhelmed with critically ill patients and won't have the necessary equipment, beds, medication -- or even medical staff -- to treat them. The medical and economic impact of continuing to ignore necessary steps could be catastrophic with lingering impact that lasts years.

Anyone who visited friends or family this weekend where it wasn't a critical need (healthcare or  similar) is a part of the problem. Anyone who went to a bar or restaurant, movie theater or other entertainment venue is part of the problem.  Anyone who went shopping for any non-critical item is part of the problem.

3903,3903,CommitteeOfOne,"&gt;just update it to show where we currently are.

According to its graph, we ""should"" be at 207 hospitalizations as of today. 

[The most current published information](https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html#Mississippi) is from yesterday, March 22, with 249 total cases (including the 1 death). Of that number, approximately 24%, or 60, have been hospitalized (this number is current as of March 20). It should be noted that the Department of Health states that is unknown whether 8%, or approximately 20, of the positive cases have been hospitalized. 

Even if we assume the ""unknowns"" are hospitalized, that gives a total of 80 hospitalizations. **So, we are approximately 62% under the covidactnow site's projections.**


It should be noted that these figures only include *confirmed positive* cases. In the clinic where my wife works, they are having to wait for five days to get results back from tests thanks to labs unable to handle the number of tests. So there can be a bit of a lag between someone being hospitalized and the hospitalization being attributed to COVID-19. (There's even one reported case of a person--not in MS--going from asymptomatic to dead before her test results were returned).

So that's where we are. I seem to remember seeing a site over the past few days where you could enter numbers and get projections, but I can't find it right now.",1584977321,fla5xk5

Because of the timing of Spring Break all of our colleges and most of our schools were effectively closed on March 13, two days after our first Corona case. People have been practicing social distancing in my area since that time; at least some of our churches have closed, last services March 8 or 15.

Washington state had its first case on Jan. 19. New York City had its first case reported on March 2. Both closed their schools on the same date we did. NYC continued to have on-site free meals through last Friday and now is serving three grab-and-go meals per day. NYC served more than half a million school meals last week and that number is expected to rise. Until very recently New Yorkers were hanging out in bars and restaurants.

It's going to be a rough few weeks, and merely being in a better situation than most is not very good. Hopefully Mississippians can watch the unfurling nightmares in NYC and Washington state and be convinced to maintain social distance and lockdown.",1584977460,fla65kf

If it doubles eight times in the next eleven days we will be at over 60,000 cases in MS. Hopefully that's an unlikely scenario. The state of New York went from 1 case to over 20,000 cases in less than three weeks but the primary areas hit are the higher density areas with smaller impact in the more rural Western parts of the state.

I would expect Mississippi to be well over 1,000 cases by the end of March, possibly much higher given the lack of significant prevention measures and the hoax/over-blown mindset of many of our fellow Mississippians.

If you're receiving government funds, let that money be used to help further good like mitigating the effects of covid or climate change.

At the end of the day, Republicans control the Executive Branch, the Senate, and the Judicial Branch, along with 26 state executive offices and 29 state legislatures.

That's a pretty nice ad hominem you have there but that aside here's my retort.  

Really?  You don't think that the #1 watched news station in America wouldn't spread outside of just the television?  Meaning that when you discuss this with friends and they say ""I heard that it's just a weak flu,"" that's not coming from them watching Fox News?  I was making the point that just because you say that you don't *watch* Fox News doesn't mean that the information that you're getting from the people around you and that you hold dear because of your own confirmation bias isn't *from* Fox.  It's not a hard leap to make considering that most of us surround ourselves with people that think like us.  I don't think that's too hard to understand but apparently it is.  

And again, that's fucking rich coming from someone that already in this very thread said that someone should stop getting their talking points from Rachel Maddow.  

[But back to what started all of this, again:](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168126/travel-bans-wuhan-china-spread-coronavirus)

&gt;Restrictions on flights in and out of China wouldn’t have prevented the novel coronavirus from circling the globe, a new model shows. Even if the amount of international travel in and out of China had been cut by 90 percent after February 1st, the trajectory of the epidemic would not have changed significantly — not without other efforts made to stop the spread of infection, like the isolation of people who were sick.

&gt;...

&gt;Now that the virus is present around the world, additional or continued travel restrictions are likely to have a limited impact on the epidemic, the researchers wrote. Policies that reduce the spread of disease within communities, like early detection and isolation of cases, will be the best way to fight the outbreaks, they concluded. 

If you would like to do your own study and publish it in [Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/early/2020/03/05/science.aba9757.full.pdf) or any other reputable science journal, feel free.

In other words, no, stopping people coming in from Europe would not and does not slow the spread of this virus.  What does is early testing and quarantining when it first started.  We're past that now.  The only option we have is self-quarantining because no one knows who has it and who is spreading it right now.

To agree with you on something, I do believe that Fauci is trying his best to walk a tight rope getting accurate medical advice to the people while not pissing off Donald ""I'm a baby"" Trump like he had to when he said, paraphrasing, ""Plaquenil isn't a cure for COVID-19 because it hasn't been double blind studied or gone through rigorous testing for the virus.""  Or when someone had to tell Trump that a 'strong' flu vaccine wouldn't work on novel coronavirus.

Mississippi's governing body (mostly) sucks and our lack of testing is certainly a major factor, but there could be several other factors that we're not taking into account here, some of which could actually be beneficial. 

1. Population Density. One thing I've wondered is how much population density is taken account of in those estimations. I've never seen a clear confirmation on whether they are factoring in population density or not. If anyone could provide more information that would be appreciated.

Mississippi definitely has a lower overall density than many other places. To make a comparison to Italy, Jackson has nearly one fifth the population per square mile that Rome has, and the numbers continue that trend all the way down the board. People are just generally more spread out here, and that could be a difference on how easily it spreads locally.

2. Humidity. Current studies are showing that heat and humidity more than likely decreases the spreadability of Corvid (it doesn't stop the infection, but it shortens the amount of time that the virus sticks to surfaces). Mississippi has been in the middle of a major rainy season, so that could have negatively effected its spread here.

3. Immunity. Experts are saying that the virus has more than likely been in America since at least January, and right now there's been very few cases of people who recovered from the virus regaining it. That suggests that infected bodies are building immunity to the virus. (Mutant strains are a major worry, but so far we've seen very little evidence that Covid-19 will frequently mutate.) Being that the time frame of the viruses arrival to America coincides with the common flu season around here, there's a chance that some of our ""flu"" victims around here were actually early victims of Covid-19, and if that's the case then we could already have a heard immunity growing in Mississippi.

Now nothing I've said just now is confirmed, and much of it is working off of ideas that haven't fully been confirmed, but very little of the virus is directly confirmed yet. We're learning more and more about it every day, and its important to pay attention to everything. We're still learning, and its important to not give into fear at a time like this.

China shut down their economy for a reason. And everything we’re seeing in our exponential infection rate in our own country, that we can trust, suggests that we are absolutely not doing enough to stop the disease.

&gt;Exactly, and experts are completely convinced that there is no getting though it quickly. 

China is already on a return to normal trajectory. 3 months is not much of a recession. 

&gt;Quickly returning to normal is not possible. 

Factually incorrect. 

&gt;So the question is, how do we maintain the consumer economy’s ability to bounce back? 

Well that's easy. Allow consumers to decide how much risk they're willing to take, and don't bar them from making economic exchange that they'd like to. 

There is no consumer economy when the working class is bankrupted from medical bills, and when there are stacks of bodies and droves of the permanentlay disabled because we let this illness overburden the medical system all at once.

Of course there is still an economy. Debt doesn't mean you can't make money to pay it off over time. What the hell do you think a mortgage is? If you don't want to get sick, then myself, the CDC, and medical professionals recommend you stay home. If you're willing to rush your health, then that's on you. 

&gt;Right. And GDP is expected to trend downward, by literally any financial institution you ask. Yes.

&gt;**Lesson 1: Intervene Fast, Before It’s a Crisis**

&gt;&gt;Just one week after the country’s first case was diagnosed in late January, government officials met with representatives from several medical companies. They urged the companies to begin immediately developing coronavirus test kits for mass production, promising emergency approval.

&gt;**Lesson 2: Test Early, Often and Safely**

&gt;&gt;The country has conducted over 300,000 tests, for a per-capita rate more than 40 times that of the United States.

&gt;**Lesson 3: Contact Tracing, Isolation and Surveillance**

&gt;&gt;South Koreans’ cellphones vibrate with emergency alerts whenever new cases are discovered in their districts. Websites and smartphone apps detail hour-by-hour, sometimes minute-by-minute, timelines of infected people’s travel — which buses they took, when and where they got on and off, even whether they were wearing masks.

&gt;Lesson 4: Enlist The Public’s Help

&gt;&gt;Officials also credit the country’s nationalized health care system, which guarantees most care, and special rules covering coronavirus-related costs, as giving even people with no symptoms greater incentive to get tested

We're still struggling to get *symptomatic* people tested here, whereas they were doing free drive-thru testing almost immediately for anyone in the country.

I went to a show in Nashville on the 10th? I’ll have to double check but I’m certain that’s right. I started having a runny nose.. had that for a few days and boom. Intense pain. I can cut out my name and send an Imgur link of my day by day. It felt like the worst flu ever with other symptoms mixed in. It’s not like the flu though. I know that’s hard to explain but this pain isn’t something I’ve felt before. It’s pain but I ache. I ache so much. The symptoms keep getting worse in terms of that. They’re off and on during the day and I don’t understand it. 

I know DeSoto county isn’t taking it all that seriously. Please be careful and wash your hands. Even if this isn’t serious you don’t want it. There isn’t anything that relieved the pain. Not Tylenol, cold/flu/etc medicine.

Reddit seems to be the only place asking why I got tested. There was suspicion with symptoms I was having. I’m supposed to start a job at FedEx next week. FedEx + someone that tested positive for covid. Am I wrong for getting tested and finding out that I am positive? I don’t understand why people are asking. You don’t want to feel like this.. trust me. That’s why. I don’t know what’s going on with my body and why it hurts so freaking much. I think I’m getting better and boom.

Is a lockdown coming? 
While other states, including Louisiana, have issued stay-at-home orders, Reeves said Tuesday that he believes it possible to get through the pandemic without having to issue such an order in Mississippi.

However, Reeves said it is possible he may issue a stay-at-home order in the future.

""I've seen some folks that are criticizing various decisions that have been made,"" Reeves said at a press conference. ""Let me just be clear. This is not a time for politics. This is not a time for criticizing leaders, no matter what decisions they make because a lot of people are under a lot of stress.""

The purpose of this was to ensure that the state governments would remain powerful actors. This remained true and effectual until the Great Depression, more or less.

Whereas dual federalism was akin to a layer cake, federalism is more like a [marble cake](https://www.lifeloveandsugar.com/rainbow-swirl-cake/) with all the layers mixed together. The purpose of this is to allow the different levels of government to cooperate to achieve common goals. In addition to historical Supreme Court cases affirming the supremacy of federal law over state law, states ceeded some sovereignty in exchange for money and federal aid during the Great Depression (and continue to do so today. Cooperative federalism has empowered federal, state, and local governments to fund and provide access to basic services like utilities, education systems, public infrastructure, transport grids, etc. Numerous programs that resulted from cooperative federalism remain highly popular, including social security, disability, Medicare and Medicaid, school lunch programs, interstate highways, etc. 

Although marble cake federalism allows the national government a lot more power than the governments of Washington or Adams' time (especially during times of national crisis), the states have enormous power to implement actual policy. This can lead to huge disparities between states that expand the limits of state capacity like Massachusetts, which has subsidized healthcare for eveyone up to 300% of the federal poverty level since 2006, and California and New York (and separately, NYC), which have created and heavily subsidized expansive tertiary education systems, versus (mostly Southern) states that choose to exercise their capacity morally like Missississippi, where abortion has been deemed non-essential, and Mississippi, where [HB 1523](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Liberty_Accommodations_Act) made it legal to deny LGBTQ+ people non-emergency medical treatment, and Mississippi, where [31 counties](https://mspolicy.org/hb-979-repeal-prohibition-in-mississippi-and-require-a-vote-for-counties-to-stay-dry/) are ""dry"" and refuse to allow the sale of alcohol. 

Like I said, government at every level has the capacity to effectively manage almost any crisis. This crisis is admittedly more difficult, but effective, capable leadership can mitigate the worst effects of this crisis.",1585245038,flkp2yw

4391,4391,EmotionallySqueezed,"That's an excellent point that you've made. State and local governments retain immense reserve powers to be used during crisis. I think the issue here is that most local and state authorities do not have the information nor the capability to tackle this crisis on their own. There simply aren't enough resources for everyone. During past crises, the federal government has used its massive leverage to purchase supplies for states. Because the administration has decided not to do this, states are forced to compete with one another on the open market, further raising the price of desperately needed medical supplies and equipment. 

I completely understand your libertarian point of view and would probably agree with you on a great number of issues during normal times, but sometimes a severe crisis necessitates a unified response. We are, for better or worse, 82 counties economically integrated with one another, as well as the economies of 49 other states. To drop cooperative federalism right now would artificially raise the death toll. We can either mitigate covid together as Americans and come out stronger on the other side, or we can compete as 50 distinct actors and wait for the supply and demand levels to reach equilibrium and return us to normalcy.

Every piece of good information about this pandemic (and potential epidemic) tells me that Mississippi is not just vulnerable, but highly likely to be an epicenter of covid-19. 

First. Look at the Johns Hopkins map. We have cases widely dispersed throughout the state. And at the current rate of testing, we should be confident that the actual cases are drastically higher than the reported cases. 

Second. If we want to protect ourselves, we’re already way behind. Social distancing is the first step, and should started 3 weeks ago. We haven’t done what we need to. Mandatory quarantine, aside from groceries, banks, and truly essential businesses (COMPLETELY UNLIKE WHAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS DEFINED) should be instigated. 

The measures that Tater has put forward are essentially just virtue signaling.  He values the value of the economy over the that of human life. He should be forced to resign after this is all over and done with. 3-4 months, minimum, by the way. 

We should be scared. This is big. This is horrifying. The only way that we can defend ourselves is by isolating ourselves and insisting that we shouldn’t come to work.

And the data is also based on only the cases we have here in the US, for example, in China patients ages 70 to 79 years had a fatality rate of 8%. In Italy, which has a high proportion of residents over age 65, the fatality rate is strikingly high, around 10% as of March 25.

Ann. § 33-15-31(a), § 33-15-31(b), § 33-15-11(c)(1) &amp; § 33-15-11(c)(4) any order, rule, regulation or action by any governing body, agency or political subdivision of the state that imposes any additional freedom of movement or social distancing limitations on Essential Business or Operation, restricts scope of services or hours of operation of any Essential Business or Operation, or which will or might in any way conflict with or impede the purpose of this Executive Order is suspended and unenforceable during this COVID-19 State of Emergency. However, nothing in this Executive Order shall in any way alter or modify the authority of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, the Mississippi Department of Public Safety or of the State Department of Health and the State Health Officer.

Many people, including myself, were reading this as if there were a comma between ""freedom of movement"" and ""or social distancing,"" and that changes the meaning of the paragraph (slightly).

Here's some very rough back-of-the-napkin math. The case fatality rate in the US is [around 1.5%](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/). [6 people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-by-country.html) have died in Mississippi. At 1.5% fatalities, that implies that about 400 people have it. 

Expect what I really mean is *had* it. It generally takes a couple of weeks for an infection to lead to death. So it's more like 400 people were infected *two weeks ago.*

Infection is currently doubling [about every 3 days](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#the-growth-rate-of-covid-19-deaths) in the US. Two weeks gives you about 4.6 doublings, which means those 400 infected people two weeks ago are closer to 10,112 infected people today.

4616,4616,DatMini,"[Jackson Free Press](https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2020/mar/24/gov-tate-reeves-orders-limited-gatherings-today-ex/) had a pretty good write-up on what his executive order does. It essentially boils down to what is classified as essential/non-essential and how that affects work from home options. There's also some questionable exemptions for groups of 10+
&gt;One of the immediate consequences of Reeves’ order is the formal declaration that most of Mississippi’s businesses qualify under it as ""essential,"" and thus are exempt from restrictions on public gatherings. As of press time, the Jackson Free Press has received reports from businesses in the Jackson area that have, as of today’s executive order, scuttled plans for work-from-home and ordered their employees back to work on-site.

I can't find any info on which businesses have done this, but option to work from home is critical if we are want to combat this thing.

Additionally...
&gt;From the date of this Executive Order until April 17, 2020, Mississippi residents shall avoid social and other non-essential gatherings in groups of more than 10 people where the gatherings [sic] in a single space at the same time where individuals are in close proximity to each other,"" the order states. ""This does not apply to normal operations of locations like airports, medical and healthcare facilities, **retail shopping including grocery and department stores, offices, factories and other manufacturing facilities** or any Essential Business or Operation as determined by and identified below.

The bolded emphasis is where this comes into problem. The executive order gives a broad sweep for what is deemed essential, and this could apply to many office settings. This gives the potentiality for a crowded office not to adhere to social distancing recommendations and require workers to come in without offering a work from home option. It could lead to workers being stuck between a rock and a hard place when trying to watch their own health, but not loose a job as well. If the executive order were to ban gatherings of 10+ for offices that would erase the fear of repercussions for wanting to work from home.

This is just for offices. There's the additional issues with this regarding the roll backs for retail, food establishments, and churches too.

Bringing this back to the original question, let's say a city had different standard for what is essential vs non-essential. If the city's restrictions were tougher than the state's, those workers that had the former security of being able to work from home may no longer have that option. If you're taking every precaution you can personally, that's not going to protect you if you are still stuck in close quarters with a person who isn't taking this as responsibly. Your actions of personal responsibility are now nulled by the person who didn't.

Personally, I don't know what to think about the executive order since it has pretty much no effect on my family, I already work from home and my wife works at Hattiesburg Clinic, so she never had an option to work from home to begin with.  I understand, however, that the state has to balance the risk of increasing the infection rate versus the certainty of economic damage, and make no mistake about it, damage to the state economy is a very serious thing.  The economy makes everything in this state possible, including health care, welfare checks, public schools and their lunch programs, even the electric power rate is dependent on the economic well-being of the state.  There is a direct correlation to the death rate among elderly people and the electric rate, for example, because elderly people will simply not run their air conditioner if it costs too much, and then they die.  I am no fan of corporate cost/benefit analyses when they are talking about human life and safety, but the government absolutely must make that analysis when deciding ""where is the cutoff between saving lives by hurting business, and losing lives by wrecking the economy?""  It's not simply about greed, it's about survival as well.

Like him, I'm in a high-risk category, in fact I'm at much higher risk than a healthy 70 year old since I have COPD, asthma and I'm immune compromised due to a rheumatological condition I treat for every week with an injection.  Oh, and I'm 55, not that old but still in the increased risk range based on age alone.  If I contracted the virus and developed the disease, at the very least I would suffer lung damage, and let me tell you, COPD and asthma are no cakewalk as it is.  Despite that, I absolutely agree that I want for my four children and future grandchildren to grow up in a country that offers what it offered my grandfather, my father and me.  I'm willing to keep on staying home, limit my trips to town, do all the things that someone in a high risk category should do, while businesses get back to business.

The hysteria over Covid 19 has been overblown from the very beginning, which is what I was saying from the very beginning.  So yeah, I'm with the Texas Lt Governor on this one, us high risk folks need to take care of ourselves and ask others to be cautious, and at the same time we need to let business go on so that young people can earn a living and maybe not be stressed out of their mind that their whole world is going to disappear because of an upcoming Coronavirus Depression.",1585329769,flo1a2k

I didn't say the court hasn't infringed on people's ""rights"" or hasn't done things wrong--I'm saying they can rule it constitutional if the majority agree on it, even if it's morally wrong. That's what the court does--interprets the constitution and helps clarify what is legal. But that doesn't mean it's infallible--it has people on it with biases.

Also, I'm not trying to be condescending, but I don't understand what you're saying about rights being endowed by nature. What rights? Nature gives you no rights--you fight to stay alive, you don't get any guarantees. Now if you're talking about rights as a citizen, like voting or freedom of movement, bearing arms, etc., then those are given by the government, not endowed upon you by nature, or everyone in the world would have the same rights. And those rights can be taken away if you're convicted of certain crimes or in certain situations, such as my example of interment camps (or more recently, state shutdowns).

So, how are they rights? They're really more like privileges that we've all agreed should be given to citizens as long as they don't do certain things. Privileges can be taken away, which has happened in the history of the U.S. and will likely happen again.

Just because someone describes a situation and says it is likely allowable doesn't indicate agreement. Like in your example of Dredd Scott--it was deemed allowable and *legal*, but nobody that I know of is agreeing with it.

Until you’ve actually looked over the state’s finances this is an easy scapegoat. I worked as a state auditor for years and I can tell you firsthand it’s because the money isn’t there. The overwhelming majority of money goes to MDE where it is a total clusterfuck. The next two big chunks go to MDOT and Medicaid. Again, clusterfucks. Between those three that’s the bulk of the state’s expenditures. Everyone else has to feed off the scraps. All of this was true under Democratic leadership as well. MDE wastes tremendous amounts of money and a ton of fraud takes place under programs they manage and there’s virtually no recourse.

And lets not forget that low wage jobs often come with a bunch of stress, odd hours, and restrictions about personal time off which will make applying for a better paying job more difficult.

This is why it makes zero sense for an engineer, doctor, RN, etc to not even pay attention to most unskilled job listings.

- customers come in who are bored

- people bring their whole families including their kids

- someone walks in and proudly barks about how this is all bullshit and he ain’t ‘fraid of no ghosts

- someone comes in who’s sniffly and itchy and doesn’t understand social distancing

I could self-quarantine but doing so reduces the guaranteed extra hazard pay to 2/3; after insurance is taken out my take home would be around 1/2. I can’t live on that even if I stay at home and just eat a slice of bread every day. There are no guarantees of protection against eviction or disconnection of utilities or even that grocers will remain open and well stocked.

So I and my coworkers need the Governor to get serious about who’s “essential” so those of us who aren’t can stay at home without sacrificing our income to do so. It won’t hurt our employer any more than anyone else will be hurt.

You’re right that some people will still get out. The problem is that some of us HAVE to get out and we don’t need to. Seeing us out normalizes the idea that there’s nothing to be concerned about.

And maybe you, like many I hear, have every confidence that Jesus is going to protect you, but I’m willing to bet that some of the 2,500 Americans already dead from this thought the same thing and there’s far less of a guarantee there than there is with the grocers or the government or other institutions of our shared reality that we depend on.",1585603648,flyk47t

Like it’s simple - keep your people safe and alive and we’ll figure out a way later.

Then they’re paying that instead of funneling into the economy which - once again - will take a beating regardless.

I know of at least 3 houses on my street right now who constantly have more than 10 people over, in Hattiesburg, which IMO has been pretty good at handling this so far because Toby seems like a good guy. And 2 of those households are strict Democrats who hate Trump and hate Tate. Anecdotal evidence? Maybe, but most evidence is anecdotal in situations like these. 

I guess I should have made myself more clear on the leave politics out of this part of my argument. What I really meant was pre conceived politics. This guy obviously hates Tate reeves, probably only watches sound bytes and cherry picked clips of his speeches to the media. I am guilty of this myself, but There was an article posted earlier in this sub with Tate and he outlined why he hasn’t taken the shelter in place strategy here yet. He was way more well spoken in this interview than his idiotic Facebook conferences. He said that he has been in contact with VP Pence, De. Fauci, and the other Dr. (sorry forgetting her name) and they have recommended against a shelter in place order so far. So it’s not even him, it’s the nations top doctors saying ehhhh maybe not. 

He was even quoted as saying Andrew Cuomo himself second guessed putting NY into a shelter in place and how that maybe made it even worse. He said he doesn’t think that applies here due to how we’re structured completely differently than them (transportation mainly). And even Cuomo himself said a quarantine or national shelter in place order for NY, NJ, and CT would open up another can of worms

Tate reeves probably is thinking he’s gonna have a bunch of rednecks violently lashing out at a shelter in place. Which could be true. 

That’s why I’m not the governor, I couldn’t even fathom making decisions like this, and I think it’s vapid to criticize him and not give any offer to your own solution, which most people on these threads seem to be doing.

5301,5301,Smellanor_Rigby,"I live in Ohio now, and I find it very frightening that Mississippi has, proportionally, a much higher rate of COVID-19 infection. Our (Republican) governor has put many restrictions in place, very quickly, to stop the spread-- he revoked all liquor licenses starting the Sunday night before St Pat's, for example. All state workers are working from home (my husband included). Schools have been closed for weeks. Day care facilities have had to apply for a temporary pandemic license, with a limit of 6 children per room, with preference given to essential workers. 

Because of these mandates, *and the population taking them seriously*, we are seeing much lower rates of infection than we would have otherwise, although Dr. Acton keeps reminding us that the reported number is just the tip of the iceberg because we simply don't have the testing capacity. 

Frankly, people are not going to take the threat seriously even these mandates are out in place. There are plenty of ""but muh freedoms"" folks out there that are going to insist that this is all a hoax and then refuse a vaccine afterwards. However, if people see their government taking action, they are more likely to follow and do what is best.

Do you remember your mom counting down from 3 as a child? Did she even count to ""one and a half...... One and a quarter.........""? That's basically what Mississippi is doing right now, when they need to get the belt out. 

I'm so glad for you, that you and your grandmother aren't going to have to leave the house for 3 months to obtain provisions, but not everyone has had the ability or foresight to live that way (speaking as someone that has prepped and could stay home for another 3 months, no problem, if not for my ""essential"" job in financial services).

My server/bartender friends say UI/the stimulus is a joke compared to what they actually make and also can't depend on/wait to see when anything like that is actually going to happen.

You can't just waive rent and utilities. Materials have to be purchased to make utilities work. How do you think they purchase those? Utility bills. Then you need man power, gotta pay them somehow.Some landlords, the rent coming in is their only income. Hell, they may be still paying a mortgage on the house you're renting. Not everybody who wants to make money, or owns property, is a fascist just looking to make dollars off of lives. 

Also your little enlargement about spending two weeks in the ICU is so short sighted. Some people are LOSING their insurance by not being at work. So if they were going to work and caught this and had to stay in ICU for two weeks, they'd likely be paid and then also have insurance paying for it.

An employee took her *UNgloved* hand, pulled her mask aside, rubbed her nose, dug down deep in her ear, put the mask back, picked up a pen with that same *UNgloved* nasty hand, handed it to one of the nurses (who was wearing a moon-suit to check IDs, apparently), who then handed it to a person in their car, that person hands the pen and form back to another nurse, who hands it back to a 4th employee who also has *UNgloved* hands, who puts this plague-pen **BACK IN A CUP** for the next person.

No running water. No bathroom except a portapotti which they advertised as ""NOT regularly cleaned"". At the COVID testing site.

Saw not one person clean their hands or change their gloves, yet they just went from one car to the next, cross-contaminating every single person who came through that line.

5498,5498,CommitteeOfOne,"Sounds very similar to the existing  executive order:

&gt;The shelter-in-place guidelines are as follows:

&gt;Individuals are to stay at home except for the limited allowances in the executive order.

&gt;When outside of their homes, people must follow social distancing guidelines by maintaining a 6-foot distance from others and avoid groups of 10 or more.

&gt;Evictions are suspended, though people are still required to pay any rent or make any mortgage payments.

&gt;All nonessential businesses are to stop all activities other than those necessary for minimum operations (e.g. payroll, health insurance, security) and enabling employees to work from home.

&gt;Social and other non-essential gatherings in groups of more than 10 people must be cancelled or rescheduled.

&gt;Restaurants and bars may only remain open for drive-thru, curbside, and/or delivery service.

&gt;People may leave their homes only to perform essential activities, such as caring for someone in the vulnerable population, getting food or necessary supplies, and working for an essential business.

&gt;Individual outdoor recreation is encouraged, but not group recreation or activities such as soccer or basketball games.

Public outings, such as to the grocery store, should have minimal numbers of people - like no more than a small family, although some places are going futher than that. Costco is going to restrict entry to two people per membership. 

Work from home if at all possible. 

No gatherings of 10+ people, including at your house. 

You can walk or bike around outside for exercise, but they ask that you avoid contact with others. 

No visitors to the hospitals.

The article you posted answers about half of my questions. To be sure: it provides clear-cut legal analysis and I was actually wondering about the legality of a legitimate quarantine against people’s wishes. So I appreciate you showing me that. Thankfully most people (from what I’ve seen) are complying and everyone agrees that it’s in everyone’s best interests to stay home etc. But at the same time, thankfully, I haven’t heard of any compliance forced upon citizens yet. It seems at the moment, most people are cool with the government (at various levels) highly suggesting that people stay home and obey curfews and all that. Which, again, is a good idea on an individual level. 

But my main issue is the idea that a lot of people actually want the government to “do more” as is usually the demand. Education campaigns aren’t good enough, they claim. Daily CDC briefings updating us on the death toll and the infection count isn’t effective enough at keeping people home, apparently. So their solution, ostensibly, is to have the government force people to stay home. Which doesn’t make sense to me because, what does that solve, exactly? For whose benefit are these “orders,” anyway? The smart people have already decided to stay home and social distance. The people who haven’t adjusted their daily lives surely have witnessed store closings and traffic reductions and I’m quite confident no one in their right mind is seeking infection, so what’s the problem, exactly? The government can’t post police at everyone’s homes and assign them numbers to get in line to go to the grocery store, and until that happens, people are going to get food when they can, and when they feel it’s unlikely they’ll meet crowds at the stores.

My whole point is that people are already staying home more. They’re shopping less. They’re attending fewer gatherings because there are fewer gatherings even happening right now. The task of telling everyone how to flatten the curve has already been accomplished. Or at the very least, it is currently being worked on. I don’t think government mandated lockdowns are the answer, at least not without a very clear timeline on the end of such a lockdown, at the very least. 

The assumption that government lockdowns are the ultimate way to flatten this curve has never made sense to me. People who want to avoid infection (which is just about everyone) have been made aware of how to do that. They still need to go get groceries. They still need to visit their families to the extent that’s feasible and safe, anyway. And I’m sure no one will be on board with a cop posted at everyone’s home keeping them inside like China was doing for a while. So it seems an unnecessary tactic to install lockdowns when they’re not going to accomplish all that much, and they’re only adding power to a government that is too powerful at the moment anyway.

There is certainly a large chunk of our state's populace who is greatly affected in different ways by this. No one individual's struggle is worse or better than the other for a lot of us, except for a few. We are all having our own struggles, stresses, and fears that we are having to face somehow.

There's a lot of unknown's right now and the statistics only paint part of a morbid picture due to the circumstances. This incomplete picture casts fear and this in turn creates panic because our own leaders have their own incomplete pictures or try painting absurd ones that conflict with what is an obvious threat. This doesn't help fears or help things; it only makes things worse.

The certain sad reality that is staring us down is a hard thing to comprehend. Take in the gravity of simply having a stay at home order given or the mere fact our president has been on TV nearly every day for a span of time speaking about this. Lots of people use humor to help with this and the memes are a mix of the anger towards it too.

You say they should listen to their people...how are they listening if all they hear are complaints and no ideas to make it better? I can tell you from experience in working around politicians and people in higher positions, they just write people like that off as being unintelligent. They have no problem with you criticizing them, but only if you give them reasons why you are and solutions to that.

When you complain about medical malpractice, there isn't a way to tell them they could have done it better because its just obvious. But politics is different because what may be good for one person isn't good for another.

For example right now, for me shelter in place/stay at home/everything closing down has little to no effect on me and how I do my job/get paid/life my life (besides I can't go play live music)

But for other people, that $1,200 check isn't gonna be enough, and trying to get unemployment is HELL right now, and nobody knows how long thats going to take either. So the shutdown doesn't work for these people because yeah they MIGHT get the virus and they MIGHT give it to someone else and that person MIGHT die but they also MIGHT not.

I’m saying that “highly upvoted” is not a good argument. 

&gt; ... mississippi-related posts are not a good metric for what people are wanting.

MS related is a good metric. Our rule for years has been all posts must be apolitical. The joke posts were violating that rule. I let them through anyway because I though it was the right thing to do. 

If they continue, the sub will be a joke/childish pictures sub like so many others have become over time. 

While a funny picture with Tate Reeves slurs in it is MS related, it was in violation of our sub rules up until yesterday. 

I relaxed those rules because I think that we need to talk politics these days. I think criticizing the state government is important. 

But that does mean we are going to make the sub a joke sub. 

That’s all this is about. 

&gt; You are instead reducing content from a subreddit that is already very small ...

I don’t find this argument convincing. We could make it huge by making it comical and obscene but then what would we have? There are already large subs that you can post that content on. 

Go start a Mississippi memes sub. No one is stopping you. 

&gt; You did not ask anyone and the decision had no basis in any prior rules.

It did have a basis in prior rules and in my monitoring of the comment and in listening to other people. No, I didn’t take a poll. This sub is mostly full of people who hate MS, not who love it. Polls are not helpful.

[He requested an SBA declaration of disaster March 17 which was granted on March 20](https://www.msema.org/news/governor-reeves-requests-sba-economic-disaster-declaration-for-covid-19/)

5842,5842,drumsOFwar,"So what if instead of corporate welfare to the tune of over 1.5T, why not disperse direct so people can pay bills.   Not angry little man, not angry at all; but you are advocating for behavior that is irresponsible and has the effect of potentially killing others. A real probability of doing serious harm. 

Now that we have some statistics, we know that nearly 25% are asymptomatic which means they are carrying and spreading a deadly virus without knowing. 

If people are not prepared, that's unfortunate and our leaders need to step up. But ignoring simple facts just because what the fuck ever is the action of, and let me be clear, a fucking moron.

EDIT: To expand my thoughts on payments. Businesses don't need money, people do. A factory can sit but the people need money. So instead of giving the factory owner money and they still lay off their work force (causing unemployment claims so now the government pays twice), pay the employees. Then they can pay their bills. We take care of the people, reduce panic, and give businesses the opportunity to run on skeleton crews until we get through this. The reduced production will cover the needs of Americans until such time that we have control over this virus situation. 

So we save the people from exposure, we reduce government expense, we give people in need the ability to ride out the storm, and in the interim we completely overhaul corporate laws so that a one month demand reduction doesn't require 1.5T in help. I mean how in the fuck?

EDIT II: Congrats on your hygiene. Do you believe everyone else has your level of hygiene? No of course not. So just because you wouldn't do the stupid thing (and I only say that because you said it, I honestly don't know) does NOT mean that the argument is invalid. There is an idiot out there without an acceptable level of hygiene who shares your views on going out that will spread the virus. Don't be daft.",1585858842,fm8zf4n

And btw, I  keep using the number 1.5T. The reason is simple. The 2T deal has some money for the people and small businesses. So 1.5T is left. Also the actual amount is much higher, so the  number I am using is a very conservative estimate.",1585862025,fm95da2

I tried writing our reps, Tate, etc. urging them to protect the elderly and immunocompromised and of course they didn't respond (that was February, mind you). I'm done being here. The brain drain is real. My partner and I are highly skilled and educated but we are working for barely nothing, living in poverty because there's nothing for us here. Tech people and educators totally get screwed here. Mississippi has made it obvious we aren't valued and we aren't welcomed. Hell, just the magnitude of abuse and generational poverty that gets covered up because conservative Christian values is all that matters and no one wants to look at the rotting baseboards. Plus, being LGBT means things are harder here than they need to be.

I think Tate is the epitome of Mississippi values. Rich, white perfect family who espouses Christian values and ignores the working class. More worried about what the neighbors think than actually representing their constituents. He's not a joke, he's a reminder of what happens when the state with the most black voters in America just completely rigs the system in favor of the GOP. With all the voter suppression with cage call voter purging, purging voter rolls days before elections, shuttering polling places in black districts, voter ID laws, gerrymandering, etc. it's hard to just sit here and not feel oppressed. I'd rather be homeless anywhere else than spend my life here being pooped on by rich religious nutjobs.

Sorry but this subreddit is going to see a lot of political posts because people are rightfully frustrated. We want a government that represents the working class and our best interests. What we have instead is a system blatantly rigged against us.

Is it because of cultural reasons?  Do any of you Mississippi haters have even the slightest clue what a ""rate"" is?

The term ""rate"" is a mathematical one.   In mathematics, a rate is the ratio between two related quantities in different units. If the denominator of the ratio is expressed as a single unit of one of these quantities, and if it is assumed that this quantity can be changed systematically, then the numerator of the ratio expresses the corresponding rate of change in the other variable.  So the hospitalization rate for any disease is the number of people who have been hospitalized for whatever reason divided by the number of are known or estimated to have the disease.

No. Not like what you mean. Using “hard data” doesn’t really work like that. 

What we can do is use models to predict how it could have happened. And to the point of your underlying implication of the political situation, and why it is damning of Tate Reeves, is that there are models that could have foreseen this. Namely, MS has high incidence of all of the health conditions that are understood to complicate and worsen COVID-19. Obesity, diabetes, cigarette smokers per capita, etc. These risk factors have been well publicized since March 10 (I’m choosing this date because of when I, a citizen without any special knowledge or responsibilities, learned these things).

I don’t know what the “data” was that Reeves said he was looking at to make the call when he did, as to why he didn’t act sooner, and with more force than he even is now, but it certainly wasn’t good data. Mississippi will be hit hard by COVID-19—and as far as modeling goes, I also foresaw this explicitly because of our poor leadership, as an additional contributing factor.",1585928984,fmbm02k

Well, no. There are detractors but there are supporters as well.

To be clear, I’m going to do what I think is in the best interest of the sub. Other factors are only relevant as they pertain to that goal. I do not now, nor will I ever make decisions based on how I think the voting will go. 

You don’t see all the complaints I was getting about the joke posts. Which, by the way, were valid complaints. If I were following the rules correctly, I’d have removed all of them. As I’ve mentioned, I have already altered the rules to allow political posts as a way of responding to the sub members. I feel like that’s the right thing to do.  

You also didn’t see the posts I had to remove because they were too much to allow or were spam or were violating some other rule.

You haven't seen a proper diner because you live in a culinary hotspot. Most of MS is what's called a ""food desert"", with varying levels of access to grocery stores and fresh produce, let alone non-American restaurants. 
Oxford, on the other hand, has more food variety than any city of its size in this state. I don't know any off the top of my head, but I know there's at least one diner in Oxford.

Plus there’s an insane level of cognitive dissonance when it comes to racism here. I had a boss who would actually tell a story about how a black woman accused him of racism. He kicked her out of his office because he “wasn’t like that” and was offended she accused him of such. This is a man who I’ve heard say the n-word with a hard R on multiple, multiple occasions and actually said he wouldn’t hire a black woman because and I quote, “their hair smells funny.” My boyfriend works in a factory and he’s heard the hard R from people who told them they only said it because they black person they were talking about was racist! First of all no, “reverse racism” isn’t a thing and second of all why would you leap to saying that word immediately?  

People who say that racism isn’t prevalent here aren’t paying attention. When a mixed race couple (specifically black/white) comes in somewhere, you can literally see racism on people’s faces. My little brother was on a team with a mixed kid. His dad was an amazing coach and he was getting a tournament team together. My parents asked another couple if they would be joining the team and were told no because, “they’re not...our kind of people.” Hell, I got dirty looks at a bar because I’m a white girl and I was out with a Latino guy. People here are racist as fuck. You’re getting downvoted, but you’re right.",1586047845,fmgfggr

* Our hospitals don't have enough ventilators.

I say this because MBA’s are becoming a dime a dozen in the business world today with many universities allowing 4 year bachelor students to stay for a 5th and receive an MBA and also just lowering admissions standards as a whole. There are a lot of articles out there that talk about how MBA’s have become money grabbing schemes for many schools and have a low ROI unless they are a top MBA program in the country or the student has a set plan (job in hand or desire to be in that area).

However, all that being said, do your own research on the program, the starting salary upon graduation, the % with jobs and where they end up, do lots of candidates get internships, etc. This will help you make the decision as to whether or not you want to attend MC or any MBA at all.

We haven't run out of ventilators, hospital beds or ICU beds (not even close), so in that regard the death rate isn't due to overwhelming the hospitals yet.  If hospitals do become overwhelmed, that rate could climb very quickly, but the news on that front is good: we are at 12 days until peak resource use on April 18, and we are not expected to have a hospital bed shortage or an ICU bed shortage on that day.  Check out [https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections), and click on the data for Mississippi.

On the other hand, the known rate of infection (20,370 tested so far divided by 1,738 positive) is only 8.5%.  20k is a really good sample size given Mississippi's population (I'm basing that on my experience in MS politics, I have zero experience in epidemiology), so that 8.5% number is pretty solid.

In the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.

Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.

That we do not overstate the dangers to our institution, a reference to a few facts will sufficiently prove.

The hostility to this institution commenced before the adoption of the Constitution, and was manifested in the well-known Ordinance of 1787, in regard to the Northwestern Territory.

The feeling increased, until, in 1819-20, it deprived the South of more than half the vast territory acquired from France.

The same hostility dismembered Texas and seized upon all the territory acquired from Mexico.

It has grown until it denies the right of property in slaves, and refuses protection to that right on the high seas, in the Territories, and wherever the government of the United States had jurisdiction.

It refuses the admission of new slave States into the Union, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits, denying the power of expansion.

It tramples the original equality of the South under foot.

It has nullified the Fugitive Slave Law in almost every free State in the Union, and has utterly broken the compact which our fathers pledged their faith to maintain.

It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst.

It has enlisted its press, its pulpit and its schools against us, until the whole popular mind of the North is excited and inflamed with prejudice.

It has made combinations and formed associations to carry out its schemes of emancipation in the States and wherever else slavery exists.

It seeks not to elevate or to support the slave, but to destroy his present condition without providing a better.

It has invaded a State, and invested with the honors of martyrdom the wretch whose purpose was to apply flames to our dwellings, and the weapons of destruction to our lives.

It has broken every compact into which it has entered for our security.

It has given indubitable evidence of its design to ruin our agriculture, to prostrate our industrial pursuits and to destroy our social system.

It knows no relenting or hesitation in its purposes; it stops not in its march of aggression, and leaves us no room to hope for cessation or for pause.

It has recently obtained control of the Government, by the prosecution of its unhallowed schemes, and destroyed the last expectation of living together in friendship and brotherhood.

Utter subjugation awaits us in the Union, if we should consent longer to remain in it. It is not a matter of choice, but of necessity. We must either submit to degradation, and to the loss of property worth four billions of money, or we must secede from the Union framed by our fathers, to secure this as well as every other species of property. For far less cause than this, our fathers separated from the Crown of England.

Our decision is made. We follow their footsteps. We embrace the alternative of separation; and for the reasons here stated, we resolve to maintain our rights with the full consciousness of the justice of our course, and the undoubting belief of our ability to maintain it.”

Tennessee Gov. [Bill Lee](https://thehill.com/person/bill-lee) (R) is taking heat online this week after signing a proclamation declaring Saturday a day of observation to honor a former Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader.

Lee had proclaimed Saturday Nathan Bedford Forrest Day in Tennessee, according to [The Tennessean](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/12/tennessee-nathan-bedford-forrest-day-gov-bill-lee-signs-proclamation/1684059001/). Under state law, Tennessee's governor must issue proclamations for six days of special observation, three of which pertain to the Confederacy, the paper noted.

In addition to July 13's Forrest Day, Tennessee governors are also required by law to proclaim Jan. 19 Robert E. Lee Day and June 3 as Confederate Decoration Day, also known as Confederate Memorial Day. ",1586225624,fmngnfb

The bad news is that unfortunately, I was only approved for a weekly benefit of $53 per week. Which ain't much, but something's better than nothing I guess. At least I won't starve to death. However,

&gt;In addition, Turner said, people have not begun receiving the additional $600 in their weekly benefit payments, but she expects payments will likely be applied retroactively to this week. This means recipients could receive a check for $1,200 or more in some future weeks.

Basically, MDES is still 

&gt;...waiting on guidance from the federal government on how to integrate the new payments and eligibility to their systems.

So, if you manage to successfully apply for unemployment and get approved (which is major challenge in itself right now I know), even if you only qualify for a small amount of weekly/monthly benefits at the moment, you very well could see an increase in your unemployment benefits over the coming weeks if your former employement was impacted by the Coronavirus. 

If you manage to successfully apply for unemployment and DON'T get approved, then according to Jackie Turner (MDES Director)

&gt;...it's possible some gig economy and freelance workers will be denied if they apply for unemployment right now, but could be approved in another week or two.

295,295,HowardBealesCorpse,"So I lived in Clinton from November 2014 to August 2019. I lived in the Northridge Apartments on Northside Drive by the Briars neighborhood. When I moved in it was 850 a month and rent didn't go up until you moved out. I'm not sure what they're asking for now but I'm sure it's north of $1000. It was a two bedroom two story townhouse. It was quiet when I lived there. I was working for the Department of Revenue. I've since changed jobs and got married and I'm living in north Jackson for the time being. 

/u/front2back2 is absolutely right. It's pretty quiet and anything you want to do is a 30 minute car ride (I20 or I220 either way) to Ridgeland, Flowood, Brandon or Madison. You absolutely will get raped in taxes for vehicle tags in Hinds county granted it won't be as bad as in Jackson city limits. Wife got her 2017 Honda CRV tag and it was north of $600. For comparison that's what I paid for a tag in Clinton in 2019 for a 2018 Honda Accord.

I would suggest looking at apartments near old downtown if you want to minimize car driving though expect to pay more in rent. Look around near the Police station.

It's highly unlikely to happen since doctors are legally required to test people who die with symptoms of the disease, but let's assume the opposite for the sake of your question.  The projections I linked to are epidemiological projections that do not depend on whether the people who die with respiratory symptoms are diagnosed or not (obviously, since they are *projections* of what will happen *in the future* based on what has happened in the past).

I'll look into this, but I suspect the difference will probably be in what the epidemiologists define as ""needed"" hospitalizations versus the behavior of patients, doctors and hospitals.  If they are going strictly by medical guidelines about when to hospitalize a covid-19 sufferer, then they are not taking into account human behavior.  In that case, I would say that the ICU beds are a more reliable indicator, because it's easy enough to get yourself admitted into a hospital if beds are available, but it's an entirely different thing to get admitted into ICU.

We accept that tens of thousands of our fellow Mississippians will die from diseases each year, that more will die from automobile and other accidents, or simply from old age, and we each know that we too will die one day, but we are able to keep all of that in proper perspective so that we don't live each day in terror of what will happen the next.

&gt;Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun.

You are correct that the situation in New York is nothing short of human tragedy, pure and simple. They are, however, a state with vastly more resources than ours. Half of Mississippi's rural hospitals have no ICU beds. Many rural hospitals are struggling financially. We rank 50th in the nation in testing, which means that the numbers released today are a more accurate reflection of confirmed cases about this time last week. Frankly, our healthcare system does not have the resources to adequately face this crisis, nor does New York's. 

Additionally, Mississippians have high rates of underlying conditions. Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity run rampant in this state- so much so that far more people are killed by these conditions than will die from covid. However, the presence of underlying conditions makes it more difficult to fight the virus, which is why the young and healthy are far more likely to have mild symptoms, if any at all. While our healthcare system could treat these patients under normal circumstances, we will struggle if we have to treat even a small percent of these people at once, mostly because for-profit healthcare doesn't waste money on extra capacity in a state that isn't concerned with the health of its residents. 

Finally, the most concerning part of this from a state-wide standpoint is that out legislative session has ended. Our reps and senators might meet for 90 days during a normal year (and 120 dates every fourth year!), but they are sheltering-in place at home right now. What this effectively means is that the state will not be funding any additional measures to face this crisis. 

We will have to make tough choices within our communities over the coming months. If you haven't heard it now, make no mistake- the longer this continues, the more likely our system will fail to cope and healthcare will be prioritized for those with a greater chance of survival. New York is struggling, and that's apparent. Mississippi, on the other hand, has only just seen the beginning of this. We should have learned lessons and examples from Wuhan, Korea, Iran, Italy, and Seattle, but we twiddled our thumbs and pointed fingers. We might not have saved everyone but early measures could have prevented infections and deaths. 

TLDR; no one is calling the state trash, they're pointing out that we aren't going to be able to stop the wave of death and disease that has come because we've done too little, too late.",1586391653,fmuhr4o

But what makes it even more amazing,  the WHO are to be credited with the eradication of small pox.  A great feat considering the WHO was not created till 1948.  The first small pox vaccine was devised in the 1700's.

The information that is credited in the article is from Feb and is from China's govt.  Right now until proven I will have to accept that as fiction.

Stuff like this does not help.

561,561,TractionCityRampage,"They're partially correct. It's basically an argument between the mask providing a false sense of security and preventing symptomatic spread versus not wearing anything at all. I'd still wear one because of asymptomatic spread though.

&gt; But in updated guidance published on Monday, the organisation maintained that **while masks could help limit the spread of the disease, they were insufficient on their own. There was no evidence that wearing a mask in the community prevented healthy people from picking up respiratory infections including Covid-19**, it said.

&gt; Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who chaired the WHO’s scientific and technical advisory group for infectious hazards, said that unless people were working in healthcare settings, masks are **“only for the protection of others, not for the protection of oneself”.**

The types of masks that non healthcare workers are wearing will not effectively filter out the viral droplets and other stuff and if you are wearing one that can, it will do more good if a healthcare worker is wearing it. It's protection to slow spread to others but not yourself. 

Also their reasoning is that 

&gt; Heymann said masks could create a false sense of security that could end up putting people at greater risk. Even with the mouth and nose fully covered, the virus can still enter through the eyes.

&gt; “People think they are protected when they are not,” he said. “Healthcare workers, in addition to the masks, wear visors too, to protect the eyes.”

&gt; Another concern is that people may contaminate themselves when they adjust, remove and dispose of their masks.

674,674,Pitiful-Location,I'm a soon to be secular Jewish transplant to Mississippi. As a non-Mississippian I don't have a lot of insight but from my research Mississippi has a really small Jewish population (about 1500). The Institute for Southern Jewish Life might be a good place to look [https://www.isjl.org/mississippi-vicksburg-encyclopedia.html](https://www.isjl.org/mississippi-vicksburg-encyclopedia.html),1586478901,fmy62hr
675,675,dogfish21,"So I live in Brandon. It's 40 minutes to an hour away from Vicksburg on 20. I don't know much about the local Jewish community, but I can guarantee ppl are going to throw Jesus into everything you do and see. I don't say it in a negative way. It's just how the whole state is in my opinion. 

The biggest things I feel like you need to decide is
 A. How far you are willing to drive to work each day?
 
You can buy land in Hinds county(higher taxes, but Utica is cheap) with no social life. 
You can buy a house/town home in Jackson, Madison or Ridgeland (40 minutes to hour and fifteen minutes drive). That will all have more of a night life. Significantly more ethnically diverse, but still not very diverse. 
You can buy a house in Clinton(25 minute drive) Mississippi College is there and it'll have more ethnic diverse food than Vicksburg. 

B. Do you want to hunt on your own land or hunt in a club(I'm not sure what others would call this, but it's where a group of people pay yearly dues to be able to hunt on the land)?
There are plenty of these in the area

C. What kind of animals do you plan on owning? 

Vicksburg is a great town. You have to go to 10 South Rooftop Bar and Grill. There are casinos and it's not too far away from New Orleans. Memphis and Birmingham are both probably around 4 hours drive from there(maybe wrong on Memphis). Jackson is nice and I'm sure there is a synagogue in Warren county or in Hinds County. Any specific questions give me a holler. I'm not from here originally, and I'm moving within the month. It's not a bad thing. Wife and I just want more family help with our newborn and we both teach so it's easy to move.",1586479458,fmy6yum

C) Meat rabbits, maybe a henhouse. Goat or two? My goal is a self-sufficient homestead, but I’m not sure what animals do well in MS.

679,679,EmotionallySqueezed,"Chloe, I am so happy you're thinking of moving here! I'm not a native of Vicksburg but I lived relatively close by in Jackson so I might be able to answer some of your questions. 

Mississippi is an imperfect place with many structural issues, but we're all pretty good at heart. You will undoubtedly hear cavalier comments, but they generally come from a lack of understanding, more so than hatred. Use this an excuse to spread Jewish culture and customs to the Delta. Invite your neighbors over for homemade brisket at Passover or a friend to worship with you. To the best of my knowledge, Vicksburg has a tiny Jewish community with a temple, [Anshe Chesed](https://www.vicksburgpost.com/2016/10/01/anshe-chesed-temple-marks-175th-anniversary-in-vicksburg/). 

Now, as far as food goes, you'll have to make some adjustments. Ethnic food isn't as common here as in other places, but there are several restaurants in Vicksburg and specialty grocery stores in Jackson. It's about an hour away, so you might want to buy in bulk when there. That being said, consider this a great opportunity to try cooking your own version of a dish. I actually do this a lot and can usually find 95% of ingredients or substitutes at Walmart or Kroger. 

You mentioned wanting to buy a house and some land. You're in luck, baby, cause land is dirt cheap here! Houses add a bit of expense, but you'll pay a fraction of what the rest of the country pays for far more land and square footage. The climate here makes it even better, in my opinion. Winter is effectively non-existent, and the temperature is above 70 from April to October. This past summer I think I remember it being 90 most days up until mid November. The Delta has rich soil, as well, so you can grow a truly magnificent garden for most of the year if you have a green thumb. We're a pretty rural state, so there's a lot of wildlife that will come and eat what you grow, too!

As far as a social life, it's easy to make friends here. There are many organizations to get involved with (although they'll be more towards the Jackson area) and people are super friendly and polite. Get to know your neighbors and coworkers and your congregation and they'll introduce you to the rest of the town. 

We don't have a lot to offer, Chloe, but we make up for it in other ways. Give Mississippi a chance and you might grow fonder of it.",1586480985,fmy9esl

682,682,Tweedleayne,"I struggled for fifteen minutes trying to figure out how to write point C. Its really hard to explain in a couple of sentences.

But yes, population density is one of the factors. Italy has almost ten times the population density of Mississippi, over an area that's a little under twice as big.

Another factor is age. The average age of a Mississippian is about 36, while the average age of an Italian is about 45. In a disease that's more lethal the older you get, that's a pretty big difference.

Next up is smoking culture. Europe has a way worse smoking problem than America, and with a disease that targets the lungs, that problem can be costly. Unfortunately, this one applies to other states, not us. Our smoking problem is almost on par with Italy. But despite that this is still important to keep in mind when trying to understand Italy's part of this epidemic.

Touching is another factor. I dont know a proper way to say this one, so I'll just put it blunt. Italians are smacking lips constantly. That's a great way to spread the thing.

Weather is a controversial subject here, but I feel it's an important part of the discussion. There's no direct confirmation, because the testing is still ongoing, but there's reasonable evidence that heat and humidity decrease the spread potential of Covid-19 infected water droplets. So the logic  goes that hotter, more humid places that are going into their summers are going to see less spread than cooler, less humid places coming out of their winters (like Italy).

Finally, and at least to me this is the most important, is understanding, both in the hospitals and publically. This all broke out in Italy when very little was understood about the virus. So Italian doctors didn't know the best way to handle the patients, and the Italian public didn't know the best way to keep themselves and others protected. I know it seems like both our government and our people have done a shit job of handling this, but even as bad as we've been we're still better off than people who literally dont know what to do.

There's probably more reasons, but all this was simply off of memory.

So to put it in Layman terms. The Italians were a bunch of old smokers huddled up together swapping spit in an area prime for spreading the virus.

That's not to say we're peachy, our obesity is gonna kick our asses, but we're still way better off than Italy. On a scale of bad positions for the virus, Italy is near the bottom, and judging other places by their results is going to make the situation seem worse than it actually is.",1586481181,fmy9pr7

This was just my experience though. Keep in mind I grew up outside of Memphis, and it may be completely different in that area. In fact I've known a few people from the Madison area, and they spoke highly of it.

688,688,McWaylon,"The most obvious place to go in Vicksburg is the Civil War Battlefield but if you are not a big history person you'll probably not care for it. Great place to visit though. That said there is not a lot to visit in west MS outside of Vicksburg and Natchez. You will need to go to Jackson if you want to do any big city stuff, if you are used to yuppie/ upper class folk then Madison, Fondren,Flowood will be up your alley. If you want to shop at the high dollar areas you will love Madison especially the Renaissance, the high class shopping district in Madison.

As for being Jewish, you will receive no trouble. Most MS Jews tend to live in the bigger cities, and since Jewish folk are so rare in the rest of the state, at worst you will be seen as a curiosity, nothing more. Your real trouble will be locating a local Jewish community, but it should not be a problem if you do your research.

As for food (especially ethnic) you will have no choice but to go east toward Jackson. Greek, Vietnamese, and other Asian type foods restaurants are plentiful in the area. You can find Asian/Hispanic groceries in the Jackson area no problem.

One more thing, the heat.....GET USED TO IT!!!!! The wet heat will tear a newcomer to bits if you are not careful especially from June to August.

In short as far as social/ entertainment scenes go get used to driving to Jackson quite often. Do not be discouraged we in the central part of the state tend to do it a lot. Go down to the coast, hit the beach, meet a guy or gal (if you are single), sail out to ship island, there is plenty for you to do. Just ask us we will be glad to give more info.

First, I did some googling and the link below is all I could find for a temple in Vicksburg. As everyone will attest, this place has more churches than traffic lights and faith permeates a lot of life’s aspects. But good people are good people, so I personally don’t think you should be worried about any sort of prejudice unless you come across the occasional asshole. 

https://reformjudaism.org/find-a-congregation/anshe-chesed-congregation-vicksburg-ms

Second, ethnic food. This one makes me sad. Restaurant-wise, Atami has some pretty decent sushi but other Asian restaurants are pretty much catch-alls with a lot of generic American-Asian fare because that’s what people here are used to eating. I don’t know of any specialty grocers here but Kroger has a weirdly well-stocked Asian section for spices, noodles, sauces, etc. I’m counting down the days til I can get a good bowl of ramen again though. I came across an authentic Thai open-source recipe book on reddit so I’ll DM that to you when I find it. 

Lastly, the social scene. I’m in my mid-20s and it’s a hard no. I moved here with my girlfriend and we keep each other sane. Another friend moved down recently to work at the same spot which has been great, but the outlook is not great if you’re my age. There’s a few bars and Cottonwood/Key City where people hang out but my only friends here (not counting friendly elderly neighbors and the sort) are people I work with and people that moved here from back home. 

For all three of these things, I’ll say this: Jackson is your friend. Commuting from the Clinton area could potentially be a compromise/solution. Heads up, that is a college town for a Christian college. 

I hope this helps a little bit, and feel free to DM me if you have any questions at all.

On the one hand, you have the City putting out a blanket order not to have church services.

On the other hand, you have ask how the church was breaking the order, ignoring the specific bit about church services. People stayed in cars with windows rolled up and listened on their car radios. Social distancing was maintained. No groups gathered. 

And then again, the State must have a right to act to protect public safety, and we need to respect that, even if we disagree. (Think anti-vaccination. )

Edit:  I realize that there is still a discrepancy between the number of people we are actually hospitalizing versus the projections, but that's a triage issue.  We are projected to have enough non-ICU beds for people who truly need them, right now we have enough capacity for those who truly need them and others who could safely stay at home but elect to be admitted for various good reasons for which no one is faulting them.

That Mathew quote is not applicable. It is about being seen to worship in order to appear worshipful. You’ve got no reason to believe that’s the case here. The pastor’s argument for having church is that many of his members do not have internet access and this method allows them to have a safe service.

&gt; Saying you can't go to church doesn't violate your freedom of religion. 

It does if I believe that church attendance is an expression of faith. 

&gt; You are just as much a Christian on Sunday no matter what building you're in. 

No offense (and I agree with you) but, “says you.” There are many Christians who believe they need church service to be able to worship, pray, stay faithful, and gain strength from their community. Others believe (right or wrong - I’m not judging here) that God will protect them if they have faith in Him and keep His sacraments, of which church attendance is one. 

&gt; It seems to me that one of the bible's greatest lessons was do no harm. To do that in this moment, means staying at home and socially isolating.

&gt; Sitting in a building for an expression of faith is the definition of being seen by men. 

As I said before, “says you.” I also explained previously why you are incorrect. 

&gt; As for says me, if you need church service to be able to worship, pray, stay faithful, then you are once again being seen by men. 

As I explained, your personal opinion on the matter does not translate to others. Projecting your feelings on others is not the best plan. 

&gt; And if you're arguing your rights are being violated by a closed building, then once again, you're yelling loudly you can't be a good Christian without, being seen by men. 

I don’t see how you’re being confused here. Telling someone they cannot worship as they normally do is, without question, a restriction on their freedom of religion. The only question is whether or not this restriction is merited. The legislature was not involved. The executive acted unilaterally. 

&gt; As for freedom of assembly, there are many different ways to assemble.

No, there are not. Assembly is clearly defined by the courts as the freedom to gather physically. By restricting this freedom, civil rights are being violated. Again, the question is whether or not it is merited. No action was taken by the legislature. This freedom was curtailed by the executive with no input from the people. 

&gt; Doing so in a large crowd right now for the sake of faith should allow for criminal charges to be filed, should someone get sick. 

Doing so for any real could have that effect. As I said, my decision for our church was to not hold services.

They’re at a church instead of being at where people are killing, and while they’re murdering they at a church where we ain’t gonna hurt nobody, we ain’t drinking. Look where they at y’all.

When you say that conservatives have tried to keep the current democrat areas down, you fail to factor the impact that the current democrats have on those districts/precincts (see Kennedy and LaRita Stokes). 

California will blow my mind?  I spent about a year in CA.  What I saw was that blacks and whites were united in their disdain for the poor illegals leaching off the state.  I then concluded that the racism in Mississippi had less to do with the color of the skin, but the Economic status of the hated.  This applies to Mississippi and the rest of the country (as I worked and lived in other geographical regions of the country too).

But that may be too much for you to handle.

It may break your biased perception of what reality truly is.

Stays open: X number of people die or accelerate health problems from drinking too much during the pandemic in their homes, or become alcoholics themselves during this period.

Closed down: Y number of people die from withdrawal symptoms 

Just my opinion, but I would think that X would be larger, and cause more long-lasting damage to society. I could understand the opposite argument though and accept it.

From my point of view, there are some number of reasons people would oppose a ""drive-in"" church service, despite it complying with social distancing and having no possible medical issues. Some people hate religion and don't want them to meet in the first place. Most redditors reading this story are probably white, and when they hear ""church pastor"" they probably just have a caricature of an angry old white man in their head, and make them unsympathetic to their cause even if they otherwise would. Maybe they did not enjoy being brought to church as a child. I can try to appeal to religious liberty, but this is not very popular in this day in age. 

People are anti-religious and proud of it, but it is perhaps harder for them if their hatred finds itself against a minority they are not part of themselves.

There is a history of conflict between the black community and the police in popular culture, so I use it as a last appeal: Please stop persecuting people, especially black folks, when they have done nothing wrong! Look at what you are doing!",1586689391,fn66jfw

*Church Services
&gt;The City of Greenville put in place an Executive Order that orders all church buildings closed for in person
and drive in church services, until the State of Mississippi’s Shelter In Place Executive Order No. 1466 is lifted
by Governor Tate Reeves. Churches are strongly encouraged to hold services via Facebook Live, Zoom, Free
Conference Call, and any and all other social media, streaming, and telephonic platforms. 

*City Curfew
&gt;The City of Greenville put in place an Executive Order that orders a city wide curfew effective immediately
from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. daily, until the State of Mississippi’s Shelter In Place Executive Order No. 1466 is lifted

But since you immediately lack the knowledge of how these masks work I will fill you in since it's urgent you stop spreading false information. This is available in multiple locations but I will provide a source.

&gt;Every filter has a particle size range that it collects inefficiently. Above and below this range, particles will be collected with greater efficiency. For fibrous non-electret filters, this size is about 0.3 micrometers (µm); for electret filters, it ranges from 0.06 to 0.1 µm. When testing, we care most about the point of inefficiency. As flow increases, particles in this range will be collected less efficiently.

[Source.](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data)

What that means is that an n95 ask works for smaller as well as larger particle sizes and is tested a .3 micron where it is *least* efficent.

The masks for all, particularly cloth masks idea is to keep dipshits who think going to Home Depot for fertilizer and potting soil from spreading it by containing thier sneezes and other infected emissions.

I assume by being ""self-employed"" that means you are running (or were trying to run) your own legitimate business? Because that's what I'm looking to do once all of this ends - but's its not what I was doing before this.       
I was an ""independent contractor"" in the sense that I had a boss and co-workers and everything else a regular w2 employee has - but the boss had me and my co-workers classified as 1099 independent contractors simply for tax purposes and so he wouldn't have to provide us with health insurance or collect taxes from our paychecks and whatnot. I get that ""technically"" as an independent contractor I was my own boss - but in reality - the owner of the company writing my paychecks was my boss. So, obviously that's who I put as my ""employer"". I was able to get most of his info from my 1099, including his tax id number.

I know this probably doesn't help you much, and I apologize. I wish I knew what to tell you. If you didn't have a singular source of income as an independent contractor like I did, then yes, if I were in your shoes I probably would put my own company name in the ""Name of Employer"" box.

There may not be much nearby, but they will be needed somewhere. If they are licensed in in-demand fields like respiratory therapy, there will be a number of job openings, some with emergency benefits like housing for workers who are working away from home. Additionally, many states are temporarily relaxing restrictions for health care. A med school senior can learn anything they didn't already know on the fly, and a healthcare worker in one field can do a good enough job in another field for the time being.

We are definitely doing better than predicted. This is great news, but we'll be continuing to adjust to different forms of social distancing over the coming months until we find a vaccine. This will be burdensome, but necessary, and I encourage everyone reading this to make the most of your time. 

If anyone has lost their job or is unhappy with the one they have, I encourage you to take this opportunity to consider a career change. Mississippi has an excellent network of affordable  community colleges that can grant you an associate's degree in an in-demand industry in two short years, as well as a number of world class four-year institutions. The long-term benefits of a college degree are numerous and will quickly outweigh the any short-term costs.

Nature trails, boat ramps and spillways for fishing remain open at the district’s lakes in Mississippi. Visitors to the Mississippi lakes must adhere to the governor’s executive order to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people.

62% of all our power in the US comes from fossil fuels. Coal accounts for 23% of that. Natural gas is 38% and contributes significantly to global warming via methane. Solar power is a very safe and clean source of power that is frequently the target of misinformation campaigns courtesy of big oil. I hope the majority of the United State's power one day comes from a mix of nuclear, solar and hydro. Stable, effective and clean.

If classes resume in fall, they are still worried about sports not happening, which is a huge way we, and countless others, make money.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that people are dying, and that sucks. Yes, young people can die from this, but the scenario is highly unlikely. If people just keep saying ""we need to stay inside and change things to a new normal, you could die if you get this""....how is that living life? I could die in a car accident today, I could be hurt at work and die during an accident, I could fall and slip and kill myself getting out of the shower, etc. I don't fear those things because if I did, I'd lead a pretty boring and unfulfilling life. And I know...saying I don't care if I get this virus doesn't just apply to me, it affects others, but if you're scared of getting it, you can stay home. You don't need a stay at home order to tell you to do that.

Maybe for now you should apply for disability and use that as a cushion while you wait things out.

I risk swimming in dirty water, I risk driving (dunno where you live but I'm in Hattiesburg and Hardy Street is a fuckin death sentence everyday waiting to happen) to work everyday before I was told I had to work from home.

Rationality is a subjective thing. Why do you think people sell drugs? They are desperate, and one rationale of ""oh if I get caught selling this I'll be in trouble and not see my family for a long time"" goes out the window when the rationale of ""if I don't do this my family suffers"" appears

1457,1457,DatMini,"First off, hot-damn your grandma is a trooper! She is an admirable woman to keep persevering.

I'm abstaining from applying because given how overwhelmed the current safety nets are right now, I probably wouldn't get approved in time. I've been living off savings from my internship last summer; if I hadn't saved I would have been even more screwed. It felt like an accomplishment in life to finally be able to give back though stocking up on groceries for my fiance's family who has helped me so much.

The thing is I realize I am very lucky and privileged to have had that savings; I know that several more are struggling and I am worried about what happens to them. I got lucky and the fact that I am in a more comfortable spot because of how the cards of luck and disadvantage are dealt bothers me deeply. Life honestly can be out of your control depending on how the house deals them and that is not the individual's fault (to a certain reasonable extent).

I have lived and fought the traffic in both Atlanta and Houston; I absolutely get the risk with driving, but at soon to be 27 I haven't had a wreck yet. Because I am overly cautious and assume everyone around me IS going to kill me. I mitigate by having a dashcam, increased following distance, and consistently driving in a defensive manner scanning all cars around me.

Problem is that you can't do this with Covid. I can't see where the virus is or know who may be asymptomatically carrying it. The tools that offer greater protection are in limited supply; there's been no germ-ex, lysol, rubbing alcohol or any other cleaning supplies in any of our local stores. I have a cloth mask that was made for me, but those are only so effective and are meant more for protecting others than yourself. It is my rationality that is telling me the balance of this situation is not in my favor. I didn't persevere through all the bad things in my past just to meet a possible end by this virus. I learned to survive and fight for my life and that's what I am doing now in my choice. 

Given my views and life perspective, yeah I am technically selling out by seeking a career with the company I have been interning with, but yes there are bills and other adult things that need to be paid. What matters is what terms we set this at, and for myself the terms are looking out for my health.

I'm not going to give you my life story or try to serenade you for empathy, but I've been through enough to know not to settle for some things.

There have been a few studies done in other countries where they are sampling the population randomly and testing for Corona antibodies that show you had the virus. Almost none of the people they are testing had ""confirmed cases"", but tons are showing up with antibodies meaning they had it and got over it weeks ago (it takes around 2 weeks for them to even show up). Extrapolating the percentage for the whole area and comparing with the # of confirmed cases at the time of the sampling they are showing that literally 50-200x more people have had COVID than what the confirmed cases show, the symptoms were just so mild they didn't realize it. This pushes the mortality rate to around or even well below 0.1% (the same as the flu).

These studies are still early stages, but the results have been consistent and promising. Just letting you know it's not all gloom and doom out there, it just seems like it is because the whole picture isn't being shared. If I had to guess this might not ever become common knowledge because the leaders don't want the world to know they crashed the economy over what's essentially a more infectious flu. Sure, temporarily lockdown some of the most dense urban areas to make sure we don't flood those healthcare systems, but no-where is seeing near the peak of the curve that they expected, probably because everybody (not literally but almost) has already had the virus and didn't even realize it.

Like, we were *always* going to have 3,624 cases and 129 deaths (as well as the attendant projections for lower overall deaths), and that’s just not so. It is the social distancing and stay at home orders that have pushed those numbers lower, and there’s nothing magical about the work we’ve already done that keeps the numbers from escalating again. If we loosen social distancing or allow larger groups to assemble without at least a plan in place for keeping infections low, we’re right back to those 2 million dead models from earlier on.

Yet we can afford to give hedge fund managers and billion dollar companies multi-million dollar tax breaks every year, as well as giving Israel and other foreign countries billions of dollars every year so that they'll be ""nice"" to us. 

And let's not forget about the seriously over-bloated military budget which dwarfs every other country in the world by a huge margin. I was in the Air Force - and trust me - they don't need that much money. The use-it-or-lose-it system they use for budgeting purposes in seriously flawed and winds up costing US taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary expenditures. For example - our squadron got new office furniture EVERY single year. Did we need it? Of course not! There was nothing wrong with the old stuff. But the squadron commanders had to spend the money they were budgeted somehow - otherwise, if they didn't, their budget would go under review and they would likely receive a somewhat smaller budget amount in the next fiscal year. This IS how the system is supposed to work - but it's not in human nature to trade something of higher value for something of lower value. So the squadron/flight/unit/etc commanders wind up wasting money on bullshit they don't need every single year in order to make sure their budgets won't be reduced. Now - imagine every Unit Commander/Captain/Colonel/etc. in every branch of the US Military doing the exact same thing every year - and it's very easy to see how and why our Military's budget got so large and over-bloated.",1587062915,fnm0fnc

The government should be doing way more to help the people who are out of work than just a one time $1200 check that's not going to last one cycle of bills for most people (if it even covers that). We need affordable healthcare for all so people don't have to worry about how they are going to be able to pay for it. People out of work need guaranteed monthly income. Rent AND mortgage should be suspended.

Those things should have been done. Instead we have senators, congressmen/ women finding out about the disease before the public, dumping stock and buying stock in healthcare and medical supplies. We have the Speaker of the House on late night shows showing off her two $11,000 refrigerators and freezer with over one hundred dollars of ice cream. We have celebrities quarantined in their mansions singing songs to people, while the ""essentials"" risk exposure/ transmission, and former workers sit idle wondering how their going to be able to make it until the end of the month or even week.

I'm not saying a fuck you to the people who want to go back to work, who need to go back to work to survive. I'm saying fuck you to the rich who want to rush the economy back to work so they can start making (stealing) money. I'm saying fuck you to the president who wants the economy back up to increase his election chances at the detriment of the poorest and most vulnerable people of the country.

I'm sick and tired of the bullshit going on in this country. Did you know while most people got $1200, people who made over $1 million got a $1.7 million dollar stimulus? We're getting fucked over by the elite, the rich, the bourgeois. Do you not realize that? ""We need to be back to work"". Of course, but the system in place cannot handle more people getting sick.

Benefits of Recycling

1Reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators

2Conserves natural resources such as timber, water and minerals

3Increases economic security by tapping a domestic source of materials

4Prevents pollution by reducing the need to collect new raw materials
Saves energy

4Supports American manufacturing and conserves valuable resources

5Helps create jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries in the United States

Ready?

1.no.the volume is the same or increases.  Because cardboard and paper are not sold, they go to the landfill anyway.

2.increases the amount of natural resources (energy) to process the excess and useless waste.

Until then, you’re simply sulking because it has been shown that the benefits of the city recycling program are exposed as a lie.

Welcome to real life 101.

Until then, keep safe, and learn that if you recycle cardboard and paper, you are costing your city money.

Economics?  I took it in college.

And unlike the city of oxford, when I encounter a half million dollar loss, I quickly evaluate the necessity to keep it.  

You stop.  Wait for the market to recover, then you reinstate it.  Unless, of course, you are gaming the system and getting federal tax dollars to operate the program.  The feds, who lack all economic sense, will pay billions for leftist tax pay to feel good.

And be glad you aren’t in California where you are fined for not recycling.  Meaning, the state will force cities and businesses to sustain losses because “recycling makes the guv feels gud”.

How idiotic is that!  No wonder Waste Connections, a landfill and recycling company, moved to Texas years ago.



So, let’s make you mayor of oxford:  do you continue to recycle garbage even though it’s a money losing program and the less expensive alternative is to tell residents to recycle cans only and put cardboard/paper in the regular trash!  You know, because you already have contracts to handle those?

1. How was I complaining about ""getting fucked by Big Pharma""? Expensive or not, it was Big Pharma that created the drug that didn't exist a decade ago, and so people like me had to just suffer.  No, I'm not complaining, I'm on my knees thanking God for the good fortune to be born at a time and in a place where I have access to this medication, and for the brilliant scientists employed by Big Pharma who dedicate their careers to finding ways to treat or even cure people like you and me.
2. I do have a gripe about the all-too-cozy relationship between the federal agency that oversees all drug companies and the companies themselves.  But that's a complex topic because of the combination of good and bad that this coziness results in.  It's also much more of a problem with the independence of bureaucracy that Max Weber studied and wrote so much about, political partisanship and ideology have very, very little to do with it.
3. I've been trying to help a friend who owns a small business in a nearby small town with his EIDL loan, and today found out that there's no more money unless and until Congress stops screwing around.  They are screwing around because of politics, they have the ""never waste a crisis"" mentality.  Meanwhile my buddy has zero income, and it will take a very long time for his business to recover.  He's scared, his entire family is scared, and hurting.  All because you SEL's want to shut down everything completely and indefinitely.  Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you are simply being irrationally scared, that goes with the SEL territory, but I'm also sure a lot of you simply want to wreck the Trump economy to get rid of him, and to wreck the entire US economy because you can then finally reduce us to a third world socialist train wreck because that's what we deserve, right?  That's how America can finally atone for all her many sins, by being taken down not just a notch or two, but completely destroyed.  So, am I getting warm here?

If I remember correctly he is quite progressive. What about him makes you think he can overcome that? I ask this question not because I don't like his progressiveness, but because I imagine that will be a huge red flag for a bunch of Mississippi voters.

In a somewhat similar scenario, Jeramey Anderson ran for the House of Representatives on the coast against Palazzo. Anderson is also a young, black, progressive candidate. He got beat pretty handily, something like 60% Palazzo to 30% Anderson. If you're not familiar with Palazzo all you need to know is that he never responds to any sort of communication, doesn't show up to town hall meetings, and is a big supporter of Trump. There were Republicans that I had talked to that mentioned how much they hate him and that he is worthless.

1813,1813,sanswaffles,"I’m coming in a little late, but still thought I’d share. I’m from the western Midwest. I’ve had average seasonal allergies my whole life and had MILD exercise induced asthma. So, otc antihistamines when I felt like it in spring &amp; harvest and no need for an inhaler. 

I’m not in the delta, but since moving to MS my allergies have been more severe and I now have to carry a rescue inhaler.  After about a year of suffering and URTIs, I finally saw a specialist and he put me on a daily year round allergy med. Works like a dream when I actually take it consistently.   My issues ended up being due to the native tree pollen that coats everything along with the mold. There’s frequently a ton outdoor mold. 

Not really a helpful comment for you beyond saying you’re not crazy, and I think it’d be worth looking into a prescription medication to manage your allergies if Doc agrees. 

I also do as the other poster suggested - Control my home’s humidity and have multiple air purifiers in the house to help with air quality.",1587186452,fnred5x

Despite numbers blowing up, LA took decently quick action and put restrictions up relatively early (especially around New Orleans) and placed the state under a stay at home order about a week after the first case was found. Additionally, they ramped up testing and were top 5 states in testing per capita.

It’s been funny to see how naive and self absorbed are during this thing. 
People -
“OMG were not social distancing enough, it’s not working, this is never going to end because nobody is taking this seriously, we’re a failure of a state “
Other people 
“But the number of deaths projected nationwide went from 2-3 million a few weeks ago to 60-70k now, so if social distancing isn’t really being done right then there’s no real reason for these lockdowns

“Oh those numbers only went down because social distancing is working”

Here's what I, a former intelligence analyst and current private investigator, see when I look at this: 

The first screenshot is from the iMessage app. The second is taken from a completely different messaging app. 

The first screenshot is from a number that is in the phone book, the second is from a number that isn't.

So unless the teacher sent the first message and then pulled out a second phone and messaged the parent through a completely different messaging system, the parent took the first screenshot and then messaged themselves through Google voice or some other app and then took the screenshot.

If you look at the second screenshot, you can see that there are no messages above it, meaning it's the first message that has been sent from that number to the parent.",1587239324,fntd8fy

1849,1849,mostnoblearchon,"Actually, after reviewing I disagree and think these are real. It appears that the first picture (on the left) is a screenshot from the teacher’s phone of her conversation with the parent. That’s why the perspective is flipped. When the teacher went to send the message “She isn’t too smart...” to her teacher friend, she included the screenshot on the left along with her message. Instead, the message and the screenshot of the parent-teacher conversation got sent to the parent. It appears that the teacher has the parents name saved in her phone book (as displayed at the top of the screenshot on the left) but the parent does not have the teacher’s contact information saved. The difference in messaging apps is because the first screenshot is from the teacher’s phone / perspective (she might not be using the same messaging app as the parent). 

It’s at least not fake for the reasons you listed.",1587240156,fntepii
