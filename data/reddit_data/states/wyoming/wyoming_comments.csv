First, I don't know if OP has a lawyer. Talking to someone about a legal matter when they are represented by another lawyer is a big no-no.

Next, If I start giving advice to someone, it means I'm treating them like a client which means, for all practical purposes, they are a client of mine. Under the rules, I have duties to clients. These include duties of diligence, communication, and giving good advice. I can't fulfill these duties to someone I only know through a reddit comment. 

I also have an ethical duty to not represent clients that have conflicts of interest. I don't know OP, so I can't check if I represent someone that has conflicting interests with OP.

It's probably not a big deal if I help OP wind up his company. But it might end up being a big deal. That's why I'm careful. I feel safe giving information so long as I'm not saying or implying someone should or shouldn't do something.",1577833491,fcoj3vv

34,MightyBobBarker,"I would love it if I could give personal advice to everyone that came to me with legal problems. The trouble is my personal advice is professional advice because I'm a professional.

I still try to help the best I can. Most lawyers just cut off the conversation when someone asks for help with a legal problem. I help, but make sure I draw the line short of telling people what they should do. I supply people with missing puzzle pieces, but I don't help them put the puzzle together, and I don't tell them what the picture is on the puzzle.

For example, I'm a personal injury lawyer. I get a lot of calls from people asking about offers from insurance companies after a car accident.

""They offered me $500. Should I take it?""

If they aren't my client, I can't say ""No, you shouldn't take that. That would be stupid."" I tell them that I can't advise them whether they should take an offer or not because I'm not their lawyer.

But I can say, ""Here's how I calculate the value of a bodily injury claim for my clients..."" They can do the math in their heads and come to their own conclusion based on their own circumstances.

Like I did with OP, I can help someone get all the facts they need to make a decision. But I can't make the decision for them or tell them what decision they should make unless we have some kind of written agreement.

If we don't have a contract and I start giving advice, I'm ethically bound to represent them as their attorney and I'm probably never getting paid for my services since we don't have a contract. I have to diligently help them finish putting together the puzzle no matter how big it is. And that's best case scenario. 

Worst case scenario, I give advice and don't realize the person now thinks I'm his or her lawyer. Then, when it comes to the Supreme Court's attention that I haven't fulfilled my obligations to my client (who legally and ethically is my client because I gave advice to them), I can get suspended and/or pay hefty fines because the puzzle is missing 250 pieces and scattered all over the floor.

And that's why a good lawyer won't give you advice unless you pay them or have an agreement to pay them later. Most people will be able to put the puzzle together themselves and be just fine, but it only takes one person to dump the puzzle down the toilet and blame it on you to ruin your life.",1577844369,fcoxlee

The wind is much less than Wyoming but high winds are a problem here due to all the pine trees that are not used to dealing  with high winds. They don't root very deep so anything gusting above 20mph starts blowing trees over. We had a wind storm a few years ago with winds gusting over 60mph and it looked like Armageddon. Entire sections of the forest were flattened and trees were falling on houses, cars, highways, pretty much everywhere. There is a lot more to do here but if you want solitude that's easy to find too. I'm not sure where you live in Washington but if you want a good idea of what Wyoming will be like..hang around Vantage for a while.

you also can go to Cheyenne frontier days. Less outdoorsy but it is a city wide festival in the summer, with redos, a small carnival (not as much as the east coast), and concerts at night. Loads of Native American and western activities to do on the side.

A popular brewery is currently being constructed making a total of 3-4? And a new distillery recently opened that serves amazing drinks. All the younger amenities you see in larger cities are slowly forming in the downtown area. The mall north of town is slowly dying which is a good sign that downtown will potentially see a boom.  Also, the West Edge project is slowly making moves in revitalizing the western part of downtown. Big things are slowly but definitely happening.

It wasn't until I moved to the Northern Colorado area 14 years ago that I really embraced day-to-day outdoor activities like biking to work year-round due to the well maintained bicycle lanes and multi-use paths and general awareness that motorists have of cyclists. Say what you want, but the cycling, hiking, and pedestrian infrastructure of the Front Range is great and a huge reason that people cite when moving here.

I would imagine that funding, size of the state/low population, and absence of initiative from city officials are the main reasons for poor pedestrian and cyclist safety in Wyoming.

&gt; An agreement signed in 2016 called on the wild sheep group to pay $14,000 for water infrastructure for the stock in the Blondy Pass pasture — a place separated from the bighorns. At that point the Hay Creek sheep herd had swollen to 1,500 head, Kilpatrick wrote — triple the initial stocking of 500.

197,CORedhawk,"That was an interesting article on a very complex situation.  The issue really is domestic human habitation, next to wildlife.  I don't live in the area, but have worked with both the BLM and with local landowners, and have found that both are very hard headed, and ""I want it my way and that is the only way"".  The BLM of course can point to rules and regulations that they write, and then say ""we have these rules"" (again, which they made).  

My personal opinion, is the BLM needs to regulate the type of domestic animals and to regulate the size and area areas of their wild herds.  Regulating domestic animals on private land, won't be popular but governments dictate land use all over the US.  For example I can't build a gas station, here in the middle of a suburban neighborhood.  

I've never understood the payment of the loss of private owned domestic livestock to wild animals.  of course cougars, and wolves and grizzlies will feed on domestic sheep instead of wild elk.  But isn't that the cost of doing business and having a ranch where there are lots of big predators? But if a grizzly were on private land and threatening a human or my animals, I think it would be fair to kill that grizzly too, with proper notification to wildlife management.....I don't mean extermination hunts, but limited protection...that would shape the predators range I would think.......But what do I know, I have no degrees in this area)",1578331396,fde54ul

For breakfast I would say you have a few options. R&amp;B breakfast club is probably the best 'home town' feel in Cheyenne. Epic Egg is solid but I wouldn't really say it represents the culture here. Almost everything else is a chain. There are a ton of chain foods here. 

For lunch I think you almost have to go to Little Philly. They're a strange east coast shop that has been in Cheyenne for decades. If we have an institution, they're it. Mondellos is very good if you're wanting authentic pizza, they've been around forever as well. There are a handful of places downtown as well but in my opinion they open and close with such frequency that you don't really get a feel for 'local' food. But they are tasty. 

Dinner.... Hmmmm. T-Joes is good but a bit out of town, same with Little Bear. If you enjoy Mexican, Tortilla Factory on South Greeley is solid (don't go to the one on the north side of town).

States can legislate these costs for people insured by state insurance programs, like state employees, but not people with private insurance plans. Similarly the federal government can legislate costs for people with federal insurance and those under Federal medicaid/medicare.

Wyoming’s idea was to request to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) that Wyoming residents be given Medicaid coverage solely for the potential need of air ambulance service. This way prices could be lowered due to Federal price caps under medicaid coverage, thus the patient wouldn’t get hit by a surprise bill if the helicopter that arrived at an emergency was an out-of-network provider.

The CMS rejected this request saying it was contrary to medicaid’s mission, wouldn’t fit the budget, and didn’t work with existing federal law.",1579302952,feooajp

YEAH. the role it'll play is... staying in the fucking ground, and putting back what has been taken out :)

These lawsuits continue to be an ASININE waste of Wyoming's tax payer money.  As with Matt Mediocre Mead, this ""fight"" is absolutely futile. It is at best, purely busy work for staff and just gives the governor something to posture about. The west coast does not want this, and it will never happen. It's not even up for discussion, the answer has always been no. Bottom line is, Wyoming is landlocked and therefore has no sway, zero clout, no say whatsoever in coastal waters anywhere.

One was even curled up in a bush outside the home she belonged to (I had knocked on the door asking if they knew if anyone in the neighborhood had lost a cat and it turned out she was theirs.) I can only imagine the mortality rate when you factor in wild animals and cars as well.

I am begging you, do not get cats and keep them indoor/outdoor. There's many reasons why most shelters won't adopt them out unless you sign a form saying you'll keep them inside. The health and safety of your cat is just one of the issues.

I have a strictly indoor cat and he's happy as a clam. If you're worried, make sure they have plenty of enrichment in their environment, and given them attention when you are home. Since you are getting two, they should also be able to entertain each other. It is far crueler to submit your cat to the dangers of being outdoors than to keep them safe in an enriching indoor environment.",1580266214,ffvkfvi

722,kahnwiley,"Wyoming = Wind. I grew up in Cheyenne, and lived in Laramie (30 miles or so from Medicine Bow) for 12 years. I've lived in Wyoming my whole life. Little known fact: the [Big Hollow Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Hollow_(Wyoming)) west of Laramie (on the way to Med Bow) is the second-largest wind basin in the world, and the largest in North America. And yes, it is effing windy.

When camping, I usually weigh my tents down with rocks and extra gear just to make sure it doesn't blow away when I'm not inside. There can be some pretty intense gusts that may actually break cheap tent poles. I also am usually cautious about setting up the rainfly unless absolutely necessary because that is the most common item to go sailing in the wonderful Wyoming wind, never to be seen again. . . or (even better), flying into your campfire area and creating a fire hazard.

When are you planning to go camping? Snowy Range Pass is closed during the winter/early spring, so you would have to be south of that area before the end of May. Honestly, camping up there this time of year can be fairly treacherous and it's not just the wind. . . Some friends of mine and I went to a cabin in the woods in May a few years back on a clear sunny day; when we awoke in the morning it had snowed over two feet in the night and we were stranded more than 30 miles outside of town with only a couple days' worth of MRE's to eat. We got VERY lucky. . . got stuck five miles up the road after the food ran out and just happened to run into an old man on a Cat who cleared the entire road back to the highway for us (and was none too pleased about the stupid college kids who got stuck on his dirt road).

It may or may not change how they vote or if they vote but I find that people who stick to primary talking points generally are not well received.

Example:
In the next election there are so many factors that are outside of any one persons control I tend to take a narrow approach and say whats the one thing I like about this person that I support.

Elizabeth Warren: Removal of Student Loan Debt. What is the likelyhood this could occur? If it has to go through a democratic controlled congress I would estimate high. Split congress I would say low. Is there opportunity through current regulation or executive action? I read an interpretation that the regulation currently exists in the capabilities of the Sec of Ed. Do I think this is probable and why? Yes, because I have seen crazier shit happen through regulation and executive action over the last 20 years. So this is something I like about Warren. Do I agree with all of her policies? Probably not.

Donald Trump: Strong Economy. What is the likelyhood the economy would remain strong under a second President Trump term? Do I believe the current government has exhausted or nearly exhausted their capability to prevent the slowing of the economy? I believe the Tramp tax cuts setting businesses at 21% tax rate were supposed to create growth of 3% GDP. That has not occured. The FED Reserve has decreased interest rates to bolster our economy from slowing and still hasnt hit the growth target. I think and I am hopeful our economy stays strong but based on this I am wary that these actions will not last for 4 years. I would be inclined to vote for a second term with strong indication that the economy would remain string through a second term.

I think Wyoming is a state that could go Democratic maybe not in the next year but in the course of 10 years I think it could move comparable to how some parts of Texas have. I have found by doing more than piecemealing talking points into a political conversation you usually get decent results. 

For reference, based on how I look at Politics, I am likely to vote democratic in the next election unless the candidate is Joe Biden or Tulsi Gabbard. If they were the candidate I would vote for President Trump. Of course this is a snapshot in time of my view.

Honestly, I think if someone good, not based on money, or power, or last name. Were to run for the house the house could be taken this year from Cheney democrat or republican.

989,TNT-1985,"Wyoming is a right to work state.  However, there is a teacher employment law that grants additional protections to certified teachers in all school districts.  

“Continuing Contract” is the term in the state statutes.  Not exactly the same as “tenure,” but similar.  Upon being rehired for your 4th contract in the same school district, you receive a “continuing contract.”  From that point on, administration has to document cause for you to be let go.  Otherwise, you are automatically given a new contract each subsequent year.  During your first three years, any reason, or no reason at all, is required for a simple non-renewal.  

How districts treat their staff is radically different from district to district.  Some districts play fast and loose with the continuing contracts, giving teachers really no genuine protection.  You’re simply at the mercy of the superintendent and his administrators/principals.  

In other districts, given a shortage of applicants and high turnover, teacher protection via continuing contract is meaningful, and most staff are treated as professionals and valuable assets.  It just depends on where you go!",1580702613,fgelo32

""Wyoming is a filing date priority jurisdiction. Which means a mortgage properly recorded in the county clerk’s office provides notice to subsequent purchasers and takes precedence over later conveyances. In most other states (almost all of them) there is an equitable exception to this “first in time” statutory provision. The doctrine is called equitable subrogation. 

Equitable subrogation permits “a person who pays off an encumbrance to assume the same priority position as the holder of the previous encumbrance.” (86 F. 3D 890). 

In legal matters there are positions of law called Restatements. Restatements are essentially the academic advisings of legal scholars. However the law in a common law system, as ours is, is set by precedent. Often times a court is unwilling to adopt a restatement that opposes the precedent set in the past. There is a Restatement 7.6(a)(4) of the Restatement (3rd) of Property that addresses equitable subrogation. 

Wyoming has a case called, Countrywide Home Loans v. First National Bank (144 P. 3D 1224). The case dealt with the issue of equitable subrogation, the Wyoming Supreme Court declined to adopt the restatement (a growing amount of states in the United States have adopted the modern Restatement approach) because “\[The Wyo. Supreme Court is\] charged with the duty of giving effect to the statutes our legislature has enacted... Although Countrywide makes the policy argument that equitable subrogation will make refinancing more readily available to the public and thereby, serves the public interest, those arguments are properly directed to the legislature.” In essence the Supreme Court is saying, “our laws in this issue are archaic and it is not the judiciary that can fix them, laws are made by the legislature and only interpreted by the judiciary.”

I can not think of a reason why we shouldn’t modernize our system and come in line with the majority of the country. We ought to make it as easy and inexpensive

to refinance our homes as possible. The laws that are in place now disincentivized lenders because there is such an uncertainty around priority in Wyoming real estate law. That uncertainty is bad for business and banks have to reflect that uncertainty in their interest rates to compensate for the unnecessary risk our antiquated system imposes. """,1581020557,fgq9xe2

Perhaps gas transportation is more expensive but the lower material cost of the gas added to that is still cheaper than coal plus it's transportation costs?  I don't know, but I keep hearing how gas is cheaper for the energy plants providing us electricity so I would assume what they care about is the overall cost and not only coal versus gas. Either way, not that many people are employed by the mines as a percentage of our population, it is not clean, and we have miles and miles and miles of areas suitable for wind and solar even if they don't employ a great deal of people.

1265,VerisimilitudinousAI,"Why? the demographics of our country are much more similar to our neighbors.

Lets look at Europe then. nearly a third of all people living in Switzerland own a firearm (similar to US), yet it's murder rate is among the lowest in the world. Why? because it has a homogeneous culture, where 70% of the people are from Swiss heritage (and nearly everyone else is from other European countries). The gaps in income and social status are much smaller.

The US has 1000% more immigration than any other country, and we give citizenship rights to foreign children born here. Our culture is the most diverse in the world, and that creates conflicts and inequality. The majority of these immigrants come from our neighbors to the south, so I'd say that comparing us to other American countries is extremely relevant. 

The majority of the world's population lives in countries with a higher murder rate than the US. Even in the US, there are states that have more homogeneous populations (like Wyoming), similar to Europe and Asia, and guess what? Their murder rates are a fraction of the US average. 

Now take Puerto Rico, nearly the lowest gun ownership in the US, yet it has the highest murder rate.

For every 1 percent increase in gun ownership, there was a 1.1 percent increase in the firearm homicide rate and a 0.7 percent increase in the total homicide rate. This was after controlling for factors such as poverty, unemployment, income inequality, alcohol consumption, and nonhomicide violent crime. Further, the firearm ownership rate had no statistically significant impact on nonfirearm homicides, meaning there was no detectable substitution effect. That is, in the absence of guns, would-be criminals are not switching to knives or some other weapons to carry out homicide. 

Hunters accidentally shoot about 1000 people a year, roughly 50 times more than terrorists. About 500 people a year are killed by mass shooters. But these numbers fluctuate rapidly.

From the article: ""The legislation would not repeal gun-free zones in courtrooms or on private property but **would eliminate such zones in governmental meetings (including the legislature), schools, colleges and many other venues where firearms are currently prohibited.""**

The problem is guns being allowed in public places such as schools and government buildings. Not every gun owner is responsible, not every gun owner is trained. Do I want someone who doesn't properly holster their weapon and doesn't keep his safety on in a school? Are there *any* base assurances that gun owners who enter these public places will be educated about their weapon? Any tests? Any permits?

They’re in the bottom right corner of the square, some say it’s not the actual wyoming experience or it’s wyoming easy mode but it’s still really cold, really windy, and gets hit with a ton of white out blizzards. It’s not uncommon to be getting snow into April. Living in wyoming is tough, but it’s cheap and you can find value in it if you look. Road tripping the state in the summer can be really fun, just don’t go down 1-80, it’s the most boring drive in the USA. But if you go north we have stuff like Yellowstone which is actually cooler than you can imagine, we also have devils tower which is a super cool and unique feature of the landscape. We also have really good skiing, which you can do in the Jackson area in the Rockies on the western part of the state, which is also a really beautiful area, for reference the album cover of Kanye wests album Ye is from that area. If you live in the south east you have to go hiking in veedawoo, it’s one of the most underrated spots in the state and is someplace you gotta try camping at in the summer, it’s a lot of fun. I would also recommend you look up all the stuff I talked about in here to see if it’s for you. Oh and look up what the state aesthetic is, cause I’m gonna say it, 90% of the state is not pleasant to look at. It’s an industry state where not a lot grows. But if you find the spots that are beautiful, they’re some of the most breath taking places in the US. But if you don’t like looking at an ugly place, maybe wyoming isn’t for you. It’s really nice in the Yellowstone and Jackson areas but the rest of the state is mostly a yellowish brown color with tons of dead looking plain grass and not a lot of green. So do your research and keep in mind we’re one of the less diverse places in the US and if that’s important to you then this might not be your place... almost everyone here is super nice and welcoming, but I don’t think anyone would deny we have some assholes.

Are you looking to move to a city? There aren't many to choose from: Cody, Casper, Jackson, Rock Springs/Green River, Laramie, Gillette, Sheridan, Cheyenne. Each has their own flavor, but out of the list, I'd say Laramie, Cody, Jackson, and Cheyenne have the most distinctive Wyomingness to them. (Other people will have their own preferences, no doubt.)

Most cities in Wyoming are industrial or post-industrial towns, Gillette and Casper especially. If you're outdoorsy and don't mind traveling a bit to get out into nature, you really can't go wrong, but beware cities that offer the worst of American culture (consumerism, post-industrial rot).

Jackson is a city in a beautiful landscape, but it might be the least authentic place you'll find in the state. It's extremely expensive (Teton County is frequently the richest county per capita in the country, richer even than Manhattan) and most of the people there are extremely wealthy or just passing through. It's a hard place to make friends if you're older than 30, don't have a shit-ton of money, and your entire life doesn't revolve around skiing or drinking.

Wyoming can be a harsh place, though I guess it all depends on what you’re into. As many others have pointed out, the winters are long, the wind never seems to stop blowing, and yellow-brown sagebrush seem to outnumber trees. Overall the state leans very heavily conservative/religious in their political values, social activities and events are quite limited, especially as an adult unless you belong to a church or have kids, and whatever nightlife exists (at least in the SW corner) basically boils down to a few shitty bars, the movie theater, or walking around Wal-Mart.

There are some nice outdoor locations and activities to be had, but nothing that you couldn’t do in a state like Colorado, Montana, Utah, or Idaho (though you must visit Jackson-what a beautiful town.) You’ll benefit from owing a truck or just a vehicle in general if you want to explore the Wyoming outdoors. Public transportation is nearly non-existent and the state is one of the more dangerous places for alternative transportation like bicycles. You won’t even see many pedestrians or people outside walking.

I’ve been browsing this Reddit lately as my wife’s about to complete her Master’s in Education and there’s a possibility she could get a job in Cheyenne. Housing costs appear to be lower than Fort Collins (it’s only getting more expensive here) but that’s about the closest I could tolerate to live in Wyoming again. It’s certainly not for everyone, there’s a reason it’s the least populated state in the US. But you may enjoy it, I still have friends who happily live there.",1581736652,fhnzf2r

I used to have to grind through a sheet of ice to clean my glass every morning. My doors and lock cylinders iced shut all the time. We don't use melting salt which makes winter that much more pleasant for your clothes, shoes, and your vehicle. I used to constantly empty my windshield washer fluid from having to repeatledly rinse the salty slush spray that blinds you from seeing out of the windshield as I drove through congested 6 lane interstates. But Jeeze, it's really about the sun. It feels so damn good here, no matter how many feet of snow we've got on the ground once that sun comes out. I went home to the Midwest for 2 weeks this January.

Drying and canning is good to have knowledge of; we’ve always had excess of those crops and since the growing season is short, we eat off them all winter and spring.

For veterinarians there's not alot of high end small animal hospitals, but lots of farm vets that need a hand (on that note, most people that I know also bring their small animals to the farm vets as they know the vets will give them a not bullshit rundown of what's going on and will think of the animals life  before recommending long painful surgeries or treatment plans that only delay the inevitable, such as cancer).

1823,FoxOneFire,"Congressional rules empower all its standing committees with the authority to compel witnesses to produce testimony and documents for subjects under its jurisdiction. Committee rules may provide for the full committee to issue a subpoena, or permit subcommittees or the chairman (acting alone or with the ranking member) to issue subpoenas.

As announced in Wilkinson v. United States, a Congressional committee must meet three requirements for its subpoenas to be ""legally sufficient."" First, the committee's investigation of the broad subject area must be authorized by its chamber; second, the investigation must pursue ""a valid legislative purpose"" but does not need to involve legislation and does not need to specify the ultimate intent of Congress; and third, the specific inquiries must be pertinent to the subject matter area that has been authorized for investigation.

The Court held in Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund
that Congressional subpoenas are within the scope of the Speech and Debate clause which provides ""an absolute bar to judicial interference"" once it is determined that Members are acting within the ""legitimate legislative sphere"" with such compulsory process. Under that ruling, courts generally do not hear motions to quash Congressional subpoenas; even when executive branch officials refuse to comply, courts tend to rule that such matters are ""political questions"" unsuitable for judicial remedy. In fact, many legal rights usually associated with a judicial subpoena do not apply to a Congressional subpoena. For example, attorney-client privilege and information that is normally protected under the Trade Secrets Act do not need to be recognized",1582310346,fiaxhnt

Also star valley ranch is about 1 1/2 hours (64ish miles) from jackson Hole. Your best bet is to spend the money on gas and a pass into Yellowstone.

2001,Nickfurysothereye,"I'm from the Sweetwater County area and I love it. Mechanics are always needed. In fact my father opened up his own shop here. Our area of the state runs off the mines. Coal, gas and trona. Infact sweetwater county is the worlds largest supply of Trona (baking soda, its in everything). Now if your man got on with any mine here he'd start out at about $20 hr. There are 3 or 4 animal clinics here and almost all deal with livestock.

Now as for restaurants in rock springs we have 1 taco bell, 2 McDonald's, 1 papa Murphy's, 3 subways, to many fucking Chinese places (not even 1 is a chain), 2 taco times, 1 taco johns, we had a local burger joint like 5 guys but it closed. 1 dennys, 1 old Chicago, 2 pizza huts, 1 dominos. No we dont have a chip fa la. But we have some bomb ass local restaurants. We're not too much of fans of corporate companies so we have nock of versions of places. Like fozen yogurt, we also got a smoothie place.

For groceries we have Wal-Mart, smiths and Albertsons. Now for clothing we have tj max, Ross, rue 21, Maurice's, 1 athletic store, murdocks, boot barn, Sally's (cosmetic), 

Now for supplies we have home depot, wyoming work wear, snap on truck, and more.

Hunting and fishing is huge here. We have a couple of locally owned gun shops and a sportman warehouse. A 30 minutes drive will get you to the flaming gorge firehole area. Or drive down 45 minutes more to the flaming goerge dam. Or just fish in the middle of town in green river. Or go to one of the many surounding lakes. If you like hunting i can assure you your boss will be more than understanding if you need a day off of work to get the perfect deer.

We also have a rec center that you can pay a monthly $55 or daily pass $6 that gives you access to a running track, 4 basketball courts, ice Arena, tons of gym equipment, 5 racquetball courts, lap pool, pool rock climbing wall, 2 huge pool slides, lazy river, hot tubs, and there's hot tubs in locker rooms along with saunas. All of this is all indoors, yes even the pool. Why? Because the wind blows here almost all the time and it can snow from early October till june. 

Speaking of weather. Its harsh. Winters are long and harsh. 4×4 or really good snow tires are a must. If you are a person who likes to travel during the winter just know that sometimes the interstate can spontaneously close. Even if there's no snow we can get hurricane speed winds here. So dont be surprised when you see 2,000 turcks parked all over town. And summers are hella hot, so hot it got to 99 degrees once. 

If you are looking to continue your education once you become a wyoming resident in state tuition is hella cheap. I myself only spent 10,000 on my accociates degree.

My husband and i have serious health issues and the doctors at our hospital are decent and the hospital has life flight to University Of Utah. Now with that being said. If you need a specialist for certain things you may have to drive about 3 hours to utah. If you live anywhere up north your options as i have found are limited.

The people here. You have your rotten few but you wouldn't burn a whole apple farm for 1 bad Apple. Some of the best things about this state is people care for people. One mom was in serious need of Formula and diapers for her baby and within 3 hours of her posting on one of the community pages she had enough Formula and diapers to last her a couple of months. If your truck brakes down while your out driving in the desert theres a group of jeep and truck people that will come and help you. I know a kid that found out that her coworker had no cash left for groceries because her roommate got laid off and they had to spend the rest on rent so this kid went and got them enough food for 2 weeks. People here are mostly family oriented. It's normal to see young married couples. And 9 times outa 10 the parents are supportive. Such as my husband and i got married at 19 and 22. And having kids young (20-25) is normal here too. 

Last but not least. If you live anywhere in this lovely state I hope you like to drive. Oh also we have a small airport. It only has like 2 flights a day but it will get you to salt lake city or denver.",1582538282,fimnaap

If you're hoping for a cheap spring break, this ain't it.  Like most people have said, Jackson is primo expensivo right now.  It's ski season and all the hotel prices are jacked up.  

A day pass for the Mountain Resort to ski is now $180.  Unreal.  (Look on [Wyoming.craigslist.org](https://Wyoming.craigslist.org) or ebay for people selling day passes for a huge discount if you want to ski.)  If you had a car you could easily putz around and find entertainment, but it will get repetitive.

How are you getting to Star Valley without a vehicle?  Flying into Jackson?  If you're flying in to Jackson it makes no sense for you to trek all the way out to Star Valley Ranch.  It's about an hour to 1.5 hour drive depending on the weather.  Definitely don't want to do that after a night of drinking.

You're not going to find ANY super cheap accommodations in Jackson right now.  The two places I would recommend that are probably the cheapest are the Motel 6 (not close to downtown, but Jackson has a bus system and lyft) and the Antler Inn, which are probably around $90/night.  The Antler is downtown near the square.  Easy to walk around to everything AND it's got a great big hot tub.  

Depending on your timing (you left a ton of details out that would have helped people make suggestions) you may be there during the \[Rendezvous Fest\]9[https://www.jacksonhole.com/rendezvous.html](https://www.jacksonhole.com/rendezvous.html)) which has a ton of free events and concerts.

But, depending where you're coming from, I'd suggest your group just hop in someone's car and drive to the nearest big city to your location.  Find a cheap Air BNB and just party that way.  Take in the culture during the day and bar hop at night.  Jackson ain't gonna be cheap for you, no matter how you try to swing it.",1582672741,firwxty

&amp;#x200B;

From Wiki..  Pretty much eh story I heard in Wyo hist. 

""Etymology of the town's name\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chugwater,_Wyoming&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5)\]

Some historians hold that the name ""Chugwater"" is derived from a [Mandan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandan) account of a [bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bison) hunt.  According to this narrative, a chief was disabled during the hunt and his son took charge of the hunt or ""[buffalo jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_jump)"".  Under his direction, hunters drove the bison over nearby cliffs; when the animals reached the ground below, a sound of ""chugging"" was heard by the hunters.  The story concludes with an etymology: since a stream was near the base of the cliffs, the site of the stampede has been called ""the place"" or ""water at the place where the buffalo chug.""",1582691223,fisrbju

2114,Buelldozer,"&gt; Wolf's really don't kill large animals like elk and moose that often.

Wolves kill and eat 16 to 22 Elk per wolf per year. In 2014 there were ~100 wolves in Yellowstone (officially) so that is something like 1600 to 2200 Elk per year. That's a pretty big number, especially when you consider it's additive, meaning that the Elk who died this year aren't around to make new ones for next year.

An Elk every 2 - 4 weeks counts as ""pretty often"" in my book.

&gt; A border war? Wyoming considers massive land, mineral rights purchase from oil company, which would spill over into Colorado
Purchase from Occidental Petroleum, which could be largest by government entity since U.S. bought Alaska, would raise a host of legal questions as it relates to Colorado acreage
By ALDO SVALDI | asvaldi@denverpost.com | The Denver PostMarch 8, 2020 at 6:00 a.m.

&gt; Wyoming is weighing a massive land and mineral rights purchase that could give it a piece of Colorado — actually, a lot of little pieces — along with a big straw to dip into the state’s oil and gas reserves.

&gt; And legal experts say there probably isn’t much Colorado can do to block that from happening. Welcome to a different kind of border war, one that isn’t about the annual football rivalry between Colorado State University and the University of Wyoming.

A negative flu test and a really good PA. If I had to make a wild guess, I would say they very recently got tests in and they are sick of seeing people who have it without being able to officially diagnose it.


&gt;What symptoms do you have?

Mid-grade fever for several days, cough, runny nose at the start, headache, massive lethargy, clicky ears, clicky throat, feel like I swallowed ground up glass. I also am having some difficulty breathing but I'm asthmatic so that's par for the course with any respiratory illness. My SpO2 is in the 90s, blood pressure is a little high for me, heart rate is also high but I'm also on adderall, have been coughing like a maniac, and have been using my albuterol liberally.

I did recently have a fungal infection that caused similar symptoms, so they also swabbed for that. I don't really care what the dx is as long as the symptoms eventually go away and I know if I can be around people or not.

&gt;Did you come in contact with a known case?  Did you travel.

Nope to both. My parents both traveled within the state and my mom was sick before me. She was tested yesterday too. They did not have contact with any people with confirmation.

Independent contractors, general 1099 workers, and small business owners themselves are a different story.  You have to opt in and pay in, and it's more expensive...therefore the vast majority do not have it.  Same reason most don't have Worker's Comp, or really anything beyond their general liability business insurance, for themselves.

Additionally, a LOT of service workers depend on tipped income, and we all know that hardly anyone claims all their tips (and a LOT of people don't claim any of them at all).  Now, obviously that's a separate debate to be had regarding whether they should or not, but the fact remains that it's a huge blow to their unemployment benefits (if they do get them).

And in communities like Jackson, Laramie, etc....ones whose literal lifeblood is rooted in service industry...when one business goes down, it affects other, related ones.  There's so many ways it trickles sideways and affects everyone.

So I'm legitimately concerned.  Unemployment benefits and tax breaks are not a cure-all.

vs

“Although Wyoming’s municipalities cover only 0.3% of its area, [68.3%](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-biggest-cities-in-wyoming.html) of the state's population lives in these urban centers.”

Your second point is shaky at best.  You're trying to draw a direct correlation between:

a) a sentiment without any actionable data points resulting from it (do you have data that specifically shows the negative respondants, individually, are acting accordingly (by specific actions)?  No.  No one does.); and

b) a separate data point whose premesis is based on already refuted methodology (AND whose weaknesses have been admitted by the data collectors themselves).

Lastly, refuting bad data and pointing out flaws in statistical analysis does not equate to ""excuses and denial"".

I will reiterate what I said earlier...we do have some idiots in this state, we're not perfect, etc. And there are certainly a number of valid data points I *am* concerned about. But this is not one of them, and I'm not going to have a freakout over skewed data.

The main highway closes a few times a year but if you live in Sheridan you honestly won't have much reason to be out when they close the highways. You can get run of the mill cable internet which I think is 100/10 mbit. There is constantly things to do outdoors when there isn't a virus threatening most of the population here. This is most definitely a retirement population and you will have to pay premium if you decide to move here.,1585344432,flos93c

* Sheridan is going to be *slightly* colder and have *slightly* more snow, but it's really not that much of a difference; maybe five degrees and a few more inches per year.
* Casper has more wind, no question.
* I couldn't speak for natural foods, but I know people in Sheridan go to Billings for Costco.  But Sheridan has a Walmart, Albertsons, Ridleys, etc.  Casper doesn't have a Costco either, although it does have a Sam's Club.
* My job requires me to look at the travel conditions of the state regularly, and I will say that the highways around Sheridan are probably closed more regularly than the roads around Casper.  The city roads of both towns are not closed as often as they should be, in my opinion.
* The internet I have in Casper is fine.  I couldn't speak for Sheridan.
* Sheridan is a retirement community, although it has its fair share of college town feels.  Casper has a lot of working lower to middle class, although there have been a lot of cool things that have opened in the last few years (breweries, new coffee shops, art walk, David Street Station).  
* In both places, you will endure nine months of winter to enjoy three months of summer.  Once summer hits, there's plenty to do.  Casper has a Alcova Lake about thirty minutes away, and the Platte river runs through the town.  Casper mountain also has a lot of great hiking, and if winter sports are your thing, there is a ski slope.

Solutions? For one, closing loopholes. Many highly profitable corporations don't pay taxes. Many still get subsidies. Sliding tax rates that rise with income more ad they used to. If the taxes make it less advantageous to creating massive hoarded wealth, some might actually trickle down for a change, and social programs can be cut because people make good wages and they pay more in taxes too.  Crack down on defense contractor cost overruns and delays and giant profiteering. There are many solutions but it requires wresting power over our government from the corporations.

Stay at Home order: Not Implemented

Non-Essential Business Closure: Not Implemented

This isn't entirely true, and ignores the fact that a great many non-essential businesses *have* been shut down or scaled back significantly.  Also, large public gatherings *have* been banned.  The current orders in place are very similar to the official ""stay at home"" orders that other states have (which have *numerous* exemptions as well).  They're just not being officially referred to as ""stay at home/SiP"" orders because they don't go the final step of barring people from going to the park.  Lol.

**Yes, it's debatable whether our orders go far enough, or are being enforced enough, etc.** (That's not a debate I want to get into with anyone right now.) But claiming absolutely nothing has been implemented is disingenuous and misleading (and is also frankly a slap in the face to those of us who have been shut down or scaled back, and the many, many people who are now unemployed or underemployed).  It doesn't tell the whole story and nitpicks at semantics.

Also:

-Travel severely limited

What does that mean (honest question)?

Cheyenne won't have air service after April 4th iirc, most other airports have seen a DRASTIC reduction in travel due to cancellations and restrictions from airlines or other destinations, and Federal commerce laws bar any state from closing its borders to another state (so not much we could do about that).  So I'm curious what that refers to, or what a state could do to change that status or address it?

He was assigned to live in the women-only dorms until he was able to secure a campus-operated apartment with another trans male. 

He sometimes feels targeted by people in the community, especially at gas stations. Lots of side-looks, but never people acting violent.

3515,WyoReloy1,"Three things to remember about the Wyoming Legislature, which may explain a lot of why we haven't passed anti-discrimination laws (so much for the ""equality state"":

1) As Wyoming is, effectively, a single party state, the Legislature is much more conservative than the State as a whole. That is even more true of the leadership.  The more liberal parts of the State (Albany and Teton Counties) vote Democrats who are in the minority to the extent that legislation can pass or fall - and their support is not even a factor. The other area that tends to vote Democrat, Sweetwater County, is much more of the ""labor rights"" wing of the Democratic party than the socially liberal part.

2) Over the last few years the Legislature has been gripped with dealing with limited revenue, so the State's finances have taken over most of the Legislature's time. They do not seem to want to deal with other, maybe controversial (at least here), issues. Coupled with Wyoming's limited time thy can meet in session, they have tended to punt on a lot of issues.

3) The last time I heard, the Wyoming Legislature's members are statistically older than counterparts around the country. This is partially due to the legislative calendar limiting participation mainly to people who can take time out in the middle of winter (so, retired folks and ranchers with enough help to feed while they are in Cheyenne). This also leads to a certain collective attitude toward LGBT issues which is growing more out of step with the State as a whole.",1585837661,fm7vjjo
3516,Crafty_Camper123,"There isn't much for anti-gay or trans laws that I know of. I feel like there is a lot more acceptance if you are gay than if you are trans. I have friends who were gay, and one who is recently trans. The trans friend basically got run out of town. This person was kind of an odd duck in their own right way before coming out as trans, so I'm not sure if it was more to do with their own personal life circumstances than actually being trans.  On the same  token, someone dear to me was going through a gender identity crisis and was identifying as trans. It didn't take them long to find a very supportive friend system and they are in a much smaller town than I am. (using they/them for anonymity) 

I would agree with others in that the main sentiment isn't so much anti- LGBTQ as it is not wanting to be told what we are supposed to like and support. (Speaking for others here/ generalizing. ) Like, it's fine you're gay or trans or whatever, but they don't have to like it, and they don't want to be a part of it. 

Wyoming just doesn't like being told what to do. It doesn't really matter what it is. If others are telling us it's a requirement, many will balk at it even if they didn't exactly disagree in the first place. Probably why we are last to enact many laws.",1585837878,fm7vwt7

Uinta county has 20,000 people.

Walmart has closed overnight hours.

Evanston doesn't exactly have a whole lot of retailers.

Even if people only go to the store once every week or two for essentials, there's still gonna be an awful lot of people there.  Especially if you add in the small percentage of people who *are* idiots....plus any traffic from I80 and Utah.

It's going to be that way even moreso in higher population counties.

It's simple math.

Sorry...I just see a lot of people kicking and screaming about how they anecdotally see ""so many"" people out, ""lItERaLlY nO oNe iS fOlLoWiNg tHe RuLes"", etc...and a lot of the time they're being disingenuous.

I, for one, have no idea why any given individual is out and about.  Considering there are almost 600,000 ""given individuals"" in this state, I'm not going to jump to conclusions about the general state of things.  I'm going to mind my own matters, take care of my family and my [currently fucked] business, and let the chips fall where they will.

To clarify: There are most certainly a lot of idiots in this state. And seeing people congregating at parks or whatever is different (and definitely infuriating).  But the whole ""I see this many people out"" in general or at stores is getting tiresome and just comes across as ""Karen"" ranting.  Feels like I'm gonna get glared at for even *thinking* about starting my truck some days.

Other than that, they're pretty aggressive/voracious and will take just about any bait they're offered. (I've had less luck with lures when it comes to perch.  Bait is what gets them going...particularly nightcrawlers, mealworms, and cut bait.)

&gt;Healthcare workers and first responders who provide direct patient care

Her symptoms started March 11th. She kept getting told by the dr she could only get a test if she needed to go to the hospital, but it wasn't that severe. So we have been self quarantining for 25 days, and we need to probably do it for at least another week since her symptoms stopped a week ago, to make sure our kids or I don't also have it. So we haven't seen our parents or really left the house. But it would be nice to know if we are now immune, or if any of us have it now. If she had it, she may have been infectious before the first symptoms. So our parents could have been at risk or others.

How can we make informed decisions unless we have as much information as possible? Thanks to the OP, I now know that the Dr wasn't the one to blame (I knew it wasn't).

To everyone who thinks this is trivial and we are overreacting, I have a coworker whose high school friend just died of this in DC, yes that is ""far away"" but half my graduating class lives out of state, and all of my family, except for my parents, live out of state. By the time this is done, the odds are someone we know who is alive now will will be dead.

3752,garbleflickle,Actually you can still get a test sent to a reference laboratory (depending on which ones are accepting).  WYPHL is the only lab under the state health department guidance.,1586189749,fmlnegb
3753,garbleflickle,"&gt;They're not testing people who have had close contact. 

Yes they are. They're not testing EVERYBODY who claims to have had close contact. They prioritize tests for individuals for whom a result will actually inform the course of treatment or have an impact on transmission to the public. 

&gt;They're not testing people with symptoms unless they're very sick.

That's because ""symptoms"" include anybody with mild allergies at this point. A positive test wouldn't inform any kind of treatment decisions (dont buy Tamiflu I guess) and they'd just end up being isolated at home anyway. So why use the test when you can use those resources on vulnerable people and healthcare workers?

&gt;They're telling people to go home and self quarantine . . .

As opposed to what? Sending them to the hospital? Jail? 

Folks with symptoms and contact are isolated in home away from family members OR if they cant then the family is quarantined as well. 

&gt;many who are quarantined dont comply.

3759,mtn_forester,"Overall, if you aren't testing widespread &amp; people with symptoms,  you aren't going to get a handle in the outbreak. 



When people aren't tested &amp; are told to self quarantine anyways, they will not actually self quarantine.  There is statistical data to support that. I see it here in Green River. 



And to self quarantine with a household when the rest of the household comes &amp; goes as they please,  that is NOT an effective quarantine. This, too, is occurring.",1586193723,fmluzvd
