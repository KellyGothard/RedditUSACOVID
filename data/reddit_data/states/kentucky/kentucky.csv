*****
&gt; &amp;quot;Unapologetic, disheartening, lacking compassion and insensitive&amp;quot; are just some of the words used to describe a Facebook thread involving the Henderson County Judge Executive and a disabled Henderson County man.

&gt; Bruce Reynolds, a 50-year-old disabled Henderson County man, went to pay his light bill at the courthouse in downtown Henderson.

&gt; Finding himself upset and frustrated, Reynolds took to Facebook with his complaint, ultimately exchanging words with Henderson County Judge Executive Brad Schneider.

Pretty low effort stuff if you ask me. 

The pros are that it saves time and money, less likely to have the issues that the digital voting machines have (often with no paper receipt to verify), and more people can vote easier (not worrying about getting time off work, traveling to vote if you work from a distance or are in school, etc) 

And I think getting more people to vote is a benefit to everyone unless you see something wrong with more people voting. What could that be?

I received a bill in the mail dated last month. The mail isn't perfect and often times comes late or not at all. So not the same issues but definitely can have issues with the mail. Also they will then be trusted to multiple postal workers to do the right thing no matter what district they work in. 


&gt;not worrying about getting time off work

You have a right to leave work early to vote..

&gt;traveling to vote if you work from a distance or are in school, etc)

If you can't make it for whatever reason then you can vote absentee..

63,ryeong,"For those unsure of what this means - a second amendment sanctuary county draws its name from the sanctuary city title regarding immigration. The counties in question have either voted or are considering a vote to wave away their obligation to enforce new gun laws and restrictions. Some of the comments Beshear made have caused some concern about the future of guns and this is being considered a proactive stance to stop anything from being enforced.

&amp;#x200B;

From Pendleton County:  
 

“It’s a way to say to Frankfort, ‘We support the Second Amendment, we still support Second Amendment, and we’re not going to let you take it away. We in Pendleton County in District 3 are not, are not - I repeat - are not going to let you come and confiscate our firearms! That’s our God-given right.’”

 Pendleton County Judge Magistrate Darrin Gregg said he sees Virginia lawmakers promising stricter gun laws in that state, so he wants to take a proactive step.

“If we can lead the way, we’ll be glad to lead it,” Gregg said.

New Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has voiced that he would not support an assault rifle ban but he would support a “red flag” law. That would allow police to temporarily confiscate firearms from people deemed by a judge to be a danger.

Gregg said he doesn’t want to take any chances.

“Maybe he wants to take our bump stocks,” said Gregg. “Maybe he wants to take our 30-round clips.

""‘No. You’re not taking nothing. That’s our right. You’re not taking nothing. Once you start biting, once you start biting, you want a bigger bite next time.’”

The resolution would largely be symbolic - a political statement.

“He has the right to say, 'We want your guns.' Maybe we have the right to say, 'No, you can’t have them,'” Gregg said.",1577841327,fcotrds

279,Claydough89,"Voter fraud is a problem but it isnt as wide spread as you make it. It is funny to me though that many people who cry out bout voter fraud have spoken out against election security. 

&gt;Democrats have committed voter fraud through mail and absentee voting and early voting. Not sure why you are acting like it's a ""gop"" thing. Lol

I used that example bc it is a recent example of ""widespread"" voter fraud not just a single individual. 

&gt;I received a bill in the mail dated last month. The mail isn't perfect and often times comes late or not at all. So not the same issues but definitely can have issues with the mail. Also they will then be trusted to MULTIPLE postal workers to do the right thing no matter what district they work in.

The postal system is pretty secure. Your ""late"" bulls can easily be post dated by the sending agency. I too have received a bill dated a month ago but the print date and the date stamped on the envelope was 3 days prior so your fear of the postal service is pretty irrelevant considering election monitors are just random people with minimal training. 

&gt;You have a right to leave work early to vote..

Sure, but some people cant afford to take off from work and some employers arent necessarily friendly when it comes to giving their employees the legally required rights. 

&gt;If you can't make it for whatever reason then you can vote absentee..

You still have to take time off from work or school to do so. Also KY absentee voting is much more of a pain in the ass than other states. 

&gt;Honestly not sure what your hinting at..

Not hinting at anything. The only argument you have made has been an overblown fear of voter fraud and none as to why making voting more accessible to people is not a good thing.  

&gt;Huge risks and a lot of trust. Just so maybe more people will vote? 

Places have implemented mail in voting successfully and not increased voter fraud. I also dont understand why you keep arguing against having more people vote.

&gt;Seems like there may be a hidden agenda your not talking about.

LOL did your foil hat fall off? I just think giving people access to voting makes the system work better.

&gt;Absentee ballot is in place for everything you said.

Absentee voting is great but it isnt as easy as you make it out to be. You still have to take time of work and not always much more convenient. 

&gt;With your logic they should just let us vote online. Way easier that way. Why don't we just vote at work and hand it in to our boss? Same logic.

That is not my logic at all. Mail in voting can be done in a secure manner. This example is irrelevant to anything that I have stated so far. 

Mail in voting can be set up with drop off locations to bypass the big bad mail system you fear for some reason. It can be done securely and and would save a lot of time and taxpayer money.",1578015044,fcw1lth

293,CountryKit," A La Grange family is suing the two Kentucky State Police (KSP) troopers who accidentally shot a gun into their apartment, as well as the state police. 

According to the complaint filed in Oldham County Circuit Court on Dec. 20, the family is arguing the troopers were acting within the scope of their KSP duties because they were handling firearms, which is part of their training.

The family goes on to argue that KSP is “liable for their negligent, careless, reckless and/or intentional conduct in causing the firearm to discharge into the floor of their apartment and through the ceiling of the Todds’ apartment.”

On Nov. 16, a bullet came through the ceiling of the Todd family’s apartment at Oldham Oaks in La Grange.

When the bullet entered the ceiling of the apartment, Ke’liam, Sa’rinity and Kay’leah Todd, William and KeeKee Todd’s children, were all home. Grandmother Beverly Morse was home watching the children at the time.

The bullet came through the living room of the apartment, just a few inches away from where the two girls were at the time, one sitting on the couch and the other standing behind the couch. The bullet itself didn’t fully enter the apartment and no one was injured.

KSP Troopers Dustin Gross and Landon Terry, and another KSP trooper not involved in the incident, live in the apartment above the Todd family.

KSP Sergeant Josh Lawson previously told the Era KSP had launched an investigation “that is primarily going to focus on our troopers actions or their lack of actions following the accidental discharge of their personal weapon.”

“It seems that there was a lack of response to check on the occupants below them,” Lawson added.

The Oldham County Sheriff’s Office and the La Grange Police Department responded to the incident Nov. 16.

According to the police report, Terry asked the Oldham County Sheriff deputy if he was there about the gunshot, and he responded “absolutely.” He then told the deputy that they had just moved in and had taken the magazine of out of the rifle.

“They thought it was empty and the trigger was pulled and the rifle went off because there was a round in the chamber,” according to the police report.

It’s unclear from the report which of the troopers shot the gun.

The sheriff’s deputy also noted the two troopers acted like neither were going to contact their supervisor about the incident and one responded they were “getting ready to go out.”

The family’s complaint states the troopers didn’t bother to check on the safety and wellbeing of the family after the gun had been fired.

The Era first spoke with William and KeeKee Todd and Beverly Morse at their apartment Nov. 18.

William Todd told the Era he went upstairs to the apartment and knocked on the door but nobody answered.

He said later in the evening, he saw two women leave the apartment after he had knocked on the door and then return 15 minutes later with pizza and went about their evening.

“They were just up there eating pizza like nothing had ever happened,” he said.

The trooper didn’t come down to check on the family and apologize until Nov. 17.

Beverly Morse said she was smoking a cigarette outside on Sunday, Nov. 17, when she heard the troopers above her on the patio and she told them that she knew they were up there.

After that they came downstairs to apologize. She asked them why it had taken them so long and they responded it was because they were scared and was “doing something I wasn’t supposed to be doing.”

The Era first reported earlier this month that Gross and Terry were removed from administrative leave and returned to work during their field-training phase.

Gross and Terry graduated from the police academy on Oct. 25 and were assigned to Post 5, which covers Oldham County. After graduation, a training officer supervises each trooper for 12 weeks during the field-training phase.

Lawson has not returned calls from the Era regarding the progress of the internal investigation.

According to the complaint, the family is arguing the troopers’ conduct constitutes negligent and/or intentional infliction of emotional distress upon the family, and their conduct “constitutes gross negligence and will, wanton and extreme indifference and disregard for the safety of others.”

The family is seeking compensation, trial by jury, judgment against the troopers for punitive damages and any other relief to which they may be entitled. There is currently no date set for a hearing.",1578056656,fcx9qt0

Everyone is human and makes mistakes but they didn’t even check on the other family. For me that’s the red line crossed and they both should loose their jobs for that reason alone. Although not being able to handle a firearm in a safe manner is a pretty big deal, my preteen boys both know to always treat a gun as if it’s loaded, that’s basic gun safety 101. If this had been any other job and you fucked up that bad during your probation period, you would be fired without question.

Massie compared the potential circumstances to the jailing of Rowan County, Kentucky Clerk Kim Davis by a judge when she refused to sign same-sex marriage certificates in 2015.

“A lot of people didn't think she was willing to do this, but she resisted a judge's order to issue marriage licenses with her name on it, and she refused to do it, and he found her in contempt and threw her in jail without a jury trial,” Massie said.

Does Massie not realize you don’t need a trial to get thrown in jail.  If a cop sees someone murder another person the police station isn’t going to say “well your free to go until your trial, just make sure you come back for it so we can determine if you need to go to prison”",1578110850,fczykv8

The original commenter was making a slippery slope argument, yet, rather than recognizing it as fallacious, you tried counterarguing to say there is a difference because dogs aren't ""meat"" animals.  It's cruel skinning a dog alive for the same reason it's cruel skinning ""meat animals"": they have a nervous system and brain capable of feeling it.  That's why there are animal welfare laws (although they don't work for cruelty of meat production) that are supposed to minimize animal suffering.  Despite similarities to dogs or cats, animals like foxes or rabbits often get skinned alive, frozen alive, killed by anal electrocution, or otherwise inhumanely killed.

477,Aaronlane,"Welcome! Glad to hear you are considering Kentucky!

Here is the paradox you'll encounter moving to our state: If you're relatively solitary, private people you'll be drawn toward more rural areas where you can get more land less expensively. What no one will mention is - everyone in the county there will suddenly get VERY interested in your lives. You'll be the most fascinating thing to happen, and everyone will want to know all about you. You'll be invited to 9 different churches. Good luck keeping them out of your business. 

Alternatively you could pick a bigger city like Lexington or Louisville where you wouldn't get the land you want - or a nice inexpensive pole barn for working on cars - but no one is going to bother with you at all. 

Either way, you're going to be very close to lots of our excellent state parks, numerous lakes and great all around climate.

Being involved in an armed robbery is not one of those cases, though.  Possession of drugs, pretty much ANY nonviolent offense, and I'd be in complete support of challenging trying them as an adult.  Armed robbery is not in that category.  

This boy got into some shit, and it sucks.  But this could easily have ended with a death.  Crimes like this should not ever be handled as lesser offenses.  White, black , purple, or green the law should be equal.  It makes me wonder about the number of crimes not handled equally though.

I have no issue with reduced sentences for first time offenders.  I also have no issue with things like extended parole for minors.  A case like this he may not be a violent offender himself yet but he is on that path.  So maybe a long term probation.  

With that said, education has been shown as w major factor in crime.  Generally people with less education are more likely to become repeat offenders.

No, there isn't. Compared to other parts of the state, maybe, but it's not full of opportunity, quite the opposite. That's why there's such rampant drug use and homelessness. Honest question, do you feel that these issues are personal moral failings or a societal/communal issue?

Louisville can't support the people already here. Lack of opportunity elsewhere causes people to come here, and not just from other parts of Kentucky, but Indiana, too. This contributes to a lot of your complaints. Louisville doesn't exist in a bubble from the rest of the state's problems.

A Hot Brown sandwich (sometimes known as a Louisville Hot Brown or Kentucky Hot Brown) is an American hot sandwich originally created at the Brown Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky, by Fred K. Schmidt in 1926. It is a variation of traditional Welsh rarebit and was one of two signature sandwiches created by chefs at the Brown Hotel shortly after its founding in 1923. It was created to serve as an alternative to ham and egg late-night suppers.

***

**Sandwich**

A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type. The sandwich began as a portable finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide. The 3rd of November marks the National Sandwich Day.Sandwiches are a popular type of lunch food, taken to work, school, or picnics to be eaten as part of a packed lunch. The bread may be plain or be coated with condiments, such as mayonnaise or mustard, to enhance its flavour and texture.

I had to order a new birth certificate. It took a week, it costs about $40 I think for processing and rush order. To you and me $40 isn't that much, but to someone who is deciding between healthcare, rent and food, that's a few days of groceries, a prescription or two or a little to save towards rent for the month. 

I also had to have my social security card, luckily I still had that or that would've been more time and money to get a new one. 

Lastly, I needed two proof of residence. Now luckily, the company I work for relocated me (again a privilege) so I had multiple things to show, but what if I was homeless or lived in someone else's house and didn't have that proof. 

I also had to sit at the DMV for about four hours (only open during business hours and a few hours on the weekend). For someone who is working an hourly retail job, they would have a hard time getting there because they would be working during those hours and likely have no PTO (because companies don't have to give you anything) so calling in or scheduling a day means I've lost out on several hours of work, which further increases the costs on a tight budget.

So what you are really saying when you want a policy like this is, you don't want anyone who is poor, a minority or otherwise disenfranchised be able to easily vote. Only folks with ways and means should have that and that sounds an awful like the way this country started where only white, male, landowners had a vote.

I'm saying it's a bad bill and that poor people are going to be affected regardless of preferred party. that's a bad thing in a state that doesn't really vote now as it is or cares that much about voting.  if it is as serious an issue as being portrayed, then it would have been proposed back when dubya was pushing the issue. but we had a democratic secretary of state back then.

However, putting barriers in place to prevent certain types of people from voting (because that's what this is) is just wrong and immoral. Do you truly believe if the majority of the people this would impact voted republican, republicans would be implementing this? 

Secondly, you should know better than anyone then how this impacts your fellow class ""members"". You are literally voting against your own interests, but because you are in the ""clear"" you don't see it aka privilege. There are plenty of retail jobs that don't have defined hours, tell you last minute when you are working or have you work split shifts. Just because you have a set schedule where you can switch your days around doesn't mean everyone else has this ""luxury"".

As for private sale, it's illegal to make straw purchases already with hefty fines and prison time although private sale between two individuals is lawful it's the context of said purchase that comes under scrutiny. Private manufacturing is also legal and I don't even see the government ever being able to stop that.

That makes less than zero sense because the reason the 2nd amendment exists was to protect the population in the event the government decided it didn't want to listen to the voters, who have a universal right to choose who is leading the country.

Also there are restrictions around buying/owning a gun, albeit very few. Again republicans are all for small government when it benefits them but want big brother large and in charge when in doesn't.

I for sure disagree with pursuing this sort of thing due to a political agenda. And I don't deny that the GOP have a certain agenda. But at the same time, the policy itself is reasonable when detracted from that motive. I feel that both parties do what they can to prevent the loss of power, but I don't see why proof of residence in a certain district is a negative thing. 

And no. I don't. If my fellow class members can't carve out time to get an ID, I'm not sure why that's anyone else's problem besides their own. Getting a simple state ID is not hard. It just isn't.

As long as it was paired with automatic voter registration, and ID was provided automatically upon reaching the age of voting, and provided freely then and at any point where it was required to be renewed or changed or something. And if election day was a national holiday. And if it was ensured that we wouldn't have these actions where voting locations in poorer /minority areas get shut down so that poorer voters have to travel more, and also wait in longer lines, to vote. And other stuff where voting locations in those areas seem to run into issues like running out of ballots that causes delays and such, or things with voter purges, and irregularities with people's voting locations changing at the last minute for no clear reason and without being informed, or...

well, I could go on

I could see an actual case for wanting g voter ID for election security purposes.

As to strictly inaccuracy, I think things like that get said over and over again until it's just accepted but it's really not a fact. I appreciate there are a million reports out there ranking schools and such, but a quick search this morning turns up this

 [https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-schools/s/kentucky/](https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-schools/s/kentucky/) 

&amp;#x200B;

The above link ranks DuPont Manual as the best K-12 school, public or private, in the state. Perusing the list, again a quick scan and not some deep dive so don't get all bent out of shape at me, I'm just talking out loud here, but North Oldham comes in at #7 and is the highest Oldham/Crestwood school I see. Now 7 is nothing to sneeze at at all, in fact it's a great ranking, but all I'm pointing out is, if the argument about schools are better, well, there's not a lot to back that up. There are, in fact, 5 Louisville/Jefferson county schools in the top 20, 1 Oldham couty school. This of course is where the argument always changes to 'per capita' instead of rankings, but that's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, despite my blathering here, I don't hate Crestwood, it's just boring as I said. You don't go there for culture, for diversity, for exposure to new things. You go there because you want to be with others who aren't going to challenge your point of view or way of life, and that's fine for some folks.

That is your interpretation. That isn't what they say but instead it is your inherent bias being attributed to people you don't know.

My wife and I just moved to Crestwood. We wanted to be in Oldham county vs Jefferson purely because the schools are better. We homeschool right now but if we felt like it were better we wanted the kids to have the best education and that's why we choose Oldham. My wife used to work in the Oldham school district and it is a known commodity, good support and the teachers hare more, not enough but more, administrative support and resources.

You weren't being really fair comparing Oldham to the whole state to get your ranking. Vs JCPS the Oldham schools get better scores and have fewer discipline problems. Shelby or other surrounding counties just aren't as highly ranked. And picking out a magnet school is kind of dumb given that you know none of those kids are randomly assigned. It is like picking an AP physics class vs a non-AP class, of course it is going to score better.

JCPS vs Oldham the only comparison that's fair and guess what the real estate market shows that people want to live in the Oldham county districts vs Jefferson. I know I just bought a house and we could have had a larger house (smaller yard) for less $ but we wanted to be in the Oldham county districts.

I don't speak for everyone but for me it wasn't about race. I have met 2 neighbors 1 very nice couple from Latin America who, unfortunately for me, don't speak conversational English and 1 pair of caucasians who seem like nice people. It wouldn't matter the race for my neighbors because I don't care. And for you to pain me with your broad brush of white flight is pretty offensive.

I think your opinions are ill informed. I think that people live in Crestwood because it is an easy commute to jobs in Louisville and the schools are better. But hey what do I know that's just what I did and when I lived in Pewee for 10 years it was the exact same thing.",1578762526,fdwuv3l

If you as a population decide to stop funding your ambulance company? It’s going to cost you MORE. Because there is no tax base support for emergency service.

Plus? People abuse the system. Don’t call an ambulance because you don’t want to wait at the ER. Don’t call an ambulance because you have a cold. Don’t call an ambulance because of something someone can drive your lazy ass to urgent care for. Chest pain? Call an ambulance. Giving birth? CALL AN AMBULANCE NOW. Massive trauma?

Getting huffy with people who work billing because your insurance won’t pay for a treat no transport? Doesn’t win you favors.

1078,ColonelBourbon,"I think your assumption on my opinion is ill informed. I know a LOT of people that live there, a few family members even. They are certainly 'nice' people. However, I've attended church services in that community on several occasions and the things I heard left no room for interpretation in denigrating non-traditional families and non-hetero couples.  The opinion is not just my own. 

I don't think everyone in Crestwood is racist, so save that narrative. I don't think there is an all encompassing brush to paint any gender, race, neighborhood, or creed with, but I think MOST people are there because they aren't willing to grow or are fearful of some non-existent faux statistic that suggests they'll be safer. 

As to the Oldham vs JCPS, I did show you that ranking the shows a Jeff school at the top of the heap. I don't know how that's not comparing directly or being unfair, but I'll acquiesce to the fact that true measurement of these things is very difficult. Popular opinion is Oldham schools are better. 

Make no mistake, if you want to be there for yourself and happiness and whatever, that's all good. I know I grew up in a non-diverse area and I hate my parents for it all the time. All the people and foods and entertainment and a million other things I've been exposed to because I chose to leave a Crestwood type community and move into a metro area has been phenomenal.

Boomers are ignorant, arrogant, and possess a limited awareness of their privilege and a yearning for the long forgone ""better years"" of the past, among other things.

I think that's why so many people are suggesting nature stuff, because folks who live in that area are often into that.  So if you are to, have at it!  Go fishing, hiking, camping, hunting if you want to, shoot some guns (that's seems like a uniquely American experience), ride a horse, all of that.  If you're curious, I'm sure you can find some locals to take you.

IF, however, you are more of a city mouse like me, you'll want to find a way to get to Louisville (or Nashville).  Go see some music, an art museum, a play, go dancing... I lived in a similar town (Russellville) for a year due to a job, and found myself driving back home to Louisville every weekend.

**Some of the bills passed by the democratic house that would bring drug prices down**

1. H.R. 987: The Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act--The Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act was introduced in February 2019. Five Republicans voted for the measure. The bill seeks to lower prescription drug prices, bolster the Affordable Care Act and protect care for those with pre-existing conditions.--**Senate Republicans Refuse To Bring It to The Floor For A Vote--It is a Bipartisan bill**

2. H.R. 1520, the Purple Book Continuity Act (bill aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs)--database correction and compliance to bring more affordable medications to the market via generics.

3. H.R. 1503, the Orange Book Transparency Act of 2019 (bill aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs)--databases to bring clean up the vast array of information and help consumers target ailments with the correct, most effective and cost efficient perscriptions

It's a change *observed* over decades, yes, but saying a cold day in Kentucky is contradictory evidence for climate change is just a misinterpretation of the results of climate change.

Example: when certain areas of high temperature and humidity expand because of climate change over decades, then a person goes out in that heat and dies after exposure for more than an hour because it's so humid sweating won't lower their body temperature, that's because of climate change.

I did read it.

&gt;My original statement was that global warming happens over a long time

It does.

&gt;but one day is not proof of that

Scientists observe a trend in temperatures by looking at evidence of temperature at intervals like individual days on scales like decades.  Similarly they see biological evolution based on a fossil record, where each fossil is evidence of that long term process.  How something is observed or discovered is different from what is ""proof"" or evidence.  The process is understood in the big picture, but each feature of that big picture constitutes it.  So, climate change 'skeptics' are just wrong about a cold day in Summer being ""disproof"" because really it's proof, although a single data point might be an outlier.  Any weather is 'proof'/evidence of a long term change in climate, if the long term change is real, which is observed or graphed out with more data.",1578905243,fe6u61f

Everything else? Well, our roads suck total turtle ass, so there's that as a potential factor.

Economy? News flash, we're not California. We have no beaches, no canyon passes. We're doing our best, okay? We have coal and farming and a bit of industry, but not a lot of tourism.

Higher education? A lot of Kentucky is lower class and lower-middle class. Not all of us can afford college and those of us who can might not want to deal with student loans despite being able to pay them off.

Healthcare quality? What do you expect? Hospitals still widely use Windows XP and 10-12 year old machinery, they're clearly not rolling in cash to spend on the latest and greatest in healthcare. They try their best, and I say that as someone who has been hospitalized in the past.

Fiscal Stability? That's due to coal industry among other things. Coal is very much a boom-and-bust way of making a profit. Sometimes it's worth a fortune, sometimes it's not worth the fire that lights it. Also, going back to lack of tourism.

Regulatory capture (also client politics) is a corruption of authority that occurs when a political entity, policymaker, or regulatory agency is co-opted to serve the commercial, ideological, or political interests of a minor constituency, such as a particular geographic area, industry, profession, or ideological group. When regulatory capture occurs, a special interest is prioritized over the general interests of the public, leading to a net loss for society.

Firstly, that's anecdotal. However, extrapolating your figure out to the entire population of Kentucky equates to around 40,000 Kentuckians. Beshear won by 5k. Secondly, you shouldn't be on board with the disenfranchisement of even a single Kentuckian from their right to vote. There's a state representative in Frankfort currently sitting in a seat that they won by a single vote. Every vote counts, which means the rights of every voter count.

I won't support a voter ID law until said IDs are available at every single voting poll quickly, free of cost, and valid same day with a barrier to obtaining one no higher than the current barrier to identifying yourself to vote. 

*Any* cost to vote is too high, and that includes opportunity cost and travel expenses. *Any* distance beyond the poll to have to prove yourself to vote is too far.

&gt; And it’s not like a boomer has never accused Bernie Sanders of being “just like a lazy millennial.”

Totally irrelevant, unless you're justifying the use of the word in order to make whatever argument against ""boomers"".  Bernie Sanders is an example of why the stereotypes around Baby Boomers are false generalizations.  That generation was known for 1960s civil rights protests, protests against Vietnam war, legal reforms, and so on.  If someone makes some stereotyped argument against millennials like that, they're hasty generalizations that are easily negated by statistics like those that show millennials are less egoistic, are harder working, or which negate whatever claim.  Responding by using the same kind of stereotyped misinformation is self contradictory and just as stupid.

* An ID card must be obtained at the [Circuit Court Clerk's office](https://drive.ky.gov/Pages/Circuit-clerks.aspx) in your county of residence.
* **An ID card may be obtained for a person age 15 and over.**
* [Birth Certificate](https://www.vitalchek.com/order_main.aspx?ProviderID=16401&amp;state=ky&amp;eventtype=birth) and [Social Security card](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/ssnumber) (photocopies not accepted) and proof of residency are required.
* **The cost of the ID is $12.00 and valid for four (4) years.**

With your ID thing, you moved across state lines. It's unnecessarily expensive and time consuming to get all that updated, I agree with that. However, given someone has all the necessary components, you can go to the Circuit Clerk before or after work and get a photo ID within a few hours, probably shorter, and then report to work normally or return home.

Strawman. That has nothing to do with the argument i presented. You ARE creating a narative. You do not have all the information and making up shit is the definition of cresting a narative. Classic though, just blame all your arguments shortcomings on the left and snowflakes. Pathetic lol.

&gt;If you wore a rainbow as a gay man, then the symbol you wear will be seen in light of the gay pride movement

No actually it wont. No one will know i am gay nor will they know the meaing behind the shirts i wear. That is literally them assuming the meaning and that is the problem. You and this school are assuming the meaning behind some fucking birthday cake.

&gt;I don't have to assume a hidden meaning, because the movement that deals with being gay by default has made that meaning for you. 

Oh really? Sounds like you decided the meaning just like you are deciding the meaning for this girl. When did the gay community knock on my door and change the meaning of my shirts for me? A shirt for LGBT pride is a shirt for LGBT pride. A shirt with a rainbow design is a shirt with a rainbow design. You do not have all the information on a shirts meaning so you are quite literally assuming it means lgbt when it may not at all.

&gt;If you don't like that, I suggest you try to do something about it.

Do something about what? Your assumptions?

&gt;You aren't going to get to have it both ways here, however. (The rainbow was and is a sign of the Covenant originally).

I dont have it both ways lmao. Some things are meant for pride, some things are just a design and the person may assign whatever meaning they want. You, a stranger, dont get to assume it for them. That's your problem.

Also, if it's a sign for god why do you keep going on about gays? How do you know a rainbow shirt isnt about god, huh?

Again, irrelevant. Demonstrate evidence for a god and then your points about sin may be discussed. Until then it's useless rhetoric.

My eyes went crossed trying to read the summary never mind the bill. Something I'd be curious to read or learn is if this bill is structured to benefit established interests or if it opens up a genuine market. For example does this cater to large casinos or does it offer a way to set up a legit mom and pop bookie? 

Does this maintain, ease, or otherwise change the states current charity gaming rules? On the one hand, helping charities and giving them a strong fundraising tool is good. On the other, this set up a cronyist industry where gaming operators take a shitload of money off the top to operate games for charitable causes. They essentially rent the gaming license from the charity, use volunteer charity labor, and get a big chunk of the profits. A large part of why that works is that the operators have bingo halls and the gear and the knowledge of how to navigate the regulations correctly when the charity might not.

I work remotely and I live in TN and want to move to KY. I specificslly want to move to a more rural part without being piled on top of my neighbors. Here in TN we have local telcos and other resources that have run and provided access to a bunch of customers “in the sticks”. A recent trip to KY indicated that they either don’t have this infrastructure or that it only exists in urban environments of in concentrated population hubs. 

I found myself very excited to visit Liberty/Dunnville area and then was crushed when I realized that internet access was abysmal. Windstream said I might be able to get 6mbps... maybe. In Ulysses it appears that internet should be available through a local provider, but calling them wasn’t helpful because they couldn’t tell me if thr home I was looking at would be serviced. Fordsville is another example of a place with such limited internet offerings that even though I enjoy the views and the peace... it just doesn’t work. 

KY isn’t the only place like this. Alabama and Arkansas are just as miserable in this regard. Virginia has its own set of issues depending on location. West Virginia seems to offer service similar to what we have here in TN, but at a drastically inflated price.

Does the problem occur on hard-wired devices as well as wifi?  

He needs to know the answer to these questions before contacting Spectrum or the technicians will push back and do nothing to resolve the issue.  

Wifi is frequently so fickle that they'll most likely blame it, so he needs to have something wired directly to the router...  Of course, then they'll blame the router, which is why it's best to connect a computer directly to their modem to test, rather than going through any third party equipment.  If the problem is as bad as you say, leaving a computer connected directly to their modem with ping pointed at their modem's public IP address, and, say, for instance, google's public IP address (8.8.8.8), will quickly reveal if the problem is with their equipment.  Of course, presenting this information to a technician when he comes out is difficult without proper logging equipment.  There is a program called PRTG that is free to use if you have less than 100 sensors, but it's pretty complicated to set up, but it produces really nice graphs that could prove beyond the shadow of a doubt where the problem lies...  but if you want to prove that it's the ISP, you'll need to be connected directly to their modem.",1579128931,fei2n1y

Lot of great points that I personally want too. Local ordinances require horse land to remain horse land so real commercial development is extremely unlikely outside of the narrowly zoned areas in downtown Versailles and Midway. Walmart in both cities has tried multiple times to come into the area but has been specifically prohibited. Pull up Google maps on Versailles/Midway and you'll see the closest Walmart is actually in neighboring counties. It's mainly horse and bourbon country so most land sizes are on the medium to large end.

Kentucky Speedway, which hosts NASCAR and Indy races, would also qualify  to operate a sportsbook.

This is a better position than we were in where it was charity gaming and horse tracks, but it's not exactly opening the market to different players. I think that is in the Overton Window for a lot of Kentuckians.

It bugs me a little bit when I see legislation like this because it gives those special interests a reason to get in bed with our legislators (or vice versa) and they will protect their own interests to the detriment of Kentucky and other smaller players.

&gt; The latter is especially worth remembering the next time you&amp;#039;re tempted to seriously drop the hammer on public streets, in any car-a lesson two General Motors employees learned the hard way this week when they were arrested for apparently &amp;quot;Racing&amp;quot; two new C8 Corvettes in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

&gt; UPDATE: According to Kentucky&amp;#039;s WNKY, Thim, 27, was caught driving one Corvette at 120 mph, and Derkatz, 30, at 100 mph; a third Corvette on the scene was &amp;quot;Not participating in the racing.&amp;quot; Various local news outlets report that Thim and Derkatz posted $1,000 bail and are scheduled for a pretrial hearing at Warren District Court on February 18.According to the employees&amp;#039; LinkedIn profiles, Thim is a CAE engineer working on induction and exhaust systems, and Merkatz is an electrical engineer.

Danny Bentley, a pharmacist and Republican from Russell, is the lead sponsor on [HCR 5](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/20RS/hcr5.html) which requests that several federal agencies ""expedite **research** on the safety and effectiveness"" of marijuana use for certain health purposes.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, has once again introduced a bill to legalize and regulate **medical marijuana**. Under [HB 136] (https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/20RS/hb136.html) smoking medical cannabis would not be permitted. Consumption could take place through the form of pills, capsules, oils and edibles, which must not be ""attractive"" in any way to children. Nemes has said people who can't swallow products could use inhalers. The bill also lists ""qualifying medical conditions"" with ""chronic or debilitating"" effects that could be treated with medical marijuana, including opioid use disorder, PTSD, epilepsy, AIDS and glaucoma. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;State Rep. Cluster Howard, D-Jackson, introduced [HB148](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/record/20RS/hb148.html), which would have 75% of the tax and licensing proceeds from **recreational marijuana** sales go toward paying down multibillion-dollar liabilities in the Kentucky Employees Retirement System's nonhazardous pension fund. This bill would decriminalize the possession of less than 1 ounce of marijuana and allow those previously convicted of a marijuana-related misdemeanors to have their offense expunged for free. Permits to grow cannabis plants at home also could be purchased for $250 per year under the bill.

Of note, two important things jump out, 1. Illinois requires all marijuana to be grown in state. And 2. All marijuana is grown in indoor facilities. This last point speaks to your statement. It doesn't really matter how great Kentucky's soil is for major recreational sales, as most is regulated and monitored in indoor facilities now.

&gt;**Q: Does this include marijuana in food form?**

&gt;Rep. Nemes -- ""It does, but, and this is a very important but, it cannot be in any form that is attractive to children. So, there are no gummies, no suckers, or anything of that nature. What “attractive to children” means is going to be defined more by the regulating body. People ask me about brownies and so forth.

I think questionable language in the bill, like this, is why these things get hung up. 

Plus, all this controversy over kids vaping and lawmakers in KY think vaping marijuana is the way forward.

&gt; KentuckyWired, the much-heralded plan to improve internet connectivity across the state, promised to create financial opportunities through reliable, high-speed internet access for rural communities that have repeatedly been hammered by the loss of jobs in the coal and tobacco industries.

&gt; The project is installing fiber-optic cable that will bring broadband to state agencies across Kentucky, but in order for individual homes and businesses to tap into the new network, third-party providers still need to hang the so-called last mile.

&gt; In communities still waiting for high-speed internet, residents say they&amp;#039;ll just have to continue doing what they&amp;#039;ve always done: They&amp;#039;ll have to depend on each other.

2108,Jelfff,"Over the last couple of weeks I have produced a series of **non-partisan interactive map links that can display political districts**.  This project is a public service and part of my way to ""pay it forward"". 

One map shows all the states and **U.S. House of Representatives** districts with semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  You can turn that data off and turn on other data that shows semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the **U.S. Senators**.  I was surprised to see how many states have senators from different parties.

There is also one map for each state that can show the state legislature lower chamber and upper chamber.  For 15 states, including **Kentucky**, the maps can display semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  (I will work on contacting the other states and request they improve their data so I can color their maps.)

All of this political district boundary data is hosted on various government GIS (Geographic Information System) servers.  The maps are displayed by **GISsurfer** which is a general purpose web map I developed.  Each map has a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with general information to help you get the most benefit from the map.

For the maps with semi-transparent fill, an intriguing thing to do is turn on more than one fill overlay.  For example, turn all overlays off then turn on state house fill, congress fill, congress black line.  **You might see that some areas get more blue, some get more red and some areas become purple.**

If you have trouble figuring out how to turns overlay layers on/off and restack them, then please read the **""Map tips""**.

If you want to know exactly where data for a particular map is coming from, then notice that each map link includes an address that points to a txt file.  Copy \*just\* that txt file address, paste it into a browser bar and hit enter.  That file has the addresses for the GIS layers the map can display.

Here is the link to the web page with the political district map links.

&gt;Right. Because how dare we allow diversity of thought and opinion.


Using ""diversity"" to justify support of Donald Trump is asinine considering he literally tried banning Muslims from the United States, has appointed multiple white nationalists like Stephen Miller, has made several racist remarks, refused to condemn Neo-Nazis and has pandered to their votes, has made several ominous comments himself about Nazism and his ""German genes"", the fact that racist groups and mass shooters have publicly claimed him as inspiration, and the list goes on.

Of course, for someone that either cannot or simply will not track logical consistency or moral integrity, this won't matter.

edit:

Beyond the absurdity of using ""diversity"", by framing your views as being a part of ""diversity of thought and opinion"", are you truly unaware of the self-contradiction in justifying your beliefs with that sort of relativism?  You realize that this same justification could go to justify *anything*, e.g. Nazism, Jihadist Islamism, etc..  If matters like this were just about ""opinion"", which is to say they don't involve *knowledge* (or the lack thereof), why argue about them?  Why would you even believe what you do?  Should we also be open to ""diversity of thought"" for people who believe Earth is flat?   

In this context, using ""diversity of thought and opinion"" to justify some conservative spinning of a private ""school"" (institution of indoctrination and pseudoscience which churns out adults with a 6th grade education)  expelling a girl over her sexual orientation, is so frankly stupid at all angles I find it hard to accept that you're serious.

You ""champion US oil""?  Actually solving a problem obviously *is* all or nothing.  Either it is solved or it isn't.  So, no, if you are supporting the industries which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change (not to mention all the other disgusting effects to the environment, like dumping millions of gallons of crude into oceans, etc.), then you do not support solving that problem, and you are the problem.  Science isn't political.  

&gt;put people out of work as well

This is an entirely different issue which was also used to justify opposition to abolition of slavery.  It also totally ignores that something like ""Green New Deal"" legislation would create thousands of jobs, that wind turbine technicians are one of the fastest growing jobs now, and more facts that contradict such blatant political posturing.

Okay, if she actually said that, she's wrong, so it's good she corrected herself.  It's actually a ""point of no return"" set by climate scientists.  She's exactly right in her point though.  2030-2050 are when climate change effects are projected to get very serious, i.e. by seeing floods of coastal cities, effects on crops.  Unmitigated climate change would basically be the end of the world.  The ecosystems, like the soil, the air, the oceans, which humans rely on being stable for their way of life, will eventually fail.

edit:

Actually, looks like others have projected 2050 could be ""beginning of end"":
https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/05/climate-change-apocalypse-could-start-2050-if-we-do-noting/1356865001/

&gt;In the years leading up to 2050, policy makers fail to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The case for the global climate-emergency mobilization necessary to keep temperatures from rising is ""politely ignored."" Global greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2030 and begin to fall due to a drop in fossil fuel use, but damage has been done and warming reaches 3 degrees Celsius. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;By 2050, sea levels have risen 1.6 feet and are projected to increase by as much as 10 feet by 2100. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Globally, 55% of the population lives in areas subject to more than 20 days of lethal heat a year, beyond the human threshold of survivability.

So, I had previously read otherwise, but it's actually not an outlandish estimate depending on what you consider ""the end of the world"" to mean.  

In any case, the fact that people use whatever a 29 year old congresswoman says on Twitter (even when she is reasonable enough to recant) as a barometer for facts about climate science says more about the attention span or ""target fixation"" of those people.",1579480016,ff1j3kp

They're not talking points, I just pay attention to the news. (Real news, not propaganda like what Trump relies on, e.g. Fox News, Breitbart, etc.)

 &gt;Nope. He imposed a travel ban on several countries that had state-sponsored terrorism. Those countries happened to be majority Muslim. There are far more countries with Muslim majorities that were not on the list.

Here's video of him actually saying he wants a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"":

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viDffWUjcBA

All he ended up doing was Executive Order 13769 (because there's no way he could actually accomplish it), and subsequent orders, and courts fought it, but parts are still in effect.  Obviously, the point is, *he called for banning people of a certain religion from the United States*.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769

&gt;So...one guy from the alt-right? Okay. White ""nationalist"" is not the same as white ""supremacist"". I don't agree with the guy, but at least get your terms right.

Wow, so you just bite the bullet on his Muslim ban and say *just one white nationalist?*  Then you try saying *it's not as bad as white supremacists* (actually it is).  Stephen Miller is an outright white nationalist (and is an obvious authoritarian, like Trump, just watch any video of him speaking), and Steve Bannon has been politicking his ""economic nationalism"" invoking whatever about race al around Europe with Fascist parties, and Sebastian Gorka would straight up wear a button with a Hungarian fascist party's symbol.

If you don't agree with them, why support the idiot who appointed them and who supports the same views?

&gt;Such as? Meanwhile Trump's out here touting record low unemployment across all demographics and declaring the MLK memorial a national park. I can't imagine racists being too happy with him, can you?

Racists have definitely been happy with him, claiming they were emboldened by him, some even being mass shooters.  He led chants saying congresswomen who happened to be brown or black ""should go back to their countries"" and has led basically hate campaign about those people, leading to death threats from his dumbass racist fringe supporters.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlxlWunBwOo  

He also demonizes people from majority non-white countries as all rapists or thieves or whatever.  Worse he panders to racists and actively encourages violence at his ""rallies"".  Here's another interaction that comes to mind:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axCKbWfRXm4

&gt;Again, we ought to judge people by their actions, right?

Wow, just trying to hand wave away what the US president says an inconsequential.  

&gt;His daughter and grandchildren are Jewish.

They're adult converts to Judaism.  Still he boasts endlessly about his genes which make him ""smart"", ""a fighter"", and says he's proud of his ""German blood"".

&gt;No, not that it matters, but I'm an engineer, and no head injuries to speak of. 

You're right, it doesn't matter.

&gt;And we shouldn't shocked or insulted when a Christian school asks their student to uniformly hold to Christian values or risk being asked to leave. 

I don't care how someone might feel about it, it's not a legitimate education, shouldn't receive federal funding.  And there are no ""uniform"" Christian values.  There are various interpretations by various churches, which might cherry pick to condemn homosexuality, or eating oysters or whatever else, or they might draw some more rational metaphorical interpretation of the Bible to fit with societal norms or ethics.  Those which condemn homosexuals or bisexuals are obviously not the rational kind.

&gt;I'm not a troll. either. It seems as though you aren't used to hearing conservative opinions

It sounds like you've never actually studied anything you like to 
'debate' about on the internet.  ""Opinions"" aren't knowledge.

&gt;d suggest breaking out of your protective bubble and actually having conversations with people who disagree with you. It's very enlightening.

This is such a striking example of pot calling the kettle black that makes it so obvious why talking to someone like yourself is like talking to a cult member.  

Whatever your religious or philosophical beliefs are, that pertains to knowledge, assuming you 'believe' it because you consider it true.  So, your talk about ""opinions"", if it's supposed to convey some 'tolerance' of your views or relativism, that is self contradictory.  What you believe and others don't, you believe others are wrong about.  And you have no idea at all about what kind of exposure I have had to alternative beliefs, concepts, adversity or whatever, and your talk of a ""protective bubble"" is either projection, or just meaningless.  Throughout this interaction you've blatantly hand waved away, indicating not the the points were wrong just that you're not amenable to reason about them.  And of course, your talk of ""opinion"" is probably a way of saying *I don't have to be reasonable because it's just my opinion*.

Why do leftists think conservatives just sit around watching Fox News? If I watch the news, I watch the local stations here in Louisville. I read. And I just live life. I see a booming stock market, record unemployment, lower illegal immigration, and better trade deals. *That's* news.

&gt;total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States

""until our country's representatives can figure what the hell is going on.

You need the whole quote there, my friend. And why, exactly, is this a problem, that he *said* that? Was there *actually* a 100% ""ban"" on Muslims? And is that *actually* a problem anyway? It's not like Muslims are an ethnic group, after all. It's a demonstrably hostile and violent *ideology*. We *should* vet people who claim to hold to it.

&gt;Racists have definitely been happy with him

Oh, so that means Trump *must* be a racist. Because *other* people are *happy* with him. I'm a devout Christian, and I'm happy with the job he's doing. So does that make him a devout Christian now? I'm confused by your logic.

&gt;He also demonizes people from majority non-white countries as all rapists or thieves or whatever.

He said a lot of *illegal immigrants* are rapists and criminals. This is a *true* statement, by the way. It just so happens that most illegal immigrants are also not white. So...do they get a pass because they are people of color? Was he not supposed to call out criminal activity? Did that hurt the criminals' feelings?

&gt;They're adult converts to Judaism.

Oh, so not *real* Jews. It doesn't ""count"" because Ivanka converted? Her kids don't count because they still have some Gentile in them, even though their dad (Jared) was born Jewish? Kinda bigoted there, not gonna lie.

&gt;he's proud of his ""German blood"".

Oh no. My whole family has German blood. Are we racists, too!? So does most of Louisville! What do we do!?

&gt;it's not a legitimate education, shouldn't receive federal funding

You understand that religious private schools don't generally get federal funding, right? I went to 12 years of Catholic school in Louisville paying tuition. And it was ""legitimate"" enough for me and *thousands* of others to succeed in college and beyond.

&gt;which might cherry pick to condemn homosexuality, or eating oysters or whatever else

Like I said, I'm an engineer. I know and love math, science, civics, statistics, economics, and data analysis. I'm *also* an ordained Christian minister and Bible teacher.

&amp;#x200B;

*In the early 1970s, the developers of the yet-to-be-built mall gave the land for the tower to the city, stipulating that the words ""Florence Mall"" be painted on it in view of interstate motorists.*[*\[2\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Y%27all_Water_Tower#cite_note-news.cincinnati.com-2) *The tower would thus advertise the mall, which would open in September 1976.*

*The tower was built by the Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co. of* [*Pittsburgh*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh)*, Pennsylvania, and painted in 1974 by the Virginia Erection Co. The giant advertisement immediately raised legal concerns. In July 1974, state* [*Bureau of Highways*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Highways) *officials told the city that the tower's sign was illegal because it advertised something which didn't yet exist.*[*\[3\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Y%27all_Water_Tower#cite_note-Enquirer_1974-3)

*Among the discussed possibilities were repainting the tower or covering the words with a large* [*tarpaulin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpaulin)*. With time running out to comply with the law, civil staff met for a* [*brainstorming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming) *session at the Stringtown Restaurant with the late C.M. ""Hop"" Ewing (d.2006), then Mayor of Florence, who ""sketched different ideas on a napkin"".*[*\[4\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Y%27all_Water_Tower#cite_note-4) *Ewing ultimately devised the idea of removing the vertical lines at the sides of the M in MALL, adding a stem to make it a Y and adding an* [*apostrophe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe)*; resulting in ""*[*Y'ALL*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%27all)*"".*[*\[5\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Y%27all_Water_Tower#cite_note-AmericanProfile-5) *Ewing called it a ""corny solution, but cost-effective"", because the minor alteration would cost one-third of a full repainting.*[*\[5\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Y%27all_Water_Tower#cite_note-AmericanProfile-5) *The city paid $472 to the W.T. Marx Company*[*\[6\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Y%27all_Water_Tower#cite_note-6) *of* [*Cincinnati, Ohio*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati)*, to make the changes.*

*The publicity surrounding the Florence Y'all tower advertised the mall better than a passive sign alone. On the mall's opening day in late 1976, mall-goers created a traffic jam at the* [*Kentucky Route 18*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Route_18) *exit from I-75.*",1579795941,ffcbmm7

2563,naW7-zSvyeliQtSEP6vP,"&gt; Oh so what then? CNN? MSNBC? Nope, no propaganda there...

Neither of those are propaganda in the sense that Fox News or Breitbart are.  I mostly watch CBS for live stuff or PBS News.  PBS often seems best as they don't try stirring up controversies, presumably for viewers, like many others.  Again though, that's different from Fox News-style ideological, conspiracy theory laden, racism laden, nauseating doublethink stupidity.

&gt; If I watch the news, I watch the local stations here in Louisville. I read.

Well, I never said you don't watch local news, you're meandering off topic again.

&gt;You need the whole quote there, my friend. And why, exactly, is this a problem, that he said that? 

*Why isn't it?*  That's a huge problem.  It's way beneath the standards of what someone with the responsibility of US president should say because it's bigoted stupidity, and rallies and panders to those qualities in voters.

&gt;Was there actually a 100% ""ban"" on Muslims?

Do you have problems with reading?  Reread my previous comment, Mr. Engineer.

&gt;And is that actually a problem anyway

*Of course banning all Muslims from the US would be a problem*.  This is why it is difficult for people like me to tolerate talking to people like yourself.  

&gt;It's not like Muslims are an ethnic group, after all. It's a demonstrably hostile and violent ideology. We should vet people who claim to hold to it.

*No*, Islam is not a ""violent ideology"".  By your logic, then I might assume all Christians are narcissistic, bigoted idiots.  I know that they're not however, that such would be a hasty generalization, and that it's really just a small minority of Christians who are.

&gt;Oh, so that means Trump must be a racist. Because other people are happy with him. I'm a devout Christian, and I'm happy with the job he's doing. So does that make him a devout Christian now? I'm confused by your logic.

You seem easily confused by logic generally, or just to have reading difficulties, because I said that *in response to you* saying 

&gt;I can't imagine racists being too happy with him, can you?

So, no I wasn't making that argument at all.  Nice attempt at a strawman though.  

&gt;     

&gt;He said a lot of illegal immigrants are rapists and criminals. This is a true statement, by the way. It just so happens that most illegal immigrants are also not white. So...do they get a pass because they are people of color? Was he not supposed to call out criminal activity? Did that hurt the criminals' feelings?

Again, pay attention to context.  It's not anyone else's responsibility to explain stuff like this to you because you won't pay attention, so this is another example of why you are hard to tolerate in interactions like this, because you arrogantly respond as if there's a ""debate"" despite that you don't track any logical consistency.  It would be like if Socrates had a dialog with a parrot.  

I mentioned Trump's comments of immigrants being ""rapists"" because I was describing why he seems blatantly racist.  So your leading questions are again entirely irrelevant and misleading.

&gt;Oh, so not real Jews.

Another strawman.  

&gt;It doesn't ""count"" because Ivanka converted? 

No, that's not what I meant.  To explain to you again what we were talking about:  you said he couldn't be racist because Ivanka converted to Judaism, and I replied that she was an adult convert.  That was all I said, because what we were talking about was racism, not religion.  Being Jewish (whether an Israeli, from a several generation Jewish family, or an adult convert) does not disqualify someone from being racist.  *So your argument to which I responded was already moot,* before you redirected to this.  My point about her being an adult convert was just that it's not like the Trump family had evaded Nazi persecution or something.

&gt;&gt;he's proud of his ""German blood"".
&gt;
&gt;Oh no. My whole family has German blood. Are we racists, too!? So does most of Louisville! What do we do!?

Trump has infamously brought it up in some narcissistic stupid way as usual to say that his genes are superior for being German.  If your family comes from Germany, great, but the fact that you somehow missed that point is evidence enough that German heritage does *not* make someone a master race innate genius.  

&gt;You understand that religious private schools don't generally get federal funding, right? I went to 12 years of Catholic school in Louisville paying tuition. And it was ""legitimate"" enough for me and thousands of others to succeed in college and beyond.

Sorry, I meant state funds, not federal.  I meant schools like this shouldn't be able to get public/state funds or tax credits.  

And what I meant about educational standards is that basically if they don't teach evolution, legitimate peer reviewed science, history, other subjects, they should be considered as achieving legal K12 standards.

Again, pointing to yourself being whatever kind of engineer is either totally irrelevant, or actually an argument against religious education given the nonsense of your comments.  Being an engineer is irrelevant because it does not exclude irrationality.

&gt;

&gt;&gt;which might cherry pick to condemn homosexuality, or eating oysters or whatever else
&gt;
&gt;Huh?

If someone were to take from the Bible the interpretation that homosexuality is unethical they might interpret literally its condemnation of eating shellfish, wearing multiple different fabrics of cloth, working on Sunday, etc.. Thought this would be an obvious point.

&gt;Well, give me a chance! We're just getting started, after all. My ""knowledge"" is based on facts. My opinions are based on experience, which age has given me in abundance. Like I said, I'm an engineer. I know and love math, science, civics, statistics, economics, and data analysis. I'm also an ordained Christian minister and Bible teacher. So I know more than my share about the Christian faith (and others).

Apparently despite your 'experience' or 'knowledge' you don't realize there is no ""the Christian faith"".  There are many different interpretations of Christianity, just as there are Islam, Buddhism, and so on.

Okay, truly this is my last comment and realize odds are about .00001% you will change your mind about any of these topics.  I'll point out again that it's really arrogant to constantly respond with nonsense as if by responding with anything means a 'debate' is ongoing without comprehending and tracking the content, context, and arguments back and forth, and actually being amenable to reason.",1579816825,ffdarhf
2564,cl1ft,"You seem like a reasonably minded individual...

From my POV having watched a lot of this coverage a couple things are clear:
- The Democrats have made it quite clear they aren't interesting in governance.  They've basically done none since the 2016 election.  Its quite clear that their entire reason for existence is to remove Trump from office.  From the phony Steele Dossier, the disproved Russian Collusion, to this basis for impeachment (of which there is none) its all been gaslighting leading up to the 2020 election... that much should be clear.

The president is of course not all powerful.... but its a very well established precedent that he has the right to weed out corruption in the gov't.  The Biden family has deep ethical violations in numerous areas.. Joe Biden himself, his son, his brother and sister... there are hundreds of millions of dollars tied to this family, their connections to foreign relations and cronyism.  Legally this is a case where smoke tells us there is fire.

The precedent for quid pro quo is also firmly established in foreign relations, which is why its laughable that the Democrats acted like its an impeachable offense.  Quid pro quo for the advancement of the country, its stability and largess is perfectly acceptable.  Its perfectly in the president's power to say you won't get something unless you do something.  Did anyone say anything about the quid pro quo in North Korean foreign policy, what about China?  Nope... so we are back to the question of did Trump solely do this to knock Joe Biden out of presidential running?

If none of the corruption was pre-existing in Biden's family, directly tied to Ukrainian affairs, if Joe Biden himself wasn't recorded on video bragging about how he stopped an investigation from occurring into his cronyism, if Hunter Biden was an honorable, skilled individual who had some business being on the Burisma board... IF none of that was true I'd say maybe we should consider Trump's reason for his call.  If the Democrat playbook wasn't well established and documented (remove Trump at all odds, using any means necessary, even bending state apparatus of wiretapping, warrants, etc.)... I'd say we should consider Trump's reason for the call.

Its wonderful that we have the ability to impeach... I'll agree with you on that, but me calling this a farce is not directed at that mechanism.  Me calling it a farce is the spirit its being used in.  The house knew from day one the Senate would never pass this as it had no teeth.  There are no high crimes and misdemeanors.  Pelosi waiting for weeks to send this to the Senate was solely done to draw it out... her and her squad acted as if they were deeply pained at doing it yet they passed out gold plated pens with her name on them at the signing... Pelosi wears a bracelet with a golden bullet on it.. there are numerous people with her who have a deep-seated hatred for the duly elected president.

Why is that?  Its because Trump is a source of direct contradiction to their deep seated power and corruption.  This is how these people make themselves and their families very, very rich.  I don't know much about you but I would imagine you go to work every day and work hard... you have dreams and aspirations and probably go about your life in the public or private sector, generating products or services that enhance your community and provide for your family.  Folks like Joe Biden have been in government for 30-40 years... and they make millions through shady connections, boards, lobbyists, etc.  Trump is a direct affront to the swamp and people that's why TDS is so commonplace with so many DC politicians.  Trump didn't come to DC having to rely on their power structure.

If they had exculpatory evidence they would release it, but every new piece of information that comes out makes things look worse for team Trump. I've said it before and I've yet to be wrong. More information will come out and it will make things look even worse. 

Also, the Democrats aren't interested in governance?  Thats just not true. There are literally hundreds of pieces of legislation that went through the Democratically controlled house that never made it to the Senate floor thanks to Mitch McConnell. 

Do some research into Newt Gingrich if you want to understand why there is so much gridlock in government. Mitch was a protege of his, and they use the exact same playbook to make government as ineffective as possible...",1579842656,ffec1lz

""""Abuse of power"" is largely a criminal affair, yet relies on specific abuses to be defined"""" I think Schiff and crew have been pretty thorough here.  Have you watched the hearings on any other channel besides Fox?  

Don't cite Clinton thinking I'm gonna defend the guy. I would have no problem if Clinton would have been removed from office. I think lying under oath is problematic, for any reason, regardless of party. Unfortunately even most the Republicans in the Senate at the time wouldn't convict him.

2647,Hawk4192,"I truly love how many assumptions about me you make in your post.

The criminality of ""abuse of power"" has not been cited.  They would have listed it as the actual charge, rather than the vague nonsense the letter of impeachment contained.

Obstruction of congress in this case is wanting to exercise executive privilege.  That is a common process that has been conducted in literally every presidency in history.  That is why there is a 3rd branch of government.  3 coequal branches to be able to have a tie breaker.
Congress, the legislative branch, demands something from the President, or the executive branch.  As a coequal branch, they do not have to immediately comply to a demand.  They can challenge it.  That is where the courts, the judicial branch, steps in.  The 3rd branch hears the arguments and makes a ruling.  If the loser of that ruling continue to deny, then you have an obstruction case.

The Democrats have not wanted to wait on that, because they know their case is practically non-existent.  The court would strike down their demands and they would have nothing at all.

2650,murrayky1990,"Assertions that you are willfully ignorant and are on the wrong side of history cease to be assumptions when you make them evident. Trump's crimes prior to and during his presidency are well established, however, we've already established that criminality is not a prerequisite for impeachment. You're getting hung up on something non-essential.

The fact that you think the Democrats don't have a case shows your ignorance. Abuse of power? Trump violated the Impoundment Control Act. Hence the frantic behind the scenes scramble to retroactively justify withholding the aid, and that's just what they haven't managed to hide, thanks to FOIA we'll learn even more as time goes on, and it won't exonerate Trump, I'll put money on that. 

Additionally, similarly to attorney-client privilege, and hiding crime. You can't use executive privilege to hide evidence of wrongdoing. With that said, the Democrats can't afford to wait for the courts because they have seen how this plays out numerous times prior. Trump constantly abuses the court system, and it will take years before a subpoena can be enforced.  We're still waiting on a ruling to see Trump's tax returns, despite the fact that he promised to release them himself. (Not to mention the problems with Mitch's blatant and shameless court packing at all levels, but you're good with that too I'm sure. Both sides steal Supreme Court seats right?)

I've said it before, but I will say it again. I have no problem with investigating criminality or wrongdoing, but that's not what was occuring in this Ukraine scandal. If all of this was above board why would Trump use Rudy and company to do the Justice Departments job? Why would Rudy write that letter to Zelensky saying he is acting as Trump's personal attorney? Why was Rudy acting like a maniac on Fox and Friends this week?

The answers here are fairly obvious, but you seem to have to have things spelled out for you. It's because what they were doing was/is wrong, and they knew if they were caught they would be in the situation they are currently in. If what Trump was doing was all good, why would he lie about not knowing Lev Parnas, despite the fact that they shared an attorney, had numerous pictures together, and in the last day we've seen  an hour long video of them together at a private dinner? 

I seriously don't understand how you can defend this stuff without realizing how bad/stupid it makes you look. Do you really think it is more likely that Trump was trying to root out corruption in Ukraine vs. trying to damage a political rival in an election year? Use common sense dude.

I should also mention that in May of this year the DOD certified that the Ukraine had met there anti-corruption benchmarks and recommend releasing 125 million in aid, so that anti-corruption argument is nonsense as well. 

You also need to get off this tribal bullshit and understand that seeing Trump for what he is doesn't make someone a Democrat. I will definitely be voting for the Democratic nominee in November because at this point they're all much better than Trump ( I pray to God it isn't Joe Biden though), but I have voted for numerous Republicans at the local, state, and national level. Politics isn't team sports. You don't have to support someone just because he's ""on your team"".

Keep in mind, too, on the county level, particularly in rural counties, deputy jailers are not paid that well. And that is another big sticking point.

So, you and I pay county taxes, and they don’t really fund the county jail at any meaningful level. A lot of county jails take state and federal inmates, because they bring in a higher per diem. Not to mention, they apply for grants, take on programs, and do other things to make funding stretch farther.

However, even knowing this, and that many county jails are overcrowded and underfunded? That’s still not an excuse not to follow the law. The law says that if an inmate is found not guilty, you return the inmate’s jail fees. Inmates are typically poor and uneducated, looking at pretty much every crime stat ever, and they’re the most likely to get screwed over by the system. Add systemic racism in, and it gets worse.

And this seems to be the story behind it: https://www.kentuckyliving.com/lifestyle/byron-crawford/the-rest-of-the-story

&gt;Don Fulford of Perryville, Missouri, wrote to say that he’s responsible.

&gt;In April 2008, while living in Elizabethtown, he took a job in Versailles and was driving 83 miles one-way each morning and evening. 

&gt;“After several months of this drive I noticed a very lonely looking evergreen sitting all by itself at mile marker 18,” Fulford says. “I couldn’t figure out why they hadn’t cut it down when they cleared the rest of the side of the road, and why it spoke to me each morning and night as I took that long, lonely drive.”

&gt;He’d read an inspirational article called The Trouble Tree (author unknown), about handling stress by figuratively hanging one’s troubles on a tree each evening and picking them up the next morning. So, when his wife handed him a box of old Christmas ornaments they found while cleaning the attic that summer, Fulford smiled and put them in his car. Then he began hanging a few on the lonesome cedar before daylight each morning.

&gt;“The tree was much smaller back then, and I could actually reach the top!”

&gt;Fulford says he hoped it would give others a smile, and perhaps great memories of Christmases gone by.

&gt;He thought the story would end there, but it didn’t. Soon, others began hanging more ornaments on the tree, and even a small string of solar lights.

&gt;“I’ve since moved away, but still get texts from friends who smile when they see the tree,” he writes. “I was always worried about getting in trouble, so I’ve never used my name—but hopefully the good law people of the state realize it was all done in the spirit of living and Christmas.

Lexington has a number of great parks. We always go to Jacobson Park. They have a nice playground and in summer time they turn on the water park. There are a decent number of family friendly festivals throughout the years. Malibu Jack's is always a fun way to spend the afternoon. And Lexington has a great nightlife. One of our favorites is Bourbon on Rye. You walk in and you have a feeling of almost stepping back in time. The bar itself dates back to the 1880s with all the beauty and splendor of that bygone era. The seating allows for intimate conversation. Or you can sit up and the bar and strike up a conversation with the bar tenders as you peruse the large bourbon selection. For a more local feel, check out Survivors. Don't let looks fool you. From the outside, it looks like a rough biker bar. But once in, you can meet the locals and sip on a good selection of beers and liquors while hearing your favorite songs be sung with ease or butchery. 

If the bar scene is your scene, there are plenty of local breweries to check out.  My personal favorite is West Sixth. The brewery itself is alive with art, music, convention, and good beer. And it is also, if I remember (don't quote me on this) kid friendly. Or there is Talon Winery outside the city by 10 minutes. The main building is in one of the oldest houses in the state, built in the 1790s. Go up to the bar and pay $5 to sample the wines, than buy your favorite bottle. Head outside to relax, enjoy the peace, the life music during the warm months, and let the kids run around and play.

Lexington has a great selections of restaurants as well. My wife and I love Bourbon Toulouse. Great Cajun food in a relaxed setting. The food feels like good comfort food and you get amazing portions. Half an order of the Cajun food with a pulled pork sandwich between my wife and I fills us both up. If you want a good Indian restaurant, check out Taj. I don't know how many times I've been there to be the only non-Indian patron. But the staff is friendly. The food is amazing with the rich flavors you would expect from good, authentic Indian food.

Geebus, do you people even hear yourselves. It's like you think people are literal Snidely Whiplashes instead of actually just believing there are better answers out there.

I'm opposed to the current education system because of the excessive waste and lack of adaptation top-down bureaucratic models bring. It doesn't allow schools the ability to change and adapt to meet their local population needs or to try new and innovative things, because the only reasonable manner to assess performance is through test-driven curriculums that allow abstract performance measures. 

The expense isn't the classrooms. It isn't the teachers. It's administrative cost. That's more money being diverted away from where it would be most effective or from actually paying teachers a higher salary. Voucher systems can both simultaneously reduce the need for test-driven environments by placing performance on parent-based evaluation and demand (AKA the people closest and most connected to the child and most likely the most concerned with their development) and eliminate much of the bureaucratic overhead that hasn't proven to improve the quality of schools. It also has the potential to attract alternatives to regions where there are literally none outside of the failing public school.

After the significant failures of several of the past top-down reforms intended to change curriculum and improve performance, it should be obvious we need to allow schools the individual ability to adapt and change and let reforms spread dynamically, as it does in most every other field, including higher education.",1580188720,ffsqa9w

“We study the impact of the minimum wage hike in Seattle from $9.47 to $13 on wagebill, labor demand, and firm revenue using administrative data from the state of Washington. We show that the minimum wage affected businesses both at the intensive and extensive margins. At the intensive margin, businesses increased their labor costs and adjusted to the minimum wage by mildly reducing demand for low-wage jobs, but *they largely did not pass the increase in labor costs to prices.* At the extensive margin, the minimum wage led to higher rates of business exit and shifted the composition of entering businesses towards less labor-intensive businesses. Finally, we find that the extensive margin and the intensive margin effects were of the same order of magnitude, and were equally important for understanding the impacts of the minimum wage.”",1580188910,ffsqhlv

Lexington:
Smaller town feel, lots of stuff is based on who you know or what church you go to. Can have a nice sense of community. 

Worst part of Lex is the poor road design. Traffic is awful. There’s no interstate through town, so you spend forever trying to get out of town if you want to travel. 

Schools aren’t bad for the most part. 

There isn’t a lot to do in Lexington, honestly. Maybe because I grew up there and I’ve seen it all? I feel like Louisville has a lot more going on all the time. 

Louisville:
Much larger city. Lots to do, easy to travel out from here, reasonable traffic patterns. 

Schools are hit or miss. Some are really bad. Some are awesome. Jefferson county has it set up where you can apply for other schools in the county, so you have a lot of choices. 

You can live over the river in Indiana or in an outlying smaller town in KY and commute in pretty easily if you don’t want to be in the city. 

We live just outside of St. Matthews and love it. Our neighborhood is pretty quiet and safe for kids to ride around on bikes alone. Lots of kids are always out playing. We’re minutes from great places to eat and shopping. 

Downside is violence in Louisville in general, but if you can afford to live in a nicer area (east side or small town out of the city) then you will probably really like it here!

3044,Powerism,"&gt; I believe there is a difference between ‘a natural right of man’ and the rights granted to Americans through the constitution. Two very different things. 

Luckily for us, those who drafted the Constitution disagreed with you 100%.  Rights are not “granted to Americans through the Constitution,” as you wrote.  Rather, they are unalienable, natural rights that are *enumerated* - not *granted* - by the constitution.  The constitution **does not** grant rights, rather it **lists those rights with which all humans are born.**

From the Declaration of Independence:

&gt; We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed

From the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution:

&gt; The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

Alexander Hamilton in *Federalist 84* wrote:

&gt; Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power.

This is because the bill of rights was added as a redundancy in order to get the Constitution passed.  The anti-federalist / federalist compromise (incorporating the bill of rights into the Constitution) is one of the first great examples of bipartisanship.  The constitution *does grant privileges*, for example Article 1 grants specific, limited powers to the legislature, Article 2 to the executive branch, and Article 3 to the federal judiciary.  These limited powers are granted; the bill of rights specifically enumerates what the government *cannot do.*. 

With that being said, I totally get what you’re saying about the problems we face in society, and it’s a travesty that healthcare is as expensive as it is.  We’re on the same team as far as progressing society forward.  But we must do so within the restrictions of what the constitution allows, **because our liberty is natural and cannot be impeded**, even for the “betterment of society” that your ideals compel.",1580241080,ffufur9

3089,festizian,"It's not something I'm debating, I was trying to get you to elucidate your position further before I told you why it is shortsighed. ""Problem kids"" frequently come from backgrounds of poverty. They have often been subjected to physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. They often lack the support to succeed educationally and emotionally at their homes. The existence of the bar at its current location is because those kids deserve every single opportunity to improve before you give them the boot to make your life easier. 

I mentor a child who is developmentally delayed because his mother was a drug addict. By the time he was removed from that home, he was 3.5 years old, and he would mime the process of injecting heroin, because that was what he saw. His grades are awful. He has oppositional defiant disorder. He tries his best. His adoptive mother is trying everything, including weekly in home counseling sessions and reaching out to find him a mentor like me. 

You are not aware of all of the issues facing ""problem kids"". Even an IEP doesn't fully encapsulate that student. To suggest that it should be made easier for people like my mentee to be booted from the pubic education sector is, frankly, apalling to me. And that is coming from the child of two educators, one of whom is a Milken Educator Award recipient, who have never, and would never, make the suggestion you have here.

3102,drunken-teacher,"Before I attack this argument I want you to know that I understand your points and furthermore I think they come from a place of compassion.  I think they are fundamentally flawed but they are not coming from a place of malice.  You should be commended for doing work as a mentor.  No one takes that responsibility on lightly.  

I’ve intentionally withheld my credentials because I believe it’s a weak argument  if I have to rely on my credentials.  However because you accused me of ignorance in a few areas I’m going to give you a few.  I have 23 years classroom experience.  I’ve been tenured in both rural Kentucky schools that deal with opioid addiction like you can’t imagine.  I’ve also been tenured in an inner city school on the West end of Louisville.  Not only am I aware of the problems of poverty/addiction/abuse/mental illness/all other social ills, I’ve been up close and personal with all of them.  Like your parents, I also have a room full of awards, both from the high school level and university level.  To claim that I’m ignorant of these things is mildly insulting.  I’m going to continue this discussion because I’m enjoying it and I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that wasn’t a personal attack.  

I’m extremely well read on research concerning students that have dealt with trauma.  It’s really fucking bleak!  I feel for anyone that has had major trauma in their life.  Your mentee is a perfect example.  That child deserves every bit of compassion and mercy society can muster.  However, my line in the sand is when that child’s actions infringe upon his/her classmates right to a safe and prosperous learning environment.  His trauma does not and should not give him a pass to be violent towards classmates or teachers.  His trauma does not excuse him being verbally abusive to a teacher or bullying someone else.  When he/she crosses that line, my proposal is that expulsion is the solution.  

You want that child to have an infinite number of chances because he/she has experience very real issues.  What you’re failing to realize is that in your attempts to save one child, you’re sacrificing educational opportunities for the other 30 students in whatever class they are causing problems in.  My stance is that it’s a lesser evil to expel the problem than to sacrifice the other 30 in the class.

As for your credentials, I think their relevance can be pretty roundly disregarded in this debate, seeing as you stand in direct opposition to the administrators, counselors, and other experts who are specifically educated and engaged in the actual setting of disciplinary guidelines. Detentions, ISS, suspensions, visits with principals and counselors, transfers. For all but the most extreme examples, these and the similar are more appropriate steps for students who disrupt your idyllic educational environment than outright expulsion. If you have an issue with a student disrupting your educational environment, you do indeed have the obligation to send them for discipline. The examples you gave go beyond disruptions to educational environments, and sometimes could border on criminal. And in a school with a normal and well engaged administration, harsh discipline, including expulsion, isn't something that needs any kind of modification to be included as options for those instances. 

There are indeed behaviors, especially violent, which could be, should be, and are responded to with expulsion regardless of the student's history. Happened at my school when my AP English teacher was knocked out while breaking up a fight over a girl. However, the guidelines at private schools, which you offer up as your desired template, do not only include the things you've listed as reasons for expulsion. Hell, a girl just got expelled from her private school in Louisville for a rainbow shirt she wore at her birthday dinner. The processes leading up to and including expulsion in public schools exist to protect students from overbearing disciplinarians who would infringe upon their right to an education over issues unworthy of expulsion. 

Nobody is asking that students be given unlimited chances, or suggesting that there aren't actions for which expulsion is immediately valid. They're only asking that you leave discipline and behavior modification to the people who know how/when/what degree to do it fairly, and stop espousing hyperbole that makes public school teachers look discompassionate assholes who would rather jump to the terminus than take an incremental approach. 

Identifying oneself as a member of a community or profession turns everything they say into a reflection of said community or profession. Your reflection is that of a discompassionate burn out, who lacks the patience to educate anyone but the easiest students. I don't want your commendations, I want you to stop displaying this attitude after identifying yourself as a teacher, because you do every public educator a disservice when you do.

3132,drunken-teacher,"Exactly how many days have you spent educating students?  Just curious?  I’ve watched students pull knives in public schools and get a 3 day suspension.  I’ve had more students than I care to count attempt to kill them selves over the years because of the bullying they receive from student that you seem to want to keep in public schools.  Guess what, school administrators never intervened.  On a weekly basis teacher are subject to verbal abuse from students.  You brought up the teacher that got hit breaking up a fight, that’s so common place now that we’re instructed not to break up fights we’re supposed to call the SRO.   This isn’t hyperbole sir,  it’s literally everyday life in some schools.  This is why public education sucks in some areas.  

As for burnout...quite the contrary.  I’m happy as fuck everyday I go to work.  I, like many other veteran teachers made the decision to not work for school districts that have those problems.  You can hate my guts if you want but I’m good as fuck at teaching chemistry and physics.  My AP pass rates way exceed national averages.  Most of my students head off to top level engineering schools and have success.  Many of them come back to my classroom as guest speakers.  I also coach a top level wrestling team.  Every year my program sends wrestlers off to college with athletic scholarships.  Don’t make assumptions about me just because you don’t like my stance on school tax credits and charter schools.  I fucking love my job.  Tomorrow I’ll be starting my unit on chemical thermodynamics and Enthalpy to a group of students that actually care about what I teach.  When I’m done, I’ll go down to the wrestling room and prepare 23 great young men and 3 tremendous young women for our regional tournament.   

This does however lead to another point.  I’ve worked in shit school districts where discipline goes by the wayside in the name of they’re poor or they don’t know any better or whatever excuse you want to provide.  Here’s a fact you won’t like; those schools can’t keep good teachers.  Those of us that are actually good at our jobs won’t stay in a shitty situation.  There’s not enough of us to go around so we have our pick of where we want to work. Pay attention to the staff at an underperforming school.  It’s all young teachers fresh out of college.  Most department heads have less than 5 years of experience.   Good qualified teachers leave for better situations, ergo perpetuating the cycle of terrible public schools.   

Hey man, if you have a better solution than tax credits and charter schools please by all means propose that solution.  It seems though your solution is just throw more tax payer money into the already broken school system.

&gt; Less than two months after the ban was enacted, Mosley drove 250 miles to the western Kentucky city along the Ohio River to join the county&amp;#039;s jailer in seeking an exemption for the jail.

&gt; Mosley is one of at least four elected Kentucky j.ailers who have capitalized on the e-cigarette boom, either by forming companies that sell vaping products to inmates in other jails or.

&gt; Each e-cigarette at the Carroll County Detention Center now costs $14. It&amp;#039;s the most expensive item sold at a lobby kiosk that also has socks for $1, underwear for $4 and shoes for $10. But the price per e-cigarette is an improvement, according to the current jailer John Proctor, who said he considered the cost for families when he changed suppliers after Humphrey left office.

3148,festizian,"All told, I can't tell you how many days I've spent educating students. I spent an hour each day of my senior year as a teaching assistant for delayed class of students taking algebra. In college, I was a TA who assisted in the education of skills and scenarios for EMT courses for two semesters. In my current job, I precept (read: educate in a working environment, kind of like an apprenticeship) myriad EMT and Paramedic students. I'd guess at least a few of years worth if you tallied up the hours to match with a teacher's schedule. 

However, just like your experience, all of this this is *completely irrelevant* to the debate at hand. Exactly how many days exactly have you spent as an administrator or counselor handling student discipline? You were absolutely correct when you said that credentials are a weak argument. In the 13 sentences comprising the 2nd paragraph of your latest response, there wasn't a single one of them that was relevant to the matter at hand. It was simply bloviation for the failed purpose of making yourself out to actually be an authority on this issue.

You not being allowed to intervene in a fight is not a matter of frequency or severity, or an indicator of how many more students should be expelled, it is a matter of financial and legal liability. Your inclusion of this as support for your stance points directly to a lack of understanding of the administrative process. 

The hyperbole I identified was not any of your examples of extreme discipline issues, it was your proposal that across the state, discipline problems are so pervasive and extreme that they require strict adjustment of discipline standards to enable easier expulsion. Your anecdotally based lack of administrative action and support is not evidence of a need for a system wide disenfranchisement of students from the established disciplinary steps. 

Speaking of lack of administrative support, I'd like to point out that you've completely undermined your entire argument for stricter and earlier expulsion. 

&gt; I, like many other veteran teachers made the decision to not work for school districts that have those problems...Those of us that are actually good at our jobs won’t stay in a shitty situation.

There are places that do not have the problem you've identified. You purport to currently work in one, and that it is a public school. Do those districts have a different set of instructions from the state board of education? Did Wayne Lewis descend from Frankfort and say ""Your school district henceforth can discipline students as a private school would.""? If not, and your school district is a place devoid of the problems you have highlighted, then it is not an issue whose solution requires the action you have suggested. 

&gt;Guess what, school administrators never intervened.

This is the actual issue at hand here. Administrators not giving their front line the support they need to foster the best learning environment. If you previously had administrators that would not intervene, but now you do and everything is hunky dory, I think I found your solution for you (and it's not the taxpayer dollars you saddled a strawman with!). Demand more of your administrators and those above them in the school district. You're pointing at students a finger which should be pointed instead at the administrators who allow issues like these to fester and worsen, when they have options at their disposal to negate or mitigate them. Changing the rules because the ones you already have aren't being enforced in some places is asinine.

3195,tgjer,"Since anything relating to trans youth and medical treatment almost inevitably brings out the *""kids are being castrated!""* and *""90% of trans kids desist and will regret transition!""* concern trolling:

No, that is not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 

The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth. For preadolescents it is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.

Any competent doctor or therapist who has any reasonable grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/) than that, but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes, the gender identity expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The gender identities of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender identity, and some of those young kids are trans. A child whose gender identity is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their appearance, will suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.

When this happens, transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is purely social; it consists of allowing the child to express their gender identity as comes naturally to them. If they just have gender atypical interests or clothing preferences, let them have the toys and clothes they want. If they want to use a name or pronouns atypical to the gender they were previously assumed to be, let them do that too. If they later decide they don't want to do this anymore, nothing has been changed that can't be changed back in an afternoon. Let the child explore their gender, there's no reason not to.

For adolescents, the first line of medical intervention is puberty delaying treatment. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment, then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects, and it significantly improves trans youth's mental health and [**lowers suicidality**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/01/21/peds.2019-1725).

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning, about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition, that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

Transition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/).

And ""regret"" rates among trans surgical patients (who again, are all young adults or older) are consistently found to be about 1% and falling. This includes a lot of people who are very happy they transitioned, and continue to live as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth, but regret that medical error or shitty luck led to low quality surgical results.

This is a risk in any reconstructive surgery, and a success rate of about 99% is astonishingly good for any medical treatment. And ""regret"" rates have been going down for decades, as surgical methods improve.

* [**Care of the Patient Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS)**](http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf) \- *Persistent regret among post-operative transsexuals has been studied since the early 1960s. The most comprehensive meta-review done to date analyzed 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies published between 1961 and 1991 (1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients). The authors concluded that in this 30 year period, &lt;1% of female-to-males (FTMs) and 1-1.5% of male-to-females (MTFs) experienced persistent regret following SRS. Studies published since 1991 have reported a decrease in the incidence of regret for both MTFs and FTMs that is likely due to improved quality of psychological and surgical care for individuals undergoing sex reassignment.*

First, Joe Biden did not “get him” a job.  They did hire him because of who his dad is, that is beyond dispute.  But Joe Biden did not IN ANY WAY try and make them/get them to hire him.  That is equally beyond dispute. If you don’t like famous and powerful people and their children having opportunities you wouldn’t have - reject capitalism, not Joe Biden.

Second, Joe Biden’s son being on the board at a natural gas company is by definition not a conflict of interest because Joe Biden doesn’t benefit directly from it, and has nothing to do with any of it, other than being someone’s dad.  McConnell, on the other hand, has taken an oath to be an impartial juror (on top of his oath to protect the constitution that he breaks every single day)...taking thousands of dollars in bribes from one of the sides in a trial you are supposed to be impartial in is literally the definition of conflict of interest.",1580406777,fg0flqc

[http://www.gunowners.org/pdf/2014gunfacts.pdf](http://www.gunowners.org/pdf/2014gunfacts.pdf)

And I'll also offer that typically suicide is included in the sources that say it does. Including yours. I think it's a terrible thing when someone takes their life. But it shouldn't be included in the same statistics when comparing Murders and People Assaulting one another. 

 [https://medium.com/handwaving-freakoutery/everybodys-lying-about-the-link-between-gun-ownership-and-homicide-1108ed400be5](https://medium.com/handwaving-freakoutery/everybodys-lying-about-the-link-between-gun-ownership-and-homicide-1108ed400be5) 

Best case scenario there's no correlation. Worst case it might be domestic disputes (not 100% sure on this. There are conflicting sources which is why I didn't link any) Which again, is awful but I don't think it should be lumped in with Murder if it is true. 

Even if we assume that weapons/tools being more available for people who want to use them causes more violence (which again it doesn't) It still wouldn't trump mine or even your right to self defense/self preservation and yes this includes a preservation of themselves against the state itself.

3469,Fuzzyphilosopher,"It's a lot harder to shoot moving people at a distance with a pistol than a rifle though. So if you're going for mass murder you def want an AR. I grew up and enjoy target shooting with pistols but I had a nifty [CAR-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR-15) back before all the fancy new optical &amp; laser sights and I swear a 12 year old girl could wreak havoc with one. It's so easy to carry 
 (with ammo) &amp; shoot that I think it is the best rifle ever built. For killing people anyway. 5.56mm isn't a good hunting caliber unless you're going after groundhogs or wild pigs. 

It's true that pistols are more easily concealed and used for most murders because they usually happen at close range where accuracy is not a factor. 

I'd wager the nut job who shot up the Walmart in El Paso would've done a helluva lot less harm if only armed with a pistol. Same for other terrorist shootings. Plus a police bullet proof vest is going to stop most pistol rounds. I don't think many law enforcement officers have vests rated to protect against 5.56/.223 so that's also a concern. 

I don't fit on either side of the gun debate, I think hunting and eating game is far more humane than buying animals at the supermarket, gets you in touch with nature, pistols have their place but I don't want to feel like I need to carry one. 

In a perfect world I guess I'd go for everything being limited to 5 or 6 rounds. It's plenty for hunting and not a pain in the ass for target shooting and if someone goes psycho and starts shooting and I'm unarmed it increases my odds of running or being able to charge and bash his brains in. 

I don't buy the argument that our rifles will protect us from the government, hell my local PD has 2 MRAPs. It's an army town so not normal but I hope you get my point. Armored humvees are much more common and btw fuck Don Rumsfeld for smiling about it and making hillbilly armour a thing.

And of course as you already said the pro gun people are going to be behind it like I am. Me personally it strengthens my resolve. And now I'm here defending their actions and discussing it with people on a sub that is typically very left leaning (which usually means anti gun too). 

So all in all I think it has some merit to it. They made a bold statement to the government. They made something that people are looking and talking about and they did it peacefully and respectfully (I think).

If you're on the anti gun side maybe something like this will make you think twice before you say ""gun owners have no backbone"" etc. These guys all came to support something they cared about. 

They certainly went a little overboard. But as long as they are being peaceful and exercising their rights it's A-OK in my book.

Also 2A is really really not there to protect against tyranny, nor really for personal protection. It is there to provide for the national defense since there was no standing army.

And even if it had been originally intended against tyranny, that ship has simply sailed. There is no situation where the people successfully revolt against the 21st century American government.

That's literally what the 2nd is for. I can't think of a better example. It's to provide an option for the common people to scare the government/stop them from being tyrannical/pass unjust laws. 

I will agree with you that America has s*** get way out of control. And I know the same people you ate talking about. Literally none of the people that I know that are ready to overthrow the government want to kill liberals or queers and minorities. Their beef is with the federal government. That's it. 

To offer you some insight, I actually have 3 trans/gay friends here in the commonwealth that I've encouraged to get firearms for their own protection. One of them actually is one of the people who is worried about the government infringing on their rights. They even joined a local militia group.

The minorities are the people who need the 2nd even more so than the majority. A lot of gun control was passed by the government to keep the black population of the 20th century scared and unarmed. Gun control has a history rooted in racism. 

If you don't believe the 2nd amendment was setup to prevent the government from being tyrannical I would suggest you read the federalist papers or look into what Thomas Jefferson had to say. He had a conversation with a merchant who wanted to arm his ship with cannons and Jefferson's response was essentially ""um.. why are you even asking for permission?

If you're someone attending this rally, what do you think images like this invoke in people who disagree with you or may be on the fence on this issue?

The biggest obstacle pro-2A people have is that often times they're viewed as crazy gun-nuts and lunatics. Do you think these types of images help dispel that mindset?

My immediate thought upon seeing these images (not just this one) was that it looked like something out of a terrorist war zone, not the United States of America let alone a State Capitol building.

If anything, it seems to me (and I'm not saying this **was** the intention but it's how it looks to me) that they dressed this way and carried assault style weapons (as opposed to hand guns, hunting rifles, shotguns, etc) is strictly intimidation.

Most regular people see someone dressed in camo and a face covering with an assault-style weapon and their first thought is likely something related to war or terrorism. (Not saying it's accurate, merely that's often the first thing that comes to people's minds in my experience)

That's not even touching on the fact that the KSP allowed these men to just walk around metal detectors. No one should be allowed to skip the metal detectors...you're just asking for problems. It only takes ONE person.

""The typical argument for restrictive gun laws is based around the notion of a ""nut with a gun."" And I think for the majority of people this seems like pretty ""nutty"" behavior.

The question was

&gt;But if they get to bypass a security screening what stops that weapon from becoming a loaded weapon?

Put differently, how could anyone know any of the members of the group didn't have bullets and wouldn't start shooting?

The answer seems to be *no one did*.  The fact that no one got shot at the guns rights demonstration in Virginia means nothing.  

Even if their weapons were somehow checked for ammunition beforehand, having a bunch of AR15 or AK47 pattern weapons allowed by security implies a person need only get bullets in to cause havoc.   So, when you say

&gt;Because people trying to sneak a weapon in illegally are a lot different than people openly carrying an unloaded weapon as part of a peaceful protest....

that's totally backwards:  the difference (which was the point of the comment to which you replied) is that this works against the point of a security process., which is to mitigate danger or violence.  The fact that the weapons are in plain view means nothing if they're *allowed in*.

3749,naW7-zSvyeliQtSEP6vP,"&gt;The United States is already socialist, Medicare, libraries, public transportation, and other forms of social policy that we usually take for granted. 

Definitely the wrong response here.  Presuming what they mean by ""socialist"" is the politics of progressives or ""democratic socialists"" like Bernie Sanders, the truth is that *that isn't socialism*.  Sanders will point to countries like Norway or Sweden as models for DS, to which they have responding saying they are not ""socialist"" but are explicitly market capitalist countries, they just have a strong welfare system and so on.

Calling anything the government does for taxpayers ""socialism"" renders the word meaningless.  It might be an attempt at an argument like *if you like public funding for roads or fire departments, why not public healthcare?*, but it's still inaccurate.  

Notice my pointing this out is not an argument against ""socialism"".

&gt;Not to mention the tax breaks for the ultra wealthy, 500 billion last year given by the senate and trump is a form of socialism. Would you agree that 500 billion dollars could have been better used on the middle class than given to Wall Street billionaires? I can provide a source to show proof of this if you need or want proof.

This shows the self-contradiction of such a broad definition of socialism.  If it's mean to serve corporate interests that's definitely *not* the spirit or meaning of socialism in any legitimate interpretation.  Socialism is a way that either a strong central government or something like syndicates or communities will control resources to distribute them to basically everyone, so that by either means the workers or the state own the means of production (e.g. the factories, the farms, etc.), rather than private entities (e.g. factory owners, shareholders, etc.).  Bailing out corporations with taxpayer money is not socialism by any stretch.

Answering your question, yes obviously $500 billion dollars would have been better directed towards the ""middle class"", including the Bourgeoisie (upper middle class),  or the poor.   It would be a better way of actually providing *representation* for taxation if one would rather frame it like that.",1580589255,fg7cky3

To be blunt, blaming Democrats for Mitch McConnell is very stupid.

This was never really true, and definitely isn't nowadays.

Those who have grown up in rural areas or who farm or whatever are *not* stupid.  County maps of the US do show rural areas are mostly less educated or generally ""well-to-do"", but that's not enough to say rural people are stupid, that's counterproductive and inaccurate hasty generalization.  If anything, current 'conservative' ideology of Republican party is antithetical to the kind of isolated ideology of ""hollers"" before.  And farming requires a lot of knowledge and skills, as does basically any ""blue collar"" work.  This narrative is counterproductive because it characterizes as stupid the very people who ""liberal"" politics try to support, i.e. workers, and propagates this useless blue collar/white collar ideological distinction.

The United States Government has extensively studied the concept of second American Civil War (along the assumption that it will be left versus right. HMM. I WONDER WHY THEY MIGHT POSSIBLY DO THAT.)

Their conclusion is as follows: They don’t have a snowball’s chance in Hell of winning. The moment civil war is declared, the government loses. No scenario or outcome ends in their success. Period. It’s just a matter of how long it takes.

A longer analysis will follow, but here are the salient points.

**30% of the American population will actively revolt.**

This alone is enormous and damning. Historically, you only need 10% of the population to actively participate in a rebellion to successfully overthrow the establishment: We only had 15% of the population actively attempting to throw out the British during the Revolutionary War; roughly 70% of what remained was neutral and simply stood by. By contrast, 30% of Americans in modern America would support a revolution to stop their own government if it happened tomorrow That’s how discontent the people are and how much the people don’t support the government.

**The government would need infrastructure more than rebels would.**

Already working with significant handicaps, the establishment would need electricity, access to the Internet, bridges, and airports to coordinate any active campaign against the rebellion. By contrast, the rebellion can work in the dark. Considering how easy it would be to sabotage US infrastructure, one of the first things the rebellion would do is collapse bridges, destroy, or seize power plants, and cover the Interstate in IEDs. This is relatively simple to accomplish, and it would inflict enormous damage on the establishment’s ability to restore order. It would also cost an enormous amount of time and effort to fix any sabotage, because the establishment would need to provide military protection to any workers attempting to rebuild, which is a drain their active fighting personnel resources that they could not afford.

**Taking America in a land war is almost impossible.**

The United States is absolutely full of natural terrain chokepoints, making marching an army across it against armed resistance almost impossible, and it is large enough that no sustained air campaign would be possible. The Japanese Admiralty realized this themselves during WWII, which is why many of them were against attempting to invade. Also, by an interesting coincidence, most of those chokepoints are in hard conservative states, where the resistance would be strongest. The government would lack the ability to reclaim its own land by force, especially when the previous point about infrastructure is taken into account. President Lincoln, on the matter of potential European involvement in the first American Civil War, stated, “All the armies of Europe with a Bonaparte as a commander, could not take a drink from the Ohio.”

**A significant majority–between 55 and 70%–of the military would defect to the side of the citizens.**

The problem with suppressing the people with a military, that literature and fantasy tend to overlook or ignore, is that the military is the people, too. In order to get any military to fight their own, you first have to convince them that it is necessary to do so–that it is justified. The Communists also ran into this problem, but they overcame it with psychological conditioning and creating a dog-eat-dog atmosphere within the military. The American government having actively recruited people who are patriotic, practical, brave, who have civilian families, and having reinforced those values throughout their training process, lacks the ability to convince the majority of their fighting force to engage against their own people. The moment a civil war breaks out, over half of the American military will defect to the rebel side. They will bring military gear with them and, more dangerous, military training. lt only takes one Navy Seal or Army Ranger to potentially train hundreds of civilians into a dangerous resistance force. They’ve done it before, in other nations. You can be damn sure they can do it on their own home turf.

But it gets better.

**At least 10% of the people who defect to the civilian side would not do so openly, and they would not abandon their posts.**

The moment a civil war starts, not only does America lose over half its military to the cause, but their own command structure will suddenly be infested with moles, plants, and “traitors.” There would be almost no way of knowing who is actually on their side and who is supporting the uprising. Worse yet, if one of those people happens to be the captain of one of the nuclear submarines on standby in dark water, the civil war is already lost before it even gets started.

Russia has already publicly stated that it will support any rebellion in the United States against the established government and will send troops and aid to support the resistance. This is pretty self-explanatory. The last thing the government would need during a civil war is Russia breathing down its neck, but they would get exactly that. To supplement two-thirds of their own military leaving and civilians being trained by military elites, Spetsnaz would drop in and the resistance would get armor and air support from the only other nation on the planet that stands a decent chance of fighting us openly and winning.

**The media fearmongers because it’s profitable.**

The media, for all of its paid shillery, would give coverage of everything the resistance does because it is immensely proﬁtable for them to do so. It would be guaranteed views. The only response the establishment would have would be to either allow it or order a total media blackout on the rebellion. Either way they lose, because both outcomes would awaken hundreds of thousands–if not millions–of people. We can only win on the media arena, and they can only lose. It’s merely a matter of what they think will minimize their losses.

**American civilians are armed and dangerous.**

In spite of all of the illegal attempts from the political left to disarm the American people, there are approximately 89 guns for every 100 Americans. Furthermore, we are one of the top three arms manufacturers on the planet (the others being Russia and France). The establishment would be in trouble even if their opponents were unarmed, but any rebellion of the people in America is, by definition, an armed one. They could be easily armed further by stealing weapons or even outright being given them by sympathetic interests (unsurprisingly, an overwhelming number of weapons manufacturers on American soil are deeply traditionalist, and the odds are good that many minor–and at least one major–would side with the rebels).

**The last resort Catch 22.**

The United States has an enormous stockpile of munitions and explosives, up to and including a massive number of nuclear warheads. But they cannot use any of this in this Civil War. The establishment has to play a game of “we’re the good guys” with the rest of the world while this is all taking place. There will be lines they cannot cross, because to do so would elevate the issue from being an internal matter to an international one. The moment they throw an ICBM at Ohio or drop a nuke on Austin, Texas, it stops being a civil war and becomes an international relief effort where the other militaries of the other first world nations come to save the American people from their own out-of-control and tyrannical government. The rebellion, meanwhile, is not nearly so limited re: the hypothetical nuclear submarine captain. The rebels could threaten–without bluffing–to nuke Washington DC, but the establishment has no equivalent threat they could return.",1580596408,fg7mx7y

3903,hdmibunny,"TLDR you cant use drones to enforce curfews and the militsry needs the infrastructure the civilian population provides to support itself. 

The United States Government has extensively studied the concept of second American Civil War (along the assumption that it will be left versus right. HMM. I WONDER WHY THEY MIGHT POSSIBLY DO THAT.)

Their conclusion is as follows: They don’t have a snowball’s chance in Hell of winning. The moment civil war is declared, the government loses. No scenario or outcome ends in their success. Period. It’s just a matter of how long it takes.

A longer analysis will follow, but here are the salient points.

**30% of the American population will actively revolt.**

This alone is enormous and damning. Historically, you only need 10% of the population to actively participate in a rebellion to successfully overthrow the establishment: We only had 15% of the population actively attempting to throw out the British during the Revolutionary War; roughly 70% of what remained was neutral and simply stood by. By contrast, 30% of Americans in modern America would support a revolution to stop their own government if it happened tomorrow That’s how discontent the people are and how much the people don’t support the government.

**The government would need infrastructure more than rebels would.**

Already working with significant handicaps, the establishment would need electricity, access to the Internet, bridges, and airports to coordinate any active campaign against the rebellion. By contrast, the rebellion can work in the dark. Considering how easy it would be to sabotage US infrastructure, one of the first things the rebellion would do is collapse bridges, destroy, or seize power plants, and cover the Interstate in IEDs. This is relatively simple to accomplish, and it would inflict enormous damage on the establishment’s ability to restore order. It would also cost an enormous amount of time and effort to fix any sabotage, because the establishment would need to provide military protection to any workers attempting to rebuild, which is a drain their active fighting personnel resources that they could not afford.

**Taking America in a land war is almost impossible.**

The United States is absolutely full of natural terrain chokepoints, making marching an army across it against armed resistance almost impossible, and it is large enough that no sustained air campaign would be possible. The Japanese Admiralty realized this themselves during WWII, which is why many of them were against attempting to invade. Also, by an interesting coincidence, most of those chokepoints are in hard conservative states, where the resistance would be strongest. The government would lack the ability to reclaim its own land by force, especially when the previous point about infrastructure is taken into account. President Lincoln, on the matter of potential European involvement in the first American Civil War, stated, “All the armies of Europe with a Bonaparte as a commander, could not take a drink from the Ohio.”

**A significant majority–between 55 and 70%–of the military would defect to the side of the citizens.**

The problem with suppressing the people with a military, that literature and fantasy tend to overlook or ignore, is that the military is the people, too. In order to get any military to fight their own, you first have to convince them that it is necessary to do so–that it is justified. The Communists also ran into this problem, but they overcame it with psychological conditioning and creating a dog-eat-dog atmosphere within the military. The American government having actively recruited people who are patriotic, practical, brave, who have civilian families, and having reinforced those values throughout their training process, lacks the ability to convince the majority of their fighting force to engage against their own people. The moment a civil war breaks out, over half of the American military will defect to the rebel side. They will bring military gear with them and, more dangerous, military training. lt only takes one Navy Seal or Army Ranger to potentially train hundreds of civilians into a dangerous resistance force. They’ve done it before, in other nations. You can be damn sure they can do it on their own home turf.

But it gets better.

**At least 10% of the people who defect to the civilian side would not do so openly, and they would not abandon their posts.**

The moment a civil war starts, not only does America lose over half its military to the cause, but their own command structure will suddenly be infested with moles, plants, and “traitors.” There would be almost no way of knowing who is actually on their side and who is supporting the uprising. Worse yet, if one of those people happens to be the captain of one of the nuclear submarines on standby in dark water, the civil war is already lost before it even gets started.

Russia has already publicly stated that it will support any rebellion in the United States against the established government and will send troops and aid to support the resistance. This is pretty self-explanatory. The last thing the government would need during a civil war is Russia breathing down its neck, but they would get exactly that. To supplement two-thirds of their own military leaving and civilians being trained by military elites, Spetsnaz would drop in and the resistance would get armor and air support from the only other nation on the planet that stands a decent chance of fighting us openly and winning.

**The media fearmongers because it’s profitable.**

The media, for all of its paid shillery, would give coverage of everything the resistance does because it is immensely proﬁtable for them to do so. It would be guaranteed views. The only response the establishment would have would be to either allow it or order a total media blackout on the rebellion. Either way they lose, because both outcomes would awaken hundreds of thousands–if not millions–of people. We can only win on the media arena, and they can only lose. It’s merely a matter of what they think will minimize their losses.

**American civilians are armed and dangerous.**

In spite of all of the illegal attempts from the political left to disarm the American people, there are approximately 89 guns for every 100 Americans. Furthermore, we are one of the top three arms manufacturers on the planet (the others being Russia and France). The establishment would be in trouble even if their opponents were unarmed, but any rebellion of the people in America is, by definition, an armed one. They could be easily armed further by stealing weapons or even outright being given them by sympathetic interests (unsurprisingly, an overwhelming number of weapons manufacturers on American soil are deeply traditionalist, and the odds are good that many minor–and at least one major–would side with the rebels).

**The last resort Catch 22.**

The United States has an enormous stockpile of munitions and explosives, up to and including a massive number of nuclear warheads. But they cannot use any of this in this Civil War. The establishment has to play a game of “we’re the good guys” with the rest of the world while this is all taking place. There will be lines they cannot cross, because to do so would elevate the issue from being an internal matter to an international one. The moment they throw an ICBM at Ohio or drop a nuke on Austin, Texas, it stops being a civil war and becomes an international relief effort where the other militaries of the other first world nations come to save the American people from their own out-of-control and tyrannical government. The rebellion, meanwhile, is not nearly so limited re: the hypothetical nuclear submarine captain. The rebels could threaten–without bluffing–to nuke Washington DC, but the establishment has no equivalent threat they could return.",1580606309,fg80kje

&gt;  
&gt;But I want Trump defeated.

I just want a candidate that isn't a [corporate shill](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/contributors?id=N00001669), [with a spotted past](http://www.realchange.org/biden.htm), [who's marred in scandal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/biden.htm).  So no, Biden doesn't work for me.  He's not going to progress social change, if anything he'll reinforce the status quo.  It's not about ""beating Trump"".  It's about progressing social change and getting upstanding candidates in office.  If Biden was squeaky clean and had a [track record](https://time.com/5636715/biden-1988-presidential-campaign/) of being a [decent person](https://theblacksphere.net/2019/06/democrats-and-bidens-long-history-of-racism/), then sure, I'd vote for him.  It's not about purity, ideology, or self-interests; it's about finding a person who isn't [a giant piece of shit](https://shaunking.substack.com/p/2-truths-and-31-lies-joe-biden-has).  Is that too much to ask for?

&gt;Can McGrath beat McConnell? It would take a lot of things going right. But he's actually weaker going into this election and she's not a bad candidate. McGrath is precisely the type of DC outsider that people so often claim they want. She also has crap ton of cash and support. So it's possible. But no. Because McGrath isn't who *they* wanted they're not going to vote for her. It's unbelievable.

McGrath isn't exactly great.  [She would've confirmed Kavanaugh](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/10/amy-mcgrath-reverses-course-whether-she-would-confirmed-brett-kavanaugh/1698866001/), [she's funded by Wall Street,](https://www.rawstory.com/2019/07/mitch-mcconnells-big-donors-are-wall-street-firms-and-only-9-of-his-funds-comes-from-kentucky/) and  [she supports Trump's agenda](https://twitter.com/banditelli/status/1148824933759193088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1148824933759193088&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bizpacreview.com%2F2019%2F07%2F11%2Fdem-challenger-undercuts-already-slim-chances-of-defeating-mcconnell-with-spineless-flip-flop-on-kavanaugh-773748), [yet, she compared Trump to 9/11](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcconnell-challenger-mocked-for-interview-flub)?

McConnell pushed a sexual predator to the Supreme Court, that McGrath says she would've confirmed, he loves Trump's agenda and helps facilitate it, as McGrath said she would, and she's funded by corporate interest, just like McConnell.  

How is she any better?  She has a ""D"" next to her name?  Sorry, I'm not buying it.  If it were Yarmuth,  Jim Gray, or Adam Edlen running, they'd have my vote.  Again, the DNC and KDP keep putting up terrible candidates.  I hope Booker can garner enough support to beat McGrath, but he certainly doesn't have the funding to do so.",1580610116,fg85ksy

I mostly agree with you on what you wrote. 

But it absolutely is about beating Trump. Because if he gets a second term we're going to have a lot bigger problems than worrying about ""progressive"" issues like climate change, social justice, etc. This will be an extremely consequential election. Probably the most consequential of either of our lifetimes.

It was a mistake but McGrath did retract the Kavanaugh statement. Regardless, assuming she gets the Democratic nomination, you gotta vote for her or you're essentially voting for McConnell. End of story.

3942,hdmibunny,"Getting a lot of use out of this one tonight. 

TLDR: all that technology can't enforce curfews/the military needs the infrastructure the civilian population provides. 

The United States Government has extensively studied the concept of second American Civil War (along the assumption that it will be left versus right. HMM. I WONDER WHY THEY MIGHT POSSIBLY DO THAT.)

Their conclusion is as follows: They don’t have a snowball’s chance in Hell of winning. The moment civil war is declared, the government loses. No scenario or outcome ends in their success. Period. It’s just a matter of how long it takes.

A longer analysis will follow, but here are the salient points.

**30% of the American population will actively revolt.**

This alone is enormous and damning. Historically, you only need 10% of the population to actively participate in a rebellion to successfully overthrow the establishment: We only had 15% of the population actively attempting to throw out the British during the Revolutionary War; roughly 70% of what remained was neutral and simply stood by. By contrast, 30% of Americans in modern America would support a revolution to stop their own government if it happened tomorrow That’s how discontent the people are and how much the people don’t support the government.

**The government would need infrastructure more than rebels would.**

Already working with significant handicaps, the establishment would need electricity, access to the Internet, bridges, and airports to coordinate any active campaign against the rebellion. By contrast, the rebellion can work in the dark. Considering how easy it would be to sabotage US infrastructure, one of the first things the rebellion would do is collapse bridges, destroy, or seize power plants, and cover the Interstate in IEDs. This is relatively simple to accomplish, and it would inflict enormous damage on the establishment’s ability to restore order. It would also cost an enormous amount of time and effort to fix any sabotage, because the establishment would need to provide military protection to any workers attempting to rebuild, which is a drain their active fighting personnel resources that they could not afford.

**Taking America in a land war is almost impossible.**

The United States is absolutely full of natural terrain chokepoints, making marching an army across it against armed resistance almost impossible, and it is large enough that no sustained air campaign would be possible. The Japanese Admiralty realized this themselves during WWII, which is why many of them were against attempting to invade. Also, by an interesting coincidence, most of those chokepoints are in hard conservative states, where the resistance would be strongest. The government would lack the ability to reclaim its own land by force, especially when the previous point about infrastructure is taken into account. President Lincoln, on the matter of potential European involvement in the first American Civil War, stated, “All the armies of Europe with a Bonaparte as a commander, could not take a drink from the Ohio.”

**A significant majority–between 55 and 70%–of the military would defect to the side of the citizens.**

The problem with suppressing the people with a military, that literature and fantasy tend to overlook or ignore, is that the military is the people, too. In order to get any military to fight their own, you first have to convince them that it is necessary to do so–that it is justified. The Communists also ran into this problem, but they overcame it with psychological conditioning and creating a dog-eat-dog atmosphere within the military. The American government having actively recruited people who are patriotic, practical, brave, who have civilian families, and having reinforced those values throughout their training process, lacks the ability to convince the majority of their fighting force to engage against their own people. The moment a civil war breaks out, over half of the American military will defect to the rebel side. They will bring military gear with them and, more dangerous, military training. lt only takes one Navy Seal or Army Ranger to potentially train hundreds of civilians into a dangerous resistance force. They’ve done it before, in other nations. You can be damn sure they can do it on their own home turf.

But it gets better.

**At least 10% of the people who defect to the civilian side would not do so openly, and they would not abandon their posts.**

The moment a civil war starts, not only does America lose over half its military to the cause, but their own command structure will suddenly be infested with moles, plants, and “traitors.” There would be almost no way of knowing who is actually on their side and who is supporting the uprising. Worse yet, if one of those people happens to be the captain of one of the nuclear submarines on standby in dark water, the civil war is already lost before it even gets started.

Russia has already publicly stated that it will support any rebellion in the United States against the established government and will send troops and aid to support the resistance. This is pretty self-explanatory. The last thing the government would need during a civil war is Russia breathing down its neck, but they would get exactly that. To supplement two-thirds of their own military leaving and civilians being trained by military elites, Spetsnaz would drop in and the resistance would get armor and air support from the only other nation on the planet that stands a decent chance of fighting us openly and winning.

**The media fearmongers because it’s profitable.**

The media, for all of its paid shillery, would give coverage of everything the resistance does because it is immensely proﬁtable for them to do so. It would be guaranteed views. The only response the establishment would have would be to either allow it or order a total media blackout on the rebellion. Either way they lose, because both outcomes would awaken hundreds of thousands–if not millions–of people. We can only win on the media arena, and they can only lose. It’s merely a matter of what they think will minimize their losses.

**American civilians are armed and dangerous.**

In spite of all of the illegal attempts from the political left to disarm the American people, there are approximately 89 guns for every 100 Americans. Furthermore, we are one of the top three arms manufacturers on the planet (the others being Russia and France). The establishment would be in trouble even if their opponents were unarmed, but any rebellion of the people in America is, by definition, an armed one. They could be easily armed further by stealing weapons or even outright being given them by sympathetic interests (unsurprisingly, an overwhelming number of weapons manufacturers on American soil are deeply traditionalist, and the odds are good that many minor–and at least one major–would side with the rebels).

**The last resort Catch 22.**

The United States has an enormous stockpile of munitions and explosives, up to and including a massive number of nuclear warheads. But they cannot use any of this in this Civil War. The establishment has to play a game of “we’re the good guys” with the rest of the world while this is all taking place. There will be lines they cannot cross, because to do so would elevate the issue from being an internal matter to an international one. The moment they throw an ICBM at Ohio or drop a nuke on Austin, Texas, it stops being a civil war and becomes an international relief effort where the other militaries of the other first world nations come to save the American people from their own out-of-control and tyrannical government. The rebellion, meanwhile, is not nearly so limited re: the hypothetical nuclear submarine captain. The rebels could threaten–without bluffing–to nuke Washington DC, but the establishment has no equivalent threat they could return.",1580610960,fg86ovr

Lol.

&gt;guns accidentally discharge everyday

There is no such thing as an accidental discharge.

No gun has ever been sitting quietly and without intervention decided to cock its hammer and go off.

What you are talking about are negligent discharges, wherein someone, almost always a human, is negligent in the handling, storage or manufacture of a firearm causing an unintended and negligent discharge of the firearm. 

&gt;""The typical argument for restrictive gun laws is based around the notion of a ""nut with a gun."" 

It is actually racism 99% of the time. If you look at the laws and then the surrounding times and actions being taken at that time you will find that in almost all cases gun laws are born out of either racism or knee jerk fear-mongering, hence ""the shoulder thing that goes up"" and other cosmetic bans.",1580695411,fgeay68

4069,flyingwolf,"&gt; What ever happened to “well regulated militia” that part conveniently gets skewed.

This is not how the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase. In Heller, there’s a very long discussion about why that “prefatory clause” doesn’t mean what you think it means.

In Colonial times, “regulated” meant something different. It meant “well organized, properly working, well-tuned,” just like you see old clocks branded that they are “regulated.” It has nothing to do with gun control. http://www.constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm 

Any honest person who is not illiterate in English and who is intelligent enough to comprehend some basic logic can see that “a well regulated militia” was the motive stated in the Constitution, but the operative right is clearly the second part of the amendment. ""The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" The intended meaning is all over the pages of history leading up to the amendment.

The 2nd Amendment does not at all call for government control and oversight of gun ownership. A well-regulated militia, in the context of the 2nd, is one that is properly equipped, well-trained and disciplined similarly to a regular army. Preventing the government from infringing on the people’s right to keep and bear arms is essential for the said well-regulated militia to be a well-regulated militia. The people who would serve in the militia would train with arms on their own and serve with their own guns. This is different from an army that is maintained and controlled by the government.

But you say ""Well regulated” as in “strictly controlled"". How does that meaning jibe with “shall not be infringed”? If it meant “strictly controlled,” that would be a direct and utter contradiction in that simple statement.

Finally, contemporary writings referred to “well-regulated” households, kitchens, workshops, and even young women (Henry James) and young boys (Anna Leonowens). Neither young women nor young boys were subject to substantial government regulation in the 1800s. The sense of the term is akin to a regulator clock, which keeps good time as one would expect.

4133,pinkyclown,"Let's take a look at just raw numbers. The entire United States military (including clerks, nurses, generals, cooks, etc) is 1.2 million. Law enforcement is estimated at about 1.1 million (again, including clerks and other non-officers.) This gives us a combined force of 2.3 million people who could potentially be tapped to deal with a civil insurrection. Keep in mind this also includes officers who serve in the prisons, schools, and other public safety positions that require their presence. That total of soldiers is also including US soldiers deployed to the dozens of overseas US bases in places like South Korea, Japan, Germany, etc. Many of those forces are considered vital and can't be removed due to strategic concerns.

But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that the state slaps a rifle in every filing clerk's hand and tells them to sort the situation out.

We now have to contend with the fact that many law enforcement and military personnel consider themselves patriots and wouldn't necessarily just automatically side with the state if something were to happen. There is a very broad swath of people involved in these communities that have crossover with militia groups and other bodies that are, at best, not 100% in support of the government. Exact numbers are hard to pin down but suffice it to say that not everybody would be willing to snap-to if an insurrection kicked off. Even if they didn't outright switch sides there's the very real possibility that they could, in direct or indirect ways, work against their employer's prosecution of the counter-insurgency either by directly sabotaging operations or just not putting as much effort into their work and turning a blind eye to things.

But, again, for the sake of argument, let's assume that you've somehow managed to talk every single member of the military and law enforcement services into being 100% committed to rooting out the rebel scum.

There are an estimated 400 million firearms in the US. Even if we just ignore 300 million firearms available as maybe they're antiques or not in a condition to be used, that's still 100 million firearms that citizens can pick up and use. Let's go even further than that and say of that 100, there are only about 20 million firearms that are both desirable and useful in an insurgency context and not say .22's or double barrelled shotguns.

It should be noted just for the sake of interest that several million AR-15's are manufactured every year and have been since 2004 when the ""assault weapons"" ban ended. Soooo 2-5 million per year for 15 years....

If only 2% of the US population decided ""Fuck it, let's dance!"" and rose up, that's about 6.5 million people. You're already outnumbering all law enforcement and the military almost 3 to 1. And you have enough weapons to arm them almost four times over. There are millions of tons of ammunition held in private hands and the materials to make ammunition are readily available online even before you start talking about reloading through scrounging.

So you have a well equipped armed force that outnumbers the standing military and law enforcement capabilities of the country by a significant margin.

""But the military has tanks, planes, and satellites!""

That they do however it's worth noting that the majority of the capabilities of our armed forces are centered around engaging another state in a war. That means another entity that also has tanks, planes, and satellites. That is where the majority of our warfighting capabilities are centered because that's what conflict has consisted of for most of the 20th century.

We've learned a lot about asymmetric warfare since our time in Iraq and Afghanistan and one of the key takeaways has been just having tanks and battleships is not enough to win against even a much smaller and more poorly armed opponent.

A battleship or a bomber is great if you're going after targets that you don't particularly care about but they don't do you a whole hell of a lot of good when your targets are in an urban setting mixed in with people that you, the commander, are accountable to.

Flattening a city block is fine in Overthereastan because you can shrug and call the sixty civilians you killed ""collateral damage"" and no one gives a shit. If you do that here, you seriously damage perceptions about you among the civilians who then are going to get upset with you. Maybe they manage to bring enough political pressure on you to get you ousted, maybe they start helping the rebels, or maybe they pick up guns of their own and join in. You killed fifteen fighters in that strike but in so doing you may have created thirty more.

Even drones are of mixed utility in that circumstance. It's also worth noting that the US is several orders of magnitude larger than the areas that drones have typically operated in during conflict in the Middle East. And lest we forget, these drones are not exactly immune from attacks. There's also not a lot a drone can do in places with large amounts of tree cover...like over a billion acres of the US.

And then even if we decide that it's worth employing things like Hellfire missiles and cluster bombs, it should be noted that a strategy of ""bomb the shit out of them"" didn't work in over a decade in the Middle East. Most of the insurgent networks in the region that were there when the war started are still there and still operating, even if their influence is diminished they are still able to strike targets.

Just being able to bomb the shit out of someone doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to win in a conflict against them.

Information warfare capabilities also don't guarantee success. There are always workarounds and methods that are resistant to interception and don't require a high level of technical sophistication. Many commercial solutions can readily be used or modified to put a communications infrastructure in place that is beyond the reach of law enforcement or the military to have reliable access to. Again, there are dozens of non-state armed groups that are proving this on a daily basis.

You also have to keep in mind the psychological factor. Most soldiers are ok with operating in foreign countries where they can justify being aggressive towards the local population; they're over here, my people are back home. It's a lot harder to digest rolling down the streets of cities in your own country and pointing guns at people you may even know.

What do you do as a police officer or soldier when you read that soldiers opened fire into a crowd of people in your home town and killed 15? What do you do when you've been ordered to break down the door of a neighbor that you've known your whole life and arrest them or search their home? What do you do if you find out a member of your own family has been working with the insurgency and you have a professional responsibility to turn them in even knowing they face, at best, a long prison sentence and at worst potential execution? What do you do when your friends, family, and community start shunning you as a symbol of a system that they're starting to see more and more as oppressive and unjust?

""People couldn't organize on that scale!""

This is generally true. Even with the networked communications technologies that we have it's likely ideological and methodological differences would prevent a mass army of a million or more from acting in concert.

In many ways, that's part of what would make an insurrection difficult to deal with. Atomized groups of people, some as small as five or six, would be a nightmare to deal with because you have to take each group of fighters on its own. A large network can be brought down by attacking its control nodes, communication channels, and key figures.

Hundreds of small groups made up of five to twenty people all acting on their own initiative with different goals, values, and methods of operation is a completely different scenario and a logistical nightmare. It's a game of whack-a-mole with ten thousand holes and one hammer. Lack of coordination means even if you manage to destroy, infiltrate, or otherwise compromise one group you have at best removed a dozen fighters from the map. Attacks would be random and spontaneous, giving you little to no warning and no ability to effectively preempt an attack.

Negotiation isn't really an option either. Deals you cut with one group won't necessarily be honored by another and while you can leverage and create rivalries between the groups to a certain extent you can only do this by acknowledging some level of control and legitimacy that they possess. You have to give them some kind of legitimacy if you want to talk to them, the very act of talking says ""You are worth talking to."" And there are hundreds, if not thousands, of these groups.

You are, in effect, trying to herd cats who not only have no interest in listening to you but are actively dedicated to frustrating your efforts and who greatly outnumber you in an environment that prevents the use of the tools that your resources are optimized to employ.

Would it be bad? Definitely. Casualties would be extremely high on all sides. That's not a scenario I would ever want to see play out. It would be a long, drawn out war of attrition that the actual US government couldn't effectively win. Think about the Syrian Civil War or The Troubles in Northern Ireland or the Soviet-Afghan War in Afghanistan. That's what it would be.",1580760710,fggfdib

4147,double_knock_scratch,"West Marshall is where you will find the more agricultural side of the county (acreages, mini farms, country life).    Calvert City is the major industrial area with all of the plants located there.   And the east side butts up to Kentucky Lake.

Virginia for example, Democrats swept the last election. They did it while preaching gun reform. So that tells me there’s a majority of Virginians that want to see some kind of gun reform. Who am I to subvert the will of Virginians governing themselves? What’s more American than that? I’m sorry that gun advocates are now a minority there but if they had been willing to compromise that may not have happened. Maybe it would have, who knows, but I believe we still have the support of the majority nationwide. I believe a lot of non-gun owners still support 2A as a fundamental american right but if we keep marching around like soldier-of-fortune mercenaries in front of tv cameras and shouting ‘from my cold dead hands’ and acting like fools while refusing to acknowledge that there is a problem, if we refuse to compromise, sooner or later we might just find ourselves in a national minority.

That's completely insane.

I am assuming Russiagate is your way of characterizing the Mueller Report, which if you would take the time to read does NOT exonerate the president of wrongdoing. Calling this a minor abuse of power is still admitting this is an abuse of power so further proving my point the whistle blower complaint was valid. I also don't understand what you are accepting at face value. The facts are the president withheld funds appropriated by congress in an attempt to dig up dirt on a political opponent. Not sure what there is not to accept there.

No law against  it, doesn't mean that it isn't an abuse of power and shouldn't be treated as such. This is absolutely the kind of thing whistle blower laws were created to serve as a check against.

I guess the heart of my question is in regards to what we need as precedent now to de-polarize.
Now, there are some shenanigans prior to this but it’s a good starting point for this conversation:

&gt;Let’s take Senate Democrats 51 majority senate rule change —a response to unprecedented use of the Republican filibuster— because it while it removed the ‘gridlock’ it all but removed the need to ‘reach across the aisle ’. A rule that certainly came back to bite them.

&gt;The Republican House in turn, submitted a series of changes for their house committees that where followed with one notable exception.  A formal ‘initial vote to begin writing articles’ which required a simple majority. 

https://www.co-equal.org/guide-to-congressional-oversight/investigative-rules-and-practices-followed-by-house-republicans.

I am heartened to see you subscribe to the idea of ‘fair game’. It’s what I would expect from anyone with a history of observing the process.  Rules being what they are you don’t attack the process itself.

&gt;So why then did house republicans  deride  their own rules with regards to depositions,  counsel and testimony of high ranking political appointees as a ‘deeply unfair process’?  
&gt;Why did they march in to take a stand in a room that some had clearance to be in anyway?
&gt;Where’s the reciprocity and fair play you acknowledge but these representatives don’t?

So back to precent and my question. With fair game, my concern is where those  steps taken  to ‘plow through’ opposition  left bipartisanship. 
I’m observing a breakdown of the process. Do you think anything could be done about it?

Halbeib worked on the transition team, which means he was heavily involved with the campaign and setting up the government.

Mum and dad said they were shocked when they moved to Kentucky and learned their neighbours were using spoons, sticks, and belts on their children. Mum, as a children’s pastor (specifically working with children aged 0-12 in the church), had to take many courses on child development, and was aware of how the cons typically outweigh the pros when it comes to corporal punishment. But beyond that, she was taught in her courses that parents should NEVER use objects on their children, because it creates a level of detachment that not only embodies a “weapon” but makes it hard for the parent to gauge how hard they are swatting the child. 

Lastly, if you REALLY want to swat your child, do it on the upper thigh, not directly on the butt, as this can harm the child’s lumbar as it develops. My mum encountered one child who had back problems from being spanked so frequently and intensely (which my mum refers to as “spanking gone wrong”). 

Different punishments work for different children, but what matters is not WHAT you do as a punishment, but rather how consistent you are. If a child knows you are true to your word, no threat is empty. Clear consequences make for good discipline, not more intense beatings.

However, my spanking story, and I'm 42yo to put this into some context. When I was in 4th grade I was spanked for not having completed my homework for the previous night. It was a ""last straw"" sort of punishment. It was done out in the hallway away from the other students (though they could hear what happened) and there was another teacher present, but this was more about the teacher not liking my parents than me not doing homework. My father was a top administrator for my school system and my mother was head of the local Teachers Association, so they were both very well known by everyone in the school system.

My story is exactly why schools shouldn't allow corporal punishment bcz it can be used incorrectly under the guise of other issues.

This is even if corporal punishment is ""done correctly"", and not used as an outlet for an authority figure's baggage. There is smoke research that it does essentially no good and a meaningful amount of harm.

The only time that physical harm can ""teach"" a child something is a ""one-time learning experience"" -- that is, an event so destructive that it literally scars the child's psyche, creating a pathological phobia. If you set their hair on fire for taking a cookie, they will definitely never take a cookie again. They'll be fucked up forever, but you will have successfully corrected the behavior - and that is the only time corporal punishment is effective.

All other times - every ""I was spanked and I turned out fine"" anecdote - those people turned out ""fine"" *despite* being hit, not *because* of being hit.

I noticed more than a few comments with a “not my child” sentiment but they didn’t go so far as to say no to corporal punishment in general. Just not for their perfect angels. It seems that I happen to be one of the few parents these days that wasn’t blessed with perfect angels that never do anything wrong.

I believe discipline should be handled at home. That being said, I’m sure we can all agree that there is a certain percentage of kids that do not get that much needed discipline at home. If you have any school aged kids then you have surely heard about that one trouble-maker or even a small group of problem kids. The school has to deal with those kids to maintain a healthy learning environment for all students. As long as the schools policy is fair, easily understandable and applied to all students without prejudice, then I’m fine with it. Because kids will know right up front, if I choice to do (X) and get caught, (Y) is going to be my punishment. Kids need to learn that there are civil/social rules, maybe different than those from their private lives, that they are expected to abide by. If they don’t learn these rules the consequences could be a lot worse than a spanking, like jail for instance. 

School used to be where we learned how to act in public. Your parents had a certain set of rules for you at home but school was public and slightly different. Your mom might not mind if you stand up and scream in her face but you learn right away that is unacceptable behavior with others in public. It seems to me, these days, that there is a severe lack of public decency anymore. Just go to a busy shopping center or drive around on public roads and expect another driver to follow the law, let alone drive with a little courtesy and you’ll see what I mean. I think we could all use some lessons on public decency and common courtesy when out in public these days. 

I still believe in a whippin’ mostly because it has worked for my family. It’s not our first line of punishment and I have only had to do it a very few times and I have never had to do it twice for the same offense. I can’t say that about ‘grounding’ or ‘time out’ types of discipline. I have never done it in anger and we have a discussion about it after it’s over. Neither of my kids have ever been whipped without being fully aware that if they got caught doing (X) they are getting spanked, it is never a surprise and they made that choice. I want to teach my kids to make good choices and I believe a whippin’ is much less traumatic than maybe jail time down the road for socially unacceptable behavior.",1581180291,fgy7gl1

Should we be allowed to use corporal punishment on the adults that heckled the Muslim children at the Capitol? Telling a child to repent and that they are going to hell is certainly disrespectful and disruptive. Let's fucking spank them.

That's not how our society works. As an engineer, I'm not asking a teacher or a behavioral psychologist how we should fix our engineering problems. So, I use critical thinking to get me past the basics:

**Don't hit people.**

**Get opinions from other *knowledgeable* people and resources and then *vote* accordingly.**

I'm not the one here promoting a solution. **You are.** So, I'm trying to express to you through discussion why you should revise your solution to not include hitting *anyone*-- especially children.

4552,Kyreloader,"As an adult, would you spank me if you caught me speeding or shoplifting? Personally, I would take a spanking over a speeding ticket. If I’m caught driving recklessly, there are consequences for that, adult consequences. You are comparing apples to oranges, a spanking does not have the effect on an adult that it does on a child. Also I’m not talking about a beating here and there is a difference. I also did not say a spanking was called for simply because someone thought their actions were disrespectful or disruptive. My point goes to specific rules, when the rules say: if you do this, this will happen to you and if your child does that, then he/she knows the consequences. It is the same with adults, only with more appropriate consequences. If I get caught speeding, I know I’m going to have to pay a fine. Can we fine children for breaking the rules? Throw them in jail? I’m not talking about spankings for any misbehavior but I do believe it is a viable option in some circumstances. 

Children do not and should not, in my opinion, have the same rights and privileges as adults. Having an opinion at a protest or something similar, as an adult, is completely different than a child back-talking his teacher. Apples and oranges.

I don’t know what your talking about specifically as far as the Muslim children thing.

 Your complaint is that it is “ass backwards” and “different” from how you learned, and that’s the end of it.  It’s just different.

Yes, some kids will struggle with it, but the world doesn’t revolve around your child.  The “old way” of making kids memorize everything was a miserable failure and left millions of children behind, particularly in higher math courses, because simple memorization is useless for trigonometry, for example.

I’m sorry your child struggles, but the whole idea behind education theory is to leave fewer children behind, which is what common core does...and don’t fret, in another 20 or 30 years there will be some new teaching method that will piss your kid off because “that’s not how I learned”...",1581195970,fgzo3ff

- Any smuck with a credit card can be a NRA member. You sign up for a NRA membership the same way you sign up for a magazine subscription. Having a NRA membership does not mean you have control over the NRA.

- The NRA having the two foreigners speak at a rally also is not damning. Of course the NRA would want to show that gun rights are not a US only concern, and the simplest way to do that would be to have foreign gun rights groups speak out.

- The fact that Russia does not have gun rights, does not mean that there are not Russians who would like to have guns. As such the NRA would have no real reason to be suspicious of a foreign gun rights group. This trust may have been misplaced, but NRA is not the CIA and has no way of telling if some foreign group looking to collaberate is secretly in bed with the russian mob.

- The allegations by the  are that the NRA was used as a unsuspecting vessel. The Russians would give to the NRA via Butina knowing that the NRA would likely use it in favor of Republican candidates. This does not mean that the NRA was literally coordinating with Putin as certain pundits, democrat congresspeople, and redditors like to insinuate.

Right now they suffer through it until they develop something covered by the ER. Then they end up in the ER due to diabetic shock, heart attack, aggravated dementia (police and then ER), or needing a foot or hand amputated. Any of those things costs almost their entire life worth of insulin and diet advice.  

When they go to the ER they get treatment, do you really want the EMS to run a credit check before they'll come to your home. They're sent a bill, it goes unpaid, and then either goes to collections or is written off in the hope that they'll get something through medicare/medicaid reimbursement laws for treating the poor. Unfortunately that only pays a fraction of the cost 10-25%. Collection agencies equally only pay a small amount to the hospital. So they have to make up the cost elsewhere. Which is the primary reason our medical costs are rising.  When I worked at VUMC  (8 years ago) 25% of the cost was the ""bump  because medicare/medicaid/insurance will always pay less"", 50% of the cost was making up the difference for unpaid ER visits, and the remaining 25% was what it actually cost to treat you. From what I've heard it is now more likely 25/65/10.

I've talked to many people who have the numbers and have done the math. Effectively with the money we're currently putting into medicare, medicaid, and the VA medical, we could treat everyone for a small amount more and less than what they're currently paying for insurance. While still maintaining VA hospitals to be focused on veteran specific needs: PTSD, TBI, and such. 

Now are there private sector methods to the solution, yes. Some will result in significantly more deaths or untreated issues. Others could be similar to the healthcare for all plan. For example, we could strike the law that requires ERs to treat everyone. Instead you get pre-approved for a medical credit card of sorts, or even have an HSA style account with money already in it. Next you get a chip implant that has that account information on it. Now the EMS shows up, scans your chip, and you're off to the hospital. If you don't, they run a credit check and pre-approval before taking you. If you're alone, without enough ID to run that credit check, and you have a heart attack. They might hold your hand and comfort you as you die, if they don't have a paying customer waiting.  We could also have a basic medicare for all that covers the minimum things and then paid insurances that have better coverage. The latter option was what the original ACA was aiming for, before the Dems started gutting it in advance of handing it to over to be voted on.",1581303816,fh6qsm4

In fact administrative costs will go WAY down, in fact $600 billion down according to the study I reference earlier, so those funds could be savings for providers as they wouldn't have to deal with numerous insurance companies anymore. I could not see the first study you cite because it is subscription-based. 

Another consideration with costs is that hospitals and other providers would actually generate revenues from the much greater use of their services from people who had not been able to use them before because they were uninsured or underinsured. And as a commenter of the study observed, the study does not take into account the savings from the high cost of treating uninsured people using emergency services.

Medicare for All ""for those who want it"" is inferior because you would still leave the health insurance industry intact, and it is they who are responsible for the administrative bloat and causing inefficiencies of having hundreds of insurance companies that providers have to deal with. Further, without universality there is the danger that it may be underfunded or defunded by a different administration.

4824,Kytoaster,"Sure! So, first red flag is the fact that bernie uses the word ""assault weapon"". 

To people who are familiar with firearms, ""assault weapon"" is the most efficient way to let us know that a person is not familiar with firearms. So. Not a great start. 

The first impression I get is ""well. He doesn't know much about firearms, but wants to make laws about them"".

I noticed a mention of ""the gun show loophole"".
This is fairly common misrepresentation that, again, is very well known to people familiar with firearms. There is no ""loophole"". To purchase a firearm from a registered dealer at a gun show, you must pass a background check. 

What this ""loophole"" refers to has nothing to do with the gun show or the registered firearms dealers who paid to be there. 

It is referring to personal sales between citizens. Nothing to do with a gun show, which requires a background check to purchase a firearm. His site even has a page stating how *GUNSHOWS* allow people to purchase firearms without background checks....which is not the case at all. 

Again...not a great look for someone I'm considering as a candidate. (Then again....comparing him to what we've currently got.....it's kind of a lose lose for me).

Add to that even more buzzwords ""military-style assualt weapons"" and I'm unable to control the furrowing of my brow and an audible ""hmph"".

I want to trust bernie, but when I see his campaign based on incorrect information and made up buzzwords designed to bring emotion into a conversation (""military style assault weapon"" when referring to a semi automatic rifle that functions exactly the same as your grandpa's wooden .22 magazine fed rifle) ...I immediately lose interest in him as a candidate. 

And I hate that. I REALLY fucking hate that. 

We have plenty of ""sensible and common sense"" firearm laws. But as someone who has watched this conversation for around a decade, it appears to be a one sided conversation. 

""Just agree to *THIS* law. It's COMMON SENSE!""

*Que 2 weeks later, different conversation, different law*

""Just agree to *THIS* law too. It's COMMON SENSE!!!"" 



Tldr: using media ""hot topic"" words is usually a instant giveaway that a politician has no firearms experience and will not make an effort to protect the 2nd amendment. I would be happy to be proven wrong. 

After watching the firearms debate for nearly a decade, it is a constant cycle of ""just agree to ONE MORE law, or you're being unreasonable!"". It's not a conversation, it's a one way street *from what I have seen, I speak for no one but myself*.

I'm not looking to argue or upset anyone,  but I do hope this lengthy, drawn out post at least answers your inquiries!

Wideopenspaces.com/5-misused-gun-terms-gun-owners-are-sick-of-hearing/

Pay special attention to #5, it is an important distinction that separates civilian firearms from military. Selectable fire modes, which weapons like the ar15 do not have. Thus why it is a civilian weapon. It fires no differently than any other single fire rifle. AR does not stand for assault rifle, it stands for armalite rifle. 

These may seem like minute, unnecessary details, but they are the things I want to know people making the laws UNDERSTAND before making said laws. But...when their own websites use incorrect wording...I don't have much faith.",1581350033,fh81o77

But this is an overarching issue that we will be running into with automation as well. Bernies policies include education are the only solution to a displaced workforce. The workers will need to be re-educated in order to take on new roles in society. I don’t see any republicans taking on this issue. Bernie at least does have a plan for displaced workers: free education.

As our society advances we will need more and more educated workers in order to fill more complex roles such as engineers, programmers, doctors/nurses (badly needed now) and other skilled work that you might become proficient in through a trade school of some sort. With any luck we can automate most tasks to require nothing but energy from the grid and minimal human interaction (think mass scale food production done purely by robots). This is already being done on farms with gps guided tractors. They even have a farming robot you can have grow a garden for you. But someone will need to fix and engineer those machines.

The third part of this is distribution of wealth and the means of production. If one person owns the farms or just a few own the factories to buy things with who will buy everything? No one will have money and there will be a select few that own everything.

Millionaires don’t work enough to produce enough to make Millions of dollars. They manage people that do that for them. The distribution of wealth in the United States and world wide is insane. You’d have to be an asshole to think that you’re stealing or even hurting a millionaire by making them pay their fair share. They benefited from society. That’s why they’re rich.

4987,Claydough89,"Ive heard them talk about shifting employers subsidies to a tax for roughly the same amount. That and yes, taxes would raise for people but their costs for healthcare would be eliminated. I have had government healthcare before and it worked quite nicely. I would much rather deal with that than a system that 1) has lead to a country with the greatest possible care with one of the greatest disparities in access to that care 2) incentivizes health insurance companies to provide the least amount of care for the highest price. 

As to you paying less than $570 per month for your healthcare for your family That is roughly the average costs for a single person in their 40s in KY.  Im guessing: your employer subsidizes that, you have a rather high deductible, you have minimal coverage, you dont have children, or a combination of those factors. 

The current system completely fucks people over if they dont make 200K a year and arent in perfectly good health. Ive known people that have to struggle to continue to work or have spouses take up a second job since the other is unable to continue to work due to cancer treatments. I know people that make a lot less than 200K (which you made it sound like it is still a struggle) and are burdened with medical debt in addition to their housing payments, student loans, and family obligations.

So yes, a single payer system might make some people pay slightly more dollar wise but it would still be the same percentage for everyone under this proposed plan. Again, I would much rather deal with government healthcare (which I have had) than to have a system where the insurance provider is working for a profit which means they want to pay out as little as possible and bring in as much as possible (which I currently have)",1581376415,fh99xuu

If they are unemployed they won’t have to pay for healthcare at all. These details will be worked out and it won’t be as quick as you think. Especially with the nature of this issue the republicans will definitely fight it. So I think your worries are a little preemptive. We have unemployment to soften the blow for these people. And you can get a job at almost anywhere making some decent money for a bit. With the mass exodus of people from the insurance industry there will be jobs created in temporary placement some of them can go to. Some industries will make use of the mass influx of potential educated workforce.

Hi everyone,

I feel a deep connection to Bernie and his lovely movement, and I'm writing this 3 minute letter 📜 to inspire and encourage the American people into believing that a free society that actually works for the people should exist in your country...and soon will 💚🏄 🇺🇸 🕊️❤️

My name is Tor, and I'm from Denmark 🇩🇰 I went to High School in your country 🗽 back in 91/92.

I love America, its diversity and your culture 🦅

But I can also imagine what an amazing country the US could be for the working and middle class if you implemented Bernie Sanders ideas in your everyday lifes🕺

I'm a former college student 👩‍🎓 myself here in Denmark. And as part of our universal welfare model it was free $ 0.

I have never paid anything to go to the doctor or the hospital 🏥 $ 0.

Medicine prices are fair regulated and people get subsidies for their medicine 💊

Parents 👪 have the right to 12 months paid maternity leave combined.

Universal childcare 👫 is a guarantee.

Our seniors has the right to a secure and safe retirement. Denmark is ranked among the 2 best countries in the world with the strongest retirement model 🏖️🏘️🎨📻📺

Yes. We pay slightly higher taxes if your income is less than $ 76.000 per year.

If you make from $ 76.000 annually and up, you must pay an additional + 15 % in taxes. But only of the amount exceeding $ 76.000.

We start of with a Personal allowance of $ 600 a month before we pay any taxes.

Let's say you make up to $ 18.000 annualy as a part time worker, you end up by paying around 25 % in tax.

A Public Schoolteacher 👩‍🏫 makes around $ 5.000 monthly ($ 60.000 annually) - and then pays in average around 35 % back in taxes.

Our average minimumwage is currently around $ 20 (inclusive vacation supplement)

We have a 37 hour workweek and 6 weeks vacation 🏖️ In addition commes 11 Public Holidays 🌅

Denmark is recently ranked no. 1 in ' Best Country for Business ' in the world 🌳

So despite our welfare system, we are very much a market-based economy with a great business climate 🏗️ 🛴🏄🛒💵

As of November 2019 our unemploymentrate is 3,7 % 👩‍🔬👷

Annually the average Dane makes around $ 50.000 and every household around $ 90.000.

A Gallon of Milk 🥛 is around $ 4

A Gallon of Gas ⛽ is about $ 6

A Big Mac 🍔 is around $ 4

Inflation was 0,8 % in 2018 and yes, increase in salaries seem to match it thanks to the unions protecting and backing the workforce 👷

Average monthly rent is probably around $ 800 - 1.000 for a decent modern 2 bedroom appartment + $ 150 - 200 utilities expenses

You can buy a decent house for $ 300.000 🏠

You can buy a decent new car for $ 30.000 and a small new city car for $ 15.000 🚘

Purchasing Power or Real Wages as some people calls it has gone up 40 % in Denmark since the 80'es 🕺

And this is the most proven sign that the system works for the Working and Middle class of our society 👍

Just like the US 🇺🇸 - Denmark is one of the richest countries in the world.

We are like just any other modern western country, and in many ways alike the American lifestyle of living 🍔🎢🌅🚗🏈🏀🏟️🛒💼💵🖥️🎃✈️🚔🚄🥃☕🍩🌭🍕🍟💎👠🎓🏍️🏄🏌️⛷️🍿🥪

BUT the resources are spread out and leaves noone behind - which is the essential and most profound differences between Denmark and the US.

And it has nothing to do with size, but yet everything to do with equality and fighting for someone you don't know. Which I believe, is also the very medicine that will eventually heal the soul of America, retake democracy and bring it back to the people.

Denmark and the US has been good friends for a LONG time. 300,000 Danes emigrated to America from 1850 and 70 years on including my grandmothers sisters 👵👴

Today, the US is our biggest trading partner 💯

I love Bernie Sanders and I have loved him since 2015 when I got to know more about him ❤️

Your own President Franklin D. Roosevelt 1933 - 1945 was probably a democratic socialist.

There is so much human wealth in your everyday life, knowing that nobody in your country are suffering from poverty as a direct cause of governance ⚖️

Denmark is the least corrupt country on earth 🌍

We are automatically registered to vote, and we have 13 political parties to choose from. We have a democratic 1 Person = 1 Vote system and no such thing as superdelegates nor either electoral college. And this simple model secures the power to the people every day of the week.

Bernie's model is the key to secure hard working families a decent living by practically getting money out of politics like in the majority of the western society.

We have something called ' The Danish Model ' and it's a successful combination of economic dynamic and social security.

You are gonna be blessed with the Bernie version ' not me, US ' ⛹️

Many studies in recent years shows that Danes are the most happy and satisfied people in the western world 🌍

Although we are a more
harmoniously composed population, its all about people comming and standing together 👬

And this I believe, is happening right this moment in America with Bernie Sanders strongly and compellingly leading the way.

There is nothing wrong with being social, in terms of securing eachothers backs 👬. It only makes everybody happier 😀 💚🤸

A wise guy once tought me that there is no 'I' in TEAM 😘

I'm writing this because I believe in Bernie Sanders, but also because I believe like him it can be done in the US. Just believe in it and it will happen!

Please remember 🙂 for every positive action you make and for every dollar you are able to donate - the chance that Bernie wins increases every day 🌄

Keep believing!

Lots of love

Tor ❤️

In this case were talking about a guaranteed right, not a governmental permission, but a right that the federal government agrees is a natural God given right and that they have no authority to take it away.  In all reality, how many people that own full size pickup trucks actually need them, but no one tells them they can't have them and the owning of a pickup truck is not a right, so for all intent and purposed can be regulated by the government. Concerning owning rocket launchers and such, they are legal, as well as grenade launchers and flame throwers (from a federal standpoint anyway). Back when this country was founded and up to WWI, many of the weapons were privately owned, including many warships (privateers). Even now you can buy a Gatling gun, just like any other non-Class III firearm. You can even buy a tank or fighter jet, but the weapons have to be deactivated (concrete in the barrel), or removed and replaced with mock-ups.  The main reason the Feds got all controlling about guns was due to Prohibition and Depression era gangsters using Thompson sub machine guns and other fully automatic weapons, passing the Federal Firearms Act in the 1930's to prohibit the sale of automatic weapons, short barreled rifles and shotguns. 

Back to my original thought though, need is not and never will be the governing factor of what type of firearms are legal, because it is a right and as Americans we should be able to have what we want.",1581399636,fha7ora

&gt; Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 849 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 35–36 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.


&gt; congress (and by extension the states) have the ability to regulate civilian ownership of firearms.


&gt; the Court ruled a total ban on operative handguns in the home is unconstitutional, as the ban runs afoul of both the self-defense purpose of the Second Amendment – a purpose not previously articulated by the Court – and the ""in common use at the time"" prong of the Miller decision: Since handguns are in common use, their ownership is protected.

Universal healthcare sounds like a great idea until we start talking about how It's going to be paid for.

I I'm simply not okay with the idea of taking a higher percentage of someone else's money and then using that and redistributing it so that other people Can have the same quality of life. That is literally socialism and I'm not a big fan of that.

I don't think that it's the government's right or job to decide who in our society is going to pay for stuff. It really bothers me that we don't all pay the same percentage of taxes.

I'm certainly not going to push for taxes to be raised on anybody Disproportionately. This seems like mob rule to me. Because it will benefit everybody else. It's okay to take 70% or more of someone else's income. And we can justify it by saying that everybody will get better healthcare. 

And this is assuming that we will in fact get better Healthcare and some people won't get worse Healthcare and just get free healthcare instead of it being better. 

I don't think this plan is feasible because like I said, the only way to fund it is to Raise taxes to a ridiculous level which is going to encourage those people to stop making money. Why on Earth would they keep trying to make money if they're going to lose 70% of it? They'll try to find some kind of loophole. Or donate the money away or they'll try not to make as much money. So it puts them in a lower tax bracket.

Problem #1: Bernies Year over year cost projection appears to be linear and doesn’t assume what we’re seeing right now and that is that people are getting sicker due to poor lifestyle choices. This ultimately means consumption of services could end up out pacing that projected 32 trillion over 10 yen years metric.

Problem 2: Medicare and Medicaid had a direct impact of health insurance costs, and not in the way you might think. These two programs alone increased demand for medical services and eventually that demand out paces supply thus resulting in a price increase (not attributing prices today solely on these two programs). All this to say if we think that giving medical coverage to everyone is not going to cause the cost of medical services to climb then some need to reflect on what happens when you suddenly increase demand for services without methodically increasing supply.

The only way you prevent number 2 from happening is to turn ALL of the health industry into govt owned enterprises. All this will do is still inflate the costs of things because you’ll have to make some sort of buyout or at the very least partnership with these existing hospitals. So already up front costs are going to be higher than expected due to an initial capital investment. How will the govt compensate? Raise the medical tax.

I think that these numbers look good when fit to a model that assumes we aren’t getting sicker and assumes the system today can handle a sudden increase in supply. I’m just not convinced that a system as complex as our health systems are will be magically saved by a health tax and free medical coverage for all.

FORT KNOX, Ky. —
After an effort from some of Kentucky's top lawmakers, Fort Knox has been selected to be the Army's next headquarters.

Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, along with U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, recently sent a letter to the Army's top brass.

In it, they argued Fort Knox already has the capacity to handle the Army's needs.

It looks like the Department of the Army agreed.

According to the Army, Fort Knox will be the fourth corps headquarters location activated and will be called Fifth Corps (V Corps). This new corps headquarters location will bring approximately 635 additional soldiers to Kentucky.

Beth Avey is the vice president of the Knox Regional Development Alliance. The community based organization works to promote and protect Fort Knox in order to maximize its economic impact in the region. Avey says this news is going to have a huge impact on the region.

""Anytime there are new units, or new missions, or new soldiers coming to the installation it has a tremendous economic impact on the entire region actually,"" Avey said.

T.W. Shortt owns a real estate company in Radcliff and is the president of the Radcliff Small Business Alliance. He called the announcement great news for local businesses.

""To us and the economy here it means more housing starts. It's more customers for our small businesses and it's just more activity here in our community which we could definitely use,"" Shortt said.

Army officials said it plans to activate V Corps Headquarters by the fall.

“Fort Knox has proven itself as a leader in our nation’s armed forces time and again, and I’m delighted to announce Secretary McCarthy and General McConville answered my call to station V Corps headquarters in Kentucky,” McConnell said. “As the Army continues modernizing its force structure to counter evolving global threats, Fort Knox is best choice to meet our urgent national defense needs. With its unmatched level of community support, Fort Knox will offer V Corps a warm welcome.""",1581516696,fhe8o1a

Trafficking includes processing or selling marijuana (or possessing with the intent to do so). Trafficking in marijuana is illegal in Kentucky, and penalties vary according to the violation.

Up to eight ounces. A first offense is a class A misdemeanor, punishable with a fine of up to $500, up to 12 months in jail, or both. Second and subsequent offenses are class D felonies, punishable with a fine of between $1,000 and $10,000, between one and five years in prison, or both.

Between eight ounces and five pounds. A first offense is a class D felony, punishable with a fine of between $1,000 and $10,000, between one and five years in prison, or both. Second and subsequent offenses are class C felonies, punishable with a fine of between $1,000 and $10,000, between five and ten years in prison, or both.

Five pounds or more. A first offense is a class C felony, punishable with a fine of between $1,000 and $10,000, between five and ten years in prison, or both. Second and subsequent offenses are class B felonies, punishable with a fine of between $1,000 and $10,000, between ten and 20 years in prison, or both.

Trafficking on or within 1,000 feet of a school building. A violation is a class D felony, punishable with a fine of between $1,000 and $10,000, between one and five years in prison, or both. However, if the violation carries a harsher penalty (for example, trafficking five pounds of marijuana, which is a class C felony), the harsher penalty will apply.

I believe the changes we want to see will be brought about by really getting involved in local issues: city, county, state  &amp; push it up to the hill. 

Get out to meet the candidates, if you align with them DONATE, volunteer for canvassing etc. 

Sense the energy of their words and whether you perceive sincerity.  Or if you can tell they just want the office for personal gain. 

We need fresh voices in office all they way down to city/county, &amp; back up to capital hill.

Kentucky is the BLUE GRASS state!! That could have been a CASH COW.

Our state can still benefit from the revenue, while people that choose to do so can partake of a plant. A plant. 

Inspiration also prompted by Suzanne Collins the ""Hunger Games"".  Dystopian society like that of Katniss's world doesn't become dystopian over night. The few ruling her world are gluttonous for luxury &amp; excesses ruling over those (the many)  sans compassion. 

I'm not saying that's where we are headed as a state or country, it's an exaggeration- satire!  Hopefully.  Still yet... definitely some take away food for thought in those novels.

Also, (and this is having an understanding of the Scottish accent but I definitely cannot mimic it well enough to think I'm anywhere near the right ball park) if I try to reproduce what I think the Scottish accent versus South Central Ky accent, y'all say it more with the back of your tongue/mouth and more thru the nose/nasal area that I would approach it with.

The people who would call a paper sack a 'poke' is related more to Appalachia (eastern Ky and also central West Virginia where my dad was from - there was a grocery where he grew up called the 'Poke &amp; Tote') where the Irish/English/Scots immigrated to when they came over here.  They also use 'reckon' and a few other words that were carried over here - Appalachia's accent, supposedly, is closer to what an English/Irish/Scots accent with particular words due to the geographic isolation of the area; y'alls accent changed over the last few hundred years because it wasn't isolated - theirs didn't.  

A different guy I dated had a cousin who was from Kentucky but lived in California and had an actual Scots girlfriend and we would discuss accents and words and that sorta cultural thing at Xmas while everyone was watching TV and stuffing their faces with more food than they needed.  She also made a \[bain toffee\] pie once for us to try and that shit was the fiiiiiiiire.  I also thought it funny that over the years ('cause me and that dude dated for several) there would be a point in the evening she and I had drank so much that both our collective accents would leave us unintelligible to each other and the guy I dated would laugh at us and act as translator.

A wealth tax (also called a capital tax or equity tax) is a levy on the total value of personal assets, including bank deposits, real estate, assets in insurance and pension plans, ownership of unincorporated businesses, financial securities, and personal trusts. Typically, liabilities (primarily mortgages and other loans) are deducted from an individual's wealth, hence it is sometimes called a net wealth tax.

* The high school mascot is the Scottish Highland Terrier. The band wears kilts, and does (often) feature bagpipers. 
* There's a ""Highlands Pub"" at the state park - but don't get your hopes up. They do serve some Scotch, though.

They’re a very large and culturally distinct ethnic group in America, but are also the ethnic group most likely to describe themselves as simply “American” when surveyed. I once heard a historian describe early American history in terms of a three-sided conflict between New England puritans, English southern cavalier slaveholders, and Scotch-Irish mountain folk that I thought was an interesting lens to view, say, the Whiskey Rebellion through.

5528,kentuckycc,"How does ""Medicare for all"" make a great sound byte but at the same time you call it politically unpopular? If you asked my mother is she wanted a socialized healthcare plan she would give you a resounding no. If you asked her if she wanted the government to use tax dollars to make sure everyone had insurance she would say yes of course. Polls are so leading that its hard to take them even remotely seriously.

I'm a practicing physician, and what I see in my day to day is overwhelming support for medicare for all from my colleagues. Of course some doctors and ""health professionals"" who are making big money off the broken system don't support it. I work with colleges who have worked in NZ and with the NHS and describe systems that function much like the system Warren/ Sanders have described. The NHS is ""efficient"" because the UK pays the lowest healthcare dollars per capita and has some of the best outcomes in the world. It is also one of the most socialized systems in the world. Germany has quasi government run insurers that are similar to how we run managed medicaid and medicare in ky, except that they are much more regulated and not for profit. Its essentially a group of government run insurance companies that are entirely funded by taxpayers. This is just another socialized system with more overhead. This is also very close to what progressives are campaigning for and not at all what the ACA was about. 

I don't know how cutting out predatory insurance companies, who's literal job is to take as much health care dollars and pay out as few health care dollars, is ""completely tearing down our society"" I hope thats hyperbole.

Regarding your question about what a resident would call themselves, an interesting little tidbit on the demonym is that in Kentucky most people don't identify themselves with a city, but rather with a county. If someone were to ask where I was from I would respond with Rockcastle County, and a person from Glasgow would say they were from Barren County. Personally, I think that the reason for this is twofold. 1) There really isn't much in Kentucky, we're a fairly rural state and most of our towns and cities are really only going to be known locally. Few people would know where Brodhead was, but if you say Rockcastle County they may have a better idea of where you're from. 2) One of the unique features of Kentucky is that we have a massive amount of counties (120, to be precise), especially for a state our size. I've always heard that the reason for this goes back to an archaic statute (or perhaps just a guiding principle) that all citizens should be within a day's journey of their county seat of government. In my opinion, this has contributed to the county taking on the role as the primary geographic division with which many of us identify. 

Since you seem to have at least a passing interest in this sort of thing, I'd encourage you to come and visit our state if you ever have a chance. Specifically, you might find the eastern portion of our state particularly interesting, as that is the area that has a stronger Scotch-Irish influence. Don't misunderstand, Appalachian culture is very much its own thing, but it has been heavily influenced by strong Scotch-Irish roots. If you ever visit things will be foreign, yet strangely familiar. There are a lot of negative stereotypes floating around about Appalachia and the people who live there, but I'd argue that you'd have a hard time finding a friendlier and more genuine people. 

As an aside, if you are interested in getting a glimpse of Appalachian culture, I'd recommend checking out the documentary Hillbilly. It was directed by a Eastern Kentucky native who moved away to work in film. In my opinion it's a great examination of what it means to be Appalachian and how that fits in with contemporary society.",1581780085,fhp1l89

5619,Omgomgarewethereyet,"It's not a win so much as it generalizes the region and gives an overview of why the language of Appalachia doesn't exist in a vacuum.  Of course there was/is some migration into the area.  Of course the language isn't static, no language is static.  However, whomever wrote this article is writing it from an outside perspective and looking at the Appalachian region as one continuous region, opposed to seeing it for pockets and enclaves of isolation along the main routes.

I say this because there are Appalachian Black folks in WVa &amp; Ky (and this does include Frank Walker and the Affrlachian Folks) that migrated for the labor to put railways in, dig coal, or were brought with original settlers of gentry prior to the Revolutionary War and Civil War (aka slaves).  An outsider must point this out to other outsiders because people who have experience in the area first hand already know they're there because they're neighbors.

However, the isolation of areas within Appalachia did create a linguistic isolation for generations that would keep the language in some sort of isolation that would keep the accent original to a much older version of English than what evolved in England due to a higher rate of migration and lack of isolation.",1581792666,fhpne73

And, you need not only look at current examples, but also historical examples such as pre-WWII Germany, China in the 1960's, Russia, et al.  Are there exceptions?  Yes.

5622,WikiTextBot,"**FCC fairness doctrine**

The fairness doctrine of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), introduced in 1949, was a policy that required the holders of broadcast licenses to both present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was—in the FCC's view—honest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC eliminated the policy in 1987 and removed the rule that implemented the policy from the Federal Register in August 2011.The fairness doctrine had two basic elements: It required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. Stations were given wide latitude as to how to provide contrasting views: It could be done through news segments, public affairs shows, or editorials. The doctrine did not require equal time for opposing views but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented.

5631,Visual_Wasabi,"&gt; Curios, how has your life declined under Trump to the point that he must be stopped? Please dont echo chamber what you hear on tv. Tell your story.

I don't watch cable news. There's this thing called reading and I recommend you try it sometime. As in major, national newspapers. Local ones even. And books are essential. Facts matter.

I also recommend that you pull your head out of your ass and take a look around at the state of the country as a whole. It's not always about you and your little orbit. No man is an island. Presumably you fancy yourself a proud American. You should spend sometime thinking about what patriotism is. Because it's not nationalism. We don't worship political leaders in this country as if they're Jim Jones. Even though 30-40% of Americans seem to insist on doing so.

Trump is the most worthless and corrupt individual to ever hold the office of President of the United States. He creates chaos on purpose. Why? Because when politicians create chaos it gives them authority. He's a demagogue who appeals to the worst instincts of people who are gullible enough to fall for it. From hateful rhetoric about immigrants, muslims, hispanics, the news media, and anyone else who is ""against"" him. Trump validates the hatred some feel towards others and gives it imprimatur. It's absolutely horrifying for those of us who see it for what it is.

There are many problems in this country--whether you support Trump or not. But everyone who thinks this clown is working for them are being taken for a ride. He doesn't give a shit about you. Trump doesn't give a shit about anyone. Trump cares only about Trump. But he'll tell you whatever it is you *want* to hear. It continues to work on 30-40% of the population. Meanwhile he proudly signs a tax bill that benefits himself, big donors, and big corporations. He's done nothing legitimate on healthcare to help Americans like me. He takes every opportunity to rollback environmental regulations as a favor to lobbyists.

And attempting to coerce another nation into creating ""dirt"" on a domestic political opponent, in exchange for monetary aid that was approved by Congress, should have been the last straw. But no, only Romney--of all people--had enough of a spine to do the right thing. *That* was patriotic.

Don't even get me started on all of Trump's suspect meetings with Putin. Along with all of the campaign's ties to Russia. Mueller's campaign couldn't *establish* that there was coordination doesn't mean that nobody did anything wrong. But Mueller also did not exonerate Trump for obstruction of justice in Vol. II of his report.

Also:

* Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, is in prison having been convicted  on 8 of 18 counts by a jury of his peers.

* Roger Stone, Trump's former advisor and longtime friend, is going to prison having been convicted an ALL counts by a jury of his peers.

* Michael Flynn, Trump's National Security Advisor, pled guilty to a single charge to avoid being hit with multiple charges.

But, hey, Bill Barr is working to muddy the waters enough so that Trump pardoning these felons might seem justified. But only to morons.",1581812282,fhqvfm1

Arrests over social media posts aren’t exclusive to the U.K. It happens in the U.S. as well. Look at the case of Robert Peralta as an example. Freedom of speech doesn’t mean you can shout fire in a crowded theater. 

The last argument I’ll make is regarding your statement “guns secure freedom for the populace”. There is a group called the Cato Institute - a libertarian think tank - who, along with the Fraser Institute, and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom publishes an annual report where they rank countries according to a metric called the Human Freedom Index. The HFI looks at things like personal, civil, and economic freedom, and the U.S. is never at the top. The countries that took the top 10 places in 2019, in order, were New Zealand, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Luxembourg (tied in 6th place), Finland and Germany (tied in 8th place), and Ireland. The U.K. came in at 14, the U.S. at 15. I don’t see a direct correlation between gun ownership and freedom - personal or otherwise.

Lexington is central to pretty much everything, you can get to just about anywhere in Kentucky from there within a 2 hour drive.

There are tons of breweries/bourbon/wine venues/tours in this area that you can experience year round so you're not stuck to Sept. if you were thinking a different date range.   
There is also the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington if you're into that sort of thing.

5690,RotaryJihad,"I'm in the same boat. The major hangup is:  


&gt;good, fast, reliable internet connection.

The major factor to have that is to be on or near a state road or a major county road or near a commercial/industrial area. Once you get away from that, you don't have a lot of options. Whats frustrating is that you don't have options even if you're willing to throw money at the problem to run wires and so on. You also need to see it yourself, just because paw and maw get a flyer from the phone company for ADSL doesn't mean it works out there. I'd pay a several thousand dollar premium for someone with SamKnows or similar historic data for their connection.

The biggest thing that's helped me - making friends out in the county. First, they're awesome friends and I love them dearly. Second, I can go visit and decide if I really like country living or just the idea of it. It's been 8 years or so now and I'm still not sure. Third, they know people and know places; my mates often let me know when grandpa so-and-so is giving up his farm and there's a 30 acre parcel of rough ground (rough meaning not farmable) that I'd love to live on.

Other than that, its a lot like buying any other land. You need to find a good realtor that understands your needs. This includes finding a realtor that understands what ""fast"" internet is, I get 200mbps here in the 'burbs of Louisville. ""Fast"" to my mates in the county is 20. When I visit some of them I better be sure I have my books downloaded before I leave the house because they're barely one step above \*screeching modem noises\*. Other friends have tried to find realtors that don't suck out in western KY and have been through 4 of them, a lot of houses and land are going to need work and they're having trouble finding a realtor that understands the difference between a few modest repairs and ""rebuilding the whole house"", literally.",1581950952,fhxcdtc

Moved to the far NW corner of Grant Co. (Unincorporated, but Dry Ridge zip) back in 2014 from Independence (Kenton Co.).  We dealt with HughesNet satellite internet for almost 5 years which was miserable and expensive.  About a year ago the spools of fiber optic started getting dropped on the roadsides around our little homestead.  Sure enough,  we got Cincinnati Bell Fioptics in March.  It's incredible considering a lot of the wealthy neighborhoods in southern Boone Co. still don't have it.

Despite the remoteness, we also have city water from the Bullock Pen water district.

We really lucked out finding a place that had a ""bardominium"" on it which allowed us to get a regular mortgage and move right in.  I was able to design, plan, and build a ""proper"" house while living on site.(I work in the homebuilding industry.)

5807,KentuckyHouse,"For those who hit the pay wall:

Lawmakers filed nearly a dozen ""unfriendly"" floor amendments last week to the bill seeking to legalize and tax sports betting in Kentucky.

Rep. Adam Koenig, R-Erlanger, the main sponsor for House Bill 137, told The Courier Journal the 11 floor amendments were all filed by Republican opponents of his legislation and expanded gambling, assuming their intent was to throw a wrench into the bill's progress.

After passing out of a House committee by an 18-0 vote on Jan. 15, HB 137 has been passed over for a vote on the House floor every day of the legislative session.

Despite 40 co-sponsors, the near-unanimous support of House Democrats and backing from Gov. Andy Beshear, the bill is having trouble gaining majority support in that chamber's GOP caucus, which it needs in order to get a vote on the House floor.

""This is a Republican Party caucus issue,"" Koenig said. ""I think it's fair to say that if a bill has the majority support of the (Republican) caucus, it probably would get heard. We've got some work to do to get to that point.""

The bill would allow Kentuckians to bet on sporting events at licensed facilities, limited to horse racing tracks and the Kentucky Speedway. People could also download a mobile phone application to bet on sports anywhere. The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission would be responsible for regulating sports betting.

In addition to taxing online poker and fantasy sports contests, the taxes and licensing fees from sports betting would bring in an estimated $22.5 million of new tax revenue each year for the state, according to a study commissioned by Keeneland, a Lexington horse track.

The amendments would greatly alter various aspects of the bill, significantly raising its tax rates, subjecting the Horse Racing Commission to stricter open records requirements, devoting more revenue to gambling addiction assistance and allowing a wider variety of facilities to be eligible for a sports betting license.

Eight of the floor amendments to HB 137 were filed by Rep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

While sports bets at licensed facilities are taxed at 9.75% and bets on mobile apps at 14.25%, one of Petrie's amendments would raise those rates to 14% and 21%, while two others would double and triple those rates.

Another of Petrie's amendments would allow local governments to prohibit sports betting, fantasy contests and online poker in their jurisdiction, while also requiring the sports betting phone app to have software preventing betting in those areas.

Three Petrie amendments raise the portion of tax revenue going toward a problem gambling assistance account from 5% to 7.5%, 10% and 15%, with another requiring that any appeal to a final order of the racing commission take place in a Circuit Court that is more than 60 miles away from any horse track.

Rep. Richard Heath, R-Mayfield, filed a significant amendment to allow many other venues besides race tracks to be eligible for sports betting licenses, including lottery retailers, restaurants where at least 70% of income is food and ""any other secure location deemed appropriate by the commission.""

Other amendments filed by Heath and Rep. Kim King, R-Harrodsburg, would require any information provided to the Horse Racing Commission about horse racing or sports betting to be deemed a public record under the Kentucky Open Records Act, as well as impose a penalty equal to three times the legal fees if the commission is found to have violated that law.

A common theme among the amendments is pushing back against a horse racing industry that has advocated for the bill, reflecting Republican Senate President Robert Stivers' past criticism that it is ""picking winners and losers"" by only allowing sports betting at such tracks.

The amendments also reflect a division within the Republican caucus that was exposed two weeks ago during a simple recognition of two Kentucky Lottery Corp. officials on the House floor by Rep. Jerry Miller, R-Louisville.

Miller, a supporter of HB 137, cited the book of Genesis when detailing the billions of dollars from the lottery that have gone to college scholarships over the past 30 years, saying that good can come from this supposed ""evil"" of gambling.

Rep. David Hale, R-Wellington, a Christian pastor, stood up to reply that he was ""very displeased"" and ""aggrieved"" by Miller's comparison of the lottery to the bible passage, while Rep. Chris Fugate, R-Chavies, quoted another book to say ""woe to them that call evil good and those who call good evil.""

Comparing gambling to opioids, Fugate said ""when we depend on the people of our district to lose money so the state can gain money, it's not biblical ... Don't try to make things right that are wrong in God's eyes, because no matter how you slice it, it's wrong.""

Both Hale and Fugate received applause from at least a dozen legislators after their statements.

Koenig noted that the legislative session is not yet halfway over and there is still time to pass his bill, but acknowledged that tweaks may have to be done to the bill if it doesn't gain more support in his caucus.

""I'm less optimistic than I was before, but I still like its chances,"" Koenig said. ""Obviously, we still need to do some work and might have to figure out some little changes that might make enough people happy. We'll see.""",1582042038,fi0pdj1

Legalize it and tax it. Revenue problem? Gone. Pension problem? Gone. Money for teachers, education, parks, roads and the like? Solved.

I can tell you in Louisville and Lexington there are a handful of growers that i know personally, who only sell their harvest and they make great money, not saying they are scooting around in lambo's and phantom's but they can provide easily for their families. 

Top tier stuff can easily go around 200-300 an oz. That's at minimum $3k per lb. The cost of goods to produce is negligible. Biggest expense is the initial build out, which varies quite a bit depending on what you're growing and where, but it's still possible to make profit if you have a market (which exists in Louisville and Lexington).

Why? 

Lack of research? 

Zero occurances of death related to mj over centuries isn't enough? 

Overall good health of long time users, the MJ pioneers who took so many risk, many who ended up incarcerated for victimless mj only crimes? 

Or is it the mental well being and decreased tendency to be triggered that results in the plants use? 

Personal growth that results from use?

Maybe they want KY to stay in debt to cont being dependent on fed $$$$?

Bernies net worth is 2.5 million. I’m in my 30s and have a higher net worth than that. My mom is a psychiatrist in her 60s and has a higher net worth than that. 

Bernie thinks that billionaires should pay their fair share of taxes and like Thomas Jefferson also believed, be taxed at a higher rate. 

&gt;	“I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable. But the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property, only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind. The descent of property of every kind therefore to all the children, or to all the brothers and sisters, or other relations in equal degree is a politic measure, and a practicable one…Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise.”

And when you are talking about net worth it gets even more convoluted.

But regardless of that, I have no problem with rich people paying more taxes than poor people, and for the most part they already do, by a lot. People focus on income tax paid but there are LOTS of other taxes you have to pay. My problem with Bernie is that he's a hypocritical lunatic who says things like ""billionaire's shouldn't exist"". He focuses on people who are richer than him without admitting he is richer than almost everyone else. And he constantly complains about corruption except his solutions are always to give the GOVERNMENT more power. You think the government is any less corrupt than a business? The difference is a business can be shut down but you can't really get rid of the government without a revolution.

Bernie’s plan is a wealth tax on the top .01% on wealth over $32 million. 

It astounds me the mental acrobatics it takes for a Reddit wage slave to so fervently defend the aristocracy from having to pay their share of taxes. They don’t give a shit about you and would gladly take what you have if it would buy another yacht.

I'm not anti-gun. If folks choose to own hunting rifles or shotguns, that's fine. What I'm against is any yokel being able to go and purchase a handgun or a rifle that's no different from what soldiers use. It's absurd. And the rest of us are having to pay the price for it, mass shooting after mass shooting. Those weapons should be restricted to the military.

And If people want to own a handgun they should have to obtain a license through successfully passing a legitimate firearms safety course in order to purchase one.

The success of a society depends on the shared sacrifice of all its people. I would never argue for amending the Constitution to do away with the 2nd amendment entirely. However, there is no legitimate reason for individuals in our society to own such weapons. Especially while so many die year after year in their schools, workplaces, in public, and in their places of worship.",1582516992,fim3ata
6388,hdmibunny,"&gt;You know precisely what I mean.

Obviously I do not hence why I asked. This is a subjective term that can vary depending on whom you ask. 

&gt;I'm not anti-gun. 

Disagree. You fail to understand the point of the 2nd amendment entirely. You are anti gun if you want to ban ""Assault weapons"". They are the scapegoat of the gun control argument and the main reason politicians fear them is because they know they are effective for the 2nd amendment's true purpose.

&gt;If folks choose to own hunting rifles or shotguns, that's fine. What I'm against is any yokel being able to go and purchase a handgun or a rifle that's no different from what soldiers use.

Shotguns and hunting rifles are both used by soldiers. Two popular examples being the remmington 700 and the Beneli M4 combat shotgun. In fact one of America's most popular commercial  hunting round (the 30-06) is a military cartridge that was adapted by commercial ammunition makers for use in hunting. Ie all military guns will eventually find their way back into civilian hands. If they are good for warfare then they are good at what they do and people will desire them. 

&gt;And If people want to own a handgun they should have to obtain a license through successfully passing a legitimate firearms safety course in order to purchase one. With the weapon registered to them. And no more gun shows or private sales without chain-of-custody of the serial number of the weapon.

So basically make it as hard as possible to obtain one legally. Typical anti gun argument. Disagree with you here but I follow your logic. Harder to obtain = less of them. Less guns = more safe. Disagree but I can see where you're coming from. 

&gt;The success of a society depends on the shared sacrifice of all its people. I would never argue for amending the Constitution to do away with the 2nd amendment entirely. However, there is no legitimate reason for individuals in our society to own such weapons.

The reason the 2nd amendment exists is to give the people the ability to resist a tyrannical government (foreign or domestic, state or federal) and if necessary over throw said government. So, keeping this purpose in mind that is the reason ""they"", as you put it, need ""such weapons"". One could actually argue that in order to be effective we would need tanks/rocket launchers, but that's an entirely different can of worms. 


&gt;Especially while so many die year after year in their schools, workplaces, in public, and in their places of worship.

All rifles (including bolt action ""hunting rifles"") account for less than 6% of all homicides/year. In fact school shootings (although terrible and a heinous act) take up less than .2% of all homicides. You are more likely to be stabbed or beaten to death than be shot in a school. 

The issue isn't guns. It never has been. It's the people who are using them to commit evil acts. That's what should be getting the focus. Not the guns. People need to be the ones held accountable. Not their guns.",1582519777,fim6ra9

1.) That car that looks like it's going to pull out into traffic?  It's going to do that.  Slow down in anticipation.  Did the driver lock eyes with you?  They're still pulling out.  

2.) Don't watch people's faces.  People will look right through you as they're pulling out in traffic.  Watch their front tires.  Tires moving is your ticket that you need to start taking steps to avoid a collision.  

3.)  Drive your own drive.  Someone want to speed up to keep you from passing?  Alright, whatever.  Just get behind them and follow at a safe distance.  You'll still get to your destination and they'll still have a small pp.  Win/Win.

4.)  Don't road rage.  I don't care what another driver does, don't flip them off, get into a screaming match, or get out of your car.  At best everyone around you will think you're flying high on hillbilly heroin.  At worst you'll either wreck or get shot.  Don't do that.  Be chill.

There's been an increasing move to consolidate services, and it's been a good move. It's one of the reasons why Lexington Metro merged with Fayette and Jefferson Metro merged with Louisville. It's the reason why more counties than I can currently name have moved to unified police/fire/medical dispatch and E911. Kentucky is actually starting to do right by the services provided by its absurd county count.

However, the count really does need to come down for it to make even more progress - it'll be hard for county seats to give up their courthouses and judges, but it's really the next most important move. The amount of bureaucracy your average Kentuckian is paying for is absurd...

See how the process goes, figure out the speed bumps, then in a few years try for another.

Something like 75-80% of all alcohol consumed is consumed by the top 10% of drinkers. If you ever get the unfortunate task of running a liquor store, it’ll be plainly obvious to you within your first week. Every store depends on its own set of regulars. The entire industry makes their profits from selling a shit ton of cheap liquor, not from premium bourbon. The vast majority of these distilleries are owned by conglomerates like Sazerac or Diageo that also produce things like cheap vodka and fireball. *That* is where the money is. 

And frankly OP does have a point about an economic bubble. The big distilleries have been heavily ramping up production for almost the past decade and this surplus of aged spirits is going to hit the market over the coming decade. There will be a huge glut of really good, really affordable bourbon, thus hype and prices will level off if not decrease substantially, and small distillers who have yet to make a name for themselves (usually because they choose to release underage, shitty overpriced products just to get something on the shelves) will fail to compete.

This conversation left me only one thing that I am grateful for: you're only one vote. There are more people fucked by the current system that literally the only thing that would make it worse is if providers stopped accepting Medicaid and community hospitals shut down because they don't have the resources to go against the insurance companies. Wait a second............

Your fundamental grasp of healthcare is elementary, which I applaud you for not having to be part of the system. Have you not heard of preauthorizations? Do you not realize that insurance companies require stupid hoops that have to be jumped through in order to get the healthcare one needs? There are massive delays RIGHT NOW and the current system isn't doing anything more than making it more difficult for those that need the system.

I'm not trying to pick an old wound, and please forgive me, but looking through your post history I see you've been part of a pretty tragic situation. Are you saying that you didn't benefit from public funds during that time? If your employer didn't pay your medical expenses could you imagine seeing the bills come in? Or did you experience that: seeing places ask money for someone who isn't here?

Healthcare in the US is an absolute nightmare for those that need it. And that's what this policy is for. People will still go to Walgreens for their cough medicine and others will go to the emergency department because their opiod addiction caused constipation. Medicaid patients will still take ambulances to the ER because their family won't take them to the urgent care and someone will still uber after a heart attack to make sure they get to the in network hospital. MFA won't solve all those problems, but I for one would be more than happy to pay my current premiums to ensure that EVERYONE gets a shot at proper care, not just me.

Contrary to popular belief, the actual providers of healthcare (Clinics, Hospitals, small practices like your typical small town primary care provider) don't make money hand over fist. many of them scrape by year after year, watching for the next change in regulations that affects reimbursements from the government and fighting tooth and nail with insurance providers for every dime. And watching the frequent flyer IV drug abusers and addicts walk in and get free health care (Free as in they have no intention of paying the bills they accrue) when they get an infection from dirty needles, get treated, released, and then eventually have to have a heart valve replacement because the repeated infections have destroyed their heart. and we won't get paid for most of that care as we are required by law, to treat these people. And we watch as a young family struggles to pay bills for their first child, and watch as an elderly couple faces bills that they can't pay and medications they can't afford because one or the other them got sick. We help out as much as we can, Walmart is considered Evil here, but they have a $4 dollar medication list that has helped many when they could not afford basic medications. And we have to use cut throat collection agencies to try and reclaim what we can. no other choice if we are to survive as shitty as it is.

There are 45 Democrat Senators and 2 Independents in the Senate now, 53 Republicans. 60 votes are needed to pass a bill through the Senate.

The Senate races this year do NOT have good news for Democrats. Alabama's seat is practically considered lost, meanwhile there are safer-than-safe seats for Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia (seats 1 and 2), Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

Sure, we might pick up Maine, Arizona, and New Mexico, but if Alabama is lost, that might not even get us the 51 votes needed to pass something via Reconciliation or by removing the 60 Vote Cloture rule (named the Nuclear Option for a VERY GOOD REASON, because it will result in unprecedented chaos for our hyper-partisan nation).

That's why I'm supporting candidates who focus on change that can ACTUALLY get passed. Repairing the ACA. Restoring the subsidies and reinsurance rates the GOP has gutted.

If the whole country was in a group, the healthy people would offset the sicker people. All doctors would take and get similar/same pay rates. The overall healthcare cost would go down. We, as a nation, offset the cost of sick people who can only get services in the ER. If everyone has insurance, then there is less abuse of the system.

However, physicians aren't what cripple the VA health system it's the bureaucracy in the other wings. It's months waiting for an initial appointment for BH or specialty care if you don't meet the minimum for inpatient. Its spending hours on your day off on hold or being transferred to the next hold line. If I'm being honest my experience with the VA was very positive for the first few years after service. But after:
-Having a provider refuse to change a prescription despite chronic complications with it, then threatening to recommend my issue not be covered if I continued to refuse.
-A $4000 bill from ST. E after the VA transferred me directly for emergency care (service connected) because they were swamped then covered less than $10 of it.
-Almost complete loss of function in my dominant arm/hand with months waiting in between appointments only to end up with a medical prognosis of ""it will get better or it wont""

Then when I asked if they really pay for absolutely nothing, including part of the premiums - which is extremely common, almost standard - or even copays, they said they have copays. Then they said they couldn’t remember the last time they went to the hospital. When I asked again if anything came out of their check or if they had any limitations, they said zero dollars came out of their check. 

I’m not saying that’s not possible, but if it’s true, that healthcare scenario is the rarest of the rare. 100% of insurance premiums paid for the individual is rare, and even in that rare situation they’ll cover something like 80% for dependents.

I’m all for hearing dissenting arguments, but when those arguments are totally unverifiable and are so unique to one person’s situation I don’t think it even warrants a discussion. We shouldn’t decide to pass or not pass legislation based on the exception to the rule, and frankly, I don’t think I’ve seen arguments that expand beyond “this will suck because the government sucks” or “this just won’t work.” My favorite, “how will we pay for this?” of course never gets asked when we increase military spending, which has happened already under the current administration and as the deficit continues to rise.

And even if I believed we should have that argument, there are plenty of reasons to still pass M4A even if you’re currently in a great healthcare situation, to name a few:

* Employers aren’t required to provide 100% of the premiums, meaning they could decide to offer you partial coverage at any time

* You could lose that job

* In retirement you very likely won’t have that benefit (this would again, be the exception.) and couples that retire right now are estimated to need $300,000 in retirement for medical costs alone and those costs are only expected to rise.

6944,insufferable__pedant,"Is there a more specific question that you have regarding higher education? I'm more than happy to answer questions you may have. 

1) As both a graduate and former employee of several of our public institutions, I can say that I have had positive experiences. As a professional in the field, if you're looking at public institutions you'll have a hard time finding a ""bad"" one. Sure, some institutions may have a more prestigious reputation than others and different types of institutions (large research universities vs regional institutions, for example) may serve your needs better or worse, but, as a whole, all of our public institutions are comprised of dedicated individuals who are focused on their students. I will say that the budget cuts and new funding models we've seen throughout the Bevin administration have done a number on some of the institutions. We've seen some have to eliminate entire departments and dramatically cut back in others. Still, they're doing the best they can with what they have available to them. 

2) for me, personally, no. But I studied liberal arts subjects, which don't really have a direct application in the job market. Instead, a liberal arts education gives you a broad skill set and, essentially, teaches you how to think which, ideally, should be applicable to a variety of different administrative and clerical positions. I eventually earned my master's, which was related to the field in which I'm employed. It's important not to think of college as too much of a vocational training program. Sure, some fields will be closer to their respective markets, but that's not universally the case. My advice to students is to have a plan in place and think about where they're going. Obviously, it may not be a great idea to take out massive amounts of debt while pursuing a degree in psychology or philosophy, but if you know what you're doing and have a plan for after you graduate it could make more sense. Alternatively, if your goal is simply to get a decent paying job and to get into the job market as quickly as possible, a two year degree from one of our community colleges can be a great option. The question of ""is it worth it"" (I'm assuming this is part of your question) can be difficult to answer and often varies from one person to another.",1582838618,fiyfvuv

I had friends who went to certain liberal arts colleges with more prestige attached to their names, but I’d put my education up against theirs any day of the week. That said, speaking as someone from a blue collar, lower middle class family, the value of attending a more exclusive or private school isn’t necessarily in the education itself but rather that it puts you on a first name basis with a higher economic class of people, which in turn can lead to opportunities you may otherwise not have.

I then went to UK for law school. I can’t compare it to undergrad simply because they are two very different types of programs. There are few people who truly enjoy law school, but I was well prepared by the program and genuinely liked most of my professors. I passed the bar on my first try and have practiced law ever since.

I WANT climate change reform... which is why I think it is moronic to enshrine every social program Bernie thinks will earn him brownie points under his Green New Deal. By lumping $6 trillion a year in social programs right alongside climate change proposals, it ensures NONE get passed. Our planet and our future deserve better.

And beyond that, Bernie's promises matter because when he lies, it hurts people. Just like you don't go running into a hospital telling everyone you have a cure for cancer, when you go telling people you can make your college free, your medical care free, your childcare free is not just campaign promises, but actively damaging to people's lives when you can't deliver.

People will remember your promises when they still have college loans outstanding, medical bills in collections, or a daycare tuition payment that burns a hole in their pocket every week.

They will be unable to forgive you if their spouse is in jail for a minor drug charge that Bernie said would be expunged. Or if their family member is locked up in an ICE detainment center for trying to enter the country as a refugee.

They will spit on your name and the entire Democratic Party when they remember Bernie promising to Stop Endless Wars when they get news that their son or daughter died in the most recent conflict to flair up that the US needed to step in to prevent tens of thousands from being killed.

Bernie doesn't have the votes, the coalition building, the budgetary juggling skills, or any legitimate path to making any campaign promise he has made true. That doesn't mean I don't think what he's talking about aren't problems - they are SERIOUS, HUGE problems.

But just because saying you have a cure for cancer might make people happy, or believing that curing cancer is the right thing to do, or ever that you believe you HAVE a cure for cancer, you just haven't tested it, gotten it through the FDA, or have any real vehicle for rolling it out to patients suffering today... it still is immoral and wrong to tell people you have that cure. Not until its ready. Not until you are sure. 

And right now, Bernie has zero way forward. Not just with one or two of his proposals, but for his entire platform. Each one is a monumental, massive project and would require not only a hugely coordinated rollout, but political will which is just not in existence. But rather than address that or walk through the details, he continues to add more and more to the list. With every new promise, the preceding promises become less likely to pass.

That's reality. That's politics. That's the world and how it works. Its not excuses - its simple math, nuts and bolts.",1582860919,fizepd5

When you see a big train of them like that it means that they were recently launched and still bunched up. They're launched into a relatively low orbit, partially so that if any spacecraft have a problem they'll de-orbit soon due to the thicker (but still very very very thin) air. They also aren't in their operational attitude yet (the direction they're pointing) so they're a little more reflective. So every time a batch launches you get a lot of videos of these crazy bright satellite trains. Over a few weeks/months they spread out and raise their orbits, becoming dimmer. SpaceX is also working on making them less reflective.

That's not to say we won't see them. We absolutely will, especially when there are thousands. But it'll be closer to the thousands of satellites that are already up there that most people already don't notice.

If you have any other questions, let me know. I don't work for SpaceX or anything but I know a bit about how this stuff works and enjoy spreading the knowledge!",1583096869,fj7rrwp

You are absolutely correct! You missed the punchline in the following paragraphs though. I think you also missed the sarcasm from the quoted word “erroneously”. It’s not that these children don’t deserve the aid, it’s just that the school officials were using a different method to report the numbers that better reflects the reality of the situation, which has also been perfectly acceptable for the last 17 years. 

It’s so good and christian of the current administration to step in and punish these children over a bureaucratic error instead of rectifying it. As a minister, I hope your proud of them.

I read the article, seems to me that it was USEd that started allowing this other (technically illegal) method of reporting to begin with. For 17 years no one has had a problem with that. Then along comes the trump administration and suddenly we have to cut funds to correct this problem? If the trump administration is so good at fixing problems and he cares so much for these poor kids, why is it that his administration has to punish these school districts (schools no one is claiming doesn’t deserve the funding, just that they’ve been reporting it wrong for 17 years, which USEd allowed) while they fix a bureaucratic issue? If the USEd has accepted this for 17 years then you can’t blame the school districts for reporting that way. I’m sure there is a way to bring this issue into compliance with the law without cutting funding, it’s been done for 17 years.

Maybe some school districts might have been receiving federal aide that they should have not qualify for and possibly taking money away from other school systems that actually need the aide. State and local governments are responsible for funding education. The federal government funds a small part and provides aide to those school districts that need the help.  Laws are put in place so that the federal aide goes where it is needed not to school districts that are trying to compensate for the underfunding by state and local governments. The Trump administration is just trying to get the house back in order. Either the school districts apply for aide the proper way or Congress changes the law. If the school system legitimately needs the money then they will receive the aide.,1583277769,fjet6kk

7374,Kyreloader,"Of course I’m frustrated with congress but they are not to blame for cutting off the funding. They made this law years ago and set forth the criteria. Someone (most likely in the US Ed. Dept. I suppose) along the way decided it would be ok to not follow this law exactly to the letter, which should have never happened but it did (this is where I would place blame). Along comes trump, 17 years after the fact, ‘getting the house back in order’ as you put it. His solution is to cut off funding altogether thereby punishing poor, rural kids simply because they are governed by a dysfunctional government (government said it was ok to do what they were doing for 17 years then government suddenly decides that it’s not ok after all). So yes, I certainly think this could have been handled better by the current administration. I didn’t realize ‘draining the swamp’ involved cutting funding for poor, rural school districts on a technicality. 

I’m not talking about what the feds should or shouldn’t offer state school districts, I’m only talking about what they currently do offer and the way it’s been offered for over 17 years. I would make the same critique of the Obama or Bush administrations, they might have both been around for this if it’s over 17 years old. I don’t know exactly what ‘cut off funding’ means but if it means stopping payments that these schools are expecting for the current school year, then that’s awful and harmful. How long will it take congress to address this issue, how long for the schools to go back to whatever reporting the law actually requires? Can it be resolved in time for the next school year? There’s a new census this year and that’s what the legal issue revolves around so I can definitely see better ways to manage this issue than just cutting them off.",1583285609,fjf6y88

1. The bill would allow people to use thier Social Security Card and a signed statement as a valid form of ID. FYI EVERY natural born citizen of the US should already have this unless it has been lost or stolen.

2. If you are a legal immigrant(greencard), have ever left the country legally(passport), served in the military(CAC card), have a credit card(as per this bill), drive a car legally(Driver's License), bought alcohol or tobacco(Requires a legal ID as proof), or done any other activity that requires a legal ID, then you already have a valid form of ID.

3. If you can't afford transportation to the circuit clerk's office, how can you afford transportation to the polls?

4. A legal ID costs like $10, lasts about 4 years and the process to get one takes about 15 minutes. If you can't come up with $10 and 15 minutes of free time, how do you survive in this economy?

So in short summary: EVERY legal US citizen living in KY should already have some form of legal ID and acquiring one is trivial for even the poorest kentuckian. Also there might be all of one guy in KY who lost his Social Security card, doesn't drive, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't have $10 to his name, works a job with the exact same hours as the county clerk's office, and can't take 1 hour of unpaid leave from work who's vote is being suppressed.",1583292550,fjfim8j

4. Plenty of people CAN’T do that, which is exactly my point. Homeless people still are citizens and still have the right to vote. You think they have 10 bucks to spare on a fucking photo ID? Also literally ANY financial barrier to voting is unconstitutional and considered a poll tax. 

You can pretend like there’s 1 guy who’s being hurt by this, but ALL of the current research on voter ID laws JUST LIKE THIS ONE across the country do nothing to stop in person voter fraud (which isn’t a thing that happens, frankly) and only works to disenfranchise people.

Fair is fair, if we want voter ID laws we really should make the IDs freely available on principal.

As for point 3, i see no reason why those same organizations can't help fare voters to the clerk's office to acquire IDs and some could even buck up the funding to help pay for them.

Also, considering you're writing a master's thesis on this, i assume you have at least one credible source for ALL that research?

Nowhere is anyone saying that the school districts are misrepresenting the situation. They were explicitly told by DoE officials to use another set of numbers because the numbers requested in the law are known to be less accurate than other counting methods in certain areas.

These kind of administrative/procedural allowances are normal in a wide range of places in government. Normally in a situation like this, if you had any concern at all about the impact on those effected (low income children in this case) you would send out a memo announcing that the change was coming, give people the opportunity to update their reporting procedures, and have a transition period.

In other situations where professional staff have suggested that the administration wasn't in compliance with the law, the administration has moved ahead under the theory that their interpretation of the law is what matters, and gone ahead with whatever they wanted to do until they were stopped in court.

They had these messages placed everywhere as well. Mind you, these are public schools. It created hostile environments among students and I watched a number of them result in bullying or outright violence. It creates school sponsored cliques, in essence, and anyone not a member (and the students will always find a handful of other students to single out to not be members) can be ostracized by their peers. Teachers are less sympathetic when they find the reason is that the student's beliefs are contrarian to the ones posted throughout the school by the administration. That is antithetical to a learning environment.

Also, bible groups would regularly receive benefits that nonmembers would not such as time out of the classroom to pray or the ability to stay in the auditorium during a prayer that precedes an event. Walking out of a school prayer is frowned upon by other students. Not bowing your head and participating is equally frowned upon.

Income and Poverty

Household Income — Household income rose briskly under Trump.
The Census Bureau’s measure of median household income reached $63,179 in 2018, an increase of $1,400 from 2016 after adjusting for inflation.
In percentage terms, the increase during Trump’s first two years is 2.3%. (The median figure represents the midpoint — half of all households earned more, half less.)
The official figure is the highest ever recorded, exceeding previous records set in 2016 and 2017. But Census officials said those recent “records” are all due in part to a change in the survey questions in 2014. Starting then, the annual survey has picked up some sources of income that were previously missed.
Adjusting for that factor, and also for a change in the way Census processed data starting last year, Census officials published “estimated adjusted” figures showing what median household income would have been for past years, had the current questionnaire and processing procedures been in place. On that basis, the latest figure is just a few dollars less than it was in 1999 — $63,231.
￼
The “estimated adjusted” figures also show an even greater increase during Trump’s first two years than the official figures, because the new data processing procedures had the effect of holding down income by a fraction of a percentage point. On an adjusted basis, the increase under Trump would be $1,638, or 2.7%.
Poverty — As incomes rose, the rate of poverty declined. The percentage of Americans living with income below the official poverty line went down to 11.8% of the population in 2018, the lowest level since 2001.
The poverty rate has now declined for four consecutive years, dropping by 1.3 percentage points in 2015, by 0.8 points in 2016 and by 0.4 points and 0.5 points in Trump’s first two years.

A pandemic is any disease that crosses over from another species.

COVID-19 absolutely crossed over from another animal (the question is if it was bats or pangolins (an asian cross between an ant-eater and an armadillo).

Therefore, by definition, COVID-19 is a pandemic. Pandemics are usually worse/more virulent, because hopping from one species to the next usually creates challenges our immune systems haven't seen before, making them often more dangerous.

He is 100% right that it violates the rules that the public overwhelmingly supported in passing. If we pass those rules but never adhere to them, then what is the point? That to me is the far more offensive grandstanding violation. That is lip service to a concept our representatives have an obligation to adhere to. 

Rand voted for the tax cuts, but they both don't violate this rule, were passed in normal procedure, and he has multiple times proposed cuts and spending reductions to bring the budget in line. Ignoring that tax revenue has continued to increase despite the cut in rates, all of it is ultimately irrelevant if Congress won't take the basic steps to rein in the budget which is otherwise completely disconnected from the tax rate.

Check out Brandenburg, they have a nice waterfront park with some good family events. Etown is good for basic shopping and entertainment, but we like going to Louisville for more variety and for special-ish occasions. There's also more of a racial mixture in Louisville.

NGL, you're going to run into racism that you're not used to, especially being from the Bay Area. There's not a LOT of racist people, but there's enough to be disturbing, especially with the way the n-word is casually thrown around. I've also witnessed older white folks giving mixed race couples the stink-eye, and while I haven't personally heard any comments about that, I'm sure it happens. That being said, you'll probably get less of all that around Fort Knox/Radcliff, just because (in my experience), military people are  more racially tolerant. You also have the whole Southern manners thing, which helps keep people from making rude comments, and they'll keep their thoughts to themselves! 

All that's just a few bad apples anyway. Overall, you're going to be pretty shocked by how friendly people are here. My SO (from San Jose) and I were both confused the first time someone waved as they passed us driving down our street, but it's just a neighborly thing they do here! And strangers really do start conversations with you in stores and such. It takes some getting used to, but it's nice! 

Traffic is going to be a whole different world for you. The worst traffic jams I'd run into when I was commuting to Louisville were typically 20-30 minute delays. (Of course, if there's a snow storm, that's a different story. Plus for some reason they don't use tire chains here, I don't get it.) People tend to drive slower here too, on average.

You also just have more freedom here. Just wait til you try to build a shed on your property and no one cares! And your son is allowed to run at recess! They're a lot stricter about alcohol sales here, but oh well, nobody's perfect.

7866,insufferable__pedant,"I grew up just north of London and just east of Somerset; those were the primary cities we went to if we needed to do shopping or other ""town"" stuff and I've got plenty of family in both places, so I think I'm fairly well qualified to comment on the region. 

I'd say that it was a perfectly fine place to grow up; I knew most of my neighbors and, it being a small community, most people sort of knew each other or each other's families. If it weren't for the lack of opportunities for a young(ish) professional down there I'd definitely consider moving back. Most folks down there are more than welcoming to outsiders, so if you put forth the vaguest effort integrating into the community shouldn't be a problem at all. In terms of crime, most of what you're going to see is going to be drug related and various petty crimes. Violent crime isn't all that common, and when it does happen it's very seldom random or incidental. That being said, aside from the occasional spots that have reputations for trouble, I've never felt unsafe in Rockcastle, Laurel, or Pulaski counties (where you'll find Mt. Vernon, London, and Somerset, respectively). 

I won't sugar coat things, like a lot of places in rural America these parts of the state are dealing with various ills stemming from drugs and underemployment/lack of opportunity. It's not as widespread as you might find in other parts of the state, but it's still there. Because I-75 runs through or near these places, decent-ish jobs are a bit more plentiful and you don't see the same kinds of situations that you might in some of the more remote parts of the state. 

As far as other relevant information goes: don't worry about crime in Somerset, it's fine. It's one of the larger cities in the region, so you'll see higher instances of crime simply as a function of population. I have no actual data to back this up, but having spent most of my life just outside of it I'd wager that crime per capita isn't significantly worse than the neighboring areas. If you start to look at London I will note that currently (and for the next couple of years, I believe) traveling northward will be a little frustrating. They're currently in the middle of a project to widen I-75 through Rockcastle County. It's been a minute since I've been stuck in it (it finally moved past the exit I take for my parents' place), but it could get pretty messy. I may be a bit biased, but I always preferred Rockcastle County ( Mt. Vernon, where I grew up) and Pulaski County (Somerset) over Laurel County (London) and Whitley County (Corbin). They all have their pros and cons, though. Rockcastle is more rural, by comparison, so you may be able to get more home/land for your money as compared to some of the others. I can also say that there's some real passion in the county to bring some life back into the area, which is nice to see. 

Personally, I've never been all that fond of the Jackson Purchase, but your milage may vary. I don't think the landscape is anywhere near as interesting, and, culturally, it might as well have been a different state. Admittedly, I haven't spent much prolonged time out there, but if you enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking then the eastern part of the state is probably a better fit.

The lack of young turnout isn't an issue of personal issue, it's a systemic issue of voter suppression . Not all of that suppression is intentional on the part of the dnc, it mostly has to do with economics.

Because politics is bigger than just voting. Maybe that's only what corrupt elected officials are concerned with, but because of the barriers to voting, both legal and practical, and the actual incapacity of the system to produce real change, the politics of the younger generation is developing outside the electoral sphere. Bernie is trying to tap into that by creating a movement, and it's working, but perhaps not to the effect needed for him to win the presidency. That's okay though, because this doesn't start or end with Bernie. We are building a movement of organized, experience socialists. We will create unions, we will create community networks for self defense and resource sharing, and we may end up making a new political party if they try to shove Diamond Joe or some other moderate down our throats again.

Election days should be statewide and national bank holidays (for generals) to ensure the opportunity for younger voters to go to the polls (I'm guessing that is what you were alluding to). But as circumstances stand now, most states offer some form of early voting (including primaries). Election day is just the deadline. I always vote early to get it out of the way. I would imagine passionate Bernie supporters would have prioritized assuring their vote went through above all else. If this isn't the suppression you are alluding to, please clarify.

I respect most kinds of political activism and believe that a lot of Sanders' ethos is rooted in the fruits of FDR but ideological change in the states is glacial. Although the US benefited from tons of socialist programs over half a century ago, the country had since experience decades of stigmatizing of big government throughout the cold war. That prolonged antagonizing has made the s-word a national pipe dream in the climate of 2020. I think one of the greatest missteps of democratic socialism is this attempt to gun for the executive branch before having an evenly spread success/support in local then state, then national politics (much like the green party of the past). Even if Sanders became president this year, how would he get anything done with an adversarial House and Senate?

1. There are other impediments as well, and also wide lack of faith in the system. Lots of young people believe in Bernie's message but don't think it's possible to get any of it done, and I personally agree with that sentiment, but we drive the message anyways because it's bigger than just an election cycle.


2. Hypothetically speaking, Bernie would coordinate strikes in specific parts of industry  to force the hand of an opposition congress. I think it makes sense to go for the executive as you can get the most done there in a single go. Our branches are pretty unbalanced these days and most of the real power is in the executive.

You're right about the brain washing and all that, but for me anyways, you've got the priority backwards. It isn't using socialism to bring people to Bernie, it's using Bernie to bring people to socialism. Creating more educated, capable socialists is what gives this campaign its revolutionary potential. If we can't get the American people on board with socialism, the coming white racial minority will respond to climate change and their draining political power by destroying democracy to retain said power, instituting a fully fascist state and effectively hitting the American self-destruct button. Fascism could take hold in Germany because it was demographically fairly homogeneous, with jews being a small minority. The US will be close to only half white, and not all whites will be on board, so the country will fall into civil war between Fascists and those would be removed from society.

Obviously some kind of social state like Marx talked about where private property is abolished is a ridiculous thing to say is necessary for climate change to be mitigated.  Climate change is something to be dealt with by science, engineering, emergency management, etc.  The best answer seems to be big legislation like the Green New Deal, a lot of wind and solar energy, lots of planting trees and environmental engineering and so on, lots of regulation on emissions, and more.

As I'm sure others in this post would be quick to remind us, the green new deal is politically unviable / impossible in the current system.

When soft money dominated politics in the era of the FECA - your local parties maintained a local grip on their candidates as they controlled who got the money.  It was the last bastion of the party-centric election model since we've moved away from mass meetings and open conventions in the 1970s.  


So in order to ""reduce the influence of money in politics,"" we made money more valuable by keeping the state and county parties from distributing cash.  As a result, individual contributions and PACs are the only way to make money, and with the limits currently in place, PACs aren't really effective in giving significant money.  


As a result, individual donors are top dogs.  Which means groups, services, and individuals who bring in donors get to set the agenda.  As such, the parties have significantly self-governed themselves into polar positions.  


Abortion and Gun Rights are two of the largest groups for which people self-categorize.  Bernie Sanders was historically pro-gun, Bernie Sanders was historically anti-immigration -- he backed off those because his donors made him.

To all those people who are on the fence about Biden/Sanders: I get that Bernie's people are a little ""extra"". Some are even too far gone. Don't let those people decide whether you like his policies or not. 

If you like the idea of universal healthcare (it IS doable, once you remove the stranglehold the current healthcare industry has on us), want corporations to pay their fair share without all the ""loopholes"" that keep them tax exempt, want a woman's right to choose, want fairness in immigration, value education as important to a healthy society, understand the important job we have to do to reverse climate and environmental issues, to want to end the war on drugs and actually DO something to combat addiction illness... Vote Bernie. He's been fighting for this for years.

Joe Biden is not a bad guy. But I personally view him as a guy who won't do much to change status quo (other than hopefully undo some of Trump's b.s.). He's not trying to fundamentally shape or fix anything, just beat Trump. I want more from my president. 

There will be pushback, no matter the nom. Especially if the Senate doesn't change. Biden will most assuredly cause the right to jump into action. Look at what they did to cover up the hunt to discover how his son was on the board of Burisma. Grown men and women lied, refused to cooperate, and flat-out broke oaths to their office and the American people. Just to make him look bad- and he wasn't even running yet. Bernie will get pushback from lobbyists, big pharma, the super rich, and nay sayers who somehow still equate some of his democratic socialism ideas with the Red Scare.


Will I vote for Bernie? Yes. Will I vote for Joe if I can't vote Bernie in the election? Absolutely. Trump has to go. But that doesn't mean I'll be excited about the future. I'll still not own a credit card but be thousands of dollars in medical debt (and fear for my elderly parents future). I'll still watch while companies like Apple, Amazon and Pfizer make billions off of people and not pay their fair share. I'll still worry we're not doing enough for the environment and education.

I’m sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people -- neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.

""But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest -- because, I don’t know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn’t have a permit. So I only tell you this: There are two sides to a story.

I'm for biden and it's a purely strategic move.  what's pushing me away from bernie even though I agree with his platform pretty much 100% is one very obvious thing. he's made zero attempts to attract the moderate vote. the people that he's basing his campaign on, which are not the majority of the party. right now that's black people and women who are overwhelmingly moderate and are turned off by his message of revolution. they don't want his pie in the sky ideas. they just want trump gone. and you know that the squish republicans are far more comfortable voting for biden than they are voting for the socialist. it's highly probable that they would leave the president spot blank on the ballot than vote for trump if sanders is the guy.

also keep in mind that bernie can promise the moon, but nothing has any chance of happening unless the democrats hold both houses of the legislature.  its why I'm not paying attention to either of biden's or bernie's plans since they pretty much mean squat until we know the makeup of the congress. bernie is not boosting turnout, the white hot burning desire to get trump out is. and I do not see bernie's core demos being enough of a bump to flip the senate or maintain the house seats won in 2018.

bernie already has my vote. he needs to prove he can get centrists and the moderate of both parties to vote for him.  the southern states have shown yet again that bernie isn't connecting with them, and no number of black endorsements short of obama's is going to change their minds. he's plodding on with his loser strategy of 2016 in 2020 when it's clear it isn't working. hitting the square peg harder to fit in the round hole is going to fail. and it won't be the media's fault or a dnc conspiracy that bernie's losing. it will be his own damn fault.",1583679937,fjxp47n

I would pay another $10,000 in taxes each year for my family because that's still so much less than what we have paid for private health insurance that was terrible and had such high deductibles we couldn't use it.

On her website she expressly broke out what could be done via executive action and what would require legislative action. She understood her limitations, and also how to put building blocks in place that the next administration OR the next left leaning Congress, could build on. That's the kind of thing I want to see; Bernie isn't coming close to that. 

I know that Biden was around to learn lessons from getting the ACA passed, so on some level he has to understand the limitations of the office as well.

I mean, yes, this is good, just FYI but there are lots of progressive candidates. What you need to get is that the radical change that's required can't happen playing by the current rules. 



It looks like you're mainly pro Biden because you see him as working within the unalterable constraints as you see them, which in this case, happen to be a 'moderate' to conservative electorate and a system that precludes the possibility of radical change, constitutionally.



I'm mainly pro Bernie because I see him working within the unalterable constraint of ecology, ie, we have less than 10 years to become carbon neutral or my future is going to be a mad max hell scape. This is a limit imposed by nature, by science. I consider this to be more of a hard limitation than the American constitutional system.

If my choices are:





1. A moderate getting change done within the system, change which could potentially be achieved according to typical wisdom, but would be insufficient to prevent climate tragedy





2. A radical working outside the system, where change might not succeed, but could have the chance to potentially prevent climate tragedy.

8471,mr_tyler_durden,"As I said many times before, I’m (29M) not worried about dying from this virus and most people on here are probably in the same boat. HOWEVER I am worried about panic and fear putting my life and other people’s lives in jeopardy. I read a great thread the other day about [I am terrified of #COVID19 Not because the virus is going to kill people, but because poverty might.](https://twitter.com/nomedabarbarian/status/1232922661740613634?s=21) 
and equally as important this thread about [I think most people aren’t aware of the risk of systemic healthcare failure due to #COVID19 because they simply haven’t run the numbers yet.](https://twitter.com/lizspecht/status/1236095180459003909?s=21).

Bottom line, yes, if we had the beds and the supplies and sick time then this might be closer to “just the flu” (remember it’s not, read the OP’s articles!) but we don’t have those things. We shouldn’t panic but we need to be realistic. Our best option is to stretch this out for as long as we possibly can so that we don’t overwhelm our healthcare system and that means WASH YOUR HANDS and take this seriously (among the other great points the OP put forward). Even if YOU have good odds for not dying/getting very sick YOUR actions do affect the people around you. So don’t wash your hands for yourself, wash them for your parents, your grandparents, your aunts and uncles. Even if they are under 60, if our healthcare system is overwhelmed that average death age is going to start to track downwards as people who could have survived it don’t because they don’t have the beds/supplies.

8598,-protonsandneutrons-,"I thought that, too, but then [**these articles**](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181023-the-places-that-escaped-the-spanish-flu) showed that mortality rates in earlier epidemics and pandemics significantly dropped if communities activated ""protective sequestration"": sequestration of healthy populations ***way*** earlier than by the time anyone has even gotten infected.

Once you hit patient zero, you've ceded a lot of control &amp; you can't go back in time. Especially as people go on spring break next week and come back on March 30th.

&gt;**In all, the authors of the report focused on seven communities that they found had escaped the virus,** although they say there may have been others they did not identify. Among them were the rural farming village of Fletcher, in northern Vermont, and Gunnison, Colorado, a remote town in the Rocky Mountains. Princeton University in New Jersey, Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, the Western Pennsylvania Institution for the Blind in Pittsburgh and the Trudeau Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Saranac Lake, New York.  
&gt;  
&gt;“These communities basically shut themselves down,” explains Howard Markel, an epidemiological historian at the University of Michigan who was one of the authors of the study. “No one came in and no one came out. **Schools were closed and there were no public gatherings. We came up with the term ‘protective sequestration’, where a defined and healthy group of people are shielded from the risk of infection from outsiders.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;But there may be some benefit to keeping the virus out for as long as is possible. American Samoa implemented a five-day quarantine for all boats that kept influenza from its shores until 1920. When it finally did arrive, the virus appears to have lost much of its sting and there were [**no deaths attributed to influenza in a population of more than 8,000**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570822). **The main island of Samoa to the northwest, however, lost around a fifth of its population to the pandemic.**

 [**This article**](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-cancel-everything/607675/?utm_source=digg) goes a little wild, but aims for the same goal:

&gt;As the disease was spreading, Wilmer Krusen, Philadelphia’s health commissioner, allowed a huge parade to take place on September 28th; some 200,000 people marched. In the following days and weeks, the bodies piled up in the city’s morgues. By the end of the season, 12,000 residents had died.  
&gt;  
&gt;In St. Louis, a public health commissioner named Max Starkloff decided to shut the city down. Ignoring the objections of influential businessmen, he closed the city’s schools, bars, cinemas, and sporting events. Thanks to his bold and unpopular actions, the per capita fatality rate in St. Louis was half that of Philadelphia. (In total roughly 1,700 people died from influenza in St Louis.)

Take water for example. The first gallon you might drink, the second you might give to your pets, the third you might wash your hands with, etc. When goods are price-controlled, people will buy a lot, because even the fifth, six, seventh unit is worth the price. This leads to shortages, causing other people to have to go without the good even for their higher-valued ends. 

If prices are allowed to adjust, then people will be more hesitant to buy too much of a good, because satisfying their lower-value ends is not worth the higher price. They will only buy enough to satisfy their highest-valued ends, thereby reserving other units of the good for other people’s highest-valued ends.",1584113351,fkehlrp

## Rapid Response:

### Coronavirus may be killed by a higher body temperature

May I postulate this deadly virus has the following characteristics :

1. It is highly infectious because it infects by air-borne.  


2. If the body temperature is below 36C, it grows very fast.  


3. The destructive immune reaction will take some time (? 7-10 days) to  
develop. Patients then start to have high fever.  


4. During this period, if the body temperature is above 36.5C, and better  
still, above 37C, the virus is attenuated or killed. Body will develop a  
milder immune response and recover.  


5. Patients with high fever can kill the virus. That is why CDC advocates  
some patients recovered without anti-viral therapy.

Supports of this hypothesis are :  


1. The victims usually stay in a cold environment for a reasonable time  
after being infected, eg. in ward, hotel, aeroplane cabins, air-  
conditioned offices.  


2. This year, the climate in HK and Canton is extraordinarily cold and  
persistent.  


3. The weather in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia is hot, so their  
outbreaks are easily controlled. The air-conditioning in HK and Singapore  
are too cool, so control is difficult. Canada ia again too cold, so the  
outbreak is serious.  


4. Children (especially under age of 8 years) in China are much less  
affected because they have higher metabolic rate and they are more active  
(eg. travel a long distance to school and many other physical activities).  
Children in HK are very sedentary, their homes and schools are air-  
conditioned. Therefore the infection incidence of children are same as  
adults in HK.  


5. Elderly and people with chronic illness have lower BMR. They have  
higher incidence rate and mortality.  


6. Coronavirus can be found in cats, dogs, pigeons, ducks and geese. They  
are not infected because all of them have very high BMR.  


7. It is well known that herbal medicine can increase the metabolic rate  
and kill the virus. The herbs prescribed in Canton are commented by WHO to  
be effective.  


8. Passengers from an infected aeroplane cabin have a greater chance to  
cause an outbreak in a cold place,  


9. Pregnant women are much less infected. They have high BMR. Are those  
500 contact pregnant women free from infection?  


10. More data are required to analyse if active people (eg. outdoor  
workers, labourers) are less prone to be infected.

Therefore, I would like to suggest a simple test to confirm this  
hypothesis :  
Incubate the virus at different temperature in human tissue media, say  
below 36C, 36.5C, 37C, and above 37C.

If the hypothesis is correct, then control is straight forward :  


1. Put on more clothes to make body really warm,  


2. maintain room temperature at least above 23C,  


3. do exercise for 30 minutes daily, make sure you really sweat.

Let me tell you a legend happened in HK over a hundred years ago.  
HK was infected by an unknown epidemic. In frustration, people (including  
the sick) came to the street and watched the ""Fire Dragon"" dance. As a  
miracle or due to the intense heat, many sick recovered and the epidemic  
disappeared.

This perpetuates misconceptions of what socialism is.  

For the bill,

&gt;The House bill, which Democrats had passed earlier on Thursday, would require employers to provide paid sick leave and health insurance companies to provide free testing for the coronavirus.

These things should be done because people need them.  Calling it ""socialism"" because, presumably, tax dollars are being directed to provide something which tax payers need both sets the very role of government to be 'socialism', and it encourages the belief that *because it's 'socialist'* providing what people need is something radical.

If you had meant to imply something like *Republicans would call it socialism when taxes help the poor but not when it helps the rich*, I understood the meaning, but I was saying it neither of them are socialism, so it's misleading. Socialism is supposed to be when workers own the means of production (either through the state, self-management, or some other form of ""social ownership"").  So, it's not socialism when the Fed prints $1,500,000,000,000 and gives it to banks, nor would it be socialism if they paid off student loans with that money rather than loaning it to banks, nor would it be socialism if Bernie Sanders was elected and managed to implement his $1.5 trillion plan for universal child-care.",1584178483,fkgx05q

9286,M_P_Skywalker91,Not at all. I live in Bardstown.,1584234144,fkj1z04
9287,profstenny,"I would argue that this guys rights are not being removed or impeded.

He is not a murderer, and isn’t being out in prison...but by leaving his home and potentially infecting his neighbors, someone could absolutely end up dead.  

Even as a libertarian I think you accept the proposition that one’s individual rights end where they start to impede others’ rights.  And he most certainly would be impeding the rights of others.",1584234182,fkj20uf
9288,profstenny,"Breaks Interstate Park.  Most of the hiking trails are technically in Virginia, but there are some great trails.",1584234288,fkj2618

9291,M_P_Skywalker91,People are very friendly here. Shame that this had to happen.,1584234571,fkj2jx2
9292,hdmibunny,"I think that's where I stand on it perfectly. 

If this guy had a gun and tried to shoot me I would do what was necessary to stop him. It's no different than him being negligent and not quartining himself. 

As long as we are talking self quaratine.",1584234597,fkj2l8h
9293,WingsTurnedToDust,Or at least the PHSCC. Like their job entails.,1584234699,fkj2q8w

His idiocy is taking much needed taxpayer dollars during a crisis.",1584234811,fkj2vpz
9296,M_P_Skywalker91,My biggest issue with people like him is that they are risking transmission of the virus to others for their own selfish reasons. People need to understand that there’s not enough room in hospitals for everyone and that medical resources are already severely limited. This individual was incredibly reckless and I hope he faces judicial punishment after this crisis in over.,1584235373,fkj3nds
9297,fumblefinger,"I don’t think it’s “probably lower.” You’re discounting the cases where people were just dying and they chocked it up to the common cold or the flu. You can’t be like “well there are unreported cases where people are surviving” without also bringing up “well there are also people dying of COVID-19 after it’s been misdiagnosed or when it was never diagnosed in the first place.” Otherwise your argument is in bad faith. 

And I’m tired of hearing numbers. The only metric that’s accurate is percentages. IE; .1% (influenzas) vs 3.4% (what the WHO says the death toll was at on the 4th).",1584235752,fkj464b

9300,IndecisiveAxiom,No one has immunity to the flu either.  Can you make this exchange more interesting please?,1584235992,fkj4hwi
9301,IndecisiveAxiom,"That mortality rate is based on known cases.  We don’t know all cases.  So the exact death rate is unknown, but we can be sure it’s &lt;3-3.4%.

I’m fine with flattening the curve, but this acting like it’s the bubonic plague is significantly out of proportion.",1584236187,fkj4ret
9302,IndecisiveAxiom,"*probably*

Let’s reserve the overreacting until he says *is*.",1584236293,fkj4wn8

9304,nikunikuniku,"to your face, behind your back bardstown is a bunch of cliquey good old boys.  I'm glad I don't live there anymore.",1584236484,fkj55yk
9305,CrotalusHorridus,The thought of the current federal government having such powers scares the shit out of me,1584236594,fkj5bda

9314,Laser_Dogg,We don’t know all the cases of flu either so we can only use data collected by professionals to compare.,1584238333,fkj7nkg
9315,tubcat,"Good luck. This angers me incredibly seeing as how one of the old codgers most knowledgeable about my family history is there. And I don't think his last surviving sibling could take the loss of another sibling this soon after their sister passed.

And unselfishly, this is terrible for the community and a stain on the reputation of the state as a bunch of hardheaded dunces.",1584238621,fkj815o
9316,IndecisiveAxiom,"We’ve had years to extrapolate the data, and this isn’t something that would help make your case if it were true...",1584238859,fkj8chz
9317,bluecor,"Coronavirus is a family of viruses, of which COVID-19 is one strain of virus, closely related to SARS. 

Political pandering is totally counterproductive. This shouldn't be about party affiliation. Our response (and the response of our government) should be based on the most effective methods for protecting our communities.",1584239185,fkj8s64
9318,redditor_aborigine,"As well as making up an asshole, it makes you an authoritarian who is willing to tear up the Constitution.",1584240061,fkj9xqn
9319,Dchrist30,Went to sams in lex on a reg scheduled trip yesterday and WKYT news were in the parking lot. My wife was embarrased and everyone was buying tp. I still dont understand why tp is so important right now.,1584240805,fkjawil
9320,DeleteBowserHistory,"At first I thought you wrote, “Your community should kill this idiot,” and I honestly didn’t think that was too extreme.",1584240807,fkjawkn
9321,DeleteBowserHistory,"Well shit, I didn’t even know there was a Nelson County patient. The most recent one I heard about was in Bourbon County.",1584241092,fkjb9yp
9322,heyjunior,Well I have a vertical split fridge and freezer. This is the one time I wouldn't mind having a deep freezer though.,1584241120,fkjbbb3
9323,casul,"I'm super leftist (basically libertarian, but, like, the leftist version of that).

If you want to own guns, then by all means own some guns.  That's fine.  If you're going to go buy guns and are like ""I'm buying these guns, and while I don't intend to kill anyone with them -- I may kill or at least injure some folks through some intentional gross negligence."" -- then yeah, you shouldn't own some guns you fucking idiot.

Your rights end (or should) the moment they impede on someone else's.  Full-stop.",1584241438,fkjbq4x
9324,Fozziebear71,Agreed.,1584241603,fkjbxwz
9325,hdmibunny,"See it's not even that situation. It's simplier. 

In your scenario you have to prove the dude in question is serious about using said firearms to kill someone and then we get into the discussion of being thought police. 

In this situation this dude had covid 19. There was no need to prove he was a threat to people. He is. Full stop. 

That's the issue. If you get a life threatening disease you owe it to other people to quaratine yourself. If not then you're an asshole and I have very little sympathy for you. 

I'm still not ok with the moral implications of putting someone on house arrest bit if there was ever an exception got that rule... this would be it. This dude could get others killed.",1584241628,fkjbz2g
9326,Drummer2427,"You're the guy in the article aren't you? 

Seriously, I don't see this any better than sleeping with someone and not being upfront about having HIV or any other STI. 

It's malicious to knowingly place someone in a health hazard.",1584241708,fkjc2vi

9340,Gray_Upsilon,"I do have someone at risk, so don't act like I don't. Regardless, it's fucking stupid that people are stripping the shelves clean over this fucking virus and depriving other people of resources they might actually need. This virus is not fucking worse than any other virus that's existed that has killed people. ""Arrogant"" Okay.",1584251259,fkjn01t
9341,MountainManStan, Agreed. Be sure and let the President know,1584251450,fkjn6hq
9342,theuserie,"If you work in Jefferson County (Louisville) you will pay Jefferson County employee income tax. There is no local or county income tax in Oldham County but you will pay property tax on your home. There are also local taxes paid with your water bill every month. Personal property tax on the value of your vehicle is charged by the state of Kentucky so there is no getting out of that. You pay every year when you renew your registration and it is not cheap if you have a newer car. State income tax is high IMO as well. We moved here from Ohio and while that state has a crazy structure of city, county, state, and school district income and sales taxes, we still paid a lot less overall up there. I suggest moving elsewhere.",1584252783,fkjoel0
9343,rvf,Are you acquainted with them at all?  Really curious what type of person would behave this way.,1584257238,fkjs6kv
9344,rvf,"How about we reserve the cavalier fuckwit attitudes as well.  You seem to be somehow relying on a lack of data to downplay anything against your opinion while also using it to reinforce your own, which makes you full of shit either way.

Fact of the matter is that we’ve had four months of data to go by, and no flu (“also known as influenza copypasta”) has shut down all of Italy in a long fucking time.  There is far less harm in an abundance of caution than there is in obstinate denial because you can’t handle something that is ultimately out of your control.  Go shoot a video in your truck or something if you need to feel in control that bad.",1584257916,fkjsp5u

9391,mr_tyler_durden,"That was the republicans that tried to ADD a bit in to make abortions harder. They made bad faith arguments that by not specifically adding Anti-Abortion language that the bill would revoke the Hyde Amendment which is simply not true.

&gt;	Conservative lawmakers have argued that by not including the Hyde amendment in the coronavirus spending package Democrats are trying to invalidate current federal spending bans on abortion, and allow this new funding to pay for abortion services. However, Kelsey Ryland, Director of Federal strategies for All above All, an organization focused on dismantling Hyde and expanding access to abortion, explains that simply isn’t how getting rid of Hyde would work. “I wish it was that easy. it’s a little mind-boggling to me,” Ryland says adding,”I have a hard time seeing how this bill would undue FY2020 appropriations bills that already passed.”

I am an owner of big pharma stock... have most of my vaccines. ( the last round of  mumps made me as a baby sleep for 4 days, I'm told and the doctor recommended against the second MMR \[this was in the 1990.\] unless an outbreak occurred.) 

To be clear I am not an anti vaxxer but do think they should not be mandatory... As far as I am concerned as rare as it is there are issues with injectables and pharmacological substances; some contain side effects while others have unknown long term side effects. This is not to say in the least the people are ill-served being inoculated or vaccinated but making a thing compulsory while weighing a person's self-determination against their **potential** risk is a slippery slope... It could well be that the benefits outweigh the cost but I am circumspect about the issue.  

Ultimately I think what makes this nation great is the autonomy and freedom we have to make our own choices. I don't know what the right choice is but encourage all reading this to get their shots. 

My personal opinion is instead of mandating action we need to return to the beginning and examine our educational systems. Not to indoctrinate but to educate and raise people up instead of using the force of the state to assure compliance.

It's critical to look at, and analyze, politics from perspective that's based in reality. Bernie's done some good in bringing awareness to income inequality and climate change. However he's been wildly disingenuous with respect to M4A and has done his supporters a huge disservice. Electing one individual to the Presidency will not fundamentally alter the political landscape of America. Congress is where this happens.

And if you're that upset about McGrath not being for M4A, please ask yourself whether you'd prefer a Democratic majority in the Senate or a Republican one. Personally I'll gladly take a Senate majority even if it takes a few Amy McGrath's or Joe Manchin's to get there.

2.  understand that if service is slower that staffs have been reduced to kitchen only and are now having to make food for delivery and drive thru. and since almost everywhere will be closed volumes are going to be up and there is only one point where orders will be able to get handed out. if your favorite restaurant has the ability to order through an app or web portal, use it. it speeds up the process considerably meaning less time you are sitting in the drive thru line.  the worst thing you can do is give the people who are making your food a hard time.

3.  after this is over, get behind proposals that raise the minimum wage and provide for more affordable health care plus paid sick leave. I've been in management for 14 years and I'm not making $15.  a lot of my workers are barely making $10.  minimum wage doesn't need to hit $15 but it needs to be more than the $7.25 it is now. your food prices won't go up that much and the difference in pay can be made up for with volume.  I know for a fact that we have raised our prices by dimes through the years but I have been griped at about them once or twice and it's more of passing comments than gripes.  for affordable health care, it is not an endorsement for either presidential candidate and it doesn't stop our members of congress from proposing and developing something better than what both candidates want.  and as for paid sick leave it simply does not exist for food workers. I don't even have any paid sick leave. you do not want people who are forced to work sick because they can't miss a paycheck handling your food or around a lot of the public.

You'd assume most of these closures are local establishments. People that have dumped their time, sweat, and personal resources to ensure the viability of the endeavor. What is the incentive to throw that all away when this blows over?

I guess I'm struggling to grasp the economic scale of this. Buildings have mortgages, and utilities aren't being stopped even though the doors are closed. But if all these shops close and don't reopen there's a market that's not being addressed. Those mortgages still aren't being paid, those utilities are still turned on, and we're missing a vital part of our community.

Why would it not be in the best interest to help out those businesses with things like state-sponsored debt forgiveness/repayment plans as part of the emergency spending? If we're dumping money and resources to allow people on unemployment immediately, then you'd think the same would be applied to get those off unemployment.

“Here is how the math works: Say you have a 10-employee business in Illinois. If you had not had any unemployment charges during the previous three years, the state unemployment insurance rate would be 0.7 percent — the Illinois minimum — of the first $12,740 of each employee’s wages, costing your business about $900 per year. If a laid-off employee then collected $10,000 against your account, your rate would go up to almost 5 percent, increasing what you pay to more than $6,000 a year for three years and costing your business more than $16,000 in increased unemployment insurance payments over that period — more than the employee would collect.”

9639,seacard,"Not just restaurants. I own a tutoring center (local, not a national chain), and we are no more than 2 months from closing for good. Last week, our business was down 50%, and this week looks to be worse. We've been open three years, have experienced steady growth, and had just hit a level where I was turning a decent enough profit to make a living. The first two years I stayed afloat with personal savings and small loans. There isn't a lot left in the tank, and I was planning on building that nest egg back up with our current and future profits now that we had turned the corner into profitiability. Now that this happened just as I was turning that corner, I'm worried these restrictions will go on so long that I won't be able to recover. 

Many in this thread don't really understand business. That's obvious from the comments. No small to medium sized business can withstand months and months of shutdown. It's not as simple as turning off the lights, going home and letting the government pay your employees via unemployment benefits. Cash flow is king. If money isn't coming in the door, you don't last long, period. If this goes on 2-3 months or longer, the economic impact is going to be much worse than most people realize. 

Here are the potential ramifications of a long shutdown: Thousands of small-to-mid-sized businesses in KY will disappear, unemployment will skyrocket, tax revenue will dry up because payroll taxes (paid by employees AND employers) will plummet. If you live in an area with a hot housing market, that's going to cool way down and home values will drop, reducing the amount of property taxes collected. Without a job and trying to live on low pay from unemployment, people will begin defaulting on their obligations again, like the housing market collapse of a few years ago. The government will do what it can, but how much can they do with severely impacted tax revenues?

When these things start to happen, it's not only business owners that will suffer. Local and state government workers will be impacted. Reduced tax revenue will mean school districts will have to deal with less funding. Expect 'furloughs' if you are a government worker. Most school funding comes from local sources too, not the federal or state governments. Many people are unaware of that. I have been writing checks for $3-6k every three months to local (city and county), state and federal agencies... even when I wasn't making a profit! That all disappears once the businesses close. 

How bad will it get, I have no idea, but I see a lot of people here and on other subreddits who have zero idea of the economic impact this is going to have. Buckle up folks. If we have to continue living under these restrictions for months and months, it's going to take this state and country years (or decades) to recover. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns into another great depression. You just can't close businesses and tell everyone to stay home for months and months without a serious economic impact on EVERYONE! 

Maybe it's necessary, I'll leave that up to the medical experts, but everyone should be well aware of the economic impact this is going to have if it goes on for more than a few weeks. When we hit 2-3 months, we're in serious trouble as a nation.",1584380449,fko5ep4

Starting to close bars and restaurants now, when there are still some months left of this virus, will not have made a drop in difference of business closures but will have significantly decreased the number of infected people and fatalities.

Unemployment is at least something, but assuming it’s just going to keep everyone fine and dandy with no financial strain is foolish. That’s assuming that, as others have already pointed out, the businesses are able to reopen at the end of this.",1584398057,fkoywhn

9704,McClouds,"All I'm getting at is that the shutting down of the food industry, and the countless other industries that are impacted by this and may not fully recover, is required to curtail the spread of this pandemic. I'm trying to point out that there's social programs available for those in need.

We can discuss redoing unemployment to better support folks in the future. We *should* do this, for all social programs and hold our elected representatives accountable to have said conversations. But I'm not going to let people have fear and stress today about losing their jobs when there's options available right now, and they should be taking advantage of it.

Think of it another way: this whole thread was about shutting down the food industry. If we leave it open, the infection will spread. Luckily, coronavirus isn't spread in the air like measles, but through touching contaminated surfaces and putting it in your mouth, eyes, nose, etc. So these spots are open, and the virus is spreading: people coughing and leaving droplets on the table, a server holding open a door for someone who hasn't washed their hands... So we now have a bunch of sick people, all at the same time. We've now shutdown the healthcare industry.

It fucking sucks for everyone, and my heart breaks for those affected. What about the workers that aren't laid off, but have no PTO or sick time banked? What about the kids that relied on school lunch, but it wasn't free for them, and now the schools are closed the shelves are bare? We all have to do our parts, and the government is stepping up to help where they can. This sucks for a lot of people, but the question I've asked all day remains the same: What more could they possibly do TODAY to make this better? Any suggestions should be sent to your state representative, because in a crisis like this there are no stupid ideas.",1584399918,fkp1v9g

And btw, there is a large portion of our population currently living paycheck to paycheck (or day to day within the service industry) so there was financial crisis for a lot of people before this pandemic.

I have a better understanding of infectious disease than most.  

From your post it seems you’re living in Northern Italy?  Seems sketchy since you’re posting a Kentucky subreddit.  Also, a quick look at your profile says you follow a Louisville subreddit?   Either you actually live in Louisville KY where there are less than 5 cases of COVID-19 as of this morning or you’re the only person in Northern Italy that is following what’s going on in Kentucky.  

What’s going on in Northern Italy is horrendous and I’ll even acknowledge that it’s possible that is the state of affairs in parts of the US.  Pandemics are scary as fuck!  People will without a doubt die!  This happens world wide every 50-100 years.  I’ll even admit, if I’m diagnosed with COVID-19 I will willingly self quarantine myself because it’s the right thing to do.  However, in the US we have this pesky thing called the constitution and bill of rights.   There is no amount of fear or death that would make me violate another American’s rights.

I wrote these books for my niece but they’re for everyone who wants a grand adventure. She’s 16 now and loves them. So if you’re black, white, short, tall, a brainiac or a brat, a loner or a day dreamer (like me)there’s something for you. 
Have you got a sci-fantasy wishlist? Well get it out because it checks a lot of boxes. Space ships, robots, aliens familiar and weird, vocaloids, space pirates, Magic, time travel, an evil alien queen, cyberspace, airships, interplanetary warfare, Catgirls, high speed chases, mecha, futuristic racing, and stories of love and revenge. Oh, and you’re going to laugh and cry a bit, like a sucker punch to the feels so I hope that’s ok. 
Follow 15 year old Fennius Taylor, Sereth Prime (picture above), ScareCrow the robot, and a huge cast of colorful characters as they set off on an adventure across the stars as they uncover a horrifying truth that may bring about the end of all life in the universe.

My peers then weigh the argument of the government vs my defense on if I should have my liberties restricted (Hey fam there is [evidence out there that some of the tests provided are giving false positives](https://www.fda.gov/media/135662/download) I am showing no symptoms at this time, I need to continue work so I can pay rent/bills/etc).

Over the course of my life, I've honed my gross motor skills to the extent that I could move my entire body from one physical location to another. I was born in Kentucky and lived there for twenty years before going to Europe for work. This is a phenomenon called ""moving"" which has been all the rage until lately. I've been going on my hometown communities because its amazing to see how some people/governments are treating this. These communities are echoing the behavior of Italy from three weeks ago which seems like tragic irony.

Currently, Americans are referencing Italy as the nightmare scenario, but the reality is that the country took measures most Americans may think is inconceivable. The US Constitution does allow for statewide curfews as seen in Baltimore in 2015 but until states reach that level of security (which actually should have been two weeks ago) it's going to be bad bad news for the weeks to come. Enforced curfews are ultimately the real solution but that's not where Kentucky is at right now. That also brings me back to wonton endangerment. Enforcing this for a disease hasn't been done before but I have yet to hear a legal reason as to why it can't be done. Do you think any government is going to allow people who know they have the virus to go around and shake people's hands? You've said that if you tested positive, you'd self-quarantine because it is the right thing to do. But why is it the right thing to do? Because you don't want to endanger the public. So, if you ignored the quarantine you are knowingly endangering the public. That's wonton.


*Wonton: A person acts wantonly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.*",1584604238,fkwsrze

When people commit those crimes that are serious enough to merit restricting their freedoms, is there something that happens to them *before* their trial? Maybe some special place we hold these dangerous individuals to ensure that they do not cause more harm while awaiting their due process? I think we call it jail.

However, since I already wrote it, I'm going to paste it here in case anyone else needs to read it:

I read it. I disagree with your use of the word ""facts"". Can you provide me with a single quoted ""fact"" in the petition which would validate this lawsuit? Keep in mind that your relative experience does not qualify as a fact nor does the idea that exit polls don't mesh with your personal preference.

This is not a legitimate complaint. This is a conspiracy theory which benefits no one except Donald Trump. If you support Sanders, who is still in the race at the time of this being written and who has explicitly stated he would accept the results of the primary and who has not supported the idea of suing the DNC for election fraud then you would vote for him in your primary. Then you would vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is in November like Bernie has explicitly stated his supporters and the people who believe in his movement should.

https://cbs12.com/news/local/lawsuit-rejected-over-dnc-tilt-toward-clinton

A similar lawsuit was filed in 2016 by Sanders supporters  and was dismissed by a three judge panel:

&gt; “We are mindful that there are deep disagreements within (and outside) the Democratic Party about the DNC’s alleged conduct during the 2016 primaries,” said the 29-page ruling, written by Judge Adalberto Jordan and joined by Judge Britt Grant and Senior Judge Frank Hull. “But federal courts can only adjudicate cognizable claims, and the complaint here fails on a number of jurisdictional and substantive grounds.”

This is a petition to essentially refiling of the same lawsuit but in a different year. It is particularly unnecessary because the DNC adopted several reforms to the process as Sanders requested including limiting the power of superdelegates:

https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/democrats-superdelegates-voting-changes/index.html

&gt; In a surprisingly united vote, almost all members of the Democratic National Convention curtailed the ability of the superdelegates to vote on the first ballot for the party's presidential nominee beginning with the next election.

&gt; This makes it impossible for superdelegates to change the outcome of the pledged delegates' will, which has never occurred since superdelegates were created ahead of the 1984 campaign.

If you support Sanders, you would not sign petitions which promote conspiracies that only aim to assist President Trump's reelection and instead you would do as Bernie asks and help ""Shut this president up"":

I guess I’d look at this kinda like chicken pox.  You don’t want to get it, but you’re gonna eventually get it.  If you’re healthy, you should be able to get through it.

I am a huge fan of Beshear and think he is handling this crisis pretty flawlessly (besides his refusal to release the number of tests ordered by doctors but denied by KY DoH). I have been tracking covid19 for a few weeks and built a site at [covidcompare.com](https://covidcompare.com) for assessing relative risk. 

According to my numbers which come from the [Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/), there have been more like 3500 tests in Tennessee, and the disparity with OP is that only state labs report negative results. This puts *per capita* testing at TN at 3x the level of KY and they also have 3x the level of *per capita* infections. Thus it looks like the results are more likely due to greater testing, and not a substantial difference in transmission rates.",1584825653,fl50e7i

So this is really hard to know due to the nature of how the states release data. The total test data for Tennessee is just a lower bound that they took from [this news article](https://dailymemphian.com/article/11998/covid-19-testing-memphis-strickland) which states ""at least 3500 tests conducted"". On the [TN Dept. of Health site](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov.html) they only show the total/negative number from public labs. We don't know the true denominator and can only say 10% is the maximum positive test rate. 

That being said the rate is almost definitely higher than KY's 7% because Tennessee would have to have an actual total of 5276 tests conducted to reduce their positive rate to 7%.",1584829799,fl56t1k

I'm sure Lochlainn Seabrook is a pen name, but for what I'm not sure.  Given the volume of writing (62 books in 10 years' time) and the fact that all his works seem to be from Sea Raven Press, I suspect that this is simply a name that the publisher attributes a variety of ghostwritten and anonymous works to.  Otherwise, I have a hard time believing that someone writing books in praise of Nathan Bedford Forrest is also writing things like Britannia Rules, which is about goddess-centered matriarchal pagan religion, and apparently pretty positive about it.

If there is indeed a single author behind the mask, I'd bet (based on writing entire books about these surnames) that they're probably a Blakeney or Caudill, and related to whichever of those isn't their last name.

Right outside of Clearfield, there's a place called Lockegee Rock on Clack Mountain. It's a hike to get up to the top of the overlook, but the view is beautiful! Last time I was there (early 2000s), it was an unofficial place -- no markings, no signs -- so it might be hard to find. Not sure how much things have changed since I was last there.

Also, Carter Caves right outside of Olive Hill is beautiful. Again, great camping and hiking. If you go further into southeastern KY, Jenny Wiley State Park is great. I lived in the park for a year and it was an incredible place.

I DID point to the specific bias of the source itself: it’s ownership and political leanings. But here’s some additional info on Alter Net:
-it’s website lists[one staff member](https://www.alternet.org/staff-bio-alex-henderson/) whose lists of publications are minor publications and publications owned by the same company.
-here’s a [study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01546.pdf) of bias in news reporting. Alter Net is not the worst offender, but there are much more reliable sources explaining the good work Beshear is doing.

But if you’d like to throw around logical fallacies, here’s a few happening in this article:
-“false equivalency.” The article compares the number of cases between the two states, omitting that TN has a population of 6.77 million agains KY population of 4.468 million
-“appeal to improper authority” yes Beshear’s actions COULD (and hopefully WILL) lead to lower cases, but with a how short a time his policies have been in place versus the incubation period and spread of the disease they haven’t yet has a discernible impact. I support the social distancing and positive encouragement Beshear is using, but 1-2 weeks of policy isn’t enough yet.
-“red herring.” The article is full of mentions of things that have nothing to do with its topic that are designed to inflame readers: mentioning of limiting the Democratic governor powers, Lee’s lack of support for women’s right to choose an abortion, LGBT discrimination in adoption. NONE of this relates to the article’s topic.
-“appeal to pity.” Yes, black lung is terrible. But this mention of the uncle was designed to get readers angry, like the red herrings. It’s not related to Beshear’s work versus Lee’s.",1584886384,fl6x466

It's kind of like a few years ago when the FBI wanted Apple to help them break into a terrorist's iPhone.  In that one specific instance, sure, it would've been alright, but then the FBI has the ability to keep on doing it.  Maybe next time they use it to get into a bank robber's phone.  Then a weed dealer.  Then someone doing 60 mph in a 55.  Then someone who just looks the way a cop doesn't like.

&gt;In 1995, Dr. Paul founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic, an organization that provides eye exams and surgery to needy families and individuals. He is a former president and 17-year member of Lions Clubs International, which is dedicated to preserving sight by providing eyeglasses and surgery to the less fortunate around the world. In recognition of his outstanding and sustained efforts to provide vision care to Kentuckians in need, Lions Clubs International has awarded Dr. Paul many of its highest commendations.

&gt;A large part of Dr. Paul's daily work as an ophthalmologist was dedicated to preserving the vision of our seniors. In 2002, The Twilight Wish Foundation recognized Dr. Paul for Outstanding Service and Commitment to Seniors. 

&gt;During his free time, Dr. Paul currently performs pro-bono eye surgeries for patients across Kentucky. Additionally, he provides free eye surgery to children from around the world through his participation in the Children of the Americas Program. Most recently, he traveled to Guatemala and Haiti on a medical mission trip with the University of Utah's Moran Eye Center. During his time in Guatemala and Haiti, over 200 patients, many of them blind with cataracts, had their vision restored.

How about his record on criminal justice reform?

&gt;Paul has focused on criminal justice reform as a legislative priority.[227][228] He introduced the Justice Safety Valve Act in 2013 to provide judges with greater sentencing flexibility,[229] the Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act in 2014 to restore voting rights for non-violent felons,[230] the REDEEM Act in 2014 to allow sealing and expungement for non-violent crimes,[231] the FAIR Act in 2014 to rein in police use of civil asset forfeiture,[232] the RESET Act in 2014 to address the crack sentencing disparity and how drugs are weighed,[233] the Police CAMERA Act in 2015 to increase the use of body cameras by police,[234] the Stop Militarizing Our Law Enforcement Act in 2015 to reduce the use of military equipment by police,[235] the Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act in 2017 to encourage states to reform bail policies,[236] and the Pregnant Women in Custody Act in 2018 to protect the health and safety of pregnant women in prison.[237] Paul says policies such as the war on drugs and mandatory minimum sentencing have particularly harmed minorities.[238][239]

&gt;Regarding the recreational legalization of cannabis, Paul says the issue should be left up to the states and that ""you ought to be able to pretty much do what you want to do as long as you don't hurt somebody else"".[240][241] Regarding medical use, Paul has endorsed efforts to legalize in Kentucky[242] and introduced the CARERS Act in 2015 to legalize medical cannabis at the federal level.[243] Paul has also supported states' rights-focused cannabis legislation, introducing the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment in 2014,[244] cosponsoring the STATES Act in 2018,[245] and introducing other amendments.[246][247] Paul introduced the Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act in 2015 to allow cannabis businesses increased access to banks.[248] Regarding industrial hemp cultivation, Paul has supported efforts to legalize in Kentucky[249][250] and at the federal level as well, introducing the Industrial Hemp Farming Act in 2013.[251]",1584940934,fl94pf9

Businesses are staying open if they can, or changing models and it's quite literally a public health concern first and foremost before. Maybe we should have been voting representatives with heavy leanings to social safety nets in the event something like this happened.

Don't out that on them. 

When being briefed on the consequences of our current state of readiness to address COVID, multiple senators used that information to cash out millions in stocks before the crash, and urged the public that there would be no health crisis and not to change anything about their lives.

All you have to do is look at Italy to see why, they did not lock down when they had ample warning, and were overwhelmed, with thousands of critical cases. one of the hallmarks of this disease is to save your life, you have to be put on a vent when it is a severe case. 
 I work in a medium size hospital, by using every single ventilator we have, under emergency conditions, we can at maximum have around 50 people on vents on one time. This is for a hospital that services probably 6 Kentucky counties. We. Are. It. that's all the peoples lives we can save at one time. if we have 100 people sick enough to need a vent 50 of them are going to fucking die.

11640,festizian,"I wasn't denied a test, I was just told that my primary care provider (PCP) associated with Baptist Health wasn't testing. I am a paramedic with a contact last week with a patient displaying the right symptoms, and whose test hadn't come back yet. I spiked a fever of 100.8 with no other symptoms Thursday night, called in sick for the next day. Next day I began the process.

1. I called my PCP. PCP gave me the COVID hotline number. 
2. Person I talked to at the COVID hotline, after sitting through like 10 minutes of information before the ""press 3 to be connected with a person"" told me to call my PCP. 
3. So I called PCP back, told them the COVID hotline told me to talk to them, and they put me through to a nurse triage line. 
4. Told the nurse I was febrile and a paramedic and treatd a suspected patient, am worried about transmitting to other patients, and they of course said ""Yeah, you should probably be tested."" But then they said they weren't testing, and I was just to self isolate. 
5. Told my chief that, he called the COVID hotline, and was told if I went 24 hrs without a fever, I was good to come back to work. 
6. I wasn't satisfied with that, so I took matters into my own hands and went to the drive through testing clinic in Lexington. The MD was very excited to see me, and told me that people like me are exactly why he opened his clinic for this. 

Got my result back today, and I am negative. Whole process was a gigantic pain in the ass, and including trying to get a hold of the clinic (which had a busy tone all day) probably took 10 hours of my time.

11860,dojo-dingo,"This is absolutely 100% ***NOT true.*** The goal of social distancing and sheltering in place isn't to eliminate new infections, but to slow them down. Not only so we don't overwhelm our healthcare system, **but also so we can build up as much herd immunity as possible** until a cure comes to market.

We don't have to do this forever, but the long we do it the more lives are saved.",1585081897,flecsim
11861,dojo-dingo,"I also think a lot of people are missing the point of what an overwhelmed healthcare system looks like too. When you see those graphs showing one curve with an overwhelmed healthcare system, and another ""flattened"" curve... When our healthcare system is overwhelmed, that doesn't just mean our doctors and nurses work tirelessly to treat patients and we won't be able to supply enough protective equipment...

**It means that anyone requiring a ventilator above the ""overwhelming"" point, will simply die instead.** It means you'll have 1000 sick patients needing the 2 ventilators left. It means that for most people that could have survived if treatment was available, they'll now die because everyone needs treatment at the same time.

I don't care what the cost is. If we're the only market open on the planet, while the rest of the world is shut down... Would the thousands, tens of thousands, or millions of deaths be worth that? Because we wouldn't be going back to a ""normal"" economy anyway - **Everywhere else is also closed to fight this.**",1585082244,fledez4
11862,ChmeeWu,"You missed my point ENTIRELY.  Please re-read. My point (again) if we lock society down so tightly, that no new infections occur, we have NOT flattened the curve, just moved it to the right. 
A few tens of thousands people in a nation of 330 million will not build herd or immunity. Nor it reasonableness time lock down for the 12-18 months before a vaccine is developed and made widely available. 

Instead, what I am saying in the spectrum of Social Distancing to Complete at home Lockdown, we should favor Social Distancing, so we SLOW but not STOP the spread.",1585082335,fledkyq
11863,dojo-dingo,"Nope, I understood it perfectly. Social distancing is better than nothing, but lockdowns are required - Not optional. Kentucky is faring really, really well because Beshear acted early and aggressively. The US as a whole is already at 50k cases. Again, Kentucky has been at this for weeks now, *but other states haven't even started social distancing yet.* Of those 50k cases, more than 7k of them were from the last 24 hours. This time tomorrow, we'll be over 60k cases. By the end of the day Friday, We'll be at 100k if not over.

You're absolutely right that 50k something cases won't be enough for herd immunity. But you also have to remember this virus is spreading exponentially. If we have 100k cases by Friday, we'll have double that by the following Friday. Those are also just the ***confirmed*** cases. I've had people in my own family come down with the worse flu they've had in their life, tested negative for both Flu A AND Flu B, but were still denied a Covid-19 test. If we're at 50k confirmed cases right now, how many are unconfirmed?

Social distancing is better than nothing, but lockdowns are *required*. Give this thing a few more weeks, and we'll have a pretty substantial herd immunity if current estimates of confirmed + unconfirmed cases are correct.",1585082755,fleec3z

&gt; (1). Except as provided in Section 2 of this Act, in the event of the occurrence or threatened or impending occurrence of any of the situations or events contemplated by KRS 39A.010, 39A.020, or 39A.030, the Governor may declare, in writing, that a state of emergency exists. The Governor shall have and may exercise the following emergency powers during the period in which the state of emergency exists: (a) To enforce all laws, and administrative regulations relating to disaster and emergency response and to assume direct operational control of all disaster and emergency response forces and activities in the Commonwealth;

Etc... 

Any  person  adversely  effected  by  an  emergency  order  may  bring  an  action,  individually or  as  a  class  action,  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief,  in  the  Circuit  Court  in  the county  in  which  the  person  resides  or  in  which  the  person's  affected  business  is  located, 

Etc... 

In  any  action  brought  under  subsection  (3)  of  this  section,  the  burden  shall  be  on  the Commonwealth  to prove, by  clear and convincing evidence:   (a)    The  existence  of  a  emergency,  disease  outbreak,  public  health  threat,  or  similar occurrence;   (b)    The need for the  emergency  order;   (c)   The  narrow  tailoring of the  order;   

Etc... 

Should  the  Commonwealth  meet  its  burden  any  aggrieved  person  may  prove  by  a preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the  impacts  on  the  person  or  the  person's  business warrant  relief,  in  whole  or  part,  from  the  emergency  order  or that the  emergency  order is unreasonable as applied to that person. Such  proof may  include:   (a)    That  their  personal  or  business  activities  do  not  in  fact  present  a  substantial  risk  of furthering the  emergency;   (b)    That  the  personal  or  economic  impacts  of  the  emergency  order  to  the  aggrieved person,  or  similarly  situated  aggrieved  person  are  more  severe  than  the  impacts  of the  emergency  or possible emergency  on  the  public  as a whole warranting relief;  or   (c) That the  emergency  order is  otherwise unreasonable as applied to them. 

Etc... 

(9). Any person  who  prevails  against  the  Commonwealth  because  the  Commonwealth  fails to meet  its  burden  under  subsections  (2)  or  (5)  of  this  section  shall  be  awarded  reasonable attorney  and  expert  fees  and  costs.  Nothing  in  this  paragraph  shall  preclude  further relief from  the  Kentucky  Claims Commission.

The wording here is very ""fake news media"" / ""Corona is libcuck hysteria that was created to make Trump look bad"" This is a very real problem and the US is woefully unprepared to deal with it. Beshear is one of the few who has done better than average but it's at the cost of ""job creators"" and those ""job creators"" don't want to shoulder the burden of this, they want the poor and middle class to shoulder it, just like anything else. 

So if Beshear won't let these businesses operate, this is how they get the taxpayers to float them.

If you don’t want to pay taxes, I support that but you can’t drive on our streets. If you don’t want to follow the law you shouldn’t live among us that do. You only want to complain and not offer any solutions, run for public office instead of whining on social media. 

The only fair way to have what you want is to separate yourself from what the rest of us have done by being socially responsible. If you put 5 people together, 3-4 will disagree about what is good for all. Does that make them tyrants? Any scenario that has more than a handful of people will need to have some sort of management. Any time you have more than a handful of people they are not going to agree on everything, that’s just human nature. Since people are not perfect, you’ll never have perfect government. Since people have so many different opinions, you’ll never have 100% consent.

We saw just last year Trump invoke his power to declare a national emergency over illegal immigration order to bypass Congress in order to send money to the border. I don't think any office should have the ability to declare an emergency in order to aquire powers not usually assigned the that office. This bill gives citizens and business an avenue of legal challenge to the declaration of an emergency.

For example, let's say KY has a republican governor who is anti-abortion. It's not out of the realm of possibility that a governor could declare a state of emergency using the arguement that abortion is the act of murder. Once the declaration is made, that person could then declare whatever organizations they wish to cease operations. Health clinics, physicians, hospitals, non-profits, etc. It appears that currently there is *no* legal recourse to fight such an order. That, in my opinion, is highly un-democratic.

&gt; No, I'm read the lines. Like, the bill itself. That's what's important.

Did you? Because so far all you've said is that it's reasonable and then blamed everyone else for not ""reading"" it. I replied to your first post and cited the specific wording that was vague and you had no comment on it.

&gt;My post was literally an example. But if you'd like, you're more than welcome to point out portions of the bill you believe to be unreasonable. 

Already did and you gave out crickets.

&gt;It's 3-6 months of living expenses. And I don't k ow why you're even bringing that up.

Again, you aren't reading between the lines. The wording in the bill means that any business who feels like they were deemed non-essential and therefore not operating, can sue the government to recoup costs because they ""believe"" there was not sufficient evidence to call for a state of emergency. So why is it reasonable to believe the average Joe should save for an emergency but million/billion dollar companies can't and therefore needs to be able to recoup costs from the state for enacting measures to prevent an absolute catastrophe. 

It's unsurprising you can't connect what I am saying, because I think you skimmed over the bill, said ""eh doesn't affect me personally"" and thought you'd let everyone know it's ""reasonable"". It's not reasonable, it will bankrupt our state to support corporations who didn't plan for a scenario like this and will give the ability for the senate to impeach Andy for enacting measures to prevent the spread of this disease (which would have the largest impact in the rural areas; where there is little access to the skills and tools needed to help someone with the virus).

Lets take a look at that section together, and I'll talk you through it!

&gt;(2)Any emergency order issued under this section shall be: 
(a)Narrowly tailored towards meeting the exigencies of the emergency**;(b) No  broader  or  burdensome  than  is  necessary  to  meet  the  exigencies  of  the emergency**;

Section B is *entirely* subjective. What you may deem burdensome, I may deem perfectly reasonable. Even with the benefit of hindsight, this isn't a question with an ascertainable, fact based answer, unless you can peek into parallel dimensions to see how those ones panned out. 

&gt;(c) **Not be underinclusive**;

This section is ALSO, *entirely* subjective.  And can we point out the idiocy of ""We want this to be no broader than necessary, but it can't be underinclusive.""? She's created a Catch-22 asking governors to toe a very narrow tight rope that is also invisible because its path is based on the whims of random people, and all while there is an emergency bearing down on the Commonwealth. 


&gt;(e) **Give  due  regard  in  its  scope  and  duration  for  the  impact  of  such  order  on  the public  at  large,  public  safety,  and  the  long  term  economic  impact  upon  the Commonwealth of Kentucky and its citizens**; 

Say it with me again! ***Sub-ject-ive***. What I deem as a step with a reasonable scope and duration to save lives, some ""money over lives"" idiots like the amendment's author may deem as a failure to give due regard to the ""impact of such order on the public at large"" (in itself an abusrdly vague choice of words) or long term economic impact. Again, unless we've got [Dr. Strange at our disposal](https://media.tenor.com/images/4fdf84b74eac20554835dfe75720cde7/tenor.gif), I don't think we're going to be able to ascertain a single fact.

&gt; and (f) Be  in  effect  no  longer  than  is  necessary  to  meet  the  exigency  giving  rise  to  the emergency. 

Do I even have to say it again? 

Necessary, burdensome, and reasonable, in the context of a pandemic, are judgements based on guesses and feelings. Trump is responding differently than Beshear, who is responding differently than Merkel, who is responding differently than Xi, who is responding differently than Trudeau, etc, etc, etc ad nauseum. Who among them is walking the narrow invisible tight rope Savannah Maddox has in her mind? Whose actions are too broad? Whose actions are underinclusive? Who keeps it going just the right amount of time? There isn't a single world leader who I couldn't find in violation of this bullshit if you gave me the right idiots in the jury. 

This amendment is a blatant attack on the Governor's management of this pandemic. The representative who introduced this legislation is attempting to set the stage for a series of lawsuits, filed by financially struggling Kentuckians she can paint as victims, that she can point to at a later time and say ""See? The way the Governor handled this emergency has harmed these people and is costing us x amount of dollars that could be going to help the people of Kentucky.""

Ok, so evidently your biases prevent you from understanding mockery, which you just interpret as agitation. I'm going to try to break it down, so follow along with me here. 

1. You told another poster that the amendment we're discussing is not vague, and that there are clarifications to address his concerns in the amendment. 
2. I created a lengthy and well reasoned post refuting your assertions of specificity and clarity, pointing out that the value, or lack thereof, of many emergency actions cannot be quantified. To pad my argument, I pointed out that this amendment could be applied to hold every single world leader financially liable for the way they're responding to this pandemic.
3. The post that you're now asking me to address simply conceded that contrary to your prior assertions, the amendment lacks specificity. Additionally you attempted to discredit the position I had taken, which you have also somehow adopted and not realized it, as being obviously inferred by its nature and weak. 
4. I absolutely did address your post. I mocked the shit out of the inane thought process that had to occur between arguing against a poster who identified vagueness in the amendment, and then agreeing with me that its interpretation would be completely up to individual interpretation.

To summarize: I did respond to your post, you just didn't like the response you got because it exposed your flip flopping and/or poor reading comprehension, and made you out to be a fool. Which is my objective here. I'm here because I think your opinion is utterly shortsighted and lacks foresight, and I wanted to embarrass you.

First let me agree that adding to the debt has costs. It would be better if there were no reason to; or if the amount was smaller.

I think its worth noting that none of our choices are very good right now. You have only look as far as Italy and Spain to see that there are a lot of dead people in our future; and the opportunity to keep those numbers really low without dramatically affecting our economy are in our rearview mirror. We probably should have better prepared for this. It's not like it was impossible to see coming.

But we are where we are; and our choices seem to be: 

* Allow the economy to continue as usual, with a high death toll. Hard to say how high since no one has done this in the face of overflowing hospitals. Best approximations are Spain and Italy where the human toll is huge.
* Curtail the deaths by stopping parts of the economy without bailing anyone out; in which case I'd expect a lot of personal bankruptcy and business bankruptcy with a very slow recovery.
* Curtail the deaths by stopping parts of the economy and bail out consumers but tell the businesses to go hell; in which case rebound hiring numbers will probably be bad since the business to employ are in bankruptcy with many of them closed.
* Curtail the deaths by stopping parts of the economy and bail out businesses but tell the businesses to go to hell. In which case the economic recovery will probably be better but the lower wage people in the US will be even further behind.
* Curtail the deaths by stopping parts of the economy and bail out everyone. This has the greatest addition to the debt; the least immediate impact and the fastest recovery after the situation is passed.

Infectivity if the virus is less than 20%. So there is 80% of your workforce in place right there.  They simple won’t get infected. 

54% who are infected are asymptomatic. So there is another 11% (we’re at 91% now). 

Hospitalization rate (so clearly out of the workforce) is about 16% of working age people that’s 1.5%.  But that rate is based on people who got tested. So that is mainly symptomatic people. 

Assume that 1/2 of the other 7.5% would stay home sick for a week.  (So 3.75%). 

So we are looking at a total of 5.25% who will miss work.  But for no more than two weeks (average) when the average viral spread takes about 12 weeks to run through the population. 

It won’t be evenly distributed.  But if you assume a fairly even bell curve the worst two week period would be about 2% of that 5.25%.

Yes. The US Constitution is vague as hell. And it was designed as such so that each state could have the greatest degree of self governance. The Constitution can be found in sizes as low as 40ish pages full text, including related extras the publisher wants to throw in. Meanwhile, the Kentucky Revised Statutes constitute *hundreds* of pages. There are individual chapters of the KRS, of which there are hundreds, with more text than the entirety of the US constitution. What do you think may be in some of those statutes? Maybe...some specifics? I bet we may be able to find some! Lets dig in and see if we can't use them to answer a couple of questions you asked the /u/abbarach, shall we? 

What is a speedy trial, you ask? Well, in Kentucky, it's one that occurs within 180 days of your arraignment, excluding continuances. What would be considered excessive bail if you, a presumably otherwise upstanding citizen, were busted posing as a podiatrist to satisfy your foot fetish and got charged with practicing podiatry in violation of KRS311.380 to 311.510? Anything over $500. If I was charged for stealing mail? My bail would be excessive if it's over $5,000. How do I know what bail will be for these offenses? Because these are specifically enshrined in our legal code. 

Legislation is NOT subjective by nature, and in fact should not be when avoidable. Full. Stop. Specificity ensures the clearest ability to follow the law and dispense justice. The legislation everyone else is railing against, and that you're on your knees fellating and making baseless excuses for, is needlessly obscure for the purpose of ensnaring the Democrat Governor in a series of lawsuits where he can be framed as having harmed Kentuckians through his response to the Coronavirus.

Not trying to be argumentative/aggressive but I would just like to pick your brain a bit on the ""Small Government"" bit.

Cause from my perspective throughout the history of the government it has always done nothing but be a limiter on the will/action of the people.

For example I wouldn't say that the government gave rights to say Women or Minorities but that it lifted previously established limiters on those groups.

With only a few exceptions such as when they cracked down on corporate monopolies or defended against international entities.

We don’t have to repeat the past. We can fundamentally change a broken system together. 

It’s crazy how both sides agree that this is wrong, but we’ve allowed a wedge to be driven in between us by media conglomerates working with and for members of our governments. 

Somethings gotta give man. And for too long it’s been us, people like you and me, that have given and gotten nothing in return. I would like to change that. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe you would as well. 

I don’t have a full answer to that issue. But I think I can speak for 90% of Americans when I say something is broken and it needs to be fixed. I’m not qualified to make the decision that fixes it, but I’m confident that if we didn’t have outside influences like fear mongering media and political groups, we could figure it out together. 

I don’t want to take your guns. I don’t want to limit your free speech. I enjoy those things as much as you do. 

But I want my tax dollars to matter. I want them to go to making my state better. I want them to feed those of us who are going hungry, or wearing the same shirt every day. I want them to assist in decreasing the homelessness issues in my community. 

You just moved to Cincinnati? I live in cov. Not in the nice part. And I’m tired of seeing people on my block that have nothing but broken promises and past mistakes. 

Idk man maybe I’m being to optimistic about humanity but I believe that if we work together, not only in our communities but in our government, we can help ourselves and our neighbors. Maybe that means nothing, as I know issues are a lot more complicated than some emotional plea about the human spirit, but I believe that if you saw your neighbor in need, it would bother you. It bothers me. And I’m seeing now, in the midst of this crisis, that I haven’t done enough for my neighbors. That’s what influences my politics.

That section is broad and extremely subjective, there is no attempt by the amendment author to define parameters for burdens of proof, this is clearly an attempt to tie up emergency orders like the ones we're under now in courts instead of allowing the executive branch to act.

&gt;Probably because filing another bill takes time and gutting the original bill maintains its place in the queue.

No, its because you don't want / feel the bill to go through committee before making it to the house floor.  My father worked with state legislature for 15 years, I asked him if this was common practice, he said point blank ""you don't completely gut and rewrite a bill unless you think the contents of the rewrite couldn't make it through committee review"", which is exactly what this woman did. The bill has literally nothing to do with what the original draft was for, this woman was blatantly trying to by pass a committee review.

And it's a BILL. It can be amended, it can be voted out. It may not even make it to a vote. It can be vetoed.

I never said it was great, I never said I loved it. But there *should* be some legal recourse to challenge the declaration of a state of emergency. Maybe that already exists, and if so then apparently S. Maddox isn't aware of it. 

No president, governor, mayor, etc. should have the power to unanimously and indefinitely declare a state of emergency. And this bill appears to attempt to address that by allow citizens and businesses a day in court. The court hears the arguements, and play mediator between the legislature and the executive office. That's how our government is meant to work. 

There are no mentions of monotary gain outside of court costs, no impeachment clause, nothing to that effect and people in this subreddit are acting like if this goes through its the end of Beshear. All the companies are going to sue the state out of existence! Guess what - they can't by this bill. 

And blatantly trying to pass committee review? If it's as easy as amending an entire bill with a replacement bill then why doesn't everyone do it?

But a friend of mine and all his roommates are unemployed, and despite getting unemployment, it’s not enough money to pay rent, which is sub-$900 a month for them. 

Anecdotal, but not a far shot from what a lot of people are dealing with right now. I’m seeing a lot of similar stories all over the Internet right now. A lot of working-class people are being laid off, let go, or just having their hours cut like crazy. Think of all the cosmetologists, the aestheticians, the people who work in close proximity to people for a living who legit just aren’t allowed to do business right now.

Thanks, and I agree.

I can't tell if the original commenter was genuine in the objection but at the time I wrote this, none of the respondents had taken the time to lay out what I think is the rationale for the bailout and what the other choices are.

There's a broader trend here. Trump came from a wealthy real estate background. Here's the thing about real estate: It does not matter how many ""no's"" you get to ridiculous offers as long as you get one ""yes."" I mean you can lowball 1000 properties and if you get 999 ""no's"" and one ""yes"" then you are winning.

In the same way, when you are president of the United States you are representing the world's strongest military and the world's strongest economy. If you state a world view that does not hold up to reason, and use that world view to take some unilateral actions -- the rest of the world is going to adapt as best it can because it's in their interest to.

That style does not work for SARS-CoV-2. There's no reason in SARS-CoV-2. There's no bullying it. It's not going to behave differently because we say it's less dangerous than the flu, or we want to have churches packed on Easter (great way to test that Resurrection hypothesis, I guess). It's going to spread with contact; it's going to infect and it's going to kill. 

So this is just a tough situation where the governing style the administration uses has met a crisis [for which it is very poorly suited](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mixed-messages/like-the-flu-trumps-coronavirus-messaging-confuses-public-pandemic-researchers-say-idUSKBN2102GY).",1585319206,flnibc8

This is highly unusual to say a member doesn’t have enough for a second.

&gt; This means members had to travel back to Washington for no particular reason - just to deny Massie a sufficient second - and pass it by voice vote, which was the plan all along.

&gt; Per aide: After debate ends, the House will vote by voice. Then, Massie will ask for a recorded vote. Someone will suggest an absence of a quorum. Then all the members who came back to Washington will show up. And then Massie will again ask for a recorded vote again.

Jobs are not the important factor when considering trade policy. Eliminating unnecessary jobs is the *point*. Every country involved saw more jobs created than lost and GDP growth. We’ve been at full employment many times since NAFTA, so it obviously didn’t have any long term effects on employment. If you want to argue for better welfare and unemployment benefits or job retraining for those laid off, go for it.

&gt; Jobs are not the important factor when considering trade policy. Eliminating unnecessary jobs is the point. Every country involved saw more jobs created than lost and GDP growth. We’ve been at full employment many times since NAFTA, so it obviously didn’t have any long term effects on employment. If you want to argue for better welfare and unemployment benefits or job retraining for those laid off, go for it. Just don’t argue that trade is bad, because that is basically a law in economics that it is good for everyone.

Never once did I say trade was bad. Not once. What I said was not every trade is good. 

&gt; saw more jobs created than lost and GDP growth

Jobs with lower pay and lower quality worked by illegal immigrants or people on the border being taken advantage of. 

As to the GDP point, yeah. Because the super wealthy elite are lining their pockets. Automation could essentially cripple the human workforce, but GDP will skyrocket. Is that now a positive thing because the big number went up? You can't just say something is objectively good because it is failproof in a vacuum. That's not realistic.

""People are a bit friendlier in KY in my experience to strangers."" We've all seen what the Sandmann family and the ""team mitch"" boys are like. You are ""friendlier"" to white people, but you are HORRIBLE to anyone of color or progressives.

Your idiot senator goes to a communal gym while infected and your representatives impede progress at every turn.

You spend all your time and energy telling OTHER PEOPLE WHAT TO DO and you don't do shit to fix your own state.

"" a very conservative rural population, similar to CA."" No. Our ""conservatives"" can read and do basic math. Which is why they more often than not, vote DEMOCRAT.

Unfortunately, you have demonstrated the impotence of the KY citizen. Instead of asking what YOU could do to fix your state (teach your kids more coding; focus on building community gardens; have your Covington Catholic filth actually BUILD HOME FOR HOMELESS VETS) you focus on  defending indefensible behavior.

""I am a teacher."" You may 'teach' but you do not educate. Give your kids are REAL math lesson about red state socialism. If you dare. Ask them why people in KY should GET over $5,000 every year while people in CT are forced to GIVE over $1,000 every year. https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-taxes-federal-services-difference-by-state-2019-1

If you taught CITIZENSHIP, all Kentucky students would have been marching with signs saying ""Nick Sandmann Does Not Represent Us"" and ""We Stand Against Racism"" - but you didn't. 
If you taught WORK ETHIC, Kentucky wouldn't be the nation's fiscal toilet and blame others for your economic failures. 
If you taught DETERMINATION, Kentucky citizens would be protesting daily in Mitch McConnell's office and DEMANDING his resignation. - but they aren't.
If you taught ADAPTABLILITY, Kentucky citizens wouldn't be demanding to ""bring back coal"" b/c they wouldn't want their children going down in a coal mine. - but they aren't.
If you taught RESOURCEFULNESS, Kentucky citizens wouldn't have both the least healthy and fattest children in the nation. - but they do. 

""Having multiple jobs isn’t unique to CA or CO, that is America these days."" Because TECHERS LIKE YOU keep preaching to children that we are all baby killers and lib-tards and that voting GOP makes you closer to God instead of further from affordable housing, healthcare, and education. Maybe they wouldn't be working that many jobs if they hadn't voted to take away OBAMACARE as they had been taught to do by a Kentucky TEACHER. 

""when all the mess with COVID-19 is over"" the fiscal reckoning will begin, unfortunately. Watching Trump play fast and loose with taxpayer dollars has angered some of the nicest people I know. An older woman I bring groceries to curses your state and Mitch McConnell every time I see her. Two years ago, she felt sorry for the ""poor people that have to live there"" but that sympathy is long gone. And for every small business in this state that fails, another ""we need to keep our own tax money for ourselves"" convert is born. 

You may not like what I have to say OR my delivery style, but you have been unable to dispute my FACTS. And as a TEACHER, you should know that defending your thesis is the most important part of your writing. All the flowery sentiment doesn't mean anything without the MATH FACTS to back you up. The more people are made aware of red state socialism, the more motivated they become to end it. Hope you are able to use your math skills to justify why they shouldn't.",1585458916,flt4ere

I mean really, if the virus is getting on the mask, isn't that in turn keeping it out of your mouth? Also, masks don't just ""accumulate virus"" over time. Yes, they catch particulates as you go about your day, but a quick hand wash with soap and water on a cloth mask will reinvigorate it. Or if you're using an N95 mask you can bake it in the oven for a few minutes to renew it. 

Also, that's not what masks are for in the general population. Most masks won't even stop aerosolized particulates like those from a sneeze from getting to you.

13299,RavenHatfield,"""your hatred""
Wow. PLEASE document and prove where I stated that I hated you or your state. The fact that you cannot proves that you play the victim role b/c you are incapable of improving yourself or your state. This whiny diatribe illustrates that when provided facts and figures, you, just like Donald Trump, blame those who hold you accountable. You are quite literally calling me a ""nasty woman"" for providing facts and figures that are already WELL KNOWN to most progressives. I was trying to give you a heads-up to the justifications being used to promote the Two State Solution.

 ""I will not debated facts with you while you actively hate me personally""
First of all, its ""debate"" not ""debated"" if you want to keep your verb tense agreements. Secondly, you CANNOT debate facts because you refuse to acknowledge them. Blaming your refusal to do a job based on your perception of someone else's emotional state is pretty much the definition of ""deflection."" And the fact that you refuse to share the mathematical reality of Red State Socialism with your students only means that you are failing to prepare them for the upcoming issues. But then, you ""teachers"" don't seem to actually want to work in Kentucky. 

""What I will do is continue to show my work ethic of having a side business to my students."" Oh dear God, let's all play the violins for this poor pathetic victim with a ""side business"" as though teachers in CA aren't scrubbing floors after school to earn money. 

To be clear, I do not hate you, and you cannot prove that I ever said anything to the ilk, b/c I did not. I do not hate you, but when I release this thread to CA public school teachers, THEY WILL HATE YOU. And they should.

California teaches' taxpayer dollars are PAYING YOUR SALARY, you impotent, lazy welfare queen. The average teacher salary in KY is $64,000 while the median home price is $146,000. The average teacher salary in CA is $80,000 while the median home price is $524,000. Your ""side business"" pays for your new pool, while CA teachers scrub toilets to pay for cans of refried beans. When CA teachers see that I provided you FACTS, FIGURES, and CITATIONS and you were too lazy to follow through and attempt change, THEY WILL HATE YOU. And they should.

Our teachers work too hard and too long to have lazy-ass, white trash representatives from the nation's fiscal toilet to fuck it all up. Your state does NOTHING to help this country, and the fact that you teachers lie to your students perpetuates the problem. And when California educators see this thread, they will recognize that KY teachers are very much a part of the problem, not the solution. 

I do not hate you. You are too pathetic and impotent to hate. You have demonstrated that you have no qualms being a fiscal, intellectual, and moral drain on this nation, and I am glad that you documented that fact. 

There really is nothing more to say here. 

I will pray for your children. They will need it.

Kentucky is almost evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, but when you try to elect a national Democrat who tries to run on a Hillary/Biden type ticket, you find that our Democrats are different.

Really in Kentucky you may have 20% liberal, 40% Republican/Conservative, and 40% Democrat ashamed to admit they are Republican.

In that regard, I think its somewhat understandable that a typical kentuckian would prefer a Republican at the federal level but a Democrat in charge back home, as that combination makes a strong Kentucky that's theoretically less controlled by Washington. I think it's more about perceived power dynamics than any consistent ideology.

To be clear, I'm not arguing whether that reasoning now or has ever made sense, but I do think that's more or less why weve often been a firmly red state for national elections but are much more comfortable voting blue at the local and state level.",1585531806,flvtlh8

McConnell isn't well liked, but he can align himself with Trump, who is popular in Kentucky. McGrath is stuck being associated with a fairly progressive DNC platform despite not actually being a progressive herself.

13394,RavenHatfield,"""Your words seem to indicated that I am lazy"" Your words prove it. I have asked you MULTIPLE times to justify red state socialism and/or explain why you aren't doing more to fight fake ""history"" in your textbooks, but you only talk about how I hurt your feelings. You keep saying I ""hate"" and are using that as an attempted deflection from your lack of actions. If you were a REAL TEACHER, you would be making sure you are not teaching lies by using some of these books. 

I documented the difference between salary and housing costs for you and CA teachers. And you don't seem to care about THEM. THEY pay your bills, put food on your table, and clothes on your back and you are incredibly ungrateful. 

"" I’m still a “welfare queen”"" Everyone in your state is. And until you TEACHERS do your job and tell your students the fiscal realities in this country, they will continue to behave like Nick Sandmann. And CA taxpayers will find more justification for the Two State Solution. 

""denies my humanity"" Oh this is a classic. Your state has MULTIPLE statues honoring Confederate soldiers and MULTIPLE chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and you claim that by telling you some hard fiscal truths that I ""deny"" your HUMANITY???? Wow. The victim gene is strong in you. That is a classic. Dude, if you think my giving you websites and pointing out that you are the nation's fiscal toilet is THIS DAMAGING to your psyche, I cannot imagine you surviving an actual full blown protest --- never mind conflict. And attempting to use this pitiful analogy to lecture ME, is a pathetic joke. If this is an example of Kentucky educators, I understand why your state is an epic failure. 

""It’s not that anyone is lazy here"" Then why is McConnell still in office? Why is Paul? Why is Massie? Recall campaigns can be started online. You people don't think outside your own victim mentality to change anything. When you are too LAZY to fix what is happening in your own backyard, why should you expect others to come and help you?

""blind you to any empathy to those out of your sight"" Not only am I full of empathy, I am helping many other people ""out of"" my sight. My lack of tolerance for your bullshit and deflection do not reflect my 'empathy' as you put it. 

The fact that you have NO FACTS to back up what you say and are relying on the ""you hate me so I won't respond"" or the ""you are such a mean person that we can do anything we want"" highlight your IMPOTENCE. And this is why states like CA and WA want to cut you people off. We see NO gratitude, NO efforts towards self-improvement, and NO efforts to contribute. And this entire exchange highlights that those in charge of KY education are the FIRST to teach the victim mentality. Shame on you. No wonder your state is such a mess. 

""mistakes are part of our humanity"" Really, b/c KY history books say that they made none. That the 'war of northern aggression' had nothing to do with slavery. They don't teach about the deaths during the slave trade, or the rape-based economy where slave owners sold their own off-spring for profit. The United Daughters of the Confederacy saw to that. And 'teachers' like you are brainwashing the next generation in your ""We Are Dixie Victims"" mentality.

EXACTLY!!! You have not done ONE thing to clear your schools of textbooks promoted by the UDC. You have not done ONE thing to teach your students about the massive wealth redistribution from the hardworking progressive blue maker states to the lazy welfare red taker states. You have not done ONE thing to remove Paul, McConnell, Massie, et al from office. 

You don't do anything. That is why I'm telling you that progressives are tired of funding you. You. Don't. Do. Anything. And I appreciate that you admit you are complicit in teaching your students lies. 

""degraded and insulted me"" There are migrant children dying in cages because of policies instituted by representatives from YOUR state and a president YOU PEOPLE voted for. And you get your panties in a wad over ""insults"" and say that I ""dehumanize"" you. I think the migrant children separated from their parents know a bit more than you about what it is to be ""dehumanized."" Your self-pity party reflects the content of character of KY citizens. When presented the tiniest challenge, you blame others and cry victim.

""So I challenge you:"" So the lazy welfare queen who REFUSED to address any issue that I put forth (red state socialism; UDC influenced textbooks; lack of KY values) now demands that I do YET MORE WORK b/c you are too lazy. Let's be clear, I am now only continuing this so that the LA teacher's union can see just how badly they need to unify all blue state teachers into disbanding the Federal Department of Education. Once progressive teacher see that their tax dollars are paying the salaries of ""educators"" like you, there will be marches in the streets. (Because THAT is what people who are not LAZY AS FUCK do when they need to change the government -- they march.)

""you have a simple plan of how to solve the problem"" (Why does it have to be simple? Are you that lacking in higher order thinking skills? Is everyone in KY as limited as yourself?) Here are a few solutions already being tossed around by some UC graduate honors public policy students:
1) Salaries of congressional officials (senators and reps) will be based on the average salaries of the communities they serve. The fact that Thomas Massie gets the same salary as Katie Porter means he live in a FANTASTIC house while she lives in a hovel. 
2) States that use federal revenue for more than 25% of their budge (that would be you - called ""welfare states"") are not allowed to propose any legislation unless signed off by at least four reps from the progressive states. Why should we allow people to propose laws for the entire country when they cannot even fix their own state or district?
3) Welfare states who do not improve their economic standing will lose the right to vote in the house or senate unless they place their state into ""receivership"" so that their fiscal business can be overseen by a productive state. Why should we fund people who keep flushing our money away?
4) Congressional officials from welfare states cannot sit on any A or B level committees. Why should they be on high ranking committees when they cannot even manage their own state?
You people voted for a ""businessman"" to run your country, let's run it like a business. And no BUSINESS on the planet would select the guys from the lowest performing division to run the finances of the company. 

""I don’t think you can explain it concisely and succinctly"" Even when I do, like I did above, you would claim I didn't and was being a 'bully.'  You are quite the little trumppie - calling everyone else ""nasty"" and claiming you are the victim. That is who you are. Your content of character is a weak victim when the truth is that you are just lazy and pathetic. 

""I challenge you"" I challenged you to address the issue of Red State Socialism and you cannot. I challenged you to address the influence of the UDC in your classrooms and you cannot. I challenged you to do the math of the wealth redistribution from blue to red state and you cannot. The only thing you can do well is play the victim card. 

I printed out this exchange to highlight every time you refused to address a citation I provided and/or pulled the ""victim card"" because you could not refute the truth. I've counted 17 times where I CHALLENGED you to address an issue and you refused and cried like a baby.

Teachers are fighting as hard as the system currently allows. You cant break down barriers in one day or even in one school year.

I would love to see Democrats take control of the majority of ideals associated with the GOP, as they have now proven (long suspected) they are entirely false and empty rallying cries: Patriotism. Family Values. Fiscal Responsibility. Pro Life. Pride in the American flag. I put a flag on my house and my staunchly republican, Fox brainwashed step-father said “everyone is going to think you’re a republican” and I disagreed with him but he’s kinda right. (It’s actually down until we pry the current administration out of power.) We need to usurp them and use them like battering rams to get these criminals away from positions of authority and bring their voters to the party that actually benefits their lives (those that we can). Because we ARE the true patriots with real family values who are fiscally responsible that protect and uplift our fellow humans, god dammit!! Dems have always had weak messaging and poor coordination. We have got to get it together!

And since I’m here - Vote Bernie! Joe is not far removed from what we have now, sad to say. Plus he’s a wreck of a candidate.

""Teachers are fighting as hard as the system currently allows"" I would agree with you, but this 'TEACHER' as he calls himself is aware that he uses biased ""textbooks"" sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy that preach racist fake history and he DOES NOT CARE. The taxes of CALIFONIA TEACHERS are paying this lazy racist's salary, and no one should be OK with that.

""Teaching tolerance, critical thinking, and worth ethic are essential"" Tell that to your ""teacher"" friend callofthenerd because he has admitted to not doing ANY of this.

Having been in Kentucky classrooms recently, many of them do not even use textbooks anymore. Maybe some of the more rural areas still have some textbooks, but the classrooms in which I personally find myself and the classrooms I know about from speaking to others have moved beyond traditional textbooks. There is a big focus on using educational technology in my county right now. I imagine that this educational technology will be extended to other areas as technology will (hopefully) be provided to those areas. 


As far as English classes go, students are still reading *books*, yes. Not textbooks. They are discussing texts in which the themes of racism and inequality are prominent. They are also focusing on reading literature from non-canon white authors. Were you aware of this? 


Twitter is not a place for research. That is not a good source. Didn't you learn that? Also, I am a woman, not a little boy. If you would like to insult me then please do so correctly. 


I never advocated for using dated and racist history books anywhere. I simply said that there are teachers that are more intelligent than you. I don't see how you were able to read something that I did not write or imply. 


I have not met any teacher that is a racist or a liar. I work in schools. I meet teachers. Most of them are progressive and tolerant of all races, backgrounds, religions, and cultures. Are there racist teachers somewhere?  Probably. Are teachers inherently racist? Of course not. Many of them are fighting to undo what some students have drilled into their heads from their parents and grandparents. You're not incorrect that there is still racism in Kentucky. There is racism everywhere in this country and it's despicable. It is not easily unlearned, unfortunately. It's terrible, but there are constantly people fighting as hard as they can against it. Those are the people I admire and those are the people doing respectable work, not those advocating for civil war on a daily basis on reddit.com.  


I came here to provide you more information about Kentucky teachers as you are deeply misinformed, so I dont owe you an answer to your question. That is not what I came here to discuss. I also believe that answering it will be pointless regardless of what answer I provide as you will find a way to still lose your shit and make up things that you think I said. However, I am much much more progressive than you could possibly allow yourself to believe. That is all I will say about that. Please prove me right by finding an issue with that statement or accusing me of lying. 


Save me your prayers. For someone supposedly so logical, I am laughing that you think prayers do a damn thing.

Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption was a legally recognized church in the United States, established by comedian and satirist John Oliver. Its purpose was to expose and ridicule televangelists such as Robert Tilton and Creflo Dollar who preach the ""prosperity gospel"", seen as a way to defraud believers of their money, and to draw attention to the tax-exempt status given to churches and charities with little government oversight. Oliver announced formation of his church on August 16, 2015, in a twenty-minute segment on his show Last Week Tonight.Oliver announced that the Church would be shutting down during his show on September 13, 2015. All donations were forwarded to Médecins Sans Frontières (English: ""Doctors Without Borders"").

You produce racists and rapists-in-training in your schools. SHAME. ON. YOU. This is why progressives want either a Fiscal Civil War or a Two State Solution. 

""Are there racist teachers somewhere? Probably"" And we fund them. Which his why we don't want you to have any more of our money. You flush it down your racist toilets. 

""Twitter is not a place for research"" This coming from someone too stupid to read the entire thread prior to posting. That is where you are DEAD WRONG, idiot. It is a very good place to know what social and political issues are taking hold. IF YOU DID YOUR RESEARCH, you would know that Twitter was first to really sound the alarm about COVID-19 and unlike facebook, actually removes dis-information. HISTORY books written about this pandemic will have pictures of TWEETS in them, idiot. HISTORY IS NOW. And if you are too undereducated to realize it, that is not my fault. 

""I came here to provide you more information about Kentucky teachers"" which is REALLY STUPID b/c that was not what the entire thread was about. Every single citizen in KY is a SOCIALIST WELFARE QUEEN as your state cannot fund itself. The fact that your TEACHERS aren't doing MORE to prevent dis-information is just another justification for a Civil War. 

""make up things that you think I said"" Nope -- that is what you trump trash do. 

""I am much much more progressive than you could possibly allow yourself to believe"" Which is SCARY AS FUCK! This is the entirety of your problem. By NOT DOING YOUR HOMEWORK on the previous articles I cited, you have NO IDEA of what being a true ""progressive"" looks like. Simply thinking that gay people have the right to exist does NOT make you a ""progressive."" 

""Please prove me right by finding an issue with that statement or accusing me of lying."" You are not a liar. You are just incredibly intentionally ignorant and sheltered. Your version of ""progress"" wouldn't make it in Seattle, but then, neither would any student from your school. 

""For someone supposedly so logical, I am laughing that you think prayers do a damn thing."" Again, if you did your RESEARCH PRIOR TO POSTING, you would know there are multiple articles that have proven prayer works when healing the sick. Double blind RESEARCH has been conducted in various countries. But thanks for proving, once again, that KY ""school"" personnel aren't too good at doing their homework. 

""you are deluded by yours"" Says the person who OBVIOUSLY never read the New Republic article on Bulexit. Or has done ANY research into Red State Socialism and states most dependent upon the federal government. 

COVID-19 will likely cause a recession or depression (if you know your history, you would understand the reasoning better), and during times of fiscal hardship, people become more possessive of what they have. The progressive MAKER blue states fund the federal government, while the lazy welfare red TAKER states suck off of it. We see ZERO RETURN on our fiscal investment from Kentucky. We fund your schools, and you give us Rand Paul, Mitch McConnell, and Thomas Massie. 

Rand Paul is proof enough that Kentuckians are ungrateful obstructionists who don't care if they put others at risk. California taxpayers are tired of funding this bullshit. Between Betsy DeVos and the UDC school book nightmare, we are ready to defund the Department of Education and are ready to abolish it altogether. 

Since you didn't bother to do your homework on 'states most dependent upon the federal government' I will let you know that without federal funding, your state will not survive. Kentucky has not been a fiscally viable state since slavery. But blue state taxpayers will not allow their limited DOLLARS to be diverted to states like yours any longer. 

You say I am ""deluded,"" but how delusional is it to believe that progressives will continue to fund the lazy, racist welfare trash that you people are? I realize you won't (as it may educated you) but since you don't consider Twitter to be ""research,"" searching for red state socialism shouldn't bother you. 

And I would like to remind you that the slave owning state of KY is DELUSIONAL enough to have eleven statues to CONFEDERATE 'leaders' dedicated to a war they LOST, has more than 13 chapters of the UDC, but only ONE organization to teach girls to code. And you are DELUDED enough to think we should continue to pay for this bullshit?????

""Background: So, I've been a sub for around a year now. I am currently in the middle of a 3.5 week job at a school I have visited many times. I've had most of these kids at least ten or so times prior to accepting this job. The teacher asked me personally to take it on, and the kids (mostly) like me as well. I am often told I am their favorite sub.
I generally have a ""take no shit"" attitude (as do many of the teachers here do), but I dont mind laughing and joking with the students as well. I'm not a hardass. I just have expectations.
I'm a fairly young woman with not the most intimidating appearance or voice. Students often make assumptions about me and how I will respond to certain situations. Combined with the fact that I am a substitute, they often try to take advantage of me. I do not often take it personally, but it has been a little difficult as of late.
One of the class periods i have currently has been described by nearly every teacher as one of the worst groups in the whole school. I can definitely see why. They're in 7th grade and cant even walk the 30 seconds to lunch without multiple adults escorting them.
The story: Anyway, there is one particular student I've had problems with from essentially day 1. Really, he and his group of friends have been driving me up the wall. However, he is particularly aggressive when it comes to any of the things I say. I try not to carry grudges from one day to the next. If a student is having a bad day then I get it. However, here is a list of things this student has done since I.....""",1585640617,fm013qw

13697,AndrewWaldron,"Well, giving the police authority doesn't mean they are going to do anything, however, if it came to action at all, I would expect State Police road blocks on roads coming into Ky, especially into counties that he (Gov) has mentioned have reached out to him with concerns about the number of cases across respective state lines.  Saying it now, but not yet using it, still gives people the chance to comply within what the constraints being asked.  People can still cross the state lines for work or to care for family members, or even go to the grocery or other needed service, if it is closer.  However, people are being asked not to cross the state lines for things that would be considered non-essential here, for example, if you live in Bowling Green, don't drive down to Nashville to catch a movie or go to a bar, just because TN may still have those businesses open.        
      
Ultimately I wouldn't expect to see any serious use of the State Police until we start seeing confirmed KY cases that are a result of people going to other states for non-essential reasons.  So, for now, as long as the people don't force the issue, I don't see much being done...today.  Next week, with more cases here and an explosion of cases in a neighboring state, I could see a lot more being done on this front.  Beshear has been clear, in word and action, that he doesn't want to take unnecessary steps, but rather the right steps, so I don't see him pressing this yet, more so warning us that should serious action need be taken, the proper channels are ready to do so and we, the public, have been informed.    
      
As to the legal authority, declared states of emergency at the federal level and the state level, a legislature and judicial system that, for now, are mostly staying out of Beshears way, and a populace that seems mostly fine with how things are being handled here (will of the people).      
       
I am not finding anything specifically on what the State Police have been empowered to do, but I'm still leaning on if they do anything they use the lightest touch possible until they have to actually physically quarantine people coming back in.  Question: What do the State Police do if they see your plate on the road obviously coming back from TN/wherever?  What do they if the decide your reason for doing so is non-essential/approved?  At this point, we're in a grey area on a lot of things.  I have posted the following I've found about the travel restrictions.              
    
New executive order: Do not travel out of state. Do not travel except for work, grocery, pharmacy, or to a place to exercise    
    
We want you to go out-of-state, for work, for groceries, medicine, other supplies that are necessities, a loved one to care for, or if a court requires you to travel.     
     
Anyone that’s been out on a trip on Spring Break, self-quarantine for 14 days. THIS IS AN ORDER, not a request    
       
""Announced that Kentuckians can still go to Tennessee for work, to take care of a loved one or even buy groceries if it is closer, but the Governor asks that unnecessary travel to Tennessee end. He asked Kentuckians not to travel across the southern state-line to partake in activities that have been limited, or were limited earlier in Kentucky.""",1585660608,fm0l3bi

WV is actually a key player in this solution with King Coal Hwy and Coalfields Expressway will link the region with easy access to the E coast and the Carolinas. 

If there is a holdup anywhere it is along the VA border as Va is not cooperating with WV or KY to build the roads needed to allow multiple access points to the population dense areas of the east coast.

&gt;And if you read the bill or paid attention to what it actually said and you are objective you might have another opinion.

Your taste in shoes might be an 'opinion', but the size of a shoe is an objective fact.  Something is objective if its being true is independent of someone comprehending it.  

&gt; If you don’t understand why she did what she did than you clearly don’t see the long term damages to our future. It’s not just this virus. We will probably not recover from economic destruction if something isn’t enacted to stop some of the governor’s decisions. If you don’t agree with that, fine.

You're arguing that stopping the governor from shutting down businesses or whatever to mitigate a pandemic is good because those businesses or investors or whoever would lose money, right?  

The issue with that is that if those actions are not taken by Kentucky's governor, or by other governors or the president of Italy or whoever else, millions more people would die than would otherwise.  So obviously, those leaders have been choosing to shut down businesses because it's better to decrease deaths even if it might hurt some businesses in the short term or put them out of business, or disappoint people who wanted to go to Gamestop, or have whatever other effects.

Just hypothetically, if governments just let millions more people die without intervention and ignored the obviously rational moral concern with it, were you assuming that even the economic impact of that scenario would be preferable?  Because obviously it wouldn't.  

So, despite your argument or 'opinion' being asinine from every angle, and that it pertains to an issue threatening millions of peoples' live, you still say it's 'objective', and you even complain about people's 'hate' towards you or others for it.

Not really arbitrary, just an estimate.

Also, there are probably all kinds of other means of transmission people haven't figured out yet.  Like in Japan during the SARS outbreak apparently it was transmitted by faulty plumbing sometimes.  So some are even wondering if it's possible with this corona virus.

&gt;It has been suggested that the “faecal droplet” route may have been one of several modes of transmission in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak in early 2003. In this case, droplets originating from virus-rich excreta in a given building’s drainage system re-entered into resident’s apartments via sewage and drainage systems where there were strong upward air flows, inadequate “traps” and non-functional water seals.

1) workforce

2) land

3) tax incentives and or subsidies

4) supply chain access

5) ancillary services

AND...  other regions are competing with you for the same industry.  So you don't just have to have those qualities, you have to have them in better order than dozens of other areas.  

In order for Eastern KY to be competitive attracting those jobs, the federal government will need to step in on their behalf.  Unfortunately a major fulcrum for moving the federal government's attention to Easter KY is Mitch, and he is way more interested in soap boxing in front of coal miners about how he is going to war to protect their industry.  If he starts fighting to get competing industries into the region, he will undercut that message.  Additionally he scores political points by acting sympathetic to the economically depressed region and blaming their work capacity woes on the democrats which have been waging a war against ""hard working American families"" by soberly acknowledging the reality of coal.  

Meanwhile, the fact that democrats have been working on plans to get other industries into the region is largely kept from sight or ignored by Easter KY voters, who primarily consume right leaning media.  Hemp and tourism and manufactury are all considered by dems, and there have been stirrings at the federal level to try to kickstart something (not just in Eastern KY, but in several rural regions depressed by the contraction of the coal industry).  

Mitch is the most powerful advocate for Eastern KY.  He is directly funded by coal industry/lobby, and has successfully spun the situation politically to get the region to blame the democrats and believe that he is a blue collar warrior on their behalf.  He will wring every last dollar out of coal before he swoops in and rescues the region from the callous democrats that broke those families by thoughtlessly attacking their time honored industry.

Transportation can be an issue.

Lines can be long, especially in certain areas that happen to contain a lot of poorer/specific demographics that the right has deemed as not helpful to them getting elected. 

There are tons of reasons, none of them are good reasons for not voting at all, but we should admit that our government has a very archaic process that affects those who tend to fall into the poor/wage slave demographic more than it affects the rich and retired. 

Most of these reasons would be solved by making election day a federal holiday and providing free public transportation to polling locations. Also, easing restrictions or fully allowing mail in voting in lieu of in person voting.

Now people are overloaded with information and it's not because of people all becoming collectively dumber like ""idiocracy"", it's economic.  Facebook or other media have mediated culture because their services or businesses are what people want on whatever primitive impulsive level they target (they actually discuss dopamine levels), but the monetization of that is how they continue to exploit it.  So political or economic changes could mitigate those effects.  Fox News is possible today because the Fairness Doctrine was eliminated under Reagan.  It's like if people were allowed legally to get on the air and claim aliens were invading and cause people to go crazy and riot, like in the War of the Worlds broadcast.

The 2016 United States presidential election in Kentucky was held on November 8, 2016, as part of the 2016 General Election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia participated. Kentucky voters chose 8 electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine.

On March 5 and May 17, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Kentucky  voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, and Libertarian parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated were unable to vote.

14031,Visual_Wasabi,"&gt; However, being that Coronavirus is mostly airborne

Whether or not it's airborne, and what that truly means, is discussed in [Ed Yong's latest article in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/). Yong is their science/health writer and one of the few journalists out there truly knowledgeable on this subject as he [wrote about this scenario two years ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-the-next-plague-hits/561734/). He was also on [NPR's Fresh Air](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/01/825397308/masks-vaccines-how-covid-19-might-end) today.

&gt;**Is the new coronavirus airborne?**

&gt; Confusingly, in public-health circles, the word airborne has a technical meaning that’s not just “carried through the air.” When people are infected with respiratory viruses, they emit viral particles whenever they talk, breathe, cough, or sneeze. These particles are encased in globs of mucus, saliva, and water. Bigger globs fall faster than they evaporate, so they splash down nearby—these are traditionally called “droplets.” Smaller globs evaporate faster than they fall, leaving dried-out viruses that linger in the air and drift farther afield—these are called “aerosols.” When researchers say a virus is “airborne,” like measles or chickenpox, they mean that it moves as aerosols. When the World Health Organization asserts that the new coronavirus is “NOT airborne,” it’s claiming that the virus instead spreads primarily through the close-splashing droplets, which either land directly on people’s faces or are carried to their faces by unwashed, contaminated hands. 

&gt; Such messaging is “really irresponsible,” argues Don Milton, an expert in aerosol transmission at the University of Maryland. The scientific community doesn’t even agree about whether aerosol transmission matters for the flu, so “to say that after three months we know for sure that this [new] virus is not airborne is … [expletive deleted],” he says. Milton and other experts who study how viruses move through the air say that the traditional distinction between big, short-range droplets and small, long-range aerosols is based on outdated science. Lydia Bourouiba of MIT, for instance, has shown that exhalations, sneezes, and coughs unleash swirling, fast-moving clouds of both droplets and aerosols, which travel many meters farther than older studies predicted. Both kinds of glob also matter over shorter distances: Someone standing next to a person with COVID-19 is more likely to be splashed by droplets and to inhale aerosols.

&gt; The question, then, isn’t whether the coronavirus is “airborne” in the tediously academic way the word has been defined. As the journalist Roxanne Khamsi puts it, the virus is “definitely borne by air.” The better questions are: How far does the virus move? And is it stable and concentrated enough at the end of its journey to harm someone’s health?

&gt; A handful of studies have offered preliminary answers. One team of researchers blasted virus-laden fluids into a rotating cylinder to create a cloud of aerosols. They found that the virus remained stable for several hours within that cloud, raising fears about its ability to persist in ambient air. But as the researchers have noted, the study’s experimental setup was artificial. It doesn’t reflect “what’s occurring when you’re just walking down the street,” says Saskia Popescu of George Mason University, who specializes in infection control and who was not involved in the study. “It’s more akin to medically invasive procedures like intubation, which run the risk of aerosolizing the virus, and are unique to the health-care setting.”

&gt; A second study suggests that the coronavirus can be released into the air in less dramatic ways. Joshua Santarpia and his colleagues at the University of Nebraska Medical Center found traces of the coronavirus’s RNA—its genetic material—in rooms occupied by a total of 13 COVID-19 patients, most of whom had only mild symptoms. The RNA was on obvious places such as bed rails and toilets, but also on harder-to-reach spots such as ventilation grates, window ledges, and the floors beneath the beds. The RNA even lingered in the air; using air-samplers, the team detected viral RNA floating more than six feet away from the patients, and even in the hallways just outside the patients’ rooms.

&gt; This isn’t necessarily cause for alarm. Finding viral RNA is like finding a fingerprint at a crime scene—the culprit was once there, but might be long gone. So far, the Nebraska team has failed to detect live, infectious virus in its air samples. Santarpia told me that further tests are under way, and results will be released soon.

&gt; If the Nebraska team does find infectious particles, it would mean that even mildly symptomatic people can expel SARS-CoV-2 into the air, and that the virus can travel at least the length of a hospital room—a claim supported by a few other studies. Even that, though, would not guarantee danger. Are those far-spreading virus particles concentrated enough to infect another person in the same room? How many virus particles does it even take to launch an infection? How far does the virus travel in outdoor spaces, or in other indoor settings? Have these airborne movements affected the course of the pandemic?

&gt; These questions have no answers yet. To get those answers, “you’d have to expose animals to different quantities of airborne viruses, see if they get infected, and relate that to measures of the virus [in places] where people are infected,” says Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard. “This is the type of stuff people will work on for years, but no one is going to find out for the moment.”",1585777114,fm5ozhf

Most people here are really poor, and I know a lot that don’t even have a political allegiance—they voted for trump because he’s a mess. It’s an expression of being pissed off. I don’t agree with it at all and it’s brought out the worst in people that were never nasty, but I can see the root of it pretty easy. The standard of living here is far below most of the country and has been for a long time + Appalachia has always been subject to ridicule, people from here tend to be sort of xenophobic but to people from outside of Appalachia rather than just outside of the country. When no one really offers attention, help, replacements, or solutions it’s not like any politician is going to court the majority of people from here, the populace is incredibly disillusioned and many are not even politically active probably owing to poverty and poor educational opportunities. For the record, almost half of the counties that flipped the governor seat last year in favor of Beshear were in Eastern KY, and he’s the candidate they didn’t want, it rocky Adkins had gotten nominated a good half of eastern KY would’ve flipped to Democrats—because many either don’t have a strong allegiance anymore, or don’t vote at all, and if a candidate that actually appeals to them can present they won’t hesitate to come home.
There are a lot of reasons eastern KY is the way it is and functions the way it does and it’s a lot more than I think most think so I’m quick to defend it even when I’m at total odds with most people from here—sorry if it sounded aggressive!",1585788051,fm67p27

While you may be able to file and slip past the screening process for the first check, they still may (probably) at some point check with your employer. Like I said it may go through the first time you request Unemployment Insurance (UI)  but the next month when you try to request it again (you have to request your benefits each month) may get denied by your employer because you outright quit. Then you would be stuck with no job and no UI coming in &amp; trying to find employment with everyone else that's out of a job. Also keep in mind that UI isn't paying much so if your saying you only make minimum wage or something close to it you will only get about 45%-50% of your pay. It may increase with federal funding helping to fund state for UI but with this federal government in control right now I wouldnt hold my breathe for anything from them. 
Honestly, I'd say try bringing up these issues with your boss &amp; see if their is a way to better protect yourself if this is your main reason for wanting to quit. If no such luck that route I dont know what your next step would be.

It goes to the state, someone audits it, calls your employers and says did MtDiabloDeathMachince work there for X amount of time and what was the reasoning/terms of dismissal.  At that point your employer can fight or say yes he was laid off due to Y reason. (In this case it's for Covid-19)
With things not being normal right the state is basically, if Im to understand it right, pretty much pushing through everyone's claim. Obviously some people wont qualify but you catch my drift. Their overwhelmed and overworked and they know people need money. But when you have to re-file a month from now and they call your employer and say yes he willingly quit, then your claim may be denied second time around which puts you in the position of no job, no UI and also trying to get a job with everyone else looking as well. (Also may be forced to pay back any money recieved from first month of UI benefits)
My advice, if you have a job take the steps to be safe. Insist on it from your employer.  If not, then do what you have to protect yourself if that means not doing your job to whole standard due to unsafe work environment.  Always protect yourself first. Fuck your employer if they aren't actively trying to keep you safe.

The bottom line, if we are truly a capitalist economy, failed states like Kentucky should not be funded by the more successful states. You people need to focus a bit more on fixing yourselves.

Again the man said “God will take care of me” and stayed right there. 

Eventually the waters forced the man to take shelter on the roof of his house. A boat drove by and offered to rescue the man. “Quick, before your house is washed away, jump in!” The driver said.

“My god will take care of me!” The man said and with that, his house was washed away in the flood waters.

&gt; The vast majority of voter ID laws in the United States target only voter impersonation, of which there are only 31 documented cases in the United States from the 2000–2014 period.[61]

&gt; According to PolitiFact, ""in-person voter fraud—the kind targeted by the ID law—remains extremely rare"".[12] According to the Associated Press, the New York Times, NPR, CNBC, the Guardian and FactCheck.Org the available research and evidence point to the type of fraud that would be prevented by voter ID laws as ""very rare"" or ""extremely rare"".[62][63][64][65][66][67][68] 

&gt; PolitiFact finds the suggestion that ""voter fraud is rampant"" false, giving it its ""Pants on Fire"" rating.[12] Most cases of alleged voter fraud involving dead voters have been shown to be a result of incorrect matching of voter rolls and death records, such as when someone died after they voted rather than before.[69] 

&gt; Writing in 2009, Harvard political scientist Stephen Ansolabehere noted that despite the common belief ""that fraud occurs at least somewhat often in elections … social scientists have been unable to develop unambiguous measures of the incidence of fraud, and legal cases find very little hard evidence on the matter.""[70]

&gt; In a 2012 analysis, News21 of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism surveyed thousands of election officials in 50 states regarding all instances of fraud relating to elections since 2000, and concluded that in-person voter impersonation is virtually non-existent, amounting to one out of about every 15 million prospective voters.[71]",1586024887,fmfdcv2

The 'whistle blower'........wasn't.  

On December 30, Li Wenliang sent some messages to a private Wechat  group with a few of his friends, claiming that he saw patient scans and  that “There has been 7 confirmed cases of SARS”

Li Wenliang was an opthalmologist (a doctor specialised in eye  disorders), who claimed that the virus outbreak was confirmed to be  SARS. This was objectively false information spread by a doctor in an  unrelated field, obviously he would get censured for spreading rumours.  Also, contrary to popular belief, he was not arrested at all, only told  by the police to stop spreading rumours and sign a notice. He was  reportedly at the police station for only an hour, hardly as serious as  Western media have made it sound.

Another important point that counters the “coverup” theory. He was  called down to the police on 3 January, four days after China had  already informed the WHO.

This post goes into further detail debunking the New York Times claim  that Li Wenliang was a whistleblower and shows how they twisted the  story to suit their narrative: [https://mronline.org/2020/03/05/yellow-caking-an-epidemic/](https://mronline.org/2020/03/05/yellow-caking-an-epidemic/)",1586029320,fmfksdo

I could maybe understand getting angry if we somehow find a vaccine and almost everyone gets it, but let's be real here.

This whole thing SHOULD squash the anti vax movement, but with Trump and Fox News and so on pushing various narratives, it probably won't take much of a hit.

Considering the length of most of our lives, it'll be alright if we lose 3-6 months if it means almost complete normalcy at the end.

Why would somebody risk committing voter fraud when they know the penalties are pretty harsh whereas the chance that their fraudulent vote will actually affect the outcome of the election is basically 0?

The only people this law absolutely excludes from voting are migrants/illegal immigrants, people who should not be able to vote in Kentucky anyway, as they are not citizens. On top of that, it provides a barrier to voter fraud. Even if there have been no cases of voter fraud in Kentucky as of late, as Beshear says (a doubtful claim in itself but I'll take it), making it more difficult to commit this fraud is a good thing.  


Of course, both sides are acting purely in their own interests here. Democrats like Beshear want illegals and migrants to vote because they generally vote blue. Meanwhile, Republicans want to stop them from voting because they threaten to turn local elections over to the Democrats. This is politics as it is.

These groups have no feasible way of even voting because they're not registered, it literally almost never happens (and I do mean ""literal"" in an actual literal sense,) and this kind of voter fraud in the first place would be high risk, low reward. *Maybe* a concerted effort (which greatly increases the already good chance of it not working) to turn a local election would work with the numbers required, but beyond that, you'd need to hope that the race is already very, very tight. Otherwise, adding one vote at a time isn't going to do much good, especially if already at legal risk as an illegal citizen.

Those who actually inform themselves on this topic also know that getting ID isn't necessarily as easy for certain groups. For example, if you're poor and with no reliable means of transportation to get to a courthouse that may be located across a rural county, that's unnecessarily burdensome. If you're an out-of-state college student with no license and a voter ID law says you can't use your student ID (last I checked, Kentucky's law they passed doesn't have this restriction, but it's extremely common among these GOP voter suppression bills), you're also affected.

That is, by the way, one of the other ways--other than this addressing a non-existent issue--that you know these laws are meant to suppress votes. They pretty much always come with other restrictions besides ""you need an ID"" that make it unnecessarily more difficult for some people to vote, which is literally the exact opposite of making an election more Democratic.

15178,real_big_words,"I once worked a Gamestop on the North side of town. Our customer base was largely poorer folks with a larger percentage of African Americans and Hispanic people than other stores. If someone bought an M-rated game, I had to iD them if they looked under 30. I would estimate about 40% of our customers didn't have an ID on them. They would get mad, leave the store, and come back later with an ID. Some simply didn't have it.

The point is, some people are culturally against carrying government identification on them. Whether this is based on race, class, or geography, it doesn't really matter. And as it turns out, those people tend to be more progressive and less likely to vote for Republicans.

If anything, I would think the right-wing would be *against* ""big government"" forcing people to pay for a piece of identification they may not need (getting a job, you can use a birth certificate or social security card, and they may not drive). Yet the conservatives are the ones who want this sort of thing. Why? That's probably because they don't actually care about ""big government""; they ONLY care about making money and keeping their jobs.

But a bigger problem in today's climate is that DMVs are closed and the state isn't issuing new IDs. So if this became law, no one without an ID could vote this upcoming presidential/senatorial election. That makes this purely a tactical move and has NOTHING to do with actual policy.",1586115215,fmir3ye

15306,cyntrix,"[From the article:](https://www.beargrassthunder.com/post/why-is-the-mountain-dulcimer-the-official-instrument-of-kentucky)

**The Appalachian dulcimer, commonly referred to as the 'mountain dulcimer' was officially named the state instrument of Kentucky in 2001.** The official law can be found in the *Kentucky Revised Statutes,* *Title 1, Chapter 2, Section 2.103:* 

&gt;**TITLE I - SOVEREIGNTY AND JURISDICTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH. CHAPTER 2 - CITIZENSHIP, EMBLEMS, HOLIDAYS, AND TIME** **2.103 State musical instrument.**  ***The Appalachian dulcimer is named and      designated as the official musical instrument of      Kentucky.*** **Effective: June 21, 2001 History: Created 2001 Ky. Acts ch. 160, sec. 1, effective June 21, 2001.**

**The mountain dulcimer is a three-or-four-stringed wooden string instrument played flat on your lap.** The hollow body runs the length of the fretboard with tuning pegs along the scroll at the top. It can be strummed with a flatpick or fingered, while some musicians have been known to use a glass slide to accentuate melodic accompaniment.  Unlike the guitar or banjo, the dulcimer is fretted diatonically rather than chromatically. Traditionally tuned to D-A-D, this means **the dulcimer has a rich and bright droning sound,** always in key with itself due to the diatonic fretting. Because of this, the dulcimer makes for a great educational instrument, often credited as being one of the easiest string instruments to learn. **The soft and etherical sound of the dulcimer is often compared to Asian or Middle Eastern instruments.**

**The instrument first appeared in the early 17th century, popular among Scotch-Irish immigrants residing among the Appalachian Mountains.** It's speculated that early settlers lacked the time, tools, and resources to build violin instruments with the fairly complex wooden curves and bows, instead creating the more easily-constructed dulcimer. 

**The dulcimer can be considered a blend of many European folk instruments** such as the German scheitholt, Swedish hummel, Norwegian langeleik, and French epinettes des vosges. It was during a period between 1700 to mid 1800's that the dulcimer was being developed within the Shenandoah River Valley region. 

Dulcimers were usually handcrafted locally from whichever kind of wood was easily available in the region. **Dulcimers were constructed in a wide variety of ways resulting in many unique instruments.** Some differences include different styles of fretting, number of strings, shape and size of the instrument body, as well as types of wood to improve project acoustics.

**In the late 1800s, the mountain dulcimer was starting to become more popularized outside of the Appalachian region and became known as something of a cultural icon** engrained in many musical and folk traditions. This encouraged the preservation of the instrument as it was, and discouraged further development or innovation.

**In modern times, many popular musicians have incorporated the mountain dulcimer into their music.** Jean Ritchie *(1922-2015)*, a popular folk singer and musician in the 1940's and 1950's had a huge impact on the instrument's popularization. She even went so far as to record an album titled '*The Most Dulcimer*' in 1992 after fans continually asked her the question ""Which album has the most dulcimer?!""

**Richard Fariña** ***(1937-1966)*** **was another popular folksinger who had a notable impact on the mountain dulcimer's popularization.** His album, *Celebrations for a Grey Day*, released in 1965, featured folk tunes played on guitar and dulcimer with Richard and his wife's vocal harmonies. Fariña's life came to a tragic end in 1966 due to a motorcycle crash. 

&gt;**""If Richard had survived that motorcycle accident, he would have easily given \[Bob\] Dylan a run for his money."" –** [**Ed Ward**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Ward_(writer))

Other contemporary **artists such as** **Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones as well as Cyndi Lauper have incorporated the mountain dulcimer into their music** and songwriting process in more recent times.

Needless to say, the mountain dulcimer is an extremely versatile instrument with many variations of traditions and performance. **It's rich cultural history and influence on music as a whole makes it the perfect instrument to be named the official instrument of Kentucky.**

15399,cDawgMcGrew,"You probably don’t get out much.   Read some other material off of REddit and you’ll find that Tennessee is in the top 10 fastest growing economies of nearly any report you can find.
I live in KY, and I gave credit to the governor- not sure if you read that.   Honestly, the worship of our governor is a little uncomfortable to keep seeing, potential dangerous actually.   I’m probably the only one here that remembers he didn’t win by a large margin, aka “barely won.”

But again, his team (not the man) deserves credit for handling this crisis well.",1586199221,fmm5m7g

15410,Dexta_Grif, Received an email from the address [urgentcareofky@gmail.com](mailto:urgentcareofky@gmail.com) around 1:30-2:00 PM this afternoon. This is not legitimate as I called the governor's office to verify. Please inform others!,1586202070,fmmb29f
15411,Solorath,"Take your pick. All of the establishment dems suck. They treat anything that isn't watered down moderate policies as full-bore socialism because they make tons of money being in the pockets of special interest groups. i.e. health insurance companies, ISPs, etc. 

Pelosi, Biden, Schumer, etc. - All of them are against anything that radically changes how our country works. Which is what the country needs to enact real change. This country fucking sucks and keeping status quo and wondering why we keep sucking at everything doesn't help anything.",1586202266,fmmbfu8
