Christopher McCandless
AMERICAN ADVENTURER

Christopher McCandless
QUICK FACTS
BORN
February 12, 1968
El Segundo, California
FOUND DEAD
September 6, 1992
Stampede Trail, Alaska
McCandless was born in southern California. His father was an aerospace engineer who‚Äîin partnership with his second wife, Christopher‚Äôs mother‚Äîbecame a successful entrepreneur. The family relocated to the East Coast while Christopher was still a child. He grew up in Annandale, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C.

McCandless would have returned to civilization in early July 1992 had he been able to recross the Teklanika, but the river he had easily forded two months earlier was by then swollen with snowmelt. Forced to continue on a substandard diet, he weakened and died in mid-August. His body, which weighed only 67 pounds (30.4 kg), was discovered by hunters on September 6. The cause of death was officially reported as starvation.",1577895675,fcr2526
164,lolajsanchez,"Dude, you wouldn't last a month in Colorado. Our growing season is literally one week out of the year. You need permits and tags for hunting and fishing, which require you to have an ID, so you'd still be ""on grid"". Are you buying or renting the land? Both will be an insane expense. Bye-bye 401k. Gonna hand build that cabin all by yourself? Where you gonna live in the meanwhile? Yeah, you gonna forage for berries? What's your water source? Is it frozen? You gonna boil water to decontaminate every time? 

With your attitude, the locals won't be queuing to help you, even if you offer them money. Your nonsense is only going to put yourself and others at risk. 

Real advice? Bring an avalanche beacon and tell your family that your body won't be found til next season.",1577895711,fcr27yy

Everyone is raining on your parade, and honestly for good reason. But if you‚Äôre gonna go down this path, your best bet is to start in Fairbanks where you have some moderate access to civilization. Fairbanks has TONS of dry cabins for rent, and I would suggest moving there and living in a dry cabin with a wood stove, and not using the electricity for a year. Live very cheaply, use this time to make friends and take classes from the university or locally, like foraging etc. You can also start looking for a plot of land. In year 2, buy some land and start building yourself a cabin while still living in your dry cabin (which will give you a good idea of size preference/layout). Then keep progressing from there over the next few years until you‚Äôre doing what your heart is set on doing. It‚Äôs completely possible, it just takes time.

Importantly, and I‚Äôm going to spell it out plainly, there is no need to try to completely do every part of this scenario you have in your head at once, simply because you will die. All the Alaskans don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre an idiot; we just think you‚Äôre naive to the harshness of the environment that we experience regularly. I‚Äôve been doing this stuff for 35 years, it is a progressive skill set and comfort level that does not just suddenly happen by reading a few books and having a brave soul.

We always had shovels and wool blankets in our cars etc.  The environment is pretty harsh as well.  The mountains are full of shale and the mud is like quicksand.  Moose can be aggressive and sometimes bears but not too often.  Bear mace is a minimum requirement for hiking and your knowledge of the gear you wear/carry should be addiquit for the climate.  Good luck.,1577907899,fcrxayf

I mention this because if they couldn‚Äôt survive, neither can you in my opinion. I suggest you read ‚ÄúLa Relacion‚Äù by Alvar Nunez Cabeza De Vaca, a spanish explorer who, with other men were stranded on the coast of Texas. They were captured by the indigenous people and lived with them for 12 years.

Needing to get away from city life is a really vague/oblique rationale for trying to suddenly become a mountain man. If you‚Äôre dedicated to getting tf out of where you‚Äôre living why don‚Äôt you spend a winter in a suburb of buffalo or somewhere that is harsh but populated so you can figure out if this is what you actually want.


Because right now it sounds like you are stir crazy and desperate to get out of your current situation and are going to the most outrageous extreme for the sake of going to the most outrageous extreme. I feel like youve romanticized the idea of just vanishing into the wilderness and want people to eulogize your social life and gush to each other about ‚Äúoh man did you hear what Todd did?‚Äù sort of thing.

374,Peliquin,"One of my best friends is an engineer up in Fairbanks -- his stories have me pretty convinced that most people don't understand that owning a home in the sub arctic isn't as simple as ""keep it warm."" A poorly insulated home will melt the soil around it and cause the house to subside, and this often breaks the foundation or the roof or both. A poorly insulated house may also be blazing hot in the bedroom and still have a frozen pipe in the kitchen. So on and so forth. There is a ton of literature about home ownership for the sub-arctic homeowner available at the Cold Housing Research Center -- and they love to talk to people. Educate, then buy. Too many folks just... ugh, don't do the homework.

I feel obligated to point out -- I mainly live in Idaho, and we got a lot of the same sort of people here. I guess N. Idaho is where their money runs out on their way up. Honestly, the biggest misconception neo-settler types have is an idea that somehow, magically, any place is rocking all the green, dense grass they've been dreaming of. The reality is that the frontier is mostly long gone, and that era isn't coming back. There is no land where the living is easy and the problems are few. I had to explain to a Texan that Meth was a thing in Idaho too. He refused to believe me that it wasn't the land of fish, milk and honey. It's frustrating.

I'm not saying what you want is impossible b uh t also remember that areas like Alaska harbor some of the worlds most precious biological integrity- please dont just start messing with populations of wild animals that you don't understand the life cycles of. The only people who can ""live off the land"" are essentially master trappers and fishermen, who have decades of experience and/or family passed down knowledge of wildlife, and even without schooling I would call them biologists at heart. Maybe you watch a lot of documentaries and read a few books or you just really like animals, but especially ""climbing v10's"" does not qualify you to just start slaughtering local wildlife in the woods. It takes many many years to make this sort of thing work. You are going too fast- nobody is telling that you cant, but we are saying *slow down and think*.

I doubt it. It's one thing to idealize yourself as the Henry David Thoreau of the north and another once you're standing there. Tbh, having grown up and lived here for the majority of my life, it's a great place. Saw another poster say that 90% of us would die if we couldn't go to the supermarket and it's pretty true. There is so much beautiful landscape to hike, hunt and fish and most likely he'd end up here dipping his toe into the water before jumping in.

8 degrees Celsius is perfectly comfortable *if it's dry.* Add in high humidity, rain and driving wind chill and it can be an absolutely miserable experience, particularly with mud.  
Once you go below zero degrees (32 F), it starts getting better again, as the moisture content of the air drops and you lose less heat.   
\-10 C (14 F) is comfortable with just a long sleeved t-shirt, provided you're active and it's dry weather with minimal wind.

Do you even know what the daylight cycle is like? Again, the further north you go, the worse it gets. Seasonal depression is a real killer up here, and it's not unheard of for people in the more northern towns and villages to go crazy from lack of sunlight.

They return to Alaska in the Spring.  There my pee and occasion of Winter king or 2 but most the salmon come in to our rivers in the Spring. Hunting is a Fall/Winter sport. It is plausible for you to take down a moose but you have to make sure you have the right tags.  And then you have to understand how to butcher in process moose for your meat.  If you are an experienced Hunter/Fisherman/ Gatherer you might have half a chance with a decent house set up in the middle of the woods in Alaska but you're a greenhorn and most likely we will be digging your cold body out of your cabin.,1577925654,fcsut3z

You have a lesson 10% chance of making it through the Winter alive in Alaska with no experience your a greenhorn.  Anchorage the other hand, is just a big city like any other city. Its got a very high crime and drug problem.  I do believe that my Hometown was voted the most dangerous city in the United States.

555,Saltycat9021,"I'm from Northwestern British Columbia, and have travelled and spent time in the Yukon, which I imagine is much more hospitable than much of Alaska. 

I know people who live off the grid in Northern BC but life is hard and specific to the environment (coastal/inland) and you still need to work at least seasonally. Unless you're fishing off the ocean or lake (and have a proper vessel to do so), fish are all seasonal. You need to know proper preserving techniques such as canning, smoking, drying, salting, unless you can afford a gas or diesel generator and afford to keep it going year round (freezing). 

Hunting is a skill and one that takes time to master.  Tracking, shooting, gutting, skinning, butchering and preserving are not easy. I know many skilled individuals who hunt every season and can come back empty handed. And if you're hunting outside of season, do know that people will report you if seen. 

You need to be able to make a community to survive, if you plan on using the bartering system and it can take a few years for locals of your area to be receptive to you. 

And you're living so far away from everything that travel is expensive, fuel is NOT cheap and neither is vehicle maintenance so you better know some basic mechanicing if you're gonna live out in the Bush. Not to mention how expensive fruit and veg are, so you need to build a greenhouse and garden just to offset your grocery costs.

I had appendicitis when I was a kid. In a city, you get to the hospital in 20 minutes and they fix you.

769,fondots,"I'm not an Alaskan, I found my way to this thread from someone linking it elsewhere on Reddit. I am a pretty avid outdoorsman however.

What, exactly, are you expecting to do there? What exactly does ""live off the land"" mean to you? Are you planning to move to AK, buy a house somewhere a bit off the beaten path, do a lot of fishing, and maybe raise some chickens and plant a vegetable garden? If that's your plan, then whatever I suppose, go for it. Buy some good winter gear, get yourself a decent toolkit for home maintenance, and have a ball. Expect to have to find a job at some point to fill in the gaps when the salmon aren't running or your heater takes a shit on you.

Or are you looking to do some Into The Wild style adventure? Go off into the woods alone, build a cabin, live completely off-grid, eat, wear, and use only what you carried in with you and what nature provides?

Because if that's your plan, there's a lot of skills and knowledge you're going to need. Living outdoors is rough. You're not going to build any substantial shelter in a day, especially by yourself. That means you need somewhere to stay while you're constructing it. In warmer months, you could probably get away with a basic tent or lean-too (if you haven't already practiced building Bushcraft shelters, you should definitely bone up on that before you go. It can be miserable even in a milder climate) but during winter, you're going to *really* need to build yourself somewhere warm and dry in a hurry. If you've never done any winter camping, I recommend researching that heavily right now, getting your gear, and trying it out before you head anywhere near Alaska. Since you're on the east coast, try somewhere from upstate Pennsylvania or further north first and see what it's like to spend even a weekend out of doors in the winter and remember that AK can be much colder and gets less daylight to work during.you can probably get away with some *good quality* camping gear for a few nights, but trust me, you'll get sick of it really quick. I *love* winter camping, but I wouldn't want to live like that for more than a few days.

What's your construction experience like? Building a house isn't exactly complicated, I think most people can probably handle it with some research, especially if they're not installing electricity, plumbing, or HVAC, but it's definitely an order of magnitude harder than making a birdhouse in middle school woodshop. Log building is pretty a specialized skill, and to do it well enough to survive an Alaskan winter is going to require tools and experience that you can't just pick up on the fly.

You're going to want to adjust your mentality on fishing. Don't think so much rod and reel, think fish traps, nets, and spears. If this is going to be a primary food source, your survival is dependent on having enough fish to fill your stomach and having enough to smoke/salt/etc.so that it lasts for the times you're too busy to fish (like when you're building a house for example,) you're sick or injured, the water is too frozen, or the fish just aren't there. Plan on alternate food sources too. Do you hunt? You should probably pick that up. How are your gardening skills? Do you know which local plants are safe to eat?

There's some things you're probably going to want that can't be found in the woods. Wood-burning stove to keep your cabin warm? Gotta buy that *and then* you gotta get it out to the woods somehow. 

Have you ever tanned leather? Made jerky? Canned your own fruits and vegetables? Made soap from homemade lye water and animal fat? Started a fire with flint &amp; steel or a bow drill? (Or are you planning on bringing a lifetime supply of matches and bic lighters with you?)

The way to do it would be to come in early fall and get acclimated to the weather going into winter if you really wanted to do it.  Coming in the middle of the winter is just asking to get killed.

People have lived off the land in Alaska by being in small communities subject to harsh conditions. It means catching enough fish to share with everyone, collecting enough berries, and hunting enough to share. It's not the same as it used to be, but a lot of the same challenges still remain, and the suicide rate should be a hint that it's not an easy or glamorous life.

But people haven't done that alone, because it's cold, dark and dangerous. Very few, if any, will ever survive doing that alone, and the people who do it in their communities have done it for thousands of years - and yet there's not all that many Alaska Natives around (some because of the Russians and other Europeans, and Americans).

882,OtherSpiderOnTheWall,"And it was a fair question! I just wanted to be sure to get the caveats in there, because some people legitimately think they can pull it off, and frankly only few people can.

Diet wise: The goal is to get a diet that has a lot of fat in it. Protein can only get you so far, and carbs are a limited resource in the arctic. Fortunately, most animals like moose, seal and whale will have sufficient fat in them. Trophic levels, however, means that such diets cannot sustain as many people (in a region where food/energy is already more scarce than tropical regions).

Consequently, unlike European farmers (who adapted to a carb-rich diet), the rate of diabetes among Alaska Natives and other arctic peoples is higher than e.g. Europeans, when subject to the same carb-rich diet.

One of the best sources for that is data from Greenland and Denmark, since both countries have a similar medical system that tracks each individual, creating large quantities of verifiable data that can then be used to compare the effects of a European diet on the Greenlandic people and the Danish people.",1577993826,fcv3eea

931,ForkliftChampion,"Here is how this really plays out... Be me from Arizona, have been in snow but nothing below -10 degrees Fahrenheit. Wife and I just had baby I'm 18 years old. Get a call from wife's sister saying she has business opportunity in Alaska being a dog trainer / musher. Pack our stuff and move to the middle of Denali wilderness. Turns out sister-in-law is in a relationship with a married Eskimo and he has hidden her off grid in a 20-foot by 20-foot cabin. Long story short: I'm terrible with dogs, the Aurora Borealis is beautiful, I learned how to warm up an oil pan with a propane torch for weed burning to get my car started, and fighting an Eskimo is a bad idea.",1578013239,fcvyveb

Highway 10, more commonly known as the Inuvik‚ÄìTuktoyaktuk Highway (or ITH), is a road between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk in Canada's Northwest Territories. It is the ""first all-weather road to Canada's Arctic Coast"". The idea for the highway had been considered for decades; however, final approval was not until 2013, with construction beginning in 2014. It was officially opened on November 15, 2017, opening up Tuktoyaktuk to year-round vehicle traffic, which is hoped to increase tourism in the area.

Anchorage and Fairbanks can both be as cold as -20F / -30C, but with the right clothing it will be no problem.

There are tons of snowsuits for babies on Facebook marketplace in Anchorage right now for $20-40. There will most likely still be some in February, but if you want someone in Anchorage to buy one and hold it for you until your trip, let me know. I'd be happy to buy one so that you don't have to worry, and would trust you to pay when you arrive and pick it up.

993,jesse_clifton,"Anchorage is like any other moderately sized city.  There's every amenity you could want or need. Good hospitals, an international airport that will easily connect you to anywhere on the planet, shopping, decent schools, etc.  There's an abundance of outdoor activities literally right outside your door, and certainly within an hours drive you'll be in the middle of nowhere.  There's crime, like everywhere else, but exercise a little diligence and situational awareness and you'll likely never have a problem.  Anchorage weather is a series of freeze, snow, thaw cycles that can drive you crazy.  Unlike Fairbanks which usually stays cold enough to break up the ice/snow on the roads, Anchorage is often a skating rink.  Four wheel drive in those conditions is not your friend. At the end of the day Anchorage is really is just another city... albeit one at the end of the world.  Alaska is a good place to call home, but not necessarily an easy or inexpensive place.  If you value nature and enjoy outdoor activities, or are into hunting and fishing, it's heaven.  If your idea of a great weekend is sun up to sun down shopping, you'll be less than thrilled. 

Lots of places have long, cold, dark winters so that's not so unique.  You need to be prepared for breakdowns both in your car and system failures in your home.  Even less than north slope extreme cold can be deadly and you need to be prepared to endure it should something happen.  Have heavy winter gear, food, comms, etc. handy at home and in your cars. If you own a home there are winter prep items, but it's really just routine seasonal maintenance.  The one thing a lot of people aren't able to grasp before arrival is how isolated Anchorage, and Alaska in general is.  There's one road in/out and it's a \*long\* road with few services (esp off season), or Alaska Airlines. The east coast is a very long multi-connections flight and an even longer drive.",1578029672,fcwmbsi

route...

\- Once you get north of Regina (or say Calgary) there are basically two routes: the ALCAN and the Cassier. The ALCAN is less scenic; but has more resources. In the summer I prefer the Cassier. 

\- gasoline should be no problem.  I choose to stop and fill frequently. If I've driven over two hours or 100 miles since my last fill-up, I stop at the next gas station I see. It's good to stretch your legs, etc. 

\- keep fresh water, protein bars and toilet paper in your car. You never know when you might come upon an accident/delay that could keep you stopped for many hours.

border(s)...

\- you need passports and vet documents for any pets.

1511,Peliquin,"Nice website! Thank you for reaching out here.

So, here's the deal, I am in no rush at all, I'm looking for the RIGHT home (not perfect, just right.) If it doesn't show up, I don't want to buy -- I think this is why I might be a crappy client for a lot of realtors. Therefore, what I'd like is to be a back-burner project for someone. As in, if you think of me when seeing a home, reach out to me, but don't try to match me to a house, if that makes sense.

I'm looking for a smaller home (800 sq ft would probably be perfect), with a garage (single car okay, I only have one) that has decent wall thickness, and good, tight bones. Plumbing isn't required (and may not be preferable), but I must have internet for my work. I also need an area I can fence, as I always have a dog. I'd prefer to have a minimum of work to do to make it cozy and comfortable -- I don't really want to spend my weekends replacing drywall and flooring, or fixing doors. Been there, done that, and it's not my happy place. Painting is fine, as is basic stuff, I just don't want to live at the Home Depot, you know?

I don't have kids, and don't need to be in a good school system, but I do want okay neighbors. My current neighbors are porch pirates and I spend too much time wishing they'd move away.  

If I was dreaming, what would make me happiest would be a small home/hangar combo (hangar for 25ftx35ft plane) with enough room to garden and sometimes throw up a glampy tent for out of town visitors. But I really, really, really doubt that is within my budget, which tops out at 125k, and even that's a bit of push. I'm going to be happy with less. But one should dream!

If it sounds like a fun back burner project, let me know! IF it doesn't -- no worries.",1578377147,fdg22bj

Both have their advantages for sure (I live here and have done both) but that also is seasonally dependent. You‚Äôll no doubt love it no matter how you come up and see it, but summer is likely to give you a much more enjoyable road-trip experience. :) 

Aside from seeing the northern light, there aren‚Äôt a lot of advantages to doing a winter road trip here, IMO. I‚Äôd plan for summer, drive up the Cassiar, drive down to Valdez, catch a ferry or drive over to Whittier/Seward, then head north through the Mat-Su (stopping at Hatchers Pass) and on north to Denali.

The Kenai Peninsula is gorgeous as well, but that‚Äôd take you south instead of toward Denali (if that matters to you). If you opt to go south, Homer is where the land ends and it‚Äôs about as spectacular as you could hope for!

Regardless though, I‚Äôd say your time on a road trip would be best spent in south central AK. There‚Äôs a LOT of gorgeous land to see ( south east AK especially) but in terms of being road-bound, south central is your best bet.

/S, in case you didn't notice it.

In any kind of non-FPTP system, you'll realize your neighbors don't have binary positions on things. You'll also realize the world is a lot more grey/purple/whatever than you might have thought. Most of the US coasts are only dominated by ""liberals"" because of FPTP, and most of rural America is only dominated by the ""reds"" because of FPTP. The reality is that few places ever really see 60+% support for any one politician. In fact, looking at proportional systems, a politician is lucky to get much more than 40%, if even 25%, support.

The phrase ""Majority winner elections‚Äù could have a lot of meanings. 

‚ÄúRanked choice voting‚Äù however is pretty much universally accepted as a better way to vote once people learn what the heck it actually is.

Your challenge in a campaign like this is not going to be to rally a base voting block, but to instead educate voters and non voters from all sides on a somthing they will probably vote for if only they know what it actually is.

Education is probably the way to fight the misinformation that is going to be thrown against a grassroots campaign like this.

As you are looking through this thread your probably already seeing the misinformation people are already making in their own heads just based on the choice of words in the graphic. Be honest, be specific, tell people exactly what you want to change and why, Avoid ‚Äúbuzzwords‚Äù where possible as they can be attacked the easiest. Educate instead of berate and you will stand like a shining beacon in the current  ‚Äúextreme partisan‚Äù climate. 

Just a few of my thoughts:) hope the campaigns going well",1578412647,fdh0eyx

That's not how hotels work.  Their rental day is (usually) midday to midday.  If you're arriving at 4 A.M. on Thursday morning, you need a reservation for Wednesday night.

""you still have to be out by checkout time"" because they need to change out rooms for the next renters, there aren't many cleaning people, and so they need time (checkout to checkin) to get the turnover cleaned.

You should talk to the hotel well in advance about your plans.

1652,k8faust,"I‚Äôm no expert, but‚Äîbased on my experience‚Äîyou can get some plastic sheeting to plaster over windows. That should help insulate those areas a bit better. Try and place them so that there‚Äôs a gap between the sheet and the glass. You can further insulate by hanging blankets over that. 

If there are hallways or other spaces that can be isolated by hanging curtains or blankets, that might help to partition the cold.

When it got stupid cold a few years back (-20F, I think?) I had to roll up some towels and use them to bolster the seals around the front door because the cold was seeping in between the door and the frame. That same year, I practically lived in my insulated overalls.

Heated blankets are a handy comfort to have in colder years too. You can also maybe let your hot showers vent into the house, which will also help introduce some humidity. Cooking, baking, and boiling anything at the stove will help too, but I wouldn‚Äôt suggest doing this just for the sake of heating your home.

Of course, don‚Äôt forget that you should be doubling up on your layers of clothing in the colder months. Double your socks and your pants! And remember, your neck and stomach are major circulation points, so extra warmth in those two areas go a long way to keep you running warm.

Lastly, it probably wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to at least get a thermometer and/or a infrared thermometer. The infrared can help you pinpoint where the cold is really coming from, and it‚Äôs always a handy thing to have anyhow.",1578436583,fdi6h2e

1715,Alaskans4ABE,"Below is a breakdown for you. The all caps text is what will be seen on the ballot. Hopefully the format is easy to follow.

&gt;PROHIBIT THE USE OF DARK MONEY BY INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE GROUPS WORKING TO INFLUENCE CANDIDATE ELECTIONS IN ALASKA AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES BY THESE GROUPS;

* This section is the part that gets rid of dark money (secret money) in Alaska. A good explanation of dark money is here: [https://www.opensecrets.org/dark-money](https://www.opensecrets.org/dark-money). A group like us currently has no legal requirement to disclose where they receive funding. However since we are fighting to end dark money we follow our own rules. Who funds us can be found on Facebook, our website, and APOC reports with the state.

&gt;ESTABLISH A NONPARTISAN AND OPEN TOP FOUR PRIMARY ELECTION SYSTEM;

* This one is pretty self expiatory. The long version is that with the establishment of the non-partisan primary there would no longer be a democrat or republican primary. It would all be the same.

&gt;CHANGE APPOINTMENT PROCEDURES FOR CERTAIN ELECTION BOARDS AND WATCHERS AND THE ALASKA PUBLIC OFFICES COMMISSION;

* This section has to do with who can be on these boards. The rules would be changed so it includes groups instead of just parties since we would have a non-partisan open primary. 

&gt;ESTABLISH A RANKED-CHOICE GENERAL ELECTION SYSTEM;

* This one is pretty obvious. More choice, no spoilers, most support.

&gt;SUPPORT AN AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW CITIZENS TO REGULATE MONEY IN ELECTIONS;

* This is just a way for Alaskans to say they want dark money out of all politics.

&gt;REPEAL SPECIAL RUNOFF ELECTIONS;

* We don't need runoff elections with ranked voting aka instant runoff voting.

&gt;REQUIRE CERTAIN NOTICES IN ELECTION PAMPHLETS AND POLLING PLACES;

* This is tied to the non-partisan primary. Since there would be no partisan primary there would be no candidate that is THE party candidate. The notice would make sure the voters know this. It however doesn't stop a party from endorsing a candidate.

&gt;AND AMEND THE DEFINITION OF POLITICAL PARTY.

* This is to make everything flow with the above.

The initiative [text](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d1ad3752a28990001655b00/t/5d1c506e7f15390001ccc38c/1562136686930/INITIATIVE+FINAL+TEXT.pdf) is written in legislative format. To make it easer to read this is how it works:

**This means it is new language**

\[THIS MEANS IT WILL BE REMOVED\]

Now that you have a key to legislative format it should be easier to understand.

BP knows from the gulf (which they weren't required to pay actual cost of) that it can ruin a company's finances and reputation. (Not that Texas City wasn't a big enough black eye for the company)

Don't believe me? Exxon during the Valdez spill took a loan from JPMorgan for an amount exceeding their total  assets just to clean up the bay. (This would give birth the first credit default swap, and later to synthetic Credit default swaps, which took the world  economy down in 2007-2008)

Literally when I think about where we‚Äôll most likely be in 50 years sends me into an existential panic and depression. It sounds bad but I just try not to think about it and just try to be as green as I can, always recycling, only buying from companies that actually give a shit (Patagonia is awesome at this), hunting and fishing for non endangered species and when I do fish or hunt I always try to use every last bit of the animal so as not to waste and also cut back a ton on beef. 

When I think of a green community I don‚Äôt really think of Alaska but I don‚Äôt wanna judge and say this state is bad at being green or anything but I‚Äôm sure they could use some help up here, shit most places need help with it even parts of Oregon.

2. In my time practicing law in Alaska, I have seen a handful of crimes directed against transgender people, but I don't think I've seen or heard of *any* that were motivated or caused by the victim's gender identity. So I really don't think that's something to be particularly worried about. 

3.

2376,EiusdemGeneris,"No, the case would almost certainly proceed in state court: the prosecution just wouldn't assert the hate crime aggravating factor.

In Alaska, a person convicted of most felony offenses faces a presumptive sentencing range based on the crime of conviction and how many prior felony offenses they have. If the hate crime motive is established, the judge is authorized (but not required) to impose a sentence above the high end of the presumptive range. As you probably know, under *[Apprendi v. New Jersey](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep530/usrep530466/usrep530466.pdf)*, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) and *Blakely v. Washington[Blakely v. Washington](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep542/usrep542296/usrep542296.pdf)*, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), that factor had to be proven to  jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order to allow the imposition of an aggravated sentence.

That certainly sounds like the kind of thing a law professor would say. But considering how these laws get enacted, I'd say they're close to useless in terms of predicting cultural tolerance in a given community today.

At any rate, Alaska may be a deep-red state, but that conservatism definitely tends to manifest (even in socially conservative people) in much more of a libertian-ish do-your-own-thing-if-you're-not-hurting-anyone ethos than the kind of thing you'd see in similarly red places in (for example) the Deep South.

I try to maintain a veneer of anonymity, so I'll say that I practice criminal law.

Like most of the rest of the country, Alaska started passing tough on crime legislation in the 90s and early 2000s that successfully drove down our crime rates. (Except for sex crimes, we didn't end up being especially tough compared the rest of the country, but we also started out being extremely lenient.) About six years ago, our politicians and judges started buying into the ""criminal justice reform"" movement that was picking up steam, and began reversing course through legislation and policy changes: this culminated in the passage of the most sweeping criminal justice reform bill in the country in 2016. Unsurprisingly, when we started letting more criminals out of jail more quickly, they started committing more crimes. Most of the worst legislation was repealed last year (although we're still not back to where we started), but we're still dealing with the fallout, and will for a while under any scenario. And unfortunately, our governor and the people he's appointed don't seem to be very competent, so I'm not sure how effective their response is likely to be.",1578857877,fe4cknv

I also wouldn't use ""bruh"" and ""lads"" based off the little I know of the characters. Finally, ""Pops"" feels really outdated, but isn't necessarily wrong.

When ""the jets"" (Alaska Airlines) stop in Sitka a couple times per day, continuing passengers will get off the plane, buy pies, and take them back to the airplane and on home to Juneau or Ketchikan.  

The life in Sitka is focussed on the sea -- fishing, recreation, cruise ship tourism, kayaking, etc.  There is a famous Alaska Native boarding school there too, and Alaska Natives are prominent in the community.  The Coast Guard is a major employer and does many rescues.

2450,Hayek_Hiker,"Sitka is very seasonal, with maybe 50% more people there in the summer for fishing, cannery and tourism jobs than in the winter.   Some rich people live there, but mostly just for the summer, and they might live in a home only reachable by boat.  Some are on tiny islands just offshore.

I know some uber rich people like Bill Gates come to Sitka to fish,  but unless they arrived in a huge yacht (a few do) you would never spot them.  Everybody wears a light raincoat and dresses Alaska casual.  The poor/homeless are more often Alaska Natives than not. There are a lot of Filipinos and Hispanics there too.

The Alaska Native story is very interesting, and their story is much  different than American Indians, but you need to get it right or else you will be harshly criticized.  Either do a lot of research or don't go very deep in your writing about it.

fly to anchorage, take the train to whittier, maybe linger and go to the wildlife refuge (girdwood) and get photo with bear, moose, porcupine. then go on a glacier viewing boat tour. dont spend any time on the shore whittier is boring. train to seward, walk around, go to sea life center. maybe stay the night in an air bnb in millers landing. cabs are 5 bucks anywhere in town. walk around and see exit glacier if you arent burned out on glaciers. 

train back to anchorage, walk around downtown, get a reindeer hotdog. get back on the train to denali national park. maybe take a long ass bus ride into the park. or hang out and do the touristy things there at the resort. 

you can go to fairbanks after denali, but the experience is meh for tourists. and its hot in the summer and theres a good chance there will be smoke from the yearly forest fires. i would recommend heading back to anchorage after denali. 

extra credit, your flight back could be through juneau/sitka with a layover in one of those towns. DO IT if you have the money. rental car is a must. whale watching/fishing trip highly recommended. the tourist infrastructure there is built up with stuff tourists wanna do. 

its alaska, but geographically different. think more new zealand look. 

june/july the prices triple for hotels/tourist stuff.  so go in may or august. 

extra extra credit, try to get a night at the orca island glamping spot in seward on a private island./fox island tour out of whittier on a private island/helicopter to sled dog ride on a glacier out of either girdwood or the knik river lodge.",1578907972,fe6z62i

My mom has mobility issues, she came to visit me for a week and we had a really good time doing low impact things. 

Highlights:
* Take the train from Anchorage to Seward then take a day cruise to check out glaciers and wildlife. Spend the night in Seward and walk around the town a little bit, go to the Sealife Center (closest thing to an Aquarium we have) then take the train back to Anchorage. 

* Drive from Anchorage to Girdwood (~45min). Hop on the tram to the top of the mountain at Alyeska and enjoy lunch with a view. While you're down there, you can also check out the Wildlife Conservation Center and/or the Begich Boggs Visitor Center near Portage Glacier.

* My mom absolutely loved going to the Reindeer Farm in Palmer. It's basically a petting zoo, but with reindeer. 

* The Anchorage Museum and the Alaska Native Heritage Center (both in Anchorage) are both great if she's into museums.

* You can drive or take the train up to Denali Park. Once there, you can take a bus into the park and the tour guide will narrate along the way. You'll stop a few times to stretch your legs, but no strenuous activity required.",1578942152,fe9wr5z

2583,Main-Hornet,"A fictional Sitka was already the setting for a very famous book, The Yiddish Policemen's Union. Michael Chabon did his research, though, and the fictional Sitka he used had many real life landmarks and his large Sitka airport still had a pie shop. Any fictional book set in Sitka is going to draw a comparison and you, no offense (offence) are no Chabon. 

Seems completely unrealistic that a pregnant 19 year old can afford to live on her own in Sitka. Rent and childcare (if she can find it) will run her +$2,000/month. She would be staying with dad and asking if he could sit for her while she goes to work. Dad just got out of jail and Alaska has a 6% unemployment rate so he's not going back to work anytime soon. Also, does she have health insurance? Is she a high risk pregnancy? SEARHC provides OB care but high risk patients are going to give birth at Bartlett in Juneau, ANMC in Anchorage or in Seattle. Also, your descriptions of pregnancy seem very cliche... I groaned out loud when I read about the ice cream craving. Also seems like the main character (me apparently?) is going to be Sarah Connor. I'm sure you're not intentionally rewriting Terminator but... it, um, seems like it? 

Sitka doesn't have breakup, it's in a rainforest. Also it would be relatively warm if it were breakup. So the complaining about the cold doesn't make sense. Anyway, it seems like you're unclear about what breakup even is. Perhaps that's an English idiom that means something different?

The geographic references seem like you're just randomly looking at a map or something. Seem really artificial. Also, seems weird that you don't mention Mt. Edgecumbe?

No one in Sitka has an English accent. The characters sound like they're from Skins. Was waiting for one to greet another saying ""You okay, mate?"" See also, all the metric and all the extra u's. I'd give a concrete example but every piece spoken word is wrong and not how people would talk. 

Sitka relies on planes and ferries for groceries, so any massive interruption like this, especially one that turns off all outside contact, would cause massive, immediate panic. Jules sounds like a moron as you would need to ""flood"" (not a word an American would use) the supermarket or you're going to die of starvation. Does Jules have a bunch of fish or deer saved up? Does s/he have a gun? No one in Sitka has a gas heater. There's no natural gas. Also, it would be called propane. They'd have an electric space heater or an [oil heater](https://www.ruralenergy.com/heating-equipment/oil/toyotomi-toyostove/var-l730-toyotomi-toyostove-laser-730).

If you want a gyro with a specific cut of a specific meat, you need to ask if they serve that. Most places do not. Meraki offers the ""traditional ground lamb beef mixture"".

2677,NotAnotherFNG,"&gt; I guess in this situation it's easier to ask for forgiveness than beg for permission.

I don't know what code enforcement is like in Fairbanks, but this can be a really bad philosophy when it comes to dealing with them.  Their fines usually go retroactive to the date of the violation, not the date of discovery.  Depending on how long it takes you to get caught you may owe interest of more than the original fine was.

You also don't want to be asking forgiveness from the environmental folks.  Once they start writing citations you're screwed and have little to no recourse.  They write the regulations they enforce and then interpret them or reinterpret them to their advantage, they have deep pockets for lawyers, and courts usually defer to them because they assume they know what they're talking about, if you can get a court to hear our case to begin with.  Pleading ignorance and forgiveness with the EPA is a good way to lose your home.

Let me ask you a few questions though. You don't have to answer them, just consider them. Or answer them, it matters not. These are just some things that I've asked myself in the past when considering my options for self defense as a small individual with no experience in fighting.

Can you fight? Are you physically intimidating? Are you proficient with a knife enough to not be overpowered by someone and disarmed? What if they have a gun? Could you actually stab someone? Repeatedly if necessary? Do you think that simply the presence of a knife will deter the threat?

For me, every one of those answers is no, save for ""do they have a gun"" which is honestly yes more times than not. It's not difficult to get a gun as a criminal, and in Alaska as well as my home state of Texas, guns are incredibly prevalent.

Also, what are you gonna do? Stab a bear?

Also suggest skipping Palmer Hay Flats. Reflection Lake is an OK place to stop and walk your dog but not too interesting for tourists. 

Depending on snowpack there might not be good hiking in Seward in March. Then again there might be. Harding Icefield will also require a long trek down a closed road that time of year just to start the hike. 

I also think a 7 hour drive just to Chena hot springs isn't worth it but that's up to you. I think people have more fun in Alaska if they shrink their itineraries to reduce driving time and add more activity time. For instance you could do a wildlife cruise (not sure what's open in March, but check) out of Seward and that would be more fun than 7 hours in a car and a half day in an airport just to go to Chena. 

If you do want to head up north maybe get in touch with MacLaren lodge and see if you could do a trip in there.

- You don't have enough time slotted for Coldfoot, and you may be underestimating the difficulty of the drive. Even in perfect summer conditions, 6hrs from (I assume) Fairbanks is very tight, hardly doable.
- Hatcher's Pass and Exit Glacier will be unaccessible by road, and if you decide to hike in, you'll be facing true mountaineering conditions in March.
- Maybe consider dropping some of your current itinerary in South Central that involves winter hiking, and drive to Homer?  Could be a very beautiful stop, and if you have the funds halibut fishing can make for a great day trip.
- Keep the nights open for potential aurora viewing, even when you're down by Anchorage - March is a good month for aurora, and you can't control for conditions.

When I first went to Alaska, it was three of us guys in our early 20's, driving Homer to Deadhorse in a loop. The trip was packed, but totally incredible - I look at your schedule, and I think you've got the right energy here.  But, March is still very much winter in Alaska - you've picked a tough time to try to be so mobile.

I've car-camped the Alcan 3 times from northern WA and it's totally doable and enjoyable, but you'll want to prepare a few things to make the trip more comfortable. It isn't like it's Mad Max Fury Road out there, but it is a week long trip that you'll be living on the road. 

First off, buy a Milepost. It's worth it, trust me, just buy it. Cell service is in and out in big stretches of this drive and it's amazing to have the detailed maps and info in paper right at your fingertips. 

Gas will cost at least $600 maybe $700 for the trip alone. Buy a cooler and fill it with snacks/drinks in your town grocery store before leaving. This is really convenient and will ultimately save money since you won't need to pay premium gas station prices for the same items. Camp sites are generally around $12 Canadian if you want to sleep in your car or have a tent.  You can save some money by parking in lots at places like Walmart. (Though I don't know Canadian law regarding this.) 

You can stay in hotels, but it'll cost significantly more and will cut into whatever profits you hope to make with this car. However it is nice to sleep in a real bed and get a hot shower every few nights. 

Get some Canadian cash exchanged at your bank just incase. Most places along the Alcan accept cards, but it's better to have options.  

And obviously,  get the car checked out top to bottom before you leave.  There are some stretches of the drive you really dont want to be broken down on. Check your spare tire and make sure it's aired up properly. Stock your car with everything you'd think you would need for a week away from home. 

Lastly,  enjoy the drive and happy trails!",1579164077,fejafb3

Seeing as they have found a new food source that is not dependant on climate; and the fact that Kodiak has had below average temperatures this winter. It would stand to reason that the food source would be the more likely culprit in this case, as the original article suggest.

That being said the island residents moved to roll carts only a few years ago(5ish) before that they were using bear proof dumpsters, not sure why they made the change to roll carts but it sounds like they will be changing back this summer. Bears can smell garbage from 20+miles away, I live in Anchorage and frequently have bears visit my neighborhood whenever a neighbor puts their garbage out early.

I just slipped under the door, dropped the trash, and watched it for a few seconds. It was a female and seemed content just watching me and munching on the bush, so I slapped the close button and walked very quickly back towards it and in the front door.

&gt; ""Moose are generally not aggressive animals, but they are incredibly dangerous when provoked. As a rule, never approach a moose. Bull moose may take any movement toward them as aggression and charge you. Female moose will not hesitate to engage you if she thinks you‚Äôre threatening her young. The rule of thumb here is to avoid moose if you encounter them, by skirting out of their line of site and staying in vehicles or inside the house. """,1579290578,fentgn5

I've read a second shop in Bethel is pending, and hopefully they can get through the red tape as well this year.

It's frustrating when prohibitionists portray this issue as a struggle to keep cannabis out of their communities.  Cannabis is already in our communities.  The issue is whether we allow the black market to dictate conditions, or if we assume control and try to create a regulated market.

I support recreational retail regulation of cannabis for 21+, not because I think it's harmless; I don't.  It's a drug. But I think it's less harmful than alcohol, and I think the decision to use should be a personal one, not one reserved by the state.

I think regulating cannabis and making it available to adults will have a net positive effect on society.  For one thing, it mellows out people who need to be mellowed out.  When people with a predisposition for violence get drunk, they yell, break things, hit people and drive around and get in accidents.

3240,denmermr,"Our budget did not mysteriously balloon because of $100 oil. Our budget has evolved to do the things we need to do as a state: courts and law enforcement sufficient for our population and laws, infrastructure and maintenance, taking care of our fish and wildlife resources, educating our growing population, etc. When we last had $100 oil capital budgets ballooned and addressed a ton of deferred maintenance from the last time oil crashed in the early 2000‚Äôs. 

Walker did not offer a scalpel to state budgets. At one point he was facing an 80% budget deficit (spending &gt;$5b and income ~$1b). He proposed, as one rationally should, significant spending cuts (about 20%), new revenue based in the whole economy (instead of just one industry), and a modest use of savings until things stabilized. 

The GOP legislature decided that the cuts were ok, that an 80% deficit did not warrant new revenue, and that it was better to blow through ~$14b than to address our structural revenue problem. 

The world we don‚Äôt live in any more is not some mystical world of profligate spending. The world we don‚Äôt live in any more is a world completely devoid of personal taxes. Our state leaders need to face that reality before all our savings, even the permanent fund, are gone.",1579373865,fetcd29

3263,TheNerdChaplain,"You can drive from Anchorage to Valdez in about six or seven hours, and stop anywhere you like along the way.  I've done that drive many times; here's a few places that could work.

* Eklutna Lake, which is surrounded by mountains.

* Palmer Hay Flats is surrounded by three mountain ranges, you can pull off at the Knik River access point and do it.

* Hatcher Pass isn't actually on the Glenn (it's outside Wasilla) but it is actually in the mountains, and is very scenic.  There's an old mine there, and lots of places to hike.

* If you continue up the Glenn past Palmer, there's a few pulloffs that overlook the Matanuska River, and even the Matanuska Glacier with mountain ranges down both sides.

* Sheep Mountain Lodge and further on, Eureka Lodge are both beautiful places to stop.  Sheep Mountain Lodge has a bit of a fancier restaurant in it, and Eureka Lodge is just a roadhouse diner type place.

* There's not as much from Eureka Lodge till you get to Glennallen, where the Glenn Highway ends in a junction with the Richardson.  You'll want to stop and get gas there and stretch your legs.  From Anchorage to Glennallen is about four hours.

* Turn right onto the Richardson Highway towards Valdez.  Maybe a mile or two down the road is Simpson Hill and the overlook on the left.  The overlook looks out over the Copper River Valley with Mount Sanford, Drum, Wrangell, and Blackburn in the distance.  My folks thought about getting married there back in the day, but it is often quite windy.

* You'll see many more spots along the way down the Richardson, but the two absolute best spots are only about five minutes apart, and you can't hardly miss them.  The first spot is Worthington Glacier at Thompson Pass; you'll see it from about half a mile away coming down the side of a mountain, splitting around a rock formation.  There's a little pulloff with bathrooms and informational signs, and if you have decent hiking boots that are water resistant, you can walk up to the glacier itself.

* The second spot is just a little further on, through the other side of the pass.  It's the campground at Blueberry Lake.  You're eye level with mountain ranges and glaciers across the valley.  You can see where glaciers carved the landscapes during the last ice age.  It's truly incredible.

* As you continue down the road out of Thompson Pass, you'll go through Keystone Canyon, which is a deep canyon featuring two waterfalls, Bridal Veil and Horsetail Falls.  Valdez and Prince William Sound are only about twenty minutes away. 

I don't know the drive down the Seward quite as well; Girdwood and Portage are extremely scenic (and there's a great wildlife refuge place you can see animals at).  I'm sure other posters will be able to give you more details about scenic spots down on the Kenai Peninsula.  But I think Blueberry Lake is best.  Do be aware if you're coming in summer, that road construction can add an hour or two to any drive.",1579386512,feuh1uu

A bittersweet story that makes me smile: about 5 years ago I was taking a ferry ti Prince of Wales Island from Ketchikan in the summer. There was an older woman on board who had never been to Alaska. I got to talking to her and she told me her late husband had always wanted to visit Alaska and see humpback whales. She had decided to spread his ashes with the whales. During our ferry ride off in the distance we saw spouts. Two days later I saw her in the town of Craig. She told me that that morning she had chartered a boat to take her to find the whales and indeed they found a group frolicking and playing. As they watched a young whale breach over and over only 3 or 4 hundred feet from the boat she poured his ashes into the sea. He finally got to see them.",1579388014,feumuyt

In the cabin with his head in the bucket. Not sure if you have fished for halibut before but they are like dead weight on your line. We did catch some interesting other fish out on the open water (small sharks and stuff). Personally, I enjoyed salmon fishing much more. There is an abundance of wildlife to be seen (bald eagles, moose, seals, and maybe even bear) along the rivers. The salmon fight great and you can take them to a processor who will swap them out, pound for pound, for freshly caught smoked salmon. They will package it and ship it home for you. It was, by far, the best fish I have ever eaten. We caught out limit every day whether salmon or halibut fishing, but I found the halibut fishing to be a bit boring. I much more enjoyed that challenges of freeling in big salmon, watching nature pass by as we floated down the river. Whichever you choose, being with your dad is the ultimate reward.

It was late August and early September. The day we were in the inlet it was very windy and choppy, probably like 3-4 feet. I honestly can't recall what the processing and shipping fees were. They will freeze and pack the smoked fish, or raw fish, and send it so that it will arrive after you get home upon your request. Like I said, we caught our limit every time we went out. It was an amazing trip. I'm not sure how the seasons run up there, so you might be able to fish for some King Salmon. I can't wait to get back up there again. If you schedule a float trip with one of the guides, they are generally great and will give you any advice you need about processing or whatever. Make sure you take a camera in case you come across any interesting wildlife.

From Anchorage, take the train to Denali and take a bus tour. Stay a day or two. 

Catch the next train up to Fairbanks and take the shuttle from the train station to Chena. Stay another day or two and do their northern lights tour where they take you up the mountain at night (keep in mind you aren't guaranteed to see the lights, they're dependent on a lot of factors).

Take the shuttle from Chena to the airport and fly back to Anchorage. Spend a couple days in Anchorage.

Rent a car and drive down to Seward. Visit the sea life center and walk around, it's a smaller town but one of my favorite to visit. 

Drive back up to Anchorage and visit the wildlife conservation center near Girdwood, you can even drive through it if you don't wanna get out of the car. Return to Anchorage, fly home.

The drawback to this is that you'd have to do it in the first week or two of September for everything to still be running, so you become a lot more limited if your trip is at the tail end of the month. Have fun! I love our state :)",1579585639,ff5awyi

However, you will need a rental car (or, my preference, a Motorhome) to get there from the Anchorage airport or where ever you‚Äôre coming in from. 

Also, watch what time of year you go. Many shops are only open from Memorial Day through Labor Day due to the weather there and some tours and fishing charters may be affected by seasons. You‚Äôll also need a visitors fishing license and a local charter company there can give you more information on how to obtain one. 

I hope this isn‚Äôt out of line to ask, but wildfires caused a huge drop in tourism last year and almost put several of the local shops on the spit out of business. Many Alaskans in the area banded together to try to keep them afloat, but if your parents are able to, buying their souvenirs from those small business could go a long way in helping them bounce back from last summer.

I wonder if it has something to do with any or all of the following:

-Travel becoming more affordable for those wishing to experience Alaska so it's appeal is increasing. Tourism is still a huge industry in AK and its growing so the value of the houses could increase over the coming decade.

-Alaska-hype is still a real thing for people wanting to live somewhere ""different"" but still inside the country.

-AirBnB still allowing home owners to make money off the houses they still have on the market, perhaps even profit. (Though, I dont know  the stipulations of AirBnB or real estate for sale being used as a rental.)

-Real Estate agencies may be seeing an increase of very wealthy people purchasing 2nd or vacation homes in AK so they cater their home values towards that type of buyer?

-The market really does have the demand to justify the price of supply. I know it's not a perfect comparison,  but the price for just a rental in the tiny town I live in has exploded over the last 5 years simply because more and more people are chasing a lifestyle that is less hectic and ""connected"" than where they came from.

Between 1897 and 1898, Skagway was a lawless town, described by one member of the North-West Mounted Police as ""little better than a hell on earth."" Fights, prostitutes and liquor were ever-present on Skagway's streets, and con man ""Soapy"" Smith, who had risen to considerable power, did little to stop it. Smith was a sophisticated swindler who liked to think of himself as a kind and generous benefactor to the needy. He was gracious to some, giving money to widows and halting lynchings, while simultaneously operating a ring of thieves who swindled prospectors with cards, dice, and the shell game. His telegraph office charged five dollars to send a message anywhere in the world. Consequently, unknowing prospectors sent news to their families back home without realizing there was no telegraph service to or from Skagway until 1901.[13] Smith also controlled a comprehensive spy network, a private militia called the Skaguay Military Company, the town newspaper, the Deputy U.S. Marshal's office and an array of thieves and con-men who roamed about the town. Smith was shot and killed by Frank Reid and Jesse Murphy on July 8, 1898, in the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf. Smith managed to return fire ‚Äî some accounts claim the two men fired their weapons simultaneously ‚Äî and Frank Reid died from his wounds twelve days later. Jesse Murphy is accredited as the man responsible for killing Smith.[14]

Smith and Reid are now interred at the Klondike Gold Rush Cemetery, also known as ""Skagway's Boot Hill.""

Rent for a 1 bed is about $1600 a month and the apartments are usually in pretty poor shape and utilities are not typically included. I (by ‚Äú I‚Äù I mean my three roommates and I) pay $2200 for my mortgage currently. I pay about $400/month in utilities. Diesel for the toyostoves is roughly $400/month if we fill it ourselves, otherwise we‚Äôre looking at $600 with the fees from the delivery company. Internet packages charge by the gig, I used to pay $250 for 100 gigs but we upgraded to unlimited when the fancy fiber optic cables started working last year  and now we pay $450/month and it works 60% of the time. Just to have a roof and the internet, we pay about $3500/month for a pretty small house. That‚Äôs not including the hundreds of dollars I spend every week at the grocery store just to feed myself and my husband. 

Gas is like $4 something a gallon if you have a vehicle, if not, it‚Äôll cost you at least $5000 to fly a car or truck up as we are not in the road system.

3702,frostyLesbian,"Born and raised in Alaska, I moved out to Michigan a little over a year ago, here's my take.

In my experience: because it's cold and everything is so far apart.

Winter proofing your car and all that entails (working heat, snow tires, sometimes chains, stuff to clean the snow off etc.)  
Keeping your house warm (whether it be woodstove or gas) can take up a LOT of your time and/or money. Back when I lived in AK my dad used to spend a good chunk of the summer outside cutting up wood to have for the winter so we spent less on gas.  
Not to mention the inevitable cost you'll put into dealing with all the fucking snow you get in the wintertime. And shit can get down to -60F in the interior, you'll want to be as safe with that as you can. Winter can last a long fuckin time in AK.

Then there's the matter of everything being so fuckin far away from everything else--so you pay more for gas when you're travelling and youre using up more of it for heat etc. especially when you're starting it up 20 minutes before you leave home because you don't want to get into the car when it's fucking frozen.  
And then stores charge more for their products because the trucks have to come a long ass way because (see above): everything is so fucking far away from everything else, gas, heat, etc. etc. etc.   
Everything has to get up there somehow y'know?

And with the internet-- I lived in a tiny ass town an hour out of Fairbanks called Delta Junction and in order to get any decent internet we were in the unfortunate spot where we'd have to shell out at least a thousand dollars to get a proper satellite so we'd get actual fast speeds instead of the glorified hot-spot we were using. That's just my experience there.

Not to mention a lot of common services you have in the 48s dont exist in AK and for the exact same reasons i've been repeating this whole time. It's cold. Everything is so fuckin far apart.

tl;dr: its goddamn cold n everythings far apart and sometimes your life and wallet revolve around that.

&gt; The US 2020 census has officially begun in Toksook Bay, a remote fishing village on the coast of Alaska.

&gt; Steven Dillingham, head of the US Census Bureau, has kicked off the count with a ceremonial visit to a tribal elder, Lizzie Chimiugak Nenguryarr, 90.

&gt; Mr Dillingham told Reuters news agency that the kickoff wasn&amp;#039;t just about counting the residents of one village - it was also about drawing the attention of the rest of the US. &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s the first time the word is really getting across the nation that the 2020 census is here,&amp;quot; he said.

The housing market in the Kenai/Soldotna area will be more influenced by oil and gas prices, which can be volatile. If things really shit the bed in the petroleum industry, this area will likely be hit hardest.

Seward and Homer are more tourist/fishing towns. Tourism in general has been developing strongly and isn't likely to slow down soon.

3776,greenspath,"Our nation is young. Many of its rules are not codified. Often, individuals behave according to accepted practices rather than precedent or written law. When an act is novel (new) and controversial, it calls these accepted norms into question. When the norm is an interpretation of the Constitution, we call the controversy a Constitutional crisis. 

IIRC, the U.S. federal government had never refused military aid to a state or territory under threat of invasion. In fact, manufactured threat of even vaguely American soil has been justification for war powers. 

If a politician acted in your hypothetical, in the absence of previous similar action were cannot be sure. Even in one, depending on the interpretation of that body politic, comparison to history, and crisis management, we can never be positive what might occur.

3801,HeatherFuta,"And Mueller agreed with that principle of not arresting a sitting president, and Barr obviously agrees. So that Nixon era opinion is now gossip at the Justice department. It‚Äôs basically the first thing Mueller says in his report.

The Alaska National Guard can be mobilized by the feds, and I'm not sure about the logistics of it, but I feel like quite a few would go AWOL and remain in Alaska in your hypothetical. Heck, some non-Alaska Guard military personnel would probably go AWOL too.

Then our three political reps will raise a stink. Do you see all the other reps ignoring them? Russian bases in Syria isn't a US State, no matter how young. At that point, we may as well imagine Mexico invading Texas. What do you think would happen if Mexico paid Trump a few billion to take over Texas?

Lots of very large companies operating here will be pissed.

Then along that Highway you build houses. Someone will need to protect and serve those Alaskans living along there. So they will need to build a police station. We can start to build giant groups of homes and creating new towns. Those new towns will have local and state police posts. 

Boom. We got police and emergency services across the entire state. Anchorage has now become the 2nd largest city in Alaska as the town of Balto as a population of 512,000. They finally build a Panera Bread in Alaska.

4038,MarriedEngineer,"&gt; Because it's a federal highway and should be funded as such.

That's a tautology. You're saying it should be funded because it should be funded.

The fact is, many states have more remote roads that are not cleared in the winter. That's not unique to Alaska. It's an economic decision. The pros and cons are weighed, and costs analyzed, to determine what places should or should not be maintained. 

Or to what degree. 

I used to design road upgrades. There are tons and tons of roads that could be upgraded and improved, but they are not all done now. They are studied and analyzed to figure out the most efficient solutions. Sometimes for larger projects you do a full traffic study. For smaller roads, you can actually go (partly) by complaints, or the subjective opinions of the committee of what roads are the worst, or which roads have the most problems, or are difficult to maintain, or are encroaching on private land, etc.

That's just rational real life analysis. It's necessary and needed. 

You can't just pretend like the government should just maintain all roads fully. It's literally not possible. I am knowledgeable about how many roads are literally completely non-maintained by the government, and what the process is to get them maintained. Tons and tons of ROWs are literally forested, or go through wetlands, or become impassible during wet conditions. It's a huge portion of dedicated ROWs and trying to maintain them would not just double the budget, but would use up decades of funds just to get them up to spec. 

And that's including gravel roads and the like. I'm not even getting into paved roads and the complexities of more suburban or urban areas. 

The TLDR is to educate and inform yourself. You're talking nonsense, and you'd actually realize that and admit it if you tried looking at the actual data. You can't just say ""all interior roads should be maintained and plowed all the time"" because it's *not possible.* In real life, we have to deal with actual costs and benefits.",1579925894,ffh87mw

The thing is, if a community or tax base can't come close to justifying the cost of a ferry service, then there's no good reason to have a ferry service. So you would pay for it yourself. 

Alternatively, you could form a group with those in your area, and you collectively pay for a ferry. That's an excellent example of small local government banding together to create a service for the local community.

Then the communities have to work together to help pay for it. Or you can pay for it with ticket costs. Or you can hire a company to do it, guarantee a certain level of funding (maybe using local taxes), and also pay ticket costs for the ferry.

Of course the communities can pay for it. They already paid a third of the cost, and the ferries were only used at half capacity. Doing the math shows that costs would go up, but you very likely could make use of a reduced-service system with higher but still affordable prices.

4124,MarriedEngineer,"&gt;Right, a community of ~2,000 is going to scrape up several million dollars to run a ferry system that can shuttle hundreds of people a day across the entire sound.

Yeah. 

That's $1000 per person to get a couple million for the ferry system. Which is significantly less than a typical person pays yearly for a car, to put it into perspective. In fact, you could double that and it still is easily within reason for yearly transportation costs. 

I'm not saying that $2000 (or even more) isn't a lot of money. Of course it is. But it's not ludicrous, and if you want to use an expensive service, then you pay for that expensive service.

And frankly, if fishermen want to fish, then they should pay the costs. You actually just argued that we should spend tons of money on services, that spend three times what they make on tickets, to subsidize fishing.

How exactly does that make financial sense? If the entire point is that fishing is important, especially for tourism and economic reasons, why would we want to lose tons of money in the process? Isn't that the exact opposite of what you'd want?",1579979619,ffipopu

1) Someone from ANC could better answer that, but the second largest city here is only 30k people and the nightlife will never be much more than local bars. They might have themed nights (e.g. with dancing, for holidays and special events, etc) but even moving from Milwaukee I would consider the night life ""dead"". 

2) There is frankly no reason to choose to live in alaska if you dont have a healthy appreciation of the outdoors and its activities unless you have strong family ties.

3) If you live in a city (&gt;5000 people) internet should be fast enough to play online games...if you are willing to pay exorbitant fees.

Also, you mentioned in another comment that you would be moving up here with your gf. My wife and I moved up here recently to spend a couple years BEFORE we have school aged kids because the k12 system up here is poor and getting worse.

I don't know what Alaska you want to move to, as what you see on TV is all BS. It's not the wild west it's not some romantic last frontier that they try and push on you for tourism. it's really not a good place to come to reinvent yourself. It is expensive and work is getting more and more scarce, and this is expected to continue in the next couple years as our budgets have taken a big hit due to the price of oil being down.

 I'd sit down and formulate a realistic plan by finding employment first, maybe start with workplacealaska.com. the State department of labor job assistance board... Then by establishing a budget, and seeing if you can afford to live here as Alaska is really expensive to live in, then how are you going to do mentally with the short days leaving you in the dark and cold? The sun not setting and you can't sleep in the summer?   All important stuff to look at.  How much of your life now is appropriate for Alaska? What kind of car do you have and is it good for winter? How about your clothes? are you set for cold temperatures? This stuff costs money and takes time. Don't be one of these unprepared people to get up here and run out of money and be stuck because it's easy to become homeless quickly.

It links an article. That article says in the subheadline ""Experts say logging trees won‚Äôt help.""

Which experts? Well the article itself only references and quotes one expert.

Or worst of all, what they do is search Twitter to find a quote that supports their narrative. It's not like they try to see what the general consensus is. No, they will want a tweet condemning [politician] so they search and find a tweet condemning [politician]. That way, they can push any narrative they want.

4380,NotAnotherFNG,"I did in 2017.  Cat was 15 years old.  She normally hates cars and cries from the second she sees the crate and then the entire trip.  I don't know if she knew this time was different or what, but she went right in and barely made a sound.  We'd got some mild sedatives from the vet but never used them, I was kind of afraid to due to her age.  

We drove up in a Chrysler T&amp;C with the back seats folded down.  We'd stop every 3-4 hours for litter box and water.  If she was calm she could sit our lap for a while too.  She spent most of the trip in the crate voluntarily though.  We'd really only close the door going to and from the car and hotel.  Once in either we'd open the door.

There was one day though that she was just done.  Woke up in the hotel in White Horse and went to put her in the travel crate to get going and she was just not having it.

4383,Joppalo,"I drove the Alcan 3 times with my 2 kitties in my Ford Edge and it was really easy for me. I was driving solo and my cats are pretty chill so I set up some comforts for them in the back part of the car since it was such a long drive. I had a car-topper for most of my stuff so it afforded me the space in the car for sleeping and cat comfort. My cats are 11 and 13 years old and get along very well so that made my life a lot easier. 

First off, make sure they are both vaccinated and you have the papers to show when you cross into Canada. They asked for these papers both times I entered Canada so don't forget them. I also had them in soft carriers for border crossing even though they were free-roaming in the car for the trip. I was glad I did this since CA Border agents searched my entire car and it would have been a nightmare with 2 loose cats. 

I used a tall storage bin (the kind you find at walmart for $8) for a cat box and laid an old door mat beside it to catch as much litter as possible when they jumped out. I scooped it at every stop to keep the odor under control. It worked well but still smelled funky for a bit when one dropped a huge grumpers and decided not to cover it up. I laid a pillow on top of a storage tote in the back seat so they could view the outside world for entertainment. A small 2-part dish was used for water and food though they weren't much interested in eating a lot during the trip. 

Something that made this easier was a cat tent that I could set outside when I was camping to give them some outside time and not have to worry about them running off. I found it on Amazon: [https://www.amazon.com/ESK-Collection-ESK48-Blue-Exercise-Kennel/dp/B00SFA8KBS/ref=sr\_1\_9?keywords=cat%2Btent%2Boctagon&amp;qid=1580182972&amp;sr=8-9&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/ESK-Collection-ESK48-Blue-Exercise-Kennel/dp/B00SFA8KBS/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=cat%2Btent%2Boctagon&amp;qid=1580182972&amp;sr=8-9&amp;th=1) I also let them roam in my tent when I set it up to give them more room to stretch out and roam. 

I also had a few ""Calming Collars"" that I placed near their bedding area. They are made with Lavender and some other soothing scents that help to keep cats calm. I didn't need to actually put these collars around their necks, having them near seemed to work just fine. 

I only stayed in Hotels 4 times collectively because I was able to sleep in my car and was on a budget, but the few I stayed in were all pet friendly. 

Young's Motel in Tok, AK - Very affordable and no extra pet fee!

Caribou Hotel in Glennallen - Had a pet fee, but was given a deal by the guy at the front that was super nice. 

Super 8 in Fort Nelson BC - They had a $35/per pet fee so I paid for one then I sneaked my other cat to my room in a laundry bag, lol sorry Super 8 but $70 just to have my cats in your room is ludicrous.

I can't remember the last place as I was driving forever and just stopped at the nearest place. They had a ridiculous pet fee too but I paid it since I was just ready to pass out. Basically most hotels will charge you a crazy fee so camping is a much more inexpensive and enjoyable way to go, at least for the majority of the nights. 

I tried to give the kitties some attention during my stops and gave them little nuggets of lunch meat to keep them satisfied, but they mostly just slept and cat-loafed the majority of the trip. I kept a strict rule of no cats in the front seats as they are a distraction and hazard while driving.

If you've got a regular rent-a-car type gas capacity (we have a diesel with an extra tank), I generally recommend topping off at all the gas stations you hit along the way, in case something happens. You never know. Obviously not the ones that are RIGHT next to one another, but it's better to fuel up too many times than too few, and sometimes what is a short stop between stations turns much longer.

I used their service and could not believe the level of service I got from them.  Once  the pallet entered their system, I had my tracking number and they let me know that were trucking it instead of barge, as the barge had been delayed.  Instead of 10 days or so, it was in Anch in 48 hours.

The wrap was that instead of 375 lbs, it came to 500, and oversize. The final cost still came in less than their initial quote.  They helped me when I picked it up to get it loaded.

As for the ""Have to have a job first"" recommendations, that's just a warning.

Not the most expensive place in the country, but chances are, it's a lot more expensive than wherever you're coming from.  If you don't have a job lined up, you can eat through that financial nest egg in a hurry.  As for jobs, they're limited. Check out the job listings in the local paper and on CraigsList, or check with prospective employers in your field of expertise before making the leap.  

And, it would make a lot of sense to visit before moving.  Unrealistic ideas about Alaska re widespread, so I'd recommend a long visit to a few parts of the state first.

I'll answer your questions:

&gt;Why are so many people on this sub trying to keep people away? Is it truly a bad place to live or are you trying to keep a Haven to yourself? (Lol)

You have described yourself in the earlier parts of your post as someone who will enjoy moving here. I moved here two years ago. I kinda liked the cold and I enjoyed pond fishing on little cow ponds growing up. Never hunted. Now I'm a fucking accomplished fly fisherman, kayak fisherman, and ice fisherman. I shot a moose in the face this year (whoops). Killed a caribou at almost 300 yards. I fucking love it here.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do you think that I would enjoy it, being that it seems it is perfect for my interests, or is there something I'm missing?

You'll notice a few things which will suck. The first is any time you want to visit family or do anything anywhere besides Alaska you have to cough up $500 for a plane ticket. Same with your family, anyone who wants to visit you is going to be pissed.

The second thing you'll notice is there is literally nothing to do besides be outdoors unless you live in Anchorage. -20F in Kenai with snow on the horizon and sunset at 4:30PM means you aren't going anywhere over the weekend unless you feel like going to Walmart for a day out on the town.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As a person who is most used to rural life, what area would be a good mix for a simple life, just making enough money to live comfortably?

Wherever you find employment, which brings me to the next thing I want to address:

&gt;I also have seen that it is ""absolutely necessary"" to have a job lined up before you get there, is this for any particular reason other than financial stranding?

Dude have you ever been in -23F? Do you know what that feels like? The homeless people we have out here are at extreme risk. We have a declining economy which has been in a recession for years. Unless the oil price goes up soon we probably won't be getting any better for a while.

If you move here without a job you are going to find out very quickly that we don't have the economy to support you bullshitting your way through life, you'll be out on your ass the moment you run out of money. Didn't save $1000 to get home? Congrats, you're homeless in a state that has been deeply cutting social services for the past two years.

There was a homeless guy in Soldotna who died this year. He drank a lot, two years ago he fell asleep in the snow and **lost both of his legs.** This year, after getting turned away, he **froze to death in his car in the hospital parking lot.**",1580258177,ffv8grb

4503,chili_a_la_mode,"I have been in -20's only once, in michigan, and certainly would not like to be homeless in it. 

As far as the question, I meant is it substantially harder to find work there so I should *definitely* have a job lined up first? Or since I have a decent moving fund I could take some time to find a job I'd like?

The rest of your comment made me very excited, as well. I don't do much, my hobbies include fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and nature videography, so the lack of night life really will not bother me, I'm kind of a home body any time I am not simply outdoors.

People who can afford to leave, will.  We already have crime and homelessness problems.  Meth and heroin are already huge.  It's just going to get worse.  Probably.

I absolutely do not recommend coming here without a job, it is critical if you want this adventure to be a success. Find employment, find a rental, then move. Save your savings for emergencies. If this adventure is a failure it will be a really, really shitty one. Alaska is unforgiving.

And since you visited, then you know, even if you live in our ""big city"" Anchorage, it's easy to get into the wild after a 20 to 45 min drive. Driving is much more difficult than most of the lower 48 so make sure you have a good, reliable, snow ready vehicle. Snow tires are a must if you do not have 4 wheel drive, and nice even if you do. I haven't seen anyone address transportation and it's definitely something to remember. 

   As for the discouraging comments about moving here. It's a tough place, but honestly amazing. You will find some of the kindest people on earth here. If you prove yourself to be an honest, hard working member of society, it is generally rewarded here. People help each other out here.

4563,WolfFlightTZW,"If you ever notice a semi (especially in the lower 48) they have big canvas covers that zip. Blocking airflow to the radiator removes the cooling effect. You don't want to completely block airflow, simply limit it.

In the summer when it's hot, your coolant gets heated in the block and then circulates out to the radiator so that cooler air (cooler than the engine block) can pass through the fins of the radiator and cool the fluid before it is circulated back into the block. The thermostat opens and closes to allow cooler fluid to circulate back in and hot fluid out.

In seriously cold winters, the air coming across the fins of the radiator keeps the fluid very cold, it cycles into the block, warms up a bit, then cycles back out. Yes it keeps the engine nice and cool, but it makes that portion of fluid passing through your heater core not quite as warm as you would like. 

In addition, although less likely is the metal fatigue this is causing on the engine. E.g. the block is hot, and heats up fluid which is then rapidly replaced by super cold fluid. Those stresses can be hard on the metal of an engine and could induce stress fractures.

In the end, restricting (while not completely blocking) airflow across the radiator fins, prevents the subzero air from cooling the fluid in the radiator to seriously low levels.",1580321662,ffxbcvy

To really get an Alaskan experience you have to get OFF the beaten path. Follow the road less traveled. Even the RV campers get such a limited experience in the summer time.

With a state that essentially reaches the equivalent of Georgia all the way to the west coast and up to North Dakota, we have it all.

Our news weather forecasters essentially give a weather report that covers the equivalent of 14 states in the lower 48 and parts of Mexico.

Hell even here in Anchorage where I live. There is the reported temp at the airport, but the east side might be 5-10 degrees different, South Anchorage will be different from both of those, and my house on hillside will have entirely different weather being 1000+ feet higher in elevation and I am less than 15 minute drive from said airport. Other places I have lived say if you don't like the weather wait 5/10/15 minutes it will change. I can do that, or I can literally drive 10 minutes and get a completely different weather experience.

Anchorage? Worried about the cold? Nah it don't really get cold here. You want super cold, Fairbanks and points north. Heat in the summertime? Usually mild, no AC (oh but last year, blech) you want that Fairbanks and the interior. Rain? Not so much, better head to Ketchikan/Juneau/Sitka. Snow? some, not so much, want more? Valdez/Kenai/etc.

Cost of living? The people here in Alaska that complain about high prices have really not seen prices like California/Chicago/New York/San Francisco/San Antonio etc. Trust me it costs less to live here than it does in those places.

A lot of Alaskans mistrust Outsiders. Not exactly uncommon for smaller communities, from what I understand. So there's a fair amount of that.

&gt; Do you think that I would enjoy it, being that it seems it is perfect for my interests, or is there something I'm missing?

You'd probably enjoy it. We've just kind of gotten tired of people thinking that everything's mountains and sunshine all the time. And more than one person has died chasing after that stupid van or trying to homestead.

Alaska can be as harsh and miserable as it is beautiful and majestic. Too many people come up here without realizing that. Some of them make the news.

&gt; As a person who is most used to rural life, what area would be a good mix for a simple life, just making enough money to live comfortably?

4722,legalpothead,"The whole issue with Adak is figuring out some way to bring money and work in.  I suppose this is essentially the big issue with every place, but it's even more so with Adak.

My info might be a bit out of date, but I've heard Adak has the only deepwater port in the North Pacific.  It seems to me that brighter minds than my own should be able to parlay this into a money-generating service of some sort.

Fish processing ships or other large ships might be induced to divert to Adak for one reason or another.  If not for repairs, then maybe for repairs + entertainment.  Hell, if the entertainment was spectacular enough, the cruise ships might throw you in the loop.  I'm talking some outrageous entertainment, mind you, like Jurassic Park.

Oh, shit; I've got it:  mammoths.  Scientists have been talking about cloning mammoths for years.  Adak would be perfect as a mammoth refuge.  People will flock from all over the world.

While we're waiting on the mammoths, the other idea would be for folks to make money by converting some bountiful local resource into an artisanal commodity.

Like sea salt.  No one's making/offering a North Pacific sea salt.  I thought about doing it here in the AK panhandle, but if you have to use electricity or wood to dehydrate the salt water, it's not cost effective.  Adak might be able to utilize the wind to dehydrate the water.

Down south in the lower 48, we've been watching cannabis legalization grow across the country.  Now the big idea on everyone's lips is ""420-friendly resorts"".  Indeed, even Mike Tyson is investing in a cannabis ranch to be used as a concert venue/tourist destination.  But why should should Iron Mike get to have all the fun?

Now that AK is legal and accepting applications for on-premises use licenses, Adak can step up.  You can grow your own weed in some of the buildings there. I mean, there's no doubt in my mind that some weed is growing in some of those buildings as we speak, but I'm saying you can grow even more, a lot more.

Then you can set up a network of cannabis coffeehouses to serve the Asian fishing vessels that come into port for a weekend of R&amp;R.  And use it to flavor your artisanal North Pacific Cannabis Sea Salt.  And feed it to the mammoths to offer them a little bit of life enrichment.

The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 18, 1971, constituting at the time the largest land claims settlement in United States history. ANCSA was intended to resolve long-standing issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska, as well as to stimulate economic development throughout Alaska.The settlement established Alaska Native claims to the land by transferring titles to twelve Alaska Native regional corporations and over 200 local village corporations. A thirteenth regional corporation was later created for Alaska Natives who no longer resided in Alaska. The act is codified as 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.

FYI, Deadhorse (""Prudhoe Bay"") isn't a normal town, with residents, schools, etc.  It's an industrial camp.  The people up there are there for work.  There are two hotels (one of which is super gross), one gas station, one cafeteria (inside the nicer hotel), and the 24-hour Napa auto parts/hardware/convenience store.  That's it.  In other words, everyone who's there is on the job.  They're driving company rigs, living in company housing (for the most part).  There's no public access to the Arctic Ocean (unless you fly to Utqiagvik), so there's very little tourism, other than folks just wanting to drive the haul road and see the arctic.

By all means, enjoy your visit to Alaska.  Just keep in mind that once you get north of Fairbanks, you're finished with what you'd consider towns, and just about everyone you meet will be working, so they may not need anything to buy or trade for.

I used to think this way. But he's been surprisingly effect at ruining the country. 

* The EPA is being gutted more than ever before. This doesn't spark industrialization, we simply can't compete with cheap foreign labor. 
* The FCC is crippling consumer protection in favor of business profits. 
* The State department is destroying our foreign relations. This might be rephrased to say they can't clean up Trump's garbage quick enough. 
* The head of the Department of Energy doesn't even know what his department does and is trying to shut it down. (They clean up our nuclear disasters among others fyi)
* The head of the department of education wants to cut funding and privatize education. Who does this help? The people that can afford privatized education, furthering the divide between the upper and lower classes.
* Tax cuts. The largest companies in this country are nowhere near even paying taxes. The latest round of tax cuts went more towards boosting stock prices vs any kind of investment or innovation. (caveat, plenty of blame beyond Trump on this one.)
* Lastly I will add that this administration has created a more divided America than it started with. Potentially worse than ever in our history and I can't help but think its entirely intentional. 

I'm no Hillary fan by any means either sadly. She was certainly more of the same corrupt crap. But we're headed towards the same Corporatocracy and maybe even faster than before. IDK... could still be worse with Pence I suppose.

I agree. 

But you do understand that is not why he was impeached. It was clearly demonstrated why - his abuse of power and obstruction were uncontested by the defense. The house was unable to get documents or the testimony they, as an oversight branch, were entitled to.  The DOJ said the only remedy was impeachment, the lawyers for the president during the impeachment trial said the remedy was through the courts. It‚Äôs an impossible argument. Even with the limited scope they were able to prove ample evidence.

I know this isn‚Äôt a popular opinion on this sub, but Murkowski catches more flack from people on here than Sullivan because people get their hopes up that she‚Äôs going to completely disavow her party and then get militant when that doesn‚Äôt happen. Meanwhile Sullivan is a complete and total carpet bagging Trump bootlicker who knuckles under to every whim of the party and he escapes negative media publicity because no one expects anything else of him.

If we really want our lawmakers to listen to us and change their opinions, we can‚Äôt rake them over the coals when they actually demonstrate a willingness to cross the aisle. All this Murkowski bashing is doing is probably making it more likely that she won‚Äôt speak out again in the future because both sides will crucify her; she‚Äôll just fall in line with the rest of them. 

And if people think we‚Äôre going to put her in her place by voting her out and replacing her with a Democrat, at best we‚Äôll get a one term senator (a la Mark Begich) who gets replaced the next election with another GOP yes-man who‚Äôs 10x worse.

Voting against witnesses to testify in the impeachment. 

If there are witnesses, which there are, her job/ oath, is to the constitution, not the GOP. By denying facts to enter the trial, she is not an impartial juror, and is choosing party, or country. The GOP leader, McConnell, said the GOP is in lock step with the White House counsel. They are refusing evidence, and witnesses. That‚Äôs not how oaths, or trials work. The vast majority of Americans would like to see witnesses, and evidence. Murkowski, and the other GOP senators are ignoring the will of the people, their oaths to the constitution, and the country.

My main points were that I backed with facts and not emotion were 1) I‚Äôm not sure what Murkowski has to gain by suggesting she might buck the party and then going along with the status quo anyways. I assume the argument is that she‚Äôs trying to play both sides and draw Democratic votes, but the first source I referenced shows she *losing* support, so I think if her real motive was just to play politics as you‚Äôre suggesting then she would have given up that tactic after the Kavanaugh hearing. 

And point 2) (that I sourced on 538) was to address your claim that Murkowski always goes along with Trump, but she actually seems to have one of the lowest ‚Äúconformity‚Äù ratings among Republican senators. I‚Äôll admit I didn‚Äôt look at EVERY senator on there, but at a quick glance she was much lower than people like McConnell and Sullivan. I think you‚Äôre probably basing that opinion off the two very public votes that drew a lot of media attention, which is understandable, but her larger voting record suggests that she genuinely bucks the party more often than her colleagues. This feeds into my larger point that I think it‚Äôs wise for Democrats to pick their battles. If we get outraged over everything every Republican senator does then the really scummy ones are able to fly under the radar.  if you really want to prove me wrong on this point, you could take the time to compare the voting records of each Republican senator and then throw that in my face if you find anything and I‚Äôll concede the point.

Well my wife is from Montana and we live in Tennessee and she mentioned she wants to move to Alaska. I always wanted to live in Alaska when I was young but just thought it wouldn't happen so it surprised me when she mentioned it. 
Anyhow I told her we needed to see it in the winter since I know it's beautiful in the summer. 

I've driven on snow before and my usual plan is just be extra careful.. well I rolled the truck.. Thankfully the worst that happened is done minor cuts on my hand. 

We were both blown away by how helpful and caring everyone was.. at least 20 people stopped and offered help! It was rough having a wreck there but it at least showed us how nice people can be!     And we still want to move there(:",1580686688,fgdtget

I'm sure something could be done about the people who are making waaaaaayyyy too much money via either the union or longevity. Kinda hard to be sustainable when you pay someone $100k+ in total compensation for what seems like forever.

Go to this site - [http://payroll.alaskapolicyforum.org/](http://payroll.alaskapolicyforum.org/) \- choose State of Alaska Executive Branch - Search - Filter in Transportation and Public Facilities as the department. You have to go **TWENTY NINE** (29) pages deep to see someone not pulling in over $100k total compensation. Take 423 employees x 100k and you get $42,300,000 in just compensation. Never mind everything else that goes into running a business or the other 222 employees working their way up into it. Totaling, roughly, $74.6M in just compensation. That's OVER half of the ENTIRE budget for the AMHS - last reported. Not to mention in 2018 they reported that they only brought in $46.6M in revenue.

You tell me, does this look like a recipe for success? Let go of the people who've been literally making the company hemorrhage money year after year and start a new. The last time I was on the ferry was 20 years ago and I just recently took a ride on one. Holy mother of god was it depressing. Dirty as hell tables, floors, bathrooms, carpets, and the food was appalling. Literally didn't want to touch anything. I'm not even trying to romanticize what it was like 20 years ago, it was such a stark contrast that it was obvious why people fly more, ship on Lynden, or barge their entire families out.

This figure includes healthcare and retirement.  It's not compensation in wages.  Also, it's not something paid 'forever'.  It's important to remember that AMHS employees do not pay into Social Security so the value of retirement should be higher.  There was a great broadcast of Talk of Alaska about this recently concerning teachers and the lack of sustainable retirement for the employee...like ferry workers that are poste tier III.

The review has been done and is being evaluated as you can see here in the [Northern Economics Report](http://www.amhsreform.com/sites/amhsreform.com/files/Northern%20Economics_AMHS%20Economic%20Reshaping%20Consultant%20Proposal%20%28002%29_0.pdf) that Dunleavy is using.  If it was up to Dunleavy, there would be no ferry system.     

Nothing is out of control, especially wages as you pointed out.  It's industry standard, with the exception of the Pursers that we agreed upon.  A clear and non-political vision needs to be made with our ferry system.  Case in point, the last 4 ships built do not fit existing infrastructure.

Especially now that employees are not in a defined benefits program and not paying into social security.  That alone is a disservice to those dedicated to the maritime industry in itself.  The largest problem with AMHS is having management appointed by the administration of the governor and following the direction of the administration.  That shit changes every 4 years and now we have a hodgepodge of ships that don't serve the wide area of SE/Alaska.  You don't get appointed to manage any department in Alaska by saying no.

Hey, those highways you drive... how much did they bring in revenue?

Just about $0 isn't it? Certainly isn't anywhere near $46.6M.

It's funny how, despite being a marine **highway** system, it scarcely gets treated as such. While the rest of us get to enjoy free, constantly plowed, annually maintained and regularly expanded highways, one portion of the population (who actually pays for it too) has to rely on a costly, undermaintained and regularly diminished highway.

People have become separated from government spending here and are used to receiving all services for next to nothing because up until recently oil paid for everything.

Now that the sweet oil hog we've all been riding is over instead of fixing disastrous oil tax credits and implementing a modest income tax people just want services cut cut cut.  

Governor Walker already drastically cut the budget to about as low as it was going to get without new sources of income or cutting valuable state services.  The last proposed income tax during Walker's term would have put us just ahead of Wyoming as the second least taxed state in the US. 

Now we are in a pickle, Dunleavy ran on pure lies and pipe dreams.  During the campaign he said he wouldn't touch a long list of valuable state services.

[Campaign interview August 2018.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INezy0R-lLs)

If you don't want to watch the interview let me summarize.

* No cuts to Alaska State Troopers.
* No cuts to the court system.
* No cuts to public education.
* No cuts to Power Cost Equalization.
* No cuts to prisons.
* No cuts to Pioneer Homes.
* No cuts to the University of Alaska.

We see how quickly those promises lasted.  Experts pointed out that it was impossible to do all of that without deep cuts or new sources of income, especially considering he was also promising everyone would get a $6700 PFD.

So all we are left with is new sources of income or cuts.",1580757555,fgga6fk

5543,RAGE-AK,"Are we talking revenue from the highway? Or are we talking revenue to the state? In either case, we can‚Äôt say for certain (although I‚Äôm sure someone has the figures) how much revenue is brought into the state via our road highways or through the ALCAN.  Our highways aren‚Äôt free. We certainly pay the least out of all 50 states, but gas taxes, fees, and other combo‚Äôs of it pay for our roads. Just like our taxes, oil monies, and other income sources to the state paid for the AMHS. Your taxes pay for the AMHS in part from the state‚Äôs General Fund.

There‚Äôs a couple sides to this coin and I was trying to bring up the OTHER side of it. A lot of SEAK towns have voted out the highways, that we‚Äôd all be able to enjoy, would ultimately lower shipping costs, travel costs, and other needs for the cities. The AMHS is constantly subsidized so that it can stay afloat. People have talked about privatizing it, selling it, stopping it, etc. I‚Äôm not saying I agree with the tactics of either the current political climate or the management that helped get AMHS to where it is today, but I do know that it‚Äôs not sustainable.

5544,OtherSpiderOnTheWall,"&gt;Are we talking revenue from the highway? Or are we talking revenue to the state?

Both. That number (net revenue) is less than $0. Much like how net revenue from UAA is less than $0 (since tuition doesn't cover the cost of running UAA).

&gt;Our highways aren‚Äôt free. We certainly pay the least out of all 50 states, but gas taxes, fees, and other combo‚Äôs of it pay for our roads. Just like our taxes, oil monies, and other income sources to the state paid for the AMHS.

Great. Neither is the AMHS, but our highways are, you know, ""free"", while the marine highway isn't free.  We're not paying for using the State highways. They are paying for using the Marine highway.

Quit being obtuse.

&gt; Your taxes pay for the AMHS in part from the state‚Äôs General Fund.

Oh lol, you're one of those? Any single person's contribution to the General Fund is so small that it may as well be nil. Your fishing license doesn't pay for ADF&amp;G. The State's taxes on gas barely pays for SPAR (and doesn't pay for ADOT).

We are not paying for our State government in Alaska. Any claim otherwise is ludicrous. Full stop.

&gt; A lot of SEAK towns have voted out the highways, that we‚Äôd all be able to enjoy, would ultimately lower shipping costs, travel costs, and other needs for the cities. The AMHS is constantly subsidized so that it can stay afloat. 

You're suggesting we should build highways, at a far greater cost, to places like Sitka, St. Petersburg and Ketchikan, rather than spend the relative pittance we spend on the Marine highway system? The millions and billions that would cost to build, and the millions it would cost to maintain, would far exceed the cost of maintaining and expanding the ferry system to keep it afloat.

But I appreciate the pun.

&gt;It‚Äôs sadly never really retained its gusto from the earliest of 90s and late 80s. It‚Äôs very tough, and I‚Äôm empathetic to the problems, but we have to have a solution that works today *and* tomorrow.

Here's one: Treat it like a highway. Get the federal government to reimburse the State the same as they do for highways (because it is, effectively, a highway). Spend the same amount of money, per mile, as we do for highways for the rest of the State.

Then, suddenly, the AMHS won't have an issue.

Can there still be extreme cold in or around the summer? I have a waterproof windbreaker I was going to bring, as well as a poncho, and i planned on packing an umbrella. 

The prospect of traveling to Canada sounds pretty neat, I would have to get my passport before leaving, but I am thinking I will probably have plenty of Alaska to explore to keep me pretty busy.

5651,justmutantjed,"From what I remember of Skagway (on a road trip 25+ years ago, I think), it was pretty small. Ketchikan has been my home for approximately 36 years, and I like it OK.  

There's a music scene in Ketchikan. You're not going to catch big-name acts, but there's plenty of local musicians that are quite adequate for a good night of entertainment, when you can catch them.  

Not much nightlife, as some folks have observed. Bars shut down at 0200 or before. Despite being a liquor store clerk, I'm not a very big drinker, and kind of introverted, so there's better perspectives than mine on the bars. I will say I didn't care for the Totem; there and the Asylum seems to be where the shit-starters hang around. Guess you'll find them anywhere, but those two seemed to be particularly thick.  

Food scene is good. Lots of Filipino options, so I hope you like lumpia. Diaz Cafe does them best, and I will die on this hill. Pizza Mill does some good subs, and the pizza is decent. Gold Pan's pizza is better, Oceanview is probably the best, but Ward Cove Deli has good pizza as well. New York Cafe has been a pretty good place to go for something different -- poutine, falafel, and that heavenly pork belly roll. Bawden Street Brewery does good beer, and the guy who runs it is a stand-up fella. Try the porter. AJ's (which used to be called ""Rose's Caboose"" -- RIP) is a good burger stand out north between the airport ferry terminal and the Wal-Mart. Hard to get at, but worthwhile. Burger Queen does the best burgers on the island, but no room to sit down, let alone park, most of the time. Order to-go or delivery.  

There are two ziplines that I'm aware of, on the island. One out South of town in Herring Cove, and one out North of town near Knudson Cove. There's at least two kayaking tour outfits, one of which operates out of Knudson Cove area, and may be attached to the zipline company. It's been a while, so I've kind of lost track. I used to live out on the Northern end, but I've since moved into the West End/New Town area, after some time in Downtown.  

The housing is tight, here. Most of the jewelry stores and other summertime industries will gobble it up. Make sure you have that lined up before you buy your tickets, or you may have trouble.  

If you land at either Ketchikan Apartments or Revilla Apartments (which I recommend you avoid if you have an option), the landlord is shady. Bring a camera to point at your door, make sure your stuff is locked down tight, and be familiar with the [Landlord and Tenant Act](http://law.alaska.gov/pdf/consumer/LandlordTenant_web.pdf) (actually, read that no matter where you end up, because it could save your ass). Also, prepare for pests. They're both run by the same guy, which is the only other thing I can say without putting myself out for any actionable statements. Big Dawg Realty, conversely, was a class act the entire time I dealt with them. They ran the Revilla for several years before it switched owners and promptly went to hell.  

Hope this enormous wall of text helps some. Best of luck on your trip!",1580830149,fgisu9q

The federal [Government Accountability Office](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/16/politics/gao-report-administration-violated-law-withholding-aid/index.html) called them *illegal*.  Yet both Senators spent more time in their pathetic statements criticizing the House than the guy who's actually guilty of the ""shameful,"" ""wrong,"" ""inappropriate,"" and criminal behavior.

Murkowski:

&gt;The House chose to send articles of impeachment that are rushed and flawed. I carefully considered the need for additional witnesses and documents, to cure the shortcomings of its process, but ultimately decided that I will vote against considering motions to subpoena.

*The House operated under House rules, which I disagree with (for some reason).  I considered whether to allow John Bolton to testify, the one person with firsthand knowledge of Trump ordering the illegal behavior, a man who has publicly stated Trump was engaged in a ""drug deal"", a man who was willing to testify under oath and fully expose the President's wrongdoing, 'but ultimately I decided against' doing the right thing (for some reason).*

He‚Äôs pretty much perfect and extraordinarily well-behaved other than some barking issues. He loves to run and be out in nature, but he‚Äôs also content being inside and following me around.

5850,Alyeskas_ghost,"&gt;Well I haven't gone too far down the rabbit hole

We get that a lot around here.  ;)  No worries, your friendly State employee [to the rescue](https://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/landsales).  Start there, and read everything they've got.

&gt;if it's a state land sale, and I buy it, doesn't that mean it is now private property? 

Yes, of course ‚Äî I misunderstood, and thought you were suggesting you'd just bushwhack a landing strip on a random patch of land.  To be clear, the State does retain certain rights to the land it sells, primarily subsurface resources, and attaches provisions to the contracts folks have to sign when they buy land.  But a landing strip on private land is obviously fine, and very common.

&gt; it sounds like you're saying even if I buy the land I basically am just paying to stay on state land, it's not really mine? 

No, not at all.  Again, I thought you were talking about plunking a handmade landing strip on some patch of public land.

Basically, there's a LOT to learn about living off the land in remote Alaska, and a little bit to learn about how to buy, access, and use land.  I suggest digging into all the info you can find, starting with DNR.  The good news is the State is required by law to support public land sales for pennies on the dollar; the bad news is the land is nearly all impossible to get to save for aircraft or snowmachine.",1580878309,fgl0i32

I did the super small town life for a bit and, though it can be nice and simple, it's not quite for me. I love being out in the country but much prefer having options for things to do. Speaking of, any advice on must-do activities or living in Ketchikan in general? 

Funny you mention the drinking and driving. My friend said the Canadian border patrol are some of THE most intense they've ever encountered (out of 20+ different countries or so).

And yup, that is my plan (and a really, really sweet deal imo), save up money AND get to live in and explore a new and beautiful place.

Trump is a flash in the pan, he isn't going to carry another election while losing the popular vote by a historic margin two elections in a row. The Dems are out for blood. If you thought the backlash after Dubya was bad (2008), you got another thing coming. The GoP has hitched its wagon to the wrong horse.

My generation is disenchanted with the GoP and we are paying attention. Just take a look at any reputable poll data about political leanings among 18-30 year olds. These last few years are going to motivate a historic voter turnout and it isn't going to go in trump's favor. 

Clinton's unlikeability and the DNC's shenanigans (both in the primary and in the media) suppressed liberal and independent turnout in the rust belt in 2016. Nobody that had an open mind/delusions about a billionaire being a ""political outsider"" is going to vote for President Tinyhands again. The issues he won those states on were centered around infrastructure, mining and manufacturing. He did precisely nothing to follow through on any of his promises there or help those people.

If someone like Bernie or Buttigieg winds up with the nomination it is pretty much a done deal. Pissed off liberals that sat at home last election are going to turn up in those rust belt states that won Trump his electoral college victory - often by very slim margins.

They find that in the years after the dividend‚Äôs 1982 introduction, fertility in Alaska sharply increased relative to its previous trends. Their overall estimate is that the dividend increased fertility by over 13 percent.

And this finding could also bolster support for basic income and similar policies among social conservatives who worry deeply about falling fertility.

The US government used normal, legal channels that Biden was part of to remove an ineffective and most likely corrupt Burisma for NOT doing his job and rooting out corruption. Biden's son happened to work at a place that wasn't being investigated, because the guy was not investigating any corruption. All of the sudden Trump (most likely) illegally stops congressionally allocated funds in order to pressure the Ukrainian government to cast dirt on who he thinks will be his biggest rival in the 2020 election (this same thing is most likely what cost Hillary the 2016 election). As soon as it is brought to light, the funds are released.   


If this was actually about investigating corruption then why did it stop as soon as it came to light?  But because I am almost certain that you are not actually interested in reality I am going to leave it at that. If you aren't actually arguing in bad faith then maybe take some time and really think about that last point.

You could also check out options in Denali National Park - last I heard, that park's current superintendent really wants to boost tourism and carve new hiking trails and increase the tourist buses in the park. Personally, I'm not crazy about that possible bump, but it would mean more openings. (There are already lots of shops, guided tours, and such around the park)
- No skiing here in the summer, and the rivers in town are too cold to comfortably swim. That said, there are lots of floating, canoeing, kayaking, and pack-rafting. 
- People here are pretty welcoming of newcomers, so long as they follow the old line from Jimi Hendrix: ""Let me live the way I wanna live, and I'll let you live the way you want to live"". Judgy Judys should stay out.

6398,Dundiditnow,"Expect about 50% battery range in the winter. 

It's been anywhere from -20¬∞F  to 40¬∞F in Anchorage lately and our M3LR has been using about 380Wh/mi on chill mode and regen enabled. However, we really don't have any range anxiety with our long range battery. From Anchorage, we probably couldn't get to Denali on one battery but we could get to Talkeetna for sure. In the winter, there are really not too many long drives we need to take any way, so it hasn't been a deal breaker.

There's really no Tesla service out here, but we haven't needed it.

As far as cost, we pay anywhere from $0.12 to $0.20 for electricity at home. So maybe $10 for ~200 miles of charge?
Compared to the $50-$60 I pay for our other vehicles to go 300 miles, I'd say that's a net plus
    (5¬¢ a mile for EV vs 16¬¢ a mile for ICE, if I can do math right).

One ""convenient"" public charger in Anchorage really puts a limit on where you can park, charge, and eat/explore (it's at least in a public/pay for parking in downtown). There are other chargers but they're really not useful. Nothing to do around those areas, and the distance from my house would negate the free miles we'd get from charging. I really hope this aspect improves soon. But if the past 10 years' rate is any indication, I'm guessing nothing's going to change any time soon.

Since owning the M3LR, we of course notice more and more Teslas in the area.  Seems to be less anxiety about owning one maybe?

My friend, I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this, but you‚Äôve linked the same study I linked.  The long and the short of it is that overall spending will go down 200 billion, while the method to pay for it will move from the least vulnerable to the most vulnerable.

You're missing my point. I'm objecting to losing a huge portion of my retirement savings each year to get a level of health care that I do not currently have nor really want, and also to pay for everyone else to get it.

Inuit are primarily in coastal and archipelago NWT, Nunavut, Northern Quebec and NFLD.  They are not inland people, they live and hunt on or near the ocean.

Do you think the activity in Ukraine needed to be investigated or not?  The answer to that is crucial and I am not sure what your opinion is.  If the investigation was justified, the accusations change from ""withholding aid to dig up dirt"" to ""withholding aid to root out corruption.""  Hunter Biden was receiving $166K per month for a job he had no business doing, in the country that his dad boasted about withholding aid to, contingent on the termination of the prosecutor in charge of investigating his son's company.  Yes, the prosecutor was fired for doing a poor job on the investigations, but it is misleading to phrase it as ""he was not investigating.""  He was in charge of the investigation of Burisma, and fired for corruption.  And the Biden issue is just one of many instances of suspicious behavior in Ukraine worth investigating.  As I understand it, they were all being investigated, not just targeting Biden.  

Given the information he had, an investigation was entirely reasonable, and the fact that it also helps him politically does not mean he should not investigate.  There are questions about how Trump went about certain things, but there have been members inside his administration leaking classified information on a regular basis since his inauguration.  I think it would be stupid for him to be transparent with classified investigations under those conditions.  And the fact that Democrats didn't even accuse him of a single criminal act as the basis for impeachment suggests that he was not illegally withholding aid.  But either way, none of your accusations challenge the fact that a Ukrainian corruption investigation was warranted.  There were valid reasons to investigate based on information gathered before Trump was even president.  And it is the same for Hillary.  There has been evidence of corruption in everything she has touched, and you're blaming the people who told everyone about it rather than Hillary for being corrupt.  

None of this is to say Trump is clean, I think they're all dirty.  But to impeach him for investigating something that should have been investigated was a really bad idea.  I fully expected Trump to be impeached as soon as he was sworn in, because I think he's a dumb guy and does dumb things, and Democrats made it clear that impeachment was their entire goal from the beginning.  But the fact that this is what they landed on for impeachment is a joke.

Didn't have a backup plan for their industry. And look at most of Northern Ohio now. But a couple things certain towns did helped.

So you're talking POST OIL so that is what this is. Not a debate on how long oil or related products should be around. And no matter what, I don't give a crap if Oil will be there for another 1 million years. Diversify your state.

Let's start with Michigan. Michigan decided to turn into a Medical Industry hub in the Northern Townships relative to Detroit. Those areas are thriving amazingly. Jobs everywhere. More stores being built in nice areas. Low crime. Great schools. Now that isn't all of Michigan. 

Fort Wayne, Indian decided to do the same thing, with the addition of adding areas for major distribution companies to build hubs. It literally saved the entire state. 

So we know, and we all know this, you aren't anything with just oil. Alaska has some of the most promise of any state in this county. The people of Alaska alone are some of the hardest working people period. Some might not have jobs but I bet they chop wood up on Buffalo Mine Rd at -30. 

I don't know if Alaska has a chance unless the people who run the state stop thinking like oil people and start thinking about how do I get jobs to the people all over and make our state a place companies want to stop at instead of just go around or over. People like Microsoft would save a TON having a warehouse hub in Alaska. That has been proven by Microsoft and Forbes themselves.

6765,pipsdontsqueak,"&gt;President Donald Trump‚Äôs $4.8 trillion budget proposes eliminating the Denali Commission, using the Alaska Permanent Fund dividend as evidence the state is so wealthy it doesn‚Äôt need the federally supported program that has improved village tank farms, docks and other rural infrastructure.

&gt;Alaska‚Äôs congressional delegation on Monday vowed to protect the Anchorage-based commission, as they‚Äôve done before. The Trump administration proposed eliminating the Denali Commission in previous years as well.

&gt;The budget reflects a president‚Äôs priorities and launches the budget process. But the budget still has to work its way through Congress, so it‚Äôs likely to see significant changes.

&gt;The fiscal year 2021 budget calls for the shutdown of the Denali Commission and two other agencies like it in the Lower 48. It says most of their work duplicates other federal programs, asserting they haven‚Äôt proven their effectiveness at boosting overall economic conditions in targeted areas.

&gt;A White House budget document singles out Alaska, noting that the state has enough money to pay its residents an annual dividend check. The proposed budget provides $7 million for the ‚Äúorderly closure"" of the Denali Commission, slashing funding by $10 million. 

&gt;‚Äú(The) rationale for a unique and additional federal subsidy to Alaska is difficult to justify given that the state of Alaska‚Äôs oil revenues allow it to pay an annual dividend ($1,600 in 2018) to each of its residents,‚Äù the budget document says,¬†[repeating logic used by the White House in 2019.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/msar-fy2019.pdf)

&gt;‚ÄúThe budget proposes to eliminate these commissions to reduce federal spending and streamline the federal government‚Äôs role, while encouraging states and localities to partner with the private sector to develop locally tailored solutions to community problems,‚Äù the budget document says.

&gt;The Denali Commission, an independent federal agency, works with tribal, federal, state and local partners to improve rural infrastructure and economic development statewide. It has invested more than $1.2 billion into Alaska communities and leveraged for more than $900 million in additional funding,¬†[its website says.](https://www.denali.gov/grants/)

&gt;Jason Hoke, the commission‚Äôs new federal co-chair, said the commission is critical to the state and federal government.

&gt;‚ÄúI hope it does (survive) so I can prove to the president how valuable an asset he has,‚Äù Hoke said.

&gt;The commission was founded in 1998 through the work of the late Sen. Ted Stevens.

&gt;Alaska‚Äôs congressional delegation, which sided with the president during the recently concluded impeachment proceedings, has so far been successful in protecting funding for the Denali Commission.

&gt;They will do so again, each of their offices said.

&gt;‚ÄúSen. (Dan) Sullivan believes the Denali Commission should be fully funded, and over the last several years has worked with the Alaska congressional delegation to fund the commission beyond traditional levels,‚Äù Sullivan‚Äôs office said in a statement.

&gt;‚ÄúCongressman (Don) Young has been a long-time supporter of the Denali Commission,‚Äù Young‚Äôs office said in a statement. ‚ÄúHe will continue working with the Alaska delegation to ensure that it is funded so that it can continue its mission of serving Alaskans.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúThose of us in Congress will take those (budget) requests under consideration as we work to determine what programs to fund and at what levels,"" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a member of the Senate Appropriations committee, said in a statement. ""As an appropriator, I look forward to moving through the Fiscal Year 2021 process in a manner that addresses a wide range of Alaska priorities.‚Äù

&gt;The budget proposal would also eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps people pay for high heating bills. The program, considered vital in many of the colder, costlier parts of Alaska, would be cut from $3.7 billion to zero.

&gt;Using an online form, Murkowski‚Äôs Senate office is soliciting input from Alaskans until March 13 to explore budget needs in the state.

&gt;Other Alaska-related items in the Trump administration‚Äôs proposed budget include:

&gt;‚Ä¢ Providing $555 million to pay for a second new polar icebreaker, in addition to the one Congress funded in 2019, a priority of Alaska‚Äôs congressional delegation. The funding will ‚Äúensure America is at the forefront of safeguarding uninterrupted, year-round commercial activity, trade, and supply routes and confirming America‚Äôs leadership role in the Arctic and Antarctic,‚Äù a budget document says.

&gt;‚Ä¢ Providing funding so the federal government can accelerate mapping of the Alaska coast and U.S. waters to boost the nation‚Äôs understanding of nearshore resources and conservation opportunities, documents say.

&gt;‚Ä¢ Estimates that a lease sale for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge this year will bring the federal and state government each $503 million, and another $221 million next year. The administration had planned a lease sale for 2019 but it has been delayed. Critics have derided the estimated income from a lease sale as unrealistically high.",1581438375,fhbap7v

Definitely try to go out to Matanuska Glacier for a hike. It‚Äôs breathtaking scenery and the hike is very easy and guided. I‚Äôve done it twice (once in the summer unguided and once in the winter guided) and it was worth it both times. 

Check out Hatcher Pass and Government Peak. Blueberry Knoll trail is easy to follow and has some great views. If the road is open and you‚Äôre a decent hiker, Reed Lakes is stunning. 

Hiking the Butte in Palmer is a fun, short hike. There are two routes. I usually take the stairs because I hike with kids and it‚Äôs easier to contain them there, but either route is good. Stairs will possibly be less muddy that time of the year. 

The Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center is a good way to guarantee wildlife sightings. Plus, there are some good trails out that way.  

For restaurants in the valley, my favorites are probably Turkey Red and Vagabond Blues. Food trucks out here are great.

While what you said isn‚Äôt wrong, think about this: for wells to be shut down in Alaska, the land has to be completely restored, leaving not trace of oil production. This is super expensive. This means is usually more expensive to shut down than to deal with dwindling profit margins, or no profit at all. 

Alaska also uses a lot of the jet fuel it produces, from Kenai and the Slope. I believe a lot of the heating fuel shipped to remote areas is also produced in AK and distributed by Crowley.

6992,dimitri0610,"I did the drive four times while I lived up in Anchorage. A few friends and I some how made it a tradition to do the drive to prudhoe and back every 4th of July when we had a long weekend. We always took two cars, but one year I didn't have access to a Jeep anymore, so I drove a Honda Civic as the second car. You definitely need to be careful and consider the many scenarios that could happen. You could easily blow a tire and one year we even saw an SUV with a busted axle. However, you could also get really lucky and make it in a Civic (it was dumb of me, I know).

The drive is definitely tough, but it can be rewarding. Gates of the Arctic National Park is just passed Coldfoot and is incredible. It's also the least visited National Park in the US. So, if you like space and peace/quite, you'll enjoy that. Driving through the Brooks Range is also incredibly beautiful. Some of the mountains and terrain up there remind of those you'd find in Iceland. And chances are, you'll see some cool wildlife too. 

The endless pine forests that last for hours on end can be daunting and really tiresome, so don't underestimate them. There's also always construction in the summer and it can add some travel time to your drive.

Other than that, good luck and enjoy it. Make some stops along the way. See the views and stop for gas whenever possible. 

And be sure to check out Galbraith Lake after you get through the pass going north. If the snow is cleared by the time you go, it's a really nice place to explore and find some beautiful wild flowers. 

There's also a cool little gold mining town north of Coldfoot you can visit and check out too. 

A few notes:

In prudhoe, the gas station is self serve but you have to go into this little building to pay and start the pump. It took us a bit of time to figure it out the first trip.

The general store is worth a stop and has souvenirs to show you've been there. Stickers, patches, postcards, sweatshirts, etc.

We get posts like this every day, so you may not get the best responses without some specific questions.  Generally speaking, renting a vehicle for bouncing around Anchorage and the Kenai is a great idea, especially before the hordes of tourists show up in June.  Both Seward and Homer are great towns, and Soldotna is a good halfway point to grab a bite.  Figure 6 hours drive time between Anchorage and Homer, 3 hours between Anchorage and Seward (give or take).  Both Seward and Homer are perfect for getting out on the water (whale watching, fishing, glacier viewing, etc.).  You should also consider Whittier, which is only 45 minutes from Anchorage, and includes the [Whittier Tunnel](http://www.dot.state.ak.us/creg/whittiertunnel/accomplishments.shtml) (fun if you're not too claustrophobic).",1581622835,fhidvyk

As for supporting locals (nice!), most any small shop or restaurant you stop at will be locally owned.

7059,johnny_birds,"Only take what is necessary. 

Things are expensive here. A shitty couch at the thrift store can be a few hundred dollars.

The mail? My carriers routinely destroy my packages, and have a very hard time putting mail in the right mail box. This has been every place I've lived here. 

Unless you have lots of money, housing sucks. Expensive, and most places are very poorly maintianed. I've lived in 3 places with black mold, among other problems, and people here deny it's a real thing. 

Crime also sucks. There's a lot of it. Don't take my word for it, or the people that like to look the other way, and pretend it's not a problem, for whatever reason. Look up stats, and check the local news for a month. 

Shipping is mostly okay. A lot of stuff won't ship. A lot do. Write the company, and ask. I've had good results.

Internet? That's going to depend on where you are, which you didnt say. 

If you don't like driving in snow, you'll hate it here. We do next to nothing for snow, and ice. No salt on the roads. Just half assed plowing. You'll need winter tires, and I would suggest front, or all wheel vehicle. A lot of people will argue about this, but I don't like getting stuck in the snow, my safety is important to me, and other drivers safety as well. Knowing you can stop, or maneuver when some drunk/ meth head steps into the road is worth it. Drunks/ meth heads frequently step into the roads.

The winters here will most likely give you a hard time. It's dark, and isolated. It can be hard to meet people here. Especially, if you don't drink. If you don't drink/ don't enjoy the bar scene, and you're not a churchie, it's going to be hard to meet people. 

Almost everything will be more expensive from your perspective. Especially, fruits, and vegetables. They try to do a good job, but I don't plan on what I'm buying, I buy what looks good, and is at the store. 

It's pretty, and the fish are good. It's a fun place to check out, but leave yourself an out. You might really need it. I've watched it break down a lot of people. It's gotten to me quite a bit as well. It's different than down there for sure.",1581630335,fhirekg

&gt;This $1 billion will help save existing jobs put at risk by budget cuts and the consequential negative consequences to our economy, will help create new jobs through funding capital budgets for needed infrastructure, and will help create new jobs by stimulating our economy through funding larger dividends. 
 
Even if it were allocated entirely to the dividend, it still wouldn't restore us to what we'd have received using the standard formula. It looks like it could be one possible important step needed to bring in more revenue, so that's good, and I'll keep an eye out for any reps looking to support it. But most of the infrastructure and jobs funded by it would be of little if any benefit to the majority of residents, unlike the PFD, which potentially benefits all Alaskans (save a few unjustly cut, like felons and stuff).

I'd thought the PFD was already protected, apparently not, but even in its present starved form, it needs something like a strong constitutional amendment or overwhelming referenda if it's to survive as more than a token. Dunleavy said he'd fight for that too, but hasn't. Lots of people say they'd be willing to give up their share for a better state- great, give them a box to check, but the rest of us seriously need it. But there's enough people with higher priorities on their ballot I don't think we'll get it back any which way.

For folks who rely heavily on the PFD, I think it is important to keep in mind that we all still need healthcare, so paying a full PFD while gutting healthcare and the Pioneer homes is going to just cost us all in the long run anyway.  I mean look at what happened with the budget vetoes where Anchorage property taxes are now going to go up.  The PFD is perfectly saveable as the fund is doing well still.  Balancing the state budget seems to be the problem though.  He's spending money on outside law firms to kill off unions which provide Alaskan's jobs.  He's also been working on getting rid of he Alaskan preference in hiring, another blow to our economy.  With Meyers, he has experience already in the state government, so I'm hoping that if the recall succeeds, he will at the very least not break the law and as added bonuses not get tangled up in a bunch of lawsuits that have bad odds.

It is even more apparent if you talk to anyone that has moved up here from a really dangerous city, they laugh at how ""Mayberry"" Anchorage is compared to a really dangerous city.  

Context of the statistics people are using are important and I think get missed during these kinds of topics. [For example here is an article about the murder rate in 2017.](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/crime-courts/2018/01/05/with-35-homicides-in-2017-anchorage-set-a-disturbing-record-why/)

*""Each case is different, but there are common threads. Most Anchorage homicide victims found themselves in danger last year because of illegal drugs or heavy drinking, police said. Some associated with rough people or engaged in risky behavior themselves, Markiewicz said. Some were in fights that escalated. Seven were killed by family members or romantic partners.""*

7333,General1lol,"As a a former student of UAA, I must iterate and solidify that the social aspect of college is just as important as the education aspect. Like another commenter said, both schools are like a glorified community college. Student population is tiny. The clubs are small. The events are hardly attended. There is little to do in the state. A lot of students are born and raised there are still living with their families. There's nothing wrong with that, but the dorm life or house life at bigger colleges really livens things up. The cold makes people stay inside.  Socializing not only maintains your mental health, but also increases opportunities in life via networking. 

Alaska is an amazing place and it's scenic. But don't be fooled by thinking it's overly unique. You can find similar parks, town's, and natural features in other states . Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Montana come to mind. If you do a visit before commiting, visit in the WINTER time. Stay for a week and truly embrace the cold and solitude. Now amplify that by 8 months. The summers here are amazing and they will suck you in, but winters are a totally different beast that few expect. A lot of people here (student or not) suffer from seasonal depression.

As a born and raised Alaskan, I would be very reluctant to pay tuition for my kids to go to UAA or UAF or UAA, let alone out of state tuition. I stand by philosophy that Alaska isn't for young people. A lot of the people aged 18-24 move away and don't look back. I find a lot of my peers who went to a different state for college had a much better time socially and academically.",1581838495,fhrttb2

7336,NotAnotherWhatever,"I was going to say 0, because I personally don't own any, but average is a funny thing. To find it, you add up all the things, then divide by the population, and you didn't just ask for my house - you said my area.  

Well, that can mean a lot of things, but I figure if you want us counting individual dogs, it has to be an area we can survey easily. Given that, there are 42 households officially in what is designated as our neighborhood, as of our last neighborhood get-together.  

Three of them have sled dog teams. Two are smaller kennels that have about 30ish designated sled dogs,  mostly for doing tourist things with, but they do participate in racing when they can, and both have fielded Iditarod mushers at some point in the past 10 years. The big one which actually races yearly and sometimes fields multiple teams said it was nowhere near 100 dogs when pressed about it, and said it was only about 70, when trying to dismiss a neighbor's comment about how loud their dogs get howling at night. 

So, with a fairly big margin for error, we're looking at around 130 racing/sled dogs out of 40 households. Unless I'm really botching my math, it comes to a sneeze over three per household. 

Of course, that's not a very useful number, and this is  a horrible way to look in to this, dude. Outside the kennels most people don't really have just random sled dogs - they're expensive to feed and maintain and purchase to begin with. The equipment is expensive. The vet bills are astronomical. In the vast majority of the populated parts of the state, snowmachines are going to be cheaper than dog teams.",1581841385,fhrw1g0

The school was alright, but I think it would have been better for me if I had more time to dedicate to it. And if you're worried about out of state tuition, she can always change her residency to AK after a while (that's what u ended up doing).

I swear it feels like people are split 50/50. They either love it or they hate it. It depends on you and your attitude. There is so much to do! But you need to be willing to go out and look for it. If she enjoys the outdoors and the freedom of open space, flexible regulations, and exploring, then it's perfect. If she's a homebody and has a hard time making friends, it could be tough. Especially during the winter. You have to find your thing. Something to keep you out and active. It doesn't have to be winter sports, but just something.

I had to move to Los Angeles two years ago though for work and I've traveled many places this far. I miss Alaska so much. It is the first place I've ever been that really felt like where I needed to be. I love the big city and big opportunities that are here, but Alaska was special to me. Everyone was pretty friendly and the world up there was just a bit different. 

I highly suggest visiting. Not just to check out the school, but also for your own sake. Check in out in winter, as many have suggested. Summer would make anyone fall in love with that place. 

Another note, Anchorage and the few surrounding towns are the place to be. I have friends from the top of the state on the north slope down to the bottom of the state in Homer (I'm excluding places that you can't drive to) and they typically come to Anchorage for any type of activity you'd do/find in a city. Fairbanks is big for Alaska, but small for many other states. And they get a really tough experience when it comes to weather, both hot and cold. But you can find fun anywhere, really.

Alaska will definitely reach someone independence, self-awareness, and self-care. If you can make it up there, you can make it anywhere in the states. Be cautious though!

7390,EiusdemGeneris,"&gt; Depends on how you count crimes, etc.

The standards way is to measure the rate of various index crimes per 100,000 people. (That's how the FBI does it in its Uniform Crime Reports, for instance). When you run the numbers, it's bad: Anchorage has a murder rate double the national average, for instance, and Fairbanks is worse. 

&gt; Can you walk down nearly any street in these two towns, safely, at any time of the day? Yes.

&gt;Can you find trouble if you want to? Also, yes.

Obviously, most people aren't victimized in any given day. But the idea that this problem is isolated to people ""looking for trouble"" just isn't true. I see people using drugs in parking lots every week, get accosted by vagrants virtually every time I go the park, see people casing the houses, mailboxes, and parked cars on my street almost every day, and so on.

7401,topgear1224,"I am not in school but I will share my story.

I lived in Phoenix I went to Clarksville, (60 miles north of Nashville), now I'm in Fairbanks. Personally the city kind of feels like Clarksville, except the nearest big City isn't 60 miles away (45 minutes) it's 300 miles away (6 hours+). 

For me I will say Fairbanks is a fantastic place to visit on a vacation but living here I really don't like it. The biggest issue for me is just the cost of everything. 

Fuel is $3 a gallon, our family has three used cars and part cost is insane. 

the base price is about 10 to 15% more expensive for parts from AutoZone then in the lower 48. but everything that you can get shipped free in the lower 48 you have to pay for shipping. Case in point I needed rotors for my car that's 30 bucks each, it was an additional $20 each to ship them and it would take 2 to 4 weeks to get here on an AutoZone truck.... For me to go to the store and pick up. For now I can kind of get around this by using autozone.com. (free shipping to Alaska.....for now...)

I see the beauty in a place like this. But I'm built for the desert not for the cold. Even the most dependable cars we own struggle up here. (Just found metal in the oil filter of my brand new 2019 car...)

The cost of living isn't that far off of what Los Angeles was a few years ago. Los Angeles has the beach, Fairbanks has the Arctic environment. It just isn't a place for me. I miss being able to go out and do stuff and explore. I can't really do that up here because you're always run the risk of literally freezing to death, or getting stuck in a snowbank for 4 to 6 hours. 

Drivers in all of Alaska are just unpredictable. I've been a lot of places Clarksville had drivers that were overly courteous. sometimes you'd be sitting at a four-way stop for almost a minute until somebody finally would go. Nashville had pure aggression that I've never seen anywhere outside of New York. Alaska has sort of all of that but you never know who is going to do what. Some people like to do 20 miles an hour. Others like to go 50 along the same road. (Limit of 45)  there's a few especially knuckleheads up in Fairbanks that think all season tires are good enough for the roads up here, and that because they're using all season tires stop signs should be optional for just them.

There's a lot of other things I don't like, but I feel like the biggest thing that hurts me with Fairbanks is just the cost of everything. In the lower 48 you can get a meal at fast-food for around seven or eight bucks. Here you're looking at 15 to 20 easily. If it wasn't for Costco our family would actually struggle on food cost. We're lucky our home includes utilities. I don't necessarily think your daughter will want a dog but if she does and she chooses Fairbanks understand that if it's anything bigger than a Chihuahua she's going to struggle to rent an apartment, which may just have to rent a home and there's a lot of costs that come with that. if you freeze a home that you're renting from somebody because you didn't pay the fuel bill you're on the line for the damages of that home.

I haven't really seen a lot of crime issues in Fairbanks itself being a relatively small population. Everybody leaves their cars running when they go in anywhere, and I've yet to see somebody get their car stolen. 

Fairbanks has a fairly large military population about 10-15% or so. 
Anchorage also has a military base but they have more people overall, so I don't think the percentage is quite as high. 

personally if it was me and I had to choose between the two cities I would choose Anchorage everyday of the week. There's more business competing, and  prices are more affordable. You also don't literally run the risk of your car freezing solid. And you can always make that weekend trip up to Fairbanks.",1581906034,fhw4bbk

Whale watching tours are possible, and will depart from Whittier or Seward. However, the main tourism season runs from mid May to mid September, so your options may be more limited than normal. Hiking is hit or miss during April as that's our breakup season. I've been on mostly dry day hikes in mid April, and I've also had incredible backcountry skiing in the exact same location.

Another thing to do is to shoot a truck load of late season rutted caribou (we have a 5 per person per day limit in my region) and have the kids process it into dog food. That helps mitigate the annual mid winter die-off of, like, half the village dogs. I teach CTE and we have done dog house projects, put people mostly end up using the dog house for firewood because, well, dogs are a renewable resource and god-forbid the thought of anyone in my community investing/maintaining their own infrastructure. 

This story is also a sad reminder to me that even though I live in a village most of my kids and their families no longer hunt or participate in subsistence activities. This has only recently changed, and is not the product of some ""white man BAD!"" narrative. It turns out that when people have enough entitlements to subsist on SNAP and welfare that, well, most people just stop going out. Sad.

7687,bottombracketak,"I think there might be two of the recall reasons tied to the judiciary.  This one, From a April 2019 [article](https://www.kbrw.org/2019/04/02/chief-justice-dunleavy-has-to-choose-a-judge-from-the-list/) is getting at not filling a vacancy, and I think the other was retaliation for the courts ruling on abortion rights by cutting there funding by the same amount.

*Chief Justice Joel Bolger issued a statement Friday night saying the governor‚Äôs office doesn‚Äôt seem to understand what the Constitution requires when it comes to appointing judges.
‚ÄúThe governor must appoint one of the candidates nominated by the council,‚Äù the chief justice wrote, referring to the Alaska Judicial Council. The council screens applicants for judicial vacancies and sends a list of nominees to the governor.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy‚Äôs decision not to select anyone for one of the vacancies on the Superior Court puts the state in uncharted waters.
The Alaska Constitution and state law say the governor has 45 days to appoint a nominee from the council‚Äôs list. Forty-five days have now passed. Judicial Council Executive Director Susanne DiPietro said it‚Äôs not clear what happens next.
‚ÄúWell, that has never happened before so I don‚Äôt believe that I can really answer that question,‚Äù she said.
Eleven people applied for the two judgeships in Palmer. From that pool, the Judicial Council sent three names to the governor. Dunleavy wrote the council this week saying there appear to be qualified applicants that the council did not select and he wants to know why.
DiPietro said the authors of the state Constitution intended the Judicial Council to be selective.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very, very clear from their comments that they wanted the council to play a very strong role in screening the applicants and sending to the governor only the most qualified individuals,‚Äù she said.
Dunleavy, in his letter, points out that the council passed over one applicant that it had previously decided was qualified for a different Superior Court vacancy. He suggested it shows the council‚Äôs decisions weren‚Äôt based on merit.
Chief Justice Bolger, in his written response, said it‚Äôs not uncommon for an applicant to make the council‚Äôs list one year and be rejected the next time. It happened to him: The first time he applied for a spot on the Alaska Supreme Court, the council nominated him but the governor passed him over. The next time he applied, he was not nominated. Then in 2013, the council nominated him and Gov. Sean Parnell appointed him.

‚ÄúMy experience does not mean the council was arbitrary,‚Äù Bolger wrote. ‚ÄúI was not nominated in 2012 because there were more highly qualified candidates for the position at that time.‚Äù

Alaska‚Äôs system for selecting judges was designed to keep partisan politics at bay. DiPietro said the framers of the state Constitution intentionally limited the role of the governor.
‚ÄúThe founders were very clear that the governor had the duty to appoint from the council‚Äôs list and that he does not have the authority to call for more names,‚Äù she said.
The Judicial Council is comprised of three attorneys, three non-attorneys and the chief justice. The council met Friday evening to discuss the governor‚Äôs concerns.

Two previous governors also questioned the Judicial Council‚Äôs selections: Wally Hickel in 1993 and Frank Murkowski in 2004. Those governors raised their concerns within the 45-day window. Each case ended with the governor selecting a nominee from the original list the council sent.

The post Chief justice: Dunleavy has to choose a judge from the list appeared first on Alaska Public Media.*",1582094801,fi2zuof

1. No. Only one expensive option. 

2. 100mbts/s, yes

3. Yes, with the same company, for a lot more $

4. ~150/mo

5. Absolutely

6. GCI

7. No

8. Yes

9. Yes. Of course. How the hell do you do anything without the internet? I couldn‚Äôt do my profession. Internet is about as critical as water at this point.


I‚Äôm lucky. GCI is available to me. I can pay massive amounts for functional internet. I used to live in an area of anchorage (only a mile from where I do now, well within the city) that only had the option of ACS. They offered 3mbits/s for like 80-100 bucks a month. Yes, unusable internet speed for triple the cost of most functional internet in the rest of America. 

I suspect that there isn‚Äôt any motivation for most companies to improve infrastructure. There is zero ISP competition (like most places in America). I‚Äôm guessing ISPs are worried that 5g will make updated infrastructure potentially less valuable. 5g may carry usable speeds, but potentially latency problems exist.

Meanwhile we as Americans have handed tons of tax dollars to telecom companies to improve fiber infrastructure, which we now know they didn‚Äôt do. They also get to sell our internet history (thank republicans voting for that bullshit). So essentially, as Americans, we get one choice for internet, who gouges us for shitty internet, then turns and sells your browsing history. All while taking our tax money as a handout.

1. No. I'm paying too much for unlimited data at speeds well below what I was told I should be getting.

2. 1 Gbps. Reality, closer to 350-500 mbps, even after multiple service calls and swapped hardware.

3. No. GCI is the fastest internet in Anchorage.

4. $175 USD per month, with a $15 fee for a static IP address.

5. Yes. Google Fiber in the lower 48 is $75 USD for unlimited internet at true 1 Gigabit per second. I'm paying more than 2.3x that.

6. GCI

7. It's fiber to coax. Fiber to the junction box that services the area, then coaxial to the unit.

8. Internet is stable.

9. Definitely need internet. With smart devices, constant music or movies playing, and video gaming, as well as web surfing, we use the internet constantly.

10. There are two major players in residential internet in Anchorage. GCI and ACS. And ACS isn't adding any more circuits, so if they don't service your area, then you will never get internet. So for many, GCI is the only option for internet. It's expensive.

Thanks for taking the time to learn more about Alaska! It's awesome to see others get interested in our odd state. Technology in Alaska is in a weird place, because we are constantly advancing, and rely on the internet so much, but we don't have a good enough infrastructure to keep up with demand. There are only a handful a direct underwater lines that feed into Anchorage that go on to service the rest of state, with many rural communities having to rely on even worse satellite internet, which is even more expensive and has even worse connection quality.

Solutions like SpaceX's StarLink or, with a million to one shot, Google Fiber, would be a massive boon to Alaska, not just for residential internet, but for business as well. The entire state, a population of just over 750,000 people, share a handful of 40 GB and 100 GB fiber connections that run down the coast to terminals in Oregon and Washington State. We need a total overhaul of fiber communications in order to be even remotely competitive, let alone considered up to date.",1582163514,fi5hxlf

Advertised: 1gbps down, 50 mbps up
Speed test just now: 100 mbps down, 48 up. 
Over the last few months, speed tests have been as high as 358 mbps up/48 down and as low as 12 mbps up/300 kbps down.
In short: when things are working well, I get almost the promised upload speed, but only 1/3rd the download speed. But both are frequently much much slower. 

3. Are there any faster options available?
No

4. How much do you pay for it?
175/mo

5. Do you feel like it's too expensive?
Yes

6. What's your ISP?
GCI - the cable provider. There is literally no other choice at my location aside from cellular data. ACS, a phone provider, offers internet in my city, but not at my exact location. There is a wireless internet company in my city, but their technicians could not get a signal at my location. Soon there will be a satellite internet provider in my area, but their prices are almost as high as I‚Äôm currently paying, their promised speed is much slower, and their pricing model is essentially paying per unit of data rather than per unit of time. 

7. Do you have a fiber optic connection?
No

8. Is the connection stable for most of the time (90%&gt;)?

If stable means ‚Äúspeed as advertised‚Äù, no. It‚Äôs not even 10% of the time. 

I‚Äôd stable means ‚ÄúI can do basic functions on the internet‚Äù, then yes, my connection is 90% stable. But not a lot more than 90%. 

9. Do you feel like an internet connection is a must in your household?

Yes. The work I produce is delivered over the internet. 

10. \[EDIT\] Anything else you want to add?

In the early dial-up days of the internet, there was quite a bit of competition in Alaska‚Äôs ISP industry. Most of the providers were small local businesses, and prices were reasonable, service was stable, and customer support was a pretty easy phone call away. Slowly over the last 20 years, all of the competition has been bought out by either ACS or GCI, prices have sky rocketed, speeds have improved but become unstable, customer service has become a hassle, and, at least in the case of GCI, the profit no longer stays in Alaska.

Do you feel like it's too expensive?

1. Connection? Sure. Price? No. I'm from Texas, where internet is maybe $60/month and is unlimited with 5g or fiberoptic speed. Getting 100 mbps for about $100 here feels pricey.  

2. About 100 mbps, and yes. 

5. Nope. Used to be ACS but they're absolute shit. 

4. $99.99. We have it bundled with our phones so it's a bit cheaper than having *just* internet.

7. Nope. 

8. Yes. Sometimes it will slow for several hours, but we've very rarely had outages. 

9. Yes. We don't pay for cable or anything of the like, so streaming services are a big part of our entertainment. We also play WoW and other online games often.

4.  It's $85-100, I don't quite remember.

5.  Yes, I do.  It's actually not the speed though that I find problematic for these prices, it's the caps.  The speed is a bad value too, but at least it's sufficient for my purposes.  But in this world of cloud storage and huge downloads, the caps are unreasonable.

6. GCI.

7. No, I'm pretty sure it's a cable connection.

10. The thing to keep in mind with AK is that it's extremely large, and the situation is going to be drastically different depending on where you're at.  I'm talking from the perspective of someone living in Anchorage, which is the state's largest city.  Here your main option is GCI if you want reliable, fast internet.  There are other peripheral options but they're either similarly priced for slower speeds or just slower/less reliable.  Now, if you were to head outside of Anchorage to the plenty of other places there are in the state, you might quickly find that you don't even get GCI as an option.  You get satellite internet, if you're lucky.

7849,ArcticExtruder,"Thanks so much for taking interest in this! Since we live in the US, our telecom protections fall in the impotent and largely useless hands of the shill FCC - which currently couldn't give two fucks about the people it is supposed to represent. Our state representation is a living goiter that prides himself in monumental ignorance. And the only company that offers internet services takes full advantage the obscurity of the gray areas in the definitions of terms used.

1. Hell no
2. 1 gbps. Not even close. See notes below ¬ß¬ß
3. No. 
4. 175 USD
5. For the actual bandwidth, yes completely. For the advertised, still yes.
6. GCI
7. No. No one outside of the major wire centers do. There are only 4 fibers out of the state, GCI owns/leases two and ACS owns the other two, but ACS sticks to govt contract services and doesn't contend with GCI service areas in any meaningful way. Check out the sub oceanic fiber map for reference.
8. Not for me. Constant lags and drops. Even when I serviced a large infrastructure in town we still had issues that were just barely within minimums.
9. Absolutely.

¬ß¬ß So GCI sells what they call the ""red"" package - marketing idiots as usual. That is supposed to be 1 gbps bandwidth. But it's not dedicated, it's shared, meaning 1 gbps is the ceiling, not the floor - *up to* 1 gbps. See what I mean about definitions? Then, that number is only representative of your connection **to** GCIs network. In the lower 48 (what we call the contiguous 48 states), this would be an accurate (or at the least, modestly useful) representation of the your connection to the rest of the internet within reason; but since Alaska is as far from the lower 48 (likely the physical locations of the internet destinations) as the lower 48 spans, and the very congested and oversold fibers are the real bottleneck to service, it is rarely going to be representative of what you will experience. So to enforce this illusion of *speed*, GCI has their own ""internet speed test"" that shows only your connection to GCI in Anchorage. Now GCI browses this sub and actively defends itself so you may see the lackies doing what they do here shortly. They get aggressive at times.

These new connections range from 10Mbps to 150Mbps.

I believe on the Kenai Peninsula alone, about 25 new towers/connection points are being installed between last year and this year. They are being expanded in rural areas, not cities or towns.

Also, the claim that there is ""zero ISP competition"" is absolutely incorrect. This is especially true when you include wireless, cellular, satellite, cable, DSL, fiber, etc. Most people just don't like the slower options, so they don't include them.

In my area, typical connection speeds (both wired and wireless) are about 4 Mbps for $45 to $35 per month. So, in my humble opinion, people whining about 100 Mbps are incredible whiners and complainers.",1582223749,fi7lr4z

7963,ggchappell,"(1) During the brief period in the summer when the salmon are running: enormous amounts, if you have the equipment for it -- and current fishing regulations are not an issue. At other times: not much. The traditional way of life of natives in the area involved short-term fish camps where they spent a week or so getting enough fish to feed themselves for a year.

(2) I live in Fairbanks, and I see a moose every 2-3 months. If I were out in the bush I might see them more often. Probably the most common mammals will be moose, rabbit, beaver, fox, marmot, muskrat, ermine, porcupine, black bear, brown bear, caribou, wolf (and maybe a couple more that I forgot?). If you care about the tiny critters: vole, shrew.

As for large birds, there will be Canada geese, white-front geese, trumpeter swan, tundra swan, raven, herring gull, mew gull, bonaparte gull.

Remember that animals have different habits. Beavers are found only in or near streams, often in pairs. Gulls will be groups of maybe 5-20, but only near rivers. Ravens will be in smaller groups just about anywhere. Moose and bear will be either alone or a mother with 1-3 young. Wolves will be in sizable groups. Caribou will be in very large groups; you'll see them a lot less often, but when you encounter them, you'll encounter *a lot* of them.

Some animals, like moose, don't care whether people are around. Others, like bears, tend to avoid people -- unless there is food to be had, in which case they can become a huge nuisance. Still others, like lynx, definitely avoid people. I live in an area where there are supposedly lynx, but in 20 years I haven't seen a single one.

And meat eaters are never very common. Any area with lots and lots of wolves will soon have lots and lots of starving wolves -- and then very few wolves. But they still impact people's lives significantly because they are the most dangerous animals.

(3) Well, the natives have been living in the area for thousands of years. Until recent decades, they were self-sufficient. But of course they lived in groups. For one person to be entirely self-sufficient food-wise would be doable, I think, although it would be pretty rough.

7966,Epistemify,"Do note that those numbers of fish are the limits set by state and federal regulations. That is not how much you could catch in a post apocalyptic (or whatever your situation is) survival scenario where you are trying to live off the land by any means necessary. You could likely catch more but I'm not sure what rate you could catch stuff. Consider having a fish wheel be some sort of unlockable and/or craftable technology for constantly catching fish on a river while the player is a way.

Of animals, I can tell you that moose would be the most common thing to see, other than stuff like mice and chipmunks. Things like foxes, ermines, plenty of birds, arctic hares would be there, as well as everything else that people have mentioned.

For your 3rd question, yes. It is possible to sustain yourself. Many people who have traditionally lived there do build up a store of food for the winter. But a single moose can get you through the winter if its cold enough to preserve it. Bird meat, stored fish meat, stored moose meat, and berries will be the primary food. In many places, the winter is actually one of the best food gathering times. In the swampy tundra of Western Alaska and the North Slope (and also in the interior), it is very difficult to travel overland during the summer. The whole ground is swampy. Walking is slow, if it's even possible to traverse something on foot. But in winter, everything freezes over. Lakes, rivers, swamp (which is basically all tundra), and literally everything, freezes up and gets covered in snow. Walking over this area is difficult especially if there are no tracks. Your feet will just sink into the snow unless the snowpack is really firm (need strong winds for that). BUT, if you have a snow machine (snow mobile) or a sled dog team, then you can travel great distances really quickly. For example, I was out in western alaska in the winter and my friend and I drove snow machines to a site about 40 miles away. It took us about an hour. My friend says that in the summer it takes a full day to get to that same place, and you have to take a boat. Anyway, all that is to say that people who do live off the land use the winter to travel longer distances and hunt, especially to hunt migratory animals like caribou herds. In the summer travel is relatively efficient if you are moving up or down a calm river like the Yukon, but that is it.",1582250604,fi8xg5i

You'll be able to catch a couple of dozen of fish, depending on the season, weather, and fish. If it's more inland, you're not entirely going to see salmon. If you ignore regulations and the getting is good, you'd nab more than you could carry.

Animal encounters are common, from ravens and magpies to moose, caribou, and bears. If it's winter, you'll only see bears if there's a warm spell. Moose are most common in terms of big game. Sure, you'll see squirrels, voles. Also, mosquitoes are god awful during the summer, you should look it up.

7990,MarriedEngineer,"&gt; I bow to your unbelievable experience in all facets of life. You can work for a power company, but still find time to design cell towers and argue on the internet all day. 

I don't design communications towers. That's structural engineering, which is what my degree is about, but not what I currently do. I design service to those towers, so I need to know what is being installed on those towers in order to make my designs. Thus, I have the plans for what's being installed on them. Also, to be frank, I don't have to know this in order to know what's happening, as I've seen the ads and coverage maps of the new internet coverage ISPs. Anyone could find this info. Anyone. I just happen to know more about it as I've seen the designs, and also know about the new access points a year or so in advance. I also know the scale of the rollout, which is massive, and the timeline, which is recent. 

As for populated areas, you already have service. Multiple options, too. [As of 3 years ago, a majority of households had more than one option for broadband.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/50-million-us-homes-have-only-one-25mbps-internet-provider-or-none-at-all/) A typical urban area has 3 or more.

Another thing might be fun to have is survival strategies;
In terms of aggression moose are by far the most dangerous and aggressive. They cannot  corner so if you get behind something solid that will protect you.

bears vary, it might be cool to have a small black bear start tearing into your supplies. Jumping up and down usually will scare them off. a grizzly bear will likely win in a fight unless you have a gun. Their heads are super thick so you would have your players aim for the ribs. If the player gors prone they may let you live. Running from either of these bears will make you prey and probably end up dead.

Wolves I dont have too much personal experience in the wild but I'm sure you can find plenty of research.

Tldr: depending on the game Alaska has many wild and dangerous wildlife that all have different strategies to deal with. It could add an interesting color to a survival game other than just run and hide.",1582263729,fi9f38v

While old growth is critical to some species, many more are habitat generalists, and frequently disturbed areas, via fire, thinning, cutting or weather events are nearly always higher in biodiversity.

Clearcuts provide a significant number of benefits, when the slashpile is left, a headstart in nutrients, if burned over, a .5/.5/.5 N/P/K fertilization, and pioneer species are always associated with an increase in animal diversity within the first 5 years or so. The disturbance allows seedbed regeneration, in some cases the overstory not being a dominant native species can allow for native species regeneration.

This is the danger of laymen (youtube) understanding. Forest life cycles are incredibly complex, and still not completely duplicatable in the way other science is. You drop a bunch of buzzwords like data, publications and analysis without being able to develop an actual picture from them. Silviculture is a science, just like agriculture. Would you attempt to weigh in on a farmer's field clearing methods after a couple of articles?  

If you don't like clearcuts, just say so; they're not particularly attractive and that's a legit opinion. Don't attempt to dress up your opinion with science.

I do not want to give a little warning that applies to anyone who might consider a position in rural Alaska. Rural Alaska can be amazing. It can also be dangerous - both in terms of natural hazards, but also a very real risk of assault and sexual assault in a small community where you're the outsider (it's no less dangerous for other at-risk locals, but they often sadly don't get a choice in the matter, especially if they're minors). The easier it is to get into a position, the more you should be sure to do your research: What kind of community is it?

There are many, great communities out there, but they tend to be better at holding on to staff like teachers, nurses, etc..., whereas the communities with a high turnover might just be unfortunate, but there might also be a reason for that turnover. Do not expect the community or the group hiring you to divulge that information, because it would scare away applicants.

8335,pm_me_ur_babycats,"Hey, thanks for your reply - I hadn't given that much thought before, but I do see how that presents a very serious risk to me. But it really, really sucks that kids in rural communities are at the same kind of risk!! That seems like a public health concern if anything is. 

Since your comment I've been trying to read up on Alaska's sexual assault rates, and the figures look pretty bad compared to national averages. But it surprises me that there is so much information available, and also a reasonable amount of national awareness of this issue, but the rates of sexual violence are still so high. Do you know why communities in Alaska are so particularly vulnerable?",1582586937,fionvha
8336,OtherSpiderOnTheWall,"The short answer: You could write numerous graduate thesis on the causes of sexual assault in rural Alaska (and Alaska in general).

I am loathe to give a long answer because I'm only indirectly involved/all my information is second-hand. It's also tough because the issue unfairly colours a lot of people who are *not* guilty. A lot of the assaults/sexual assaults are going to be domestic violence related / between relatives, and in my (frankly worthless) opinion it has a lot to do with the isolation. Even in cities, victims of domestic abuse are often scared of what life would be like on their own. In a rural community, the abuser could have a lot of connections, and even a seemingly unimportant person might be crucial for survival - both for the relatives, but also for the community. So just as elsewhere, there might be a tendency to sweep things under the rug.

Add to it that many people from outside of rural Alaska do not understand and do not want to understand rural Alaska, there's a distrust of authority. The assumption is that if you call for help, you're just as likely to be viewed as the perpetrator, and it's going to be a fight to be heard. For example, OCS, for all the good they do, is largely run from and by the cities and federal government. They're *supposed* to be cognizant of the challenges of rural Alaska, but there's plenty of workers who will deny returning kids to suitable parents and relatives, because they don't think the accommodations are suitable (even though that should not be a factor in unifying the kids with relatives).

Some tribes will fight this, of course, as they should. Unfortunately, some tribes will fight for re-unification with an admitted/alleged abuser where the child doesn't want to go back to the parent either. Then it becomes a shit-show all around.

Boredom, alcoholism and all that (same as any other rural area) don't help. Banishment, a common punishment, just moves the problem to Anchorage (and moves the assault/sexual assault to the homeless population in Anchorage).

Finally, a lot of these communities are small. Like a lot of villages elsewhere in the world, even in the lower 48, you get a village mentality. Unlike a lot of villages, you can't just get in your car and leave. So when you're the outsider, there's a real risk that nobody cares, because you'll be gone in a year or two - if you even last that long - so why would anyone speak out against someone who comes knocking at your door at 2 am? They're more important than you to the locals.

But just because the rates are high doesn't mean rural Alaska sucks. There's plenty of welcoming villages. There's plenty of places that will not put up with bad behavior (even if their punishment is banishment). There's plenty of places that know which villages suck to be in and avoid them like the plague (I won't name names, but I visited one village for a few hours for work that all the neighbouring villagers - e.g. pilots, postal workers, lodge owners, etc... - all said was an unpleasant place and to not spend the night there). The same village mentality makes for a tight-knit community if you can become part of it (even if it can be a challenge to become part of it, especially if people expect you to leave). And there's plenty of great parents / people out there who are stuck in a shit situation because they have to deal with over-worked and sometimes uncaring state troopers / state workers hundreds of miles away. And there's plenty of great state troopers / state workers hundreds of miles away who do care.",1582588024,fiopkoy

8383,Alive_Following,"&gt; Do you know why communities in Alaska are so particularly vulnerable?

I've lived in a village for 6 years. It's the full package--no roads, 300 people, yada yada. I'm part of the community, and live a more traditional subsistence lifestyle (hunting all my meat, filling a chest freezer of berries, another of fish, trapping fur bearers, chopping my wood, and so on) than 95% of that community. The thing that has caused me to be most accepted in the community, however, is coaching a successful basketball team. 

Anyway, it's a complex issue, and a big part of the answer, frankly, is not so easy as ""it's colonialism/government/white people's fault."" 

There are parts of the culture here in my village that are deeply dysfunctional, and the only people responsible are my community members themselves full stop. I know the other commenters mean well, but people passing around their daughters, raping their sisters, and molesting their nieces is hard to pass off as a result of ""isolation"" or ""boredom"" or whatever. Some of it is, frankly, traditional--the I√±upiat and Athapascans are only a handful of generations removed from a very robust culture of wife capture raids, for example.

I think that most of my girls have been molested or sexually assaulted. I teach grades 7-12. Part of the problem is assault is kind of normalized. It can be quite jarring at first, overhearing the frankness with which a 15 year old might talk about her uncle fingering her, or the way that someone might say ""yeah, my half-brother raped me at thanksgiving, but if I report it my family will be mad at me,"" or to hear an old timer mention that ""yeah, so and so molested kids for a long time and the tribe looked the other way, until he did a four year old in the butt, and that was too much for the family and they ended up reporting it.""    

That's a long way of saying a lot of this is just cultural. People here choose to protect their own to their own detriment. People here choose to reject a lot of the norms of modernity and Western Civilization. It's their choice, and they reap what they sow. It's a shame that they're stuck in that cycle, but I'm not sure there's any way to change it, just like trillions and trillions of dollars didn't do anything to change Afghanistan. 

Something you should keep in mind is that welfare reform does not apply to places ""off the road system."" So your tax dollars pay for people to drink and rape each other in their government houses, with food on the table brought to you by SNAP, heated by subsidized fuel oil, illuminated by subsidized electric plants, carried by subsidized bypass mail, and all of it glued together by a never ending supply of welfare checks. So for any of you out there who wonder why so many bush teachers and professionals voted for Dunleavy and don't see a problem with the idea of ""starving people onto the road system,"" well, there you go.",1582615516,fippp15

It's a very cute place to raise children, if expensive.  There's a Carrs where you can buy food, produce, diapers, laundry detergent, meat, etc.. The prices for everything will be MUCH higher than what you're used to so what a lot of people end up doing is making the 2.5 hour drive up to Anchorage once or twice a month to stock up on staples at Costco.

There's a hardware store, automotive store, and fish tackle shop, etc. Quite a few restaurants (some may close during the winter) and iirc a bar or 2.

It's a huge port for cruise ships and where the Alaska Railroad ends so the population explodes during the summer with tourists and people fishing for salmon, but very sleepy during the winter.

And yes, we still get prime shipping for small things, it just takes longer. But that's only for small things. For big things it will either be very expensive or you won't have the option to ship at all. For reference a vacuum could be considered big.

Oh and a heads up about ordering aerosol or pressurized containers (like hairspray) it will be difficult to order those too. I've gotten around this by doing in store pickup.

Hopefully the job your husband gets is a high paying one because you might have to be a single income family for awhile, there aren't too many non seasonal jobs that pay more than minimum wage.

Anchorage is trans friendly enough. There are trans women at Fred Meyer and Costco, who have very publicly transitioned. Some people make rude comments, and some people are nice. Alaska in general leans very conservative, but you'd be able to make friends. You won't be the first trans person in town. The LGBQ community has some vocal anti-trans members, but they are pretty rare.

Alaska is expensive. Getting out of Alaska is expensive. Being poor in Alaska sucks worse than being poor in the Lower 48. Please do not come to Alaska without either a solid job offer and/or several months of living expenses (for what it will cost you to live in Alaska) saved up.

2. There will be no employment protections, but there also won't be many people who care. Alaska has and will always will be quite libertarian. As long as what you are doing does not affect their lives, people usually don't care. That being said my friends have informed me the LGBTQ population in Alaska is awful, which makes sense because dating as a single cis straight man sucks as well. Dating in general just sucks in Alaska I guess is my answer. **EDIT: I am wrong about this, Anchorage and Juneau both have protections, but then again they are the most progressive cities in the state.

It has a very small town feel with a diverse mix of people - many highly educated professionals in the area. The schools are decent, I would say the high school is the best on the Kenai Peninsula without hesitation. An interesting perception about homer is that it is all about artsy, ‚Äúgranola‚Äù people.

To answer your question about getting around in Anchorage without a car - I'm a former uni student who did just that for about 4 years. It isn't ideal - the buses in the winter don't run perfectly well on time, but it's mostly okay. I also spent a long time biking in the summer just like you're planning to, and it can be sketchy because there's few if any bike lanes and drivers here aren't great at checking for pedestrians/bikers when they're taking a right, so just make sure they see you before you cross a street.

8761,AK-Brian,"I walked, biked or used the bus system to get around Anchorage for five years in the early Y2Ks. It was a massive pain in the ass sometimes in the winter, but once the trails cleared up I actually preferred cycling throughout the summer months.

That said, at the time I basically spent all my free time hiking, biking and camping around the Chugach and Eagle River areas, so my owning a car wasn't critical. I could just bike to a trailhead or take a shuttle up if I had more gear. I also had friends and family with vehicles, so the occasional trip the valley or to Seward or Kenai was a possibility.

I do agree though, that for most people who just want to be able to get from point A to point B within Anchorage, it will be extremely tough without having a reliable vehicle. There are definitely ways to make it work, but they require a flexible approach. Most people just solve the problem with a car, but I can respect the decision to try and find another way.

I believe the government should be *obligated* to choose the most efficient and cheapest option (everything else being equal).

This is actually corporate welfare and favoritism, which is something I thought most people opposed.

I drove Rideshare in Seattle for a few years (had to live down there for medical), I could average $24-28/hr when the guy next to me couldn‚Äôt get $10. You have to be able to understand people‚Äôs movement patterns. As far as the co‚Äôs go, yeah, they‚Äôre not your friend. 

The thing about it, you decide everything.  Start time, stop time, etc. If you have a crappy pax you can even tell them to get out - but be ready to CYA - like I said, the companies are not your friend.  

Up here the rate is a lot higher per mile/minute which can make even a little bit of driving worthwhile.  Definitely look into rideshare insurance that covers your deductible.  Yes Uber &amp; Lyft cover you while you are going to pick up/have a pax in your car. Your private insurance does not during those periods - neither insurance covers you while you‚Äôre driving around with your app on in ‚Äúready‚Äù mode... ergo the need for ride share insurance.  

Uber, as your new BFF will ding you with a $1,000 deductible if you get into an accident that is your fault or if an uninsured driver hits you. Lyft, your BFF‚Äôs obnoxious little brother, has a whopping $2,500 deductible.  Both will immediately remove you as a driver until you can prove your vehicle has been repaired, so you will definitely want to get that rideshare insurance with deductible coverage or a rainy day fund.  

I would suggest not sticking their ‚Äútrade dress‚Äù permanently on your windows, I have always used clear plastic pockets or Velcro.  It isn‚Äôt an issue up here so much, but Outside if you offend another driver they will call Uber/Lyft &amp; complain, their response is to suspend you until they investigate.  Understandable considering the liability they would face if you ran the next guy off the road, a real PITA if your teenagers use your car too.  

Enough with the scary talk - like I said, you decide.  The investment to try it out is nothing more than a vehicle inspection. Do yourself a favor and snap a pic of every document &amp; keep them in a designated folder in your phone. They often ‚Äúlose‚Äù previously submitted paperwork.

There are a thousand good reasons why people don't want that job. I think my village has been through, like 6 officers over the past few years, and most of that time the position has been vacant anyway. That is to say, VPSOs don't last long. You're on call the whole time. You're hated by everyone. People throw rocks on the roof of your house all day and night so you can't get any sleep. People shoot out your windows.  It's dangerous. Aaand the VPSOs I know put in massive overtime, week after week. And it gets worse. You have to try to do your job at the whim of tribal and regional cooperation politics (can't so anything about so and so because they're on the NANA board, can't take a report on the rape of a minor by xxx because his parents run the village [and the bootlegging], and so on).  And whenever the VPSOs try to do their job, nobody ever says anything, saw anything, &amp; etc.

It breaks the fair chase rule, which is basically where it stops being sport and becomes something else entirely. It is pretty cool to shoot guns from a moving helicopter, but almost every animal killed from the air goes to waste. The bodies are not recovered, and that, to me, is wonton waste. Again, another strike against what I would consider hunting. 

I am also not positive that wolf populations need controlling the way that many folks believe. I understand that packs of wolves can be damaging to property, and even dangerous to humans. I also understand that limiting their numbers increases potential of harvesting other big game species. Those are the only defensible reasons to control the population as far as I can justify. But the limit of wolves in many parts of the state is 10 ‚Äî PER DAY. That‚Äôs a bit silly of a number in my opinion. At those kinds of numbers, a helicopter with two hunters can easily wipe out an entire pack in a few minutes. 

Since I have moved to the state five years ago, I have seen a grand total of 2 wolves in the wild. I am an avid outdoorsman, and I spend a good bit of time outside across the state. In no place I have been would I consider the wolf population ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. And I think this is where we will find our underlying difference of opinion.

Driving the Seward highway is an experience in itself, but you should consider driving down on a week day instead of a weekend if you can. July is peak outdoor/fishing season and the Seward highway is 2 lanes. Traffic and accidents happen there and if it does, you‚Äôre stuck. There aren‚Äôt many exits! 

Seward is my favorite place. Get on a boat. While 2 days will be nice, you could do Seward in one full day (it‚Äôs not a very big place!). On the way down to Seward or on the way back to Anchorage, stop in Girdwood at Alyeska ski resort and hike or ride the tram to the top, amazing views.

You also may want to consider driving to the MatSu valley (only 45 min from Anchorage ). You could stop at Eklutna Lake which is beautiful. Or climb Palmer butte.

The shuttle bus ride into the park going at least as far as the Eileson Visitor Center is scenic and a great way to see wildlife. But, as you said, it's a drive to get there and your time is short.

So here's a suggestion (and ultimately it's your trip. Do what you want...):

 July 9th- arrive in Anchorage 10:30PM

July 10th: rent the car and drive north to the Matanuska Glacier for a guided glacier hike with MICA, NOVA or Matanuska Glacier Guides.  You'd also have time to drive up into Hatcher Pass. Overnight in Anchorage.

July 11th:  drive to homer. On your way south along the Turnagain Arm stop at the scenic pullouts. If you do this later when you are headed north, you'll be having to turn against traffic on a busy highway. The Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center at Portage is a good stop to see some animals.

July 12-13th: Homer, activities TBD.

July 13th: drive to Seward. On the way stop and do the Russian River Falls walk

July 14-July 15: Seward, activities TBD.

July 16: Drive to Whittier. Either do a Prince William Sound glacier cruise, or a glacier kayaing trip with Lazy Otter. Or the Portage Pass trail all the way to the lake. Overnight in Girdwood.

July 17: spend day in Girdwood/Portage area. Virgin Creek Falls is a quick walk. Byron Glacier trail is just a mile long, but you can explore a couple of miles further. That afternoon, head to Anchorage, depart at night",1583005867,fj4doji

Pro: I did like the visitor center -- there were good films and a few interesting exhibits, and I'm a museum junkie.  The guide on the bus was very good -- informative with an engaging style.

Con: I saw almost no wildlife at close range -- just one mangy young moose and a few ptarmigan.   (To be fair, the park Web site says of this tour, ""Good for Seeing Wildlife?  No; wildlife viewing may occur, but chances are slimmer than with other trips."")  I only went as far as Teklanika Rest Stop, and we did stop at the cabin and also got a native Alaskan presentation, but that was still 60 miles on a bus and 4.5 hours total.

What I really enjoyed was the sightseeing flight approaching Denali.  (From K2 Aviation in Talkeetna.)  It was pretty much peaks, cliffs, and glaciers, but really spectacular.  In contrast, on the bus we did see different habitats (lowland woods, subalpine, alpine tundra?).  But I saw a lot of trees elsewhere.",1583034193,fj5jfbh

I remember back in the 80-90s when we used to get 2 weeks of -20 temps in Anchorage around Feb every year, we would get ice fog and it was incredible and surreal. Driving in it was like driving in regular fog Except a bit worse especially at night. At times your wipers would work and sometimes they wouldn't depending on the outside temp and your vehicles temp. But the most crazy thing was driving in it at night time. Your headlights already aren't going to be much more helpful, and foglights really don't help much more. But with Ice fog its crazy because you see your lights reflected Upwards! I remember the first time I experienced it. I was like what the heck, what are all the street lights shinning up?

Having been injured and on crutches before, I know what a pain in the ass the snow and ice can be for mobility and safety.

The city sends out the sidewalk blower but it doesn't go long the sidewalk towards the bus stop--it goes perpendicular. I guess the sidewalk is too narrow there or they can't be bothered.

If the jackasses who park on the street would just check the plow schedule and move their cars, they wouldn't have to dig them out later. The city has to deal with that, too, so I guess their ""too bad"" attitude is a little understandable.

&gt;Article 3, paragraph (a) of the [Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CTOC/index_old.html) defines Trafficking in Persons as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, **for the purpose of exploitation.** Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.

You are lying, because the article does not ""state point blank there is no evidence."" The article says that Eastman *did not ""offer""* the evidence, but the article does not say there is no evidence or the evidence doesn't exist.

[Still, when asked for evidence that women get pregnant and have an abortion simply so they can get a government-subsidized trip, Eastman only told KTUU ""a number of people have come to (his) office with stories, experiences.""](https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/State-lawmaker-says-Alaska-women-get-abortions-for-travel-voucher-offers-no-proof-421253813.html)

&gt;Eastman is racist. If he made that comment here he would be banned for racism.

So, I checked, and apparently you're a mod, so if I may suggest, you should only ban people for racism if they say or do something racist. For the record, what Eastman said was ""We have folks who try to get pregnant in this state so that they can get a free trip to the city, and we have folks who want to carry their baby past the point of being able to have an abortion in this state so that they can have a free trip to Seattle.""

He didn't make a broad assertion about race. He didn't criticize any race. He didn't make any assumption about race. He didn't suggest discrimination about race. He didn't propose that any race is inferior to an other race. And most importantly, **he literally didn't even mention race.** He was talking about specific individuals allegedly abusing a government program.

&gt;Eastman also voted against a bill honoring black soldiers earlier this month. His stance on both bills is similar. The Wasilla Republican argues veterans should be honored equally, regardless of race.

After scratching from that race, he took a full year off from racing to recover from the disease. He is now considered cancer-free; however, Mackey suffered nerve damage in his left index finger as a result of the operation to remove the cancerous tumor. The nerve damage caused such unbearable pain in the finger that Mackey chose to have the finger surgically removed. The radiation from the treatments also destroyed his saliva glands, causing his teeth to disintegrate. He has had the infected teeth pulled, and is currently having his teeth rebuilt by dentists.

So I've worked a lot with sourdough, and it's my feeling that sourdough starter should be kept out at room temp and not refrigerated, for best vigor.  

Unfortunately, that means you need to feed the room temp starter at least once every two days, so if you're not baking, before you know it you've got a gallon or so of starter.

Fortunately, when this happens, you can make pancakes. And the cool thing is, you can just use your excess starter as the batter.  Pretty much.   Depending on how wet you keep your starter, you may need to add a little flour.  And an egg, some oil, salt, sugar. Get the griddle hot and oiled, get everything ready, then add the soda to the batter, and it will foam up.

True.

Wrong. I have always said charity can cover these cases, because it can. We are a rich country. 

That and people should be incentivized to buy insurance so this doesn't happen in the first place. And insurance would be cheaper with less regulation.

10280,MarriedEngineer,"&gt; You want our elderly and sick children's well-being to dependent on the whims of charity because we're a wealthy country? 

In the long run, charity is much more likely to be available than government funding. In fact, in general our government is already broke and overspending.

&gt;I don't know if I could even imagine a more myopic or absurd suggestion. 

The overwhelming number of new Pharmaceuticals and other medical inventions and advancements have been made in the US because of our structure. Free markets have been proven to be the best thing for everybody in general. History has already proven this. Our poorest people are better off then the average person in the former USSR, even though there everybody was legally guaranteed all the healthcare and basic necessities.

In other words, history proved me right already. As far as I'm concerned, this debate was settled years and years ago. We already ran the experiment, and we already discovered what is best for everybody. 

Free markets may not make everybody rich, but at least they stop everyone from becoming poor.

&gt;There is one thing that people who have wealth will do, fight to keep more of their money. 

People like Bill Gates, the richest person in the world, have already proved us wrong. Again, history has already proven my point.

&gt;Hell, why not let the DOT be funded by charity? 

Not charity, free markets. Free markets have built much larger engineering projects than anything that ever done by the DOT in Alaska.

&gt; people not being able to afford insulin is someone else's problem.  

* You: poor people are not my problem. The rich can pay for that with their taxes.

* Me: people should be charitable and help out the poor.

How you can take those two positions, and make *me* the selfish bad guy only proves how little you care about helping the poor.",1583620583,fjuvb8p

10407,AssGremlin,"What was the weather like in those situations? I've had this feeling of lingering dread when visiting certain new locations (not AK), and both times the weather was overcast. However, said weather was overcast everywhere along the route during each of those separate trips (where I covered approximately 800 + miles in a single day, so I experienced large swaths of very varied terrain in multiple states, and never felt that same feeling).

In addition, what is the topography like? In both cases, the locations were in valley-like situations or surrounded by significant elevation differences to the sides. Maybe it has something to do with atmospheric pressure variation as well, which can absolutely cause a variety of impacts on humans or animals - which is backed by studies and data.

I think that such specific confluences of meteorological and topographical features can play a role in these types of feelings. Find a topographical map of the areas in question and see if you can find out some common or specific patterns, and try to remember what the weather was like on each day.

I think these types of discussions are very interesting and trying to figure out a rational perspective is great, it just really sucks that so many of them are started by really insubstantial conversation threads talking about the mystical or ethereal. Our perception of the environment has been adapted through evolutionary lines that have continued unbroken (obviously, since we're here, but it bears reiterating) for hundreds of millions of years. Maybe that rogue feeling you get of anxiety is in reality you expressing something more than other individuals from external stimuli, where say for example (and I 100% will admit I'm just trying to find associations without proof here) that those organisms that could sense locations that were prone to adverse weather because of topography got that sensation, avoided it, and didn't get struck by lightning/die in a flash flood/tornado, and continued on.

And the funny thing is, I actually ascribe to some ""mystical and ethereal"" beliefs myself, I just think that so much of this stuff can be ascribed to logic that we should always try to figure stuff out instead of asking about ghost stories or local folklore (but of course folklore and myth are often shrouded in actual events, ie the great flood stories from multiple religions and cultures being potentially linked to post glacial period melting and subsequent catastrophic flooding in certain locations or generalized in shorelines across the world).",1583690125,fjy5b37

No. I am very precise with what I say. I value precision and accuracy. I have never ever said anything remotely racist. 

&gt; Then why do you support racists and deny racism when it‚Äôs obvious? 

""Obvious"". 

See, this is the bigotry I'm talking about. I know it's ironic, so I'll be very precise with my words:

""Obvious"" would be if someone said ""black people are less evolved than whites, and are closer to chimpanzees than real humans.""

I've heard someone make that argument. I found it ludicrous and absurd, but he was sincere, and extremely racist. But this is a good example of ""obvious racism.""

Now, this discussion stated with a politician who said that some people living in villages have taken advantage of government programs that give them free air travel for abortions. He didn't even mention race, and race was irrelevant to the topic at hand and the point he was trying to make. 

But, you had to assume that 1) he was lying, 2) he was talking about natives specifically, not people living in villages, and 3) his intent was group all natives together, so by targeting some of them, he was implicating all of them.

So, to you, these assumptions are ""obvious."" 

That is the key to this whole discussion. You think it's ""obvious"" that he was lying, that he was targeting natives (not just people in villages), and that his intent was to insult a race by insulting individuals of that race. All of those are somehow ""obvious"" to you. 

I personally find these assumptions categorically absurd and unfounded, and I see no evidence for them. 

So, in conclusion, why would you make unfounded assumptions about the politician? Because you hate conservatives and assume they're racist. This is called ""bigotry"" when you make unfounded incredibly insulting and extremely negative assumptions about people based on where they grew up or what political party they support. 

&gt;Also, newsflash, native Americans can be racist too.

So, would it be correct to assume that because you just said natives can be racist, you're insulting all natives and therefore you are racist yourself? 

Your statement that ""native Americans can be racist"" is more implicating than anything the politician said, because he didn't even mention race.",1583694132,fjycri3

Now hold on a minute.  Yes, Walker reduced the PFD, but most people realized that was a hard necessity, the lesser of several evils.  I didn't care for the idea, but I was solid with Walker, and I think most people I know were, too, excepting ratfucks.

The problem was, Walker's running mate got into trouble for public sexist comments and ended up resigning like a month before the election.  Walker resigned and threw his support to fucking Begich, who is a fucking moron, but it was too late by that time to take his name off the ballot.

So a lot of people ended up voting for Walker anyway (because no one fucking reads), and other people were like, Begich?  Are you kidding me? So it effectively split the vote.  *That's* why Dunleavy won, not because Walker was unpopular.",1583704115,fjyt9z8

10706,troubleschute,"And this is kind of point, actually. We sit here dispensing OUR verdict that this person should be punished with the full weight of the law and we justify that with our ignorance of her situation. The court system--judge, prosecution, defense, and jury decide what her fate should be because there are instruments for leniency or sentencing if maybe she's a kleptomaniac, drug addict, desperate to feed her kids, or just repeat offender. 

The point about my bringing up poverty is to show how the consequences shouldn't be decided by a bunch of arm-chair jurists watching arrest porn on the internet. We call for that person to be hit with not only the full weight of the law but we also get off to seeing people take some street justice  that goes way beyond the crime. 

Our perspective on crime dehumanizes the petty criminals and feeds the public outrage so that we tolerate police brutality, mandatory sentences, zero tolerance, high fines, etc., and the brunt of that legal burden is felt by the poor who are unable to pay for legal defense, restitution, or the fines imposed. Not to mention the burden of the system itself on their employment or future employment. 

So when people say, ""consequences for their actions"" but the punishments end up not fitting the crime, that's not justice. 

That's called ""manufactured consent"" to suppress an entire class (or race) of people.

10721,AlaskanWildling,"According to him, that wouldn‚Äôt be racist, so he shouldn‚Äôt mind.  Also this guy is a massive troll who‚Äôs always posting on the Alaska subreddit stirring up arguments about politics that have nothing to do with him.  He shouldn‚Äôt post if he can‚Äôt handle his own medicine.

Also, I highly suspect this account is an alt account of his considering there‚Äôs almost no activity on it and it‚Äôs highly suspicious that someone with a username with Chicago in it is interested in Alaska politics and happens to reply right after I replied on a post days old.

Go home troll.  Putin is whistling.

That's rather my problem with right-libertarianism. At a certain stage, optimistic fiction like Ayn Rand has to be set aside in the face of economies of scale and the fact that some sort of collaboration via social contract is an inevitability of human society. The efficiency gained by having everyone focus into different roles and then attempt to equitably exchange their goods and services creates a trend towards government and taxation. 

I appreciate your view, but at this point I consider the presence of an involved government to be a battle long since lost, and the pragmatic thing to do is focus on preserving individuality and personal liberties within a given system of government, which is more what left-libertarianism is all about.

It isn't all casinos, dude. That's *INCREDIBLY* fucking stereotypical, which I already tried to tell you and you keep hammering on. The tribes I mentioned own a number of assets beyond just casinos; casinos are the most visible part, but they are by no means the tribe's full holdings.

Oklahoma's tribes have interests in businesses such as supermarkets, gun shops, outdoor rec/outfitters, grain processors, hotels, restaurants, and pretty much everything else you can think of.

https://www.potawatomi.org/study-highlights-native-american-tribes-impact-on-oklahoma-economy/

&gt; The 38 federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma had a **$12.9 billion impact on the state in 2017.** The study, sponsored through the Oklahoma Tribal Finance Consortium, found that the tribes directly employ more than 50,000 people and support 96,000 jobs to tribal citizens and non-citizens, accounting for more than **$4.6 billion in wages and benefits to Oklahoma workers in 2017.** Citizen Potawatomi Nation employed 2,296 individuals with an impact of $516 million in 2017. CPN continued to grow in 2018, with 2,354 employees and a $537 million economic impact.

Zero Confirmed cases, um yeah well if your not testing except in people that are extremely sick your missing all of the carriers out there that aren't presenting symptoms. People can have it for 5-10 days before symptoms present. So that means we could have folks walking around out there that have it and haven't presented symptoms yet. There is also those that might be slightly sick or under the weather that figure they have just a mild cold. That maybe the case but with this thing it can present that was too and ignoring those folks, who are probably at work with others, is just dumb.

My point is its ridiculous that the United States can't work towards anywhere close to what a country like South Korea is doing. And yes we should be working towards getting everyone tested, But that is NOT what the CDC, Surgeon General are telling Congress right now. Just got done watching them testify and they said only people exhibiting advanced symptoms.



Am i stupid enough to think we can ramp up to getting 329 Million (Population of the U.S.) tested in a week? No, I realize it takes a bit of time to get up to speed. HOWEVER, South Korea, with less resources and people than the U.S. is able to test 10k a day. Meanwhile we test what? 20,50,100 /day? That's just pathetic.

11194,k-logg,"I don't think anyone is making the case that we are satisfied with our testing though, just that it we are taking every action necessary to improve it.  I think testing people without symptoms puts a huge strain on medical services and results in worse care for more important medical issues.  It is primarily a threat to elderly people, and people with existing heart or lung conditions, so we should keep resources available to those groups, and limit their exposure as much as possible.  Filling medical facilities with thousands of people for testing who have no symptoms is a great way to spread the virus even faster.  As far as I've seen, we have fine leadership from the people Dunleavy has in charge (Dr. Zink maybe?).  They are far more informed than me or you, and I have seen nothing to suggest that they aren't taking this seriously and doing everything possible to improve the state of testing.  Alternative suggestions are great and well worth discussion, but screaming about Dunleavy's incompetence isn't helpful.  If there is something SK is doing that can be applied here, and is not, obviously we should do that.  But we need to know what that is and evaluate whether it's a good idea here, not just point at a high number elsewhere and conclude that we are incompetent here.  SK has also spread the virus at an insane rate, which is far more important than the testing rate.  (I appreciate the civil responses, the downvotes aren't from me)",1583965458,fk8yvxg
11195,358STA,"Are they running the same test in S Korea as the CDC in the US? I could take your temperature and say I tested you. 

Remember the genome was sequenced by the Chinese 6-7 weeks ago. Your asking for 330 million tests to be developed and distributed in a month and a half with supply trains disrupted and manufacturing shut down in China. 

I don‚Äôt think testing is that useful. You have the problem of false negatives and positives, which already caused someone to be released from a quarantine facility who actually had the virus.
We need to know how long a patent needs to have to have the virus before testing positive. these questions need to be answered before testing is useful. And if a patent tests neg then becomes sick 5 days later what does that mean? 

Finally a positive test doesn‚Äôt change the medical care for a patent.",1583965965,fk8ztn6
11196,Ancient_Won,"I have no idea what they are doing for testing but I'm pretty certain its not temperature checks.  :D



So the point of testing everyone is so you can find those hidden cases that haven't shown symptoms yet. As far as a timeframe for when you develop and begin to show, from the data that's been released so far they've said they are pretty certain that it takes anywhere from 5-10 days before you start showing symptoms. During that time and prior to that time you have the potential to infect others. By testing everyone you are going to find those that haven't started exhibiting signs yet and you tell them to go home and self isolate for 14 days and all that. 
I never said a positive test changes medical care.

I work in emergency medicine (EMT) and when we get an occupational exposure they test us immediately. If we test positive they know we didn‚Äôt get sick from that exposure. If we test neg they test us again in 2 to 3 weeks to see if we test positive. 
The hold up with new tests is the world is running out of a chemical that is necessary to test for the virus. https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/5013586002 expecting 14 billion(2 per person on earth) tests in 6 weeks time is impossible. Even 327 million tests (1 per US resident) is unrealistic. 

For your plan to work you would need to test every one now and again in 5 to 10 days and not allow any one in to the area you tested.

I saw that info on the chemical shortage, but I thought there were other methods that were out there that didn't require that chemical but the CDC was dragging their feet.

He said the CDC wanted it done with this chemical but there was going to be a shortage so they had suggested during one of the conferences with the president/CDC and states governors that the CDC let them go with these other testing methods and the CDC said no. From what he was saying these are tests that China and SK and others are now doing so they are valid.

I had switched the last few years until only a few months ago to the app on the right - about a year into my current job. It's called Weather Underground. I believe it was associated with U. of Michigan. It's definitely not related to the 1970s eco-terrorists, tho both are based in Ann Arbor, MI.

It allowed you to pick your primary weather station with a click of a couple buttons in a Google map. Sometimes i wanted a station that was just a private person linked publically through a home device. Other times,  official stations like schools and airports. It also feeds from the National Weather Service for forecasting. I run a company focused in a small area outside. 

Weather Underground reduced its features a few months back to promote new premium accounts.

&gt;Failures on the Diamond Princess Shadow Another Cruise Ship Outbreak
An alert about a coronavirus infection sat in an unmonitored inbox. A cruise doctor saw ‚Äúno point‚Äù in disinfecting the ship. And Japan disregarded medical guidelines to contain an outbreak.


&gt; The email to Princess Cruises was peppered with typos and awkward grammar, but the warning was unmistakable. An 80-year-old passenger had tested positive for the new coronavirus after getting off the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Hong Kong.

&gt; ‚ÄúWould kindly inform the ship related parties and do the necessary disinfection,‚Äù Princess‚Äôs port representative wrote on Feb. 1, relaying a warning from Hong Kong health officials. ‚ÄúMany thanks!‚Äù

&gt;Nothing happened. Princess says it believes the alert sat unread in unmonitored inboxes. Grant Tarling, the company‚Äôs top doctor and the person in charge of responding to outbreaks, said he hadn‚Äôt learned about the infection until the following day ‚Äî after being alerted to a post on social media.

&gt;The fumbled alert was just the beginning of a broader breakdown by both the company and the Japanese authorities who quarantined the ship in Yokohama. **Hobbled by confusion and mistakes, they played down the risk of infection, ignored best medical practice for evacuating passengers, and activated only low-level protocols for dealing with outbreaks. Ultimately, eight people died and more than 700 were infected, including some government officials.**

I wonder if Holland America (part of Carnival just like Princess) or NCL will follow suit? 

I fully realize that port communities will probably get infected well before cruise season from residents returning to Alaska fro trips via plane.  However  if by some miracle we don't get hit, I'm  not looking forward to welcoming gobs of seasonal tourists in May to infect us.  I know lots of businesses could fold if there is no tourist season, I get the major contribution to the economy that is tourism.  Tourism summer jobs helped me gave employment during several high school &amp; colleges breaks. I have to ask what is the additional  cost *in Alaskan lives* if we allow crowds of tourists to overwhelm our shopping districts &amp; attractions?

11295,OtherSpiderOnTheWall,"I assume you're still using the same amount of toilet paper as you were before, yeah? Which means there's zero reason to change your habits. Which means neither you, nor anyone in your household, is going through 144 rolls in two weeks (fyi that would be 20 rolls per person over two weeks - an absurd amount). And also, you don't currently have enough to actually last you two weeks so you felt compelled to buy more?

And even if, by some strange alignment of the stars, you actually did go through that many rolls *and* you were infectious enough that you'd feel bad about leaving the house, you could buy more in a number of ways: Call a friend and have them buy it for you and drop it off at your house. Order it online. Venture out for a one-time purchase, being very cautious not to infect others (you don't infect others from your vehicle, for example)

Regardless, the real absurdity is that people are stocking up on toilet paper - as in, there are many people buying more than they usually do, even though they do not need it. And even if there was an actual crisis, toilet paper won't save you.

That would be impossible for our hospitals to handle as I'm sure any of the folks that work in ICU and Crit Care will be able to tell you better than I. 
A good move would be for the governor to ask all of Alaska schools to take an extra week off. This would be hard on families that rely on schools while they are at work trying to make ends meet but slowing it now while painful would be much better than the alternative.

The likelihood of someone catching it on the way up, being asymptomatic for a few days into their rotation and still shedding the virus well before they become visibly sick is considerable.   


I flew home a couple of days ago and was appalled at how many sick people chose to show up and fly in the Juneau and Ketchikan terminals.

Coronavirus in Italy tweet on March 9

[https://twitter.com/silviast9/status/1236933818654896129](https://twitter.com/silviast9/status/1236933818654896129) 

1/ I may be repeating myself, but I want to fight this sense of security that I see outside of the epicenters, as if nothing was going to happen ""here"". The media in Europe are reassuring, politicians are reassuring, while there's little to be reassured of.  

2/ This is the English translation of a post of another ICU physician in Bergamo, Dr. Daniele Macchini. Read until the end ""After much thought about whether and what to write about what is happening to us, I felt that silence was not responsible.

3/ I will therefore try to convey to people far from our reality what we are living in Bergamo in these days of Covid-19 pandemic. I understand the need not to create panic, but when the message of the dangerousness of what is happening does not reach people I shudder.  

4/ I myself watched with some amazement the reorganization of the entire hospital in the past week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities were interrupted, intensive care were freed up to create as many beds as possible.

5/ All this rapid transformation brought an atmosphere of silence and surreal emptiness to the corridors of the hospital that we did not yet understand, waiting for a war that was yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would ever come with such ferocity.  

6/ I still remember my night call a week ago when I was waiting for the results of a swab. When I think about it, my anxiety over one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I've seen what's happening. Well, the situation now is dramatic to say the least.  

7/ The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. But now that need for beds has arrived in all its drama. One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace.  

8/ The boards with the names of the patients, of different colours depending on the operating unit, are now all red and instead of surgery you see the diagnosis, which is always the damned same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia.  

9/ Now, explain to me which flu virus causes such a rapid drama.  And while there are still people who boast of not being afraid by ignoring directions, protesting because their normal routine is""temporarily"" put in crisis,  

10/ the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.  

11/ Cases are multiplying, we arrive at a rate of 15-20 admissions per day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the E.R. is collapsing. 

12/ Reasons for the access always the same: fever and breathing difficulties, fever and cough, respiratory failure. Radiology reports always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All to be hospitalized.  

13/ Someone already to be intubated and go to intensive care. For others it's too late... Every ventilator becomes like gold: those in operating theatres that have now suspended their non-urgent activity become intensive care places that did not exist before.  

14/ The staff is exhausted. I saw the tiredness on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already exhausting workloads they had. I saw a solidarity of all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?""  

15/ Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can't save everyone, and the vital parameters of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny.  

16/ There are no more shifts, no more hours. Social life is suspended for us. We no longer see our families for fear of infecting them. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols.

17/ Some of our colleagues who are infected also have infected relatives and some of their relatives are already struggling between life and death. So be patient, you can't go to the theatre, museums or the gym. Try to have pity on the myriad of old people you could exterminate.  

18/ We just try to make ourselves useful. You should do the same: we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share this message. We must spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.""  

20/ I finish by saying that I really don't understand this war on panic. The only reason I see is mask shortages, but there's no mask on sale anymore. We don't have a lot of studies, but is it panic really worse than neglect and carelessness during an epidemic of this sort?",1584056070,fkcm6os

I was a chef and worked in professional kitchens for 25 years.   I've hired people who graduated from the UA system, and the level of training is inferior to an equivalent amount of on-the-job training from a decent working kitchen. For example, the UA program doesn't teach a candidate punctuality, or how to move in a kitchen or instill in them the need to cultivate a sense of urgency, all of which are essential qualities in an apprentice cook.  About all the UA program does is teach candidates how to use a knife and make a chicken stock. When hiring, I'll take a person with the former skills over the latter.

Coronavirus in Italy tweet on March 9

[https://twitter.com/silviast9/status/1236933818654896129](https://twitter.com/silviast9/status/1236933818654896129) 

1/ I may be repeating myself, but I want to fight this sense of security that I see outside of the epicenters, as if nothing was going to happen ""here"". The media in Europe are reassuring, politicians are reassuring, while there's little to be reassured of.  

2/ This is the English translation of a post of another ICU physician in Bergamo, Dr. Daniele Macchini. Read until the end ""After much thought about whether and what to write about what is happening to us, I felt that silence was not responsible.

3/ I will therefore try to convey to people far from our reality what we are living in Bergamo in these days of Covid-19 pandemic. I understand the need not to create panic, but when the message of the dangerousness of what is happening does not reach people I shudder.  

4/ I myself watched with some amazement the reorganization of the entire hospital in the past week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities were interrupted, intensive care were freed up to create as many beds as possible.

5/ All this rapid transformation brought an atmosphere of silence and surreal emptiness to the corridors of the hospital that we did not yet understand, waiting for a war that was yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would ever come with such ferocity.  

6/ I still remember my night call a week ago when I was waiting for the results of a swab. When I think about it, my anxiety over one possible case seems almost ridiculous and unjustified, now that I've seen what's happening. Well, the situation now is dramatic to say the least.  

7/ The war has literally exploded and battles are uninterrupted day and night. But now that need for beds has arrived in all its drama. One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace.  

8/ The boards with the names of the patients, of different colours depending on the operating unit, are now all red and instead of surgery you see the diagnosis, which is always the damned same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia.  

9/ Now, explain to me which flu virus causes such a rapid drama.  And while there are still people who boast of not being afraid by ignoring directions, protesting because their normal routine is""temporarily"" put in crisis,  

10/ the epidemiological disaster is taking place. And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.  

11/ Cases are multiplying, we arrive at a rate of 15-20 admissions per day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the E.R. is collapsing. 

12/ Reasons for the access always the same: fever and breathing difficulties, fever and cough, respiratory failure. Radiology reports always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All to be hospitalized.  

13/ Someone already to be intubated and go to intensive care. For others it's too late... Every ventilator becomes like gold: those in operating theatres that have now suspended their non-urgent activity become intensive care places that did not exist before.  

14/ The staff is exhausted. I saw the tiredness on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already exhausting workloads they had. I saw a solidarity of all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask ""what can I do for you now?""  

15/ Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can't save everyone, and the vital parameters of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny.  

16/ There are no more shifts, no more hours. Social life is suspended for us. We no longer see our families for fear of infecting them. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols.

17/ Some of our colleagues who are infected also have infected relatives and some of their relatives are already struggling between life and death. So be patient, you can't go to the theatre, museums or the gym. Try to have pity on the myriad of old people you could exterminate.  

18/ We just try to make ourselves useful. You should do the same: we influence the life and death of a few dozen people. You with yours, many more. Please share this message. We must spread the word to prevent what is happening here from happening all over Italy.""  

20/ I finish by saying that I really don't understand this war on panic. The only reason I see is mask shortages, but there's no mask on sale anymore. We don't have a lot of studies, but is it panic really worse than neglect and carelessness during an epidemic of this sort?",1584065532,fkd0nqv

&gt;President Trump in an early morning tweet on Monday accused the ""Fake News Media"" and Democrats of trying ‚Äúto inflame‚Äù the coronavirus outbreak as the virus spreads globally and across the U.S. 

&gt;‚ÄùThe Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant,‚Äù Trump tweeted. 

&gt;‚ÄùSurgeon General, 'The risk is low to the average American,‚Äô‚Äù Trump added. 


And...

&gt;During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax."" During the speech he also seemed to downplay the severity of the outbreak, comparing it to the common flu.

But wait there‚Äôs more!

&gt; White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham appeared on Fox &amp; Friends, she condemned the media for using the virus ‚Äúas a tool to politicize things and to scare people.‚Äù

4/ I myself watched with some amazement the reorganization of the entire hospital in the past week, when our current enemy was still in the shadows: the wards slowly ""emptied"", elective activities were interrupted, intensive care were freed up to create as many beds as possible.

Exactly. While there's a chance he has both Coronavirus and something else, the clinics response is actually brilliant. They can't test him for Coronavirus directly, so instead they give him treatment that will only work if he doesn't have Coronavirus.

If he has Coronavirus, I can almost guarantee he'll feel the same or worse in two days. If he has something susceptible to the antibiotics, then he'll feel better in two days.

Thus, without being able to test for Coronavirus, they're nevertheless both doing so (in a roundabout way) and treating him in case it's not Coronavirus (and if it was, there is no treatment anyway).

11783,pepperelijah,"I'm telling you they totally can handle it. I have unlimited internet. They aren't offering that as part of a lottery system. I've worked in IT for 15 years, went to college for NETWORKING.

The reason they don't offer unlimited  internet for 1000$ a month, is because of the bad press that would follow. As the highest internet costs per month, you'd be on every list and sensationalized story you don't want to be on. 

If you offer unlimited internet everywhere, where do you go from there? How do you plan promotions, ""deals"", sign-up bonuses, etc.

The don't offer it everywhere as well as the aforementioned, is because if you have a highway with 10 lanes, and you use all 10 lens, you have to maintain all 10 lanes. Lanes here being the connection between cities, towns, and villages. 

But if you have 10 lanes, use 1 lane, and only maintain 1 you save money. Now, if you have 10 lanes, use 1 lane, and then open 2 and *magically* double everyone's speed during tough times, well now you're AT&amp;T. 

The trunks connecting villages/cities are fiberoptic, that's 10Gbps. Your GCI router can go as high as 1Gbps (supposedly that's what I'm paying for, have never seen those numbers), and as low as 10Mbps. I work for a company that has offices all over the state, and 10-15Mbps is what I usually see for places like Nome, Kodiak, Barrow (I can't spell its real name sorry).

Anyways, 10 Mbps, is 0.00125 Gbps. That's one household/office, for one strand of fiber, in one trunk. There are HUNDREDS of strands of fiber in a trunk. So one strand can handle 10 Gbps. 10 Giga Bits Per Second. And your modem is accessing 10 Mega Bits Per Second.

Giga= 1,000,000,000
Mega=1,000,000

The equipment used in conjunction with fiberoptics can handle the throughput of fiber optics. 

The facts are plain as day, GCI will fight tooth and nail to charge insane prices for internet, under the guise of ""iTs aLasKa, rEmOtE aREas is hARd"". GCI can more than handle the bandwidth of a million people,  something this state struggles to achieve even in the summer. 

It breaks down to a few key points. 

1. How much can we charge for the least amount of work.

2. How high can we get the prices before people complain enough to the people who matter.

3. What is the most we can build, but least we have to maintain. 

4. How do we already have something available, for the next 10 years, to offer people when sales are down, or people leave to a different ISP.

No.

No.

You're...  woefully under-educated for somebody insisting on having ""experience"" in the ""IT"" sector.

Satellite is a shared medium, with the total bandwidth dictated by the number of transponders available on a particular bird, and the resulting bandwidth limited by the angle of incidence to the groundstation, the height of the bird above earth, the encoding methods of the signals, and the technology used for the signal.

Classic satellite was ""one-up/one-down"" per transponder.  Expensive and limited.   Newer technologies allow for  one-up/many-down, increasing the downlink bandwidth - however that downlink is now shared across multiple groundstations.   Go look up DVB/TDMA satellite solutions.  You'll see what stregths and weaknesses there are.

Now go look at the geosynchronous orbits for satellites that can reach Alaska's north slope.   Not many, right?   And it's not like there's a satellite per company.  It's...  a handful of transponders that are leased from the satellite management company.

you keep using this phrase ""trunk cables""  - i do not think this means what you think it means.   

You probably want to look up undersea fiber carrying capacity per strand, maximum dispersal patterns of the laser lamdas,  passive vs active regen amplifiers....

That is because wood is renewable, while steel uses non-renewable mined resources, and concrete produces *massive* amounts of CO2 (while being reinforced with steel anyway).

And if you're talking climate change, then trees sequester carbon by absorbing it out of the air and turning it into the wood.

Given the potential changes to the SE forests, there have been several lectures across the state from national experts addressing these topics. Disturbing natural forest turnover by harvesting timber results in permanent alterations to the ecosystem that cause a significant decrease in carbon sequestration capability of the area. Several of these studies were conducted here in southeast Alaska. We also recently had a climate scientist on reddit explain the finer points of carbon sequestration in Alaska bogs and forests. Pretty enlightening, can dig around for the link if you are interested.

Anyways, your statement is notably false. Or intentionally obtuse. Perhaps you‚Äôre arguing that old growth should be spared and the previous logged forest should be harvested, but this is not proposal that was blocked. Go to a lecture.

11997,MarriedEngineer,"&gt; No research supports your statement. 

I already [linked an article about how young forests can store ""enormous amounts of carbon"" and that this has been minimized by some parties.](https://www.climatecentral.org/news/young-forests-store-enormous-amounts-carbon-20348) And the fact that timber is a renewable resource is self evident and nobody disagrees with that. Mined resources are not renewable, and again, nobody disagrees with that.

I never said it's the ""greenest"" technology (which is up for debate), but it's a growing field with massive innovations regarding glulam and curved beams and things like that, which not only makes it useful for houses, but also large spans, beams, and larger and taller buildings. Because of these changes, there have been moves to push towards more timber construction from an environmental perspective. [Here's another article from Yale about the debate, presenting both sides.](https://e360.yale.edu/features/as-mass-timber-takes-off-how-green-is-this-new-building-material) There's a pretty strong argument that in the short term, timber construction isn't better, but in the long term, it is.

There is also a question about sizing and strength of wood from new forests and young fast-growing wood, as to whether it should be de-rated compared to older wood. Data are a combination of studies over decades, and a closer analysis shows that the newer wood isn't comparable and thus factors are not accounting for how younger wood is weaker. There are applications that would benefit from older wood.

But you don't know any of this because you only listen to one side of the discussion and don't pay any attention to anybody that contradicts your predetermined conclusions. For example, I remember you specifically because I'm pro vaccine, and have repeatedly told you I'm pro vaccine, yet you have stalked me before so you can tell everyone I'm antivax for no apparent reason. Do you realize how crazy that makes you? Do you realize how crazy it is to follow someone around just so you can lie about them?

12030,OtherSpiderOnTheWall,"Testing seems to have been the biggest issue. I've seen some numbers as high as $900 per test (whether that's just one or a duplicate), albeit I haven't validated it. And the amount of tests available are limited too.

So we definitely can't test everyone right now, although there's work being done to make that more plausible. That then leaves us with when it's reasonable to test. Sometimes criteria have been self-fulfilling: e.g. if you only test people who visit northern Italy, then all your positives will be people who visited northern Italy.

In OPs case, I'm going to simultaneously presume the doctor knows what they're doing while also assuming that they still have limited tools to test. So if OPs symptoms present such that they could be something else, I can see the logic in saving the test for later - either for if OP doesn't get better or for someone with better matching symptoms.

Maybe the doctor made a mistake. That's possible too.

Unfortunately, as people know, asymptomatic people can also spread the disease. But we *can't* test everyone, so the only way we can reliably catch asymptomatic people in Alaska is to test everyone who has been in close contact with a person who has tested positive. And if our tests are limited, that means holding off on testing.

But it's ultimately up to the doctor. They still aren't required to test you.",1584162268,fkgk1gx

&gt; The Na-Den√©, Inuit and Indigenous Alaskan populations... are distinct from other indigenous Amerindians with various mtDNA and atDNA mutations. This suggests that the peoples who first settled in the northern extremes of North America and Greenland derived from later migrant populations than those who penetrated farther south in the Americas.",1584213872,fki8495
12144,WikiTextBot,"**Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas**

The genetic history of Indigenous peoples of the Americas (also named Amerindians or Amerinds in physical anthropology) is divided into two sharply distinct episodes: 

the initial peopling of the Americas during about 20,000 to 14,000 years ago (20‚Äì14 kya), and European contact, after about 500 years ago. The former is the determinant factor for the number of genetic lineages, zygosity mutations and founding haplotypes present in today's Indigenous Amerindian populations.

They later dispersed throughout the Americas after about 16,000 years ago (an exception are the Na Dene and Eskimo‚ÄìAleut speaking groups, which are partially derived from Siberian populations which entered the Americas at a later time).In the early 2000s, archaeogenetics was primarily based on Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups and Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. Autosomal ""atDNA"" markers are also used, but differ from mtDNA or Y-DNA in that they overlap significantly.Analyses of genetics among Amerindian and Siberian populations have been used to argue for early isolation of founding populations on Beringia and for later, more rapid migration from Siberia through Beringia into the New World.

We should have all industries working to fight this with all of our resources at the countries disposal. No business should be exempt from helping.

# Dear student

The corona pandemic is developing rapidly and we are in a serious and increasingly unpredictable situation. Today, the [Ministry  of Foreign Affairs (UD) has therefore advised all Norwegian citizens  travelling abroad to consider returning home as soon as possible](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/frarader-reiser-som-ikke-er-strengt-nodvendige-til-alle-land/id2693564/) (only available in Norwegian) in consultation with their travel agency or airline.

At the same time, the Prime Minister has announced that Norwegian  airports and harbours will be closed from Monday, but she has also  promised that Norwegians will be able to return home.¬†

### Recommend that you travel home to Norway

**In line with the advice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  I, as NTNU‚Äôs Rector, strongly recommend that all NTNU students who are  outside Norway return home.** 

This applies especially if you are staying in a country with poorly  developed health services. This also applies for countries with poorly  developed collective infrastructure, for example the USA, where it can  be difficult to get transport to the airport if you don't have a car.  The same applies if you don't have health insurance.¬†",1584309492,fklly02

12504,Trenduin,"I see lots of people here hating on the bus system, and while it could use some improvements and definitely isn't perfect, I don't think it deserves quite as much hate as it gets.  Especially if you live and work near one of the 4 frequent routes, (10, 20, 30 and 40) the bus is very reliable.

My partner uses it often and the buses arrive on those routes every 15 minutes and are very rarely late.  For the other routes you can actually check [where the bus actually is on the online map](http://bustracker.muni.org/InfoPoint/) to judge when to head to your stop to wait.  

The people that got screwed are the ones that live far away from any of the neighborhood routes and now have to walk far to get to a bus, or people with mobility issues that have trouble walking to a stop, which I think as a city we should address.  AnchorRIDES helps but isn't adequate enough.

If so OP the cheapest place to move is Anchorage as shipping freight is the cheapest going there and you‚Äôre able to drive up with a working vehicle and food/healthcare/gas/and other essential and non essential services are cheapest due to it being ‚ÄúThe Hub‚Äù to go anywhere in Alaska.

My apologies if this is your intent OP but questions about moving to Alaska get annoying to the point of toxicity due to tourists and out of staters glorifying what is basically hardship and drawbacks in daily life. Thinking the frugal lifestyle myth Alaska has means less spending and an easy life. No one talks about the rate of Unaliving, the STD rates, the violent crime, the forced reproduction rate, and the higher living expenses with the same wages you‚Äôd find in the lower 48. If you want a style of media that‚Äôs about as ‚Äúreal‚Äù as Alaska life gets, Frozen Grounds is a good movie to get a baseline.",1584393194,fkoqzzu

12538,troubleschute,"Heard a few people bitching about these measures but doing this after an infection gets a beachhead into the community is too late. With a butt ton of people coming back from spring break trips right now, it's definitely the best timing to do as much as we can as a stop-gap because it's almost a certainty that a handful of people are carrying it and back in Anchorage. 

This new measure, though, definitely sucks the most for anyone earning their way with tips in the server scene--bartenders, wait staff, etc. Gonna try to buy some take-out from the local joints who don't have chain money behind them. Hopefully, the wait folks will get a break as delivery people (though that's hard to pull off with liabilities and red tape). 

Musicians and performers are really getting a kick in the balls, too. Gig cancellations hurt. Lots of musicians make ends meet with teaching, too. 

The supply chain looks like it's pretty resilient for now so stop hoarding TP and stuff. Try not to buy up all the stuff that's labeled for WIC. Keep calm.",1584393661,fkorrgl

No they won't. There's **no way** the cuts are worse than any alternative. They are the best solution with the fewest drawbacks. Anything else will hurt people more.

12735,MarriedEngineer,"&gt; You know when a good time to raise taxes is?

Never. Tax rates should be capped, and that cap should be low. We should have surplus in good times, and have booming economies unencumbered by increased tax rates that suppress and kill those gains. If anything, the government should become a net lender during good times, and/or save for harder times.

There *is* an argument that tax rates should be lowered in hard times, so you would technically raise them back when the recession/depression is over, but that *isn't* just raising taxes because the economy is good and you think it can handle more taxation.

&gt;so that the government has money to fund things to boost the economy in struggling times

This is Keynesian economics, and Keynesian economics is garbage. Activist fiscal policies are almost uniformly bad, with negative outcomes. The government should not be trying to fund the economy in downturns. This ""cure"" is worse than the disease.

There may be an argument for cases of national security, but just general things like the stimulus package of 2009? Utter waste of money that just added more debt for no benefit.

Companies not only *have* left tens to hundreds of millions of dollars on the table and left, but have done so *recently.*

Are they going to stop pumping oil in places they are already operating? Not now. But they can *and will* leave Alaska if it becomes unprofitable.

And the point is, some think we are subsidizing oil companies. We are not. We are taxing them. We are giving some tax breaks for specific things, but that is a **reduction** in taxes, not actually giving any money to oil companies. So if you think we should end tax breaks and/or raise taxes on oil companies, we *will* have companies cut production, end exploration, or even leave the state.",1584475646,fkrtdho

12753,MarriedEngineer,"&gt; Increasing state revenue is the only way to fund state services.

Then cut back those services. As I've said, Alaska currently has the highest per-capita spending in the US. Sure, we're rural and remote, but that doesn't justify the incredibly high spending to this degree.

So I don't think you realize this: **We can slash spending and STILL have tons of spending.**

&gt;Or we could confiscate the PFD and use it like a tax. Since you're hardcore right wing and against redistribution of income, handouts, and welfare, that should sound great to you right? 

I have always opposed the PFD. But I have also always said that **if** that money is going to be obtained, **then** the PFD payouts are preferable to the government spending the money. Or, they could save the money and give it out later. Either way, they shouldn't spend it. That's not only foolish, but violates the entire intent of the PFD.

(Also, I'm not against handouts or welfare. I'm against *government* handouts and *government* welfare. I find it incredibly disingenous to try portraying the right as ""anti welfare"" even though studies and polls have shown we are *more* generous with our money than liberals.)",1584476331,fkruknf

Okay, I'll try to simplify this to the basics: The government should not be ""investing"" in the economy. Keynesian economics is complex, but a fundamental aspect of Keynesian economics is that you increase government spending in economic downturns to spur economic growth.

I said this is foolish policy. As an example, I brought up the stimulus package of 2009 of what *not* to do. I said it had no notable positive effect, but came at enormous cost. The economic recovery was the slowest the US has ever come out of a recession.

No, it is not debatable that it is real. In order to argue it is not real, you'd have to believe one of the following:

* It is possible to receive taxes with a zero tax rate.

* Governments do not receive taxes with tax rates between 0% and 100%.

* It is possible to get significant tax revenue and/or raise tax revenue with a 100% tax rate.

Everyone that works for the government that can work from home should have been doing it a week or more ago. A functioning government is one of the things that can help mitigate this pandemic. 

Coordination and response from government and private industry could be severely hampered if even 25% of state and local public servants are unable to do their jobs. That would mean putting even more lives at risk.

13094,Peliquin,"My own tip pertains to bathing. I know lots of people go to a public or friend's shower, or take a TPA (tits, pits, ass) bird bath. My tip is for a more in-depth clean that will last several days, and only uses about a 1 and 1/2 or 2 gallons of water.

You will need:

1. A scrubby, loufah, or washcloth  
2. A tub of some sort, large enough to squat in. (Roughnecks work well.)  
3. A 3-gallon bucket   
4. A coffee cup  
5. About 3/4 gallon boiled water.  
6. A towel and a washcloth for rinse and dry off.
7. Soap/Shampoo/toiletries
8. A vat of lotion
9. (Optional) A space heater  

Instructions:

Place the tub in front of the space heater, stove, or oven. (This is a cold job if you don't.) Next, fill the 3-gallon bucket with some cold water, and pour in the gallon of boiled water. Mix in cold water to suit. (I find it's best if this is hotter than a normal shower.) Pour a little bit of the water (two or three cups worth) back into the pot, or another bucket. Set both buckets in the tub. 

Undress, and lean over the mostly full bucket, using the coffee cup, rinse your hair. Soap up hair and rinse it out into the mostly empty bucket (this is your soapy water/bathwater.) Repeat to condition if desired, always taking clean water to the soapy water bucket, not the other way around.

When you finish washing your hair, take the clean bucket out of the tub. Climb in. It's easiest to squat, in my opinion. Using the sponge, loofah, or washcloth, dunk it into the wash water, and scrub your body down, avoiding the pits and crotch for now. Do those last. Add clean water as needed. When you are done scrubbing the body and face, then do the pits and bits, saving the rear for last. (This will contaminate your cloth and soapy water with potential fecal matter.)

When done washing, use the 'rinse' washcloth by dunking it in the clean water and washing/wiping yourself down. To rinse the crotch and rear, fill the coffee cup with water and dump it over your lower back to rinse out the crack, or use the 'splash' method with hand. Wash your hands now. If there is leftover rinse water, either save it for laundry, or dump it over your head for a final solid rinse.

When you are done, dry off, and slap on a lot of lotion. This method dries out my skin more than a normal shower, so I find that more lotion is needed. Dry and cracked skin is a vector for illness and infection, and that's just what we're trying to avoid.

At the end of your bath, the soapy water bucket or pot needs to be sanitized and your washcloth or scrubby may need the same. I use a pot so I can just boil some water in it before returning it for use. If you used a bucket, you may sanitize with hot salt water.",1584562689,fkv5u5f

&gt;***New Voluntary 28-day Deferral Request in Response to Chinese Novel Coronavirus/ COVID-19***  
&gt;  
&gt;*Blood Bank of Alaska (BBA) along with other blood banks across the United States is monitoring the evolving situation regarding the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, also known as* ***Wuhan*** *Virus and COVID-19, a new strain of viral respiratory infection, which began in* ***Wuhan City, (Communist) China***\*. There continues to be a significant increase in the number of people infected with this virus in and across mainland\* ***Communist China***\*, Europe and other international locations.\*

They've since reworded it a bit, and removed one of the ""Communist"" references.  Still stupid and unhelpful.

This is one of the dumbest things I've ever read. The virus is from Wuhan China. It's China's fault. The Chinese communist government is largely at fault, as they have been for SARS, bird flu, Asian flu and swine fever. And not only are they responsible for the outbreak, but they're responsible for horrible human rights abuses this very moment. They're an evil tyrannical Communist system that kills and has killed tens of millions.

Also, the Blood Bank's job is to be informative. So if someone doesn't recognize ""COVID-19"" but *does* recognize ""Wuhan Virus"", it is recognizable. Also, it shows up in searches, if you want more info.

Seriously, the WHO's job is to talk about health. Not to parrot left-wing social activists and virtue signal.

The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is an agreement among a group of U.S. states and the District of Columbia to award all their electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The compact is designed to ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide is elected president, and it would come into effect only when it would guarantee that outcome. As of March 2020, it has been adopted by fifteen states and the District of Columbia. Together, they have 196 electoral votes, which is 36% of the Electoral College and 73% of the 270 votes needed to give the compact legal force.

Spring break, Valentine trips, Iditarod?  People who completely asymptomatic and were spreading it? People who maybe got a sniffle and thought it was nothing? 

We can be certain it is in our community. We just don't know how deep int the community it already is. 

Which brings us to the point that we also are not a self-sustaining community. We rely on food coming in, and other supplies. Medicine. Hell, we just did a big sled dog race about that one - supplies have to come in. We have to allow for the risk. 

We can minimize it with rapid testing, quarantine, social distancing. But we can't eliminate it entirely. But our medical system only has so much to work with. That's our bottleneck, and why we're social distancing.

What we are doing is *delaying* the curve.

So if the quarantine and shutdowns start ramping back up, as people realize that going without work will destroy their careers and livelihoods, then the curve will resume, and we will not have flattened the curve. 

Hypothetically, a delay could allow time for resources to be allocated, or for summer to possibly slow its spread, or for a vaccine/treatment to be developed, but I don't think these are significant enough factors to justify this shutdown. We're harming people who really need jobs and work, and I don't think it's justified.",1584575214,fkvritx

13217,NotAnotherWhatever,"I don't know how to copy from a screencap on Twitter, but I can C/P it: 

In these days of COVID-19 concern, I figured it was best if  Ketchikan had good information, based in fact, from the source, and not  based on conjecture and silly rumor. So, here's what we do know: I was  confirmed this afternoon to have the COVID-19 virus. I‚Äôve been directed  by Public Health to stay in my home until further notice from them. We  don't know the source. 

I became sick Saturday morning with  fever, headache, general achiness, and chills. Though symptoms had  largely subsided by late Sunday afternoon, in an abundance of caution, I  was swabbed at Peacehealth yesterday morning, and results came back  negative for influenza-A, influenza-B, and RSV. In essence, all of the  ‚Äúusual viruses‚Äù were non-existent. This afternoon, I received a call  from Public Health in Anchorage and they advised that I had tested  positive for COVID-19, unfortunately the first confirmed case in  Ketchikan. I answered more than an hour worth of questions hoping to  give them as much information as possible. I recounted every step of my  life since March 6 using cell records, work calendars, as well as debit  and credit card records so that Public Health could conduct as thorough  an investigation as possible. 

As it stands now, most symptoms  have subsided though I still have a heaviness in my chest, akin to a  mild bronchitis. It feels like what most here know to be a mild case of  Ketchikan crud. For the most part, symptoms had subsided 36-hours after  onset and I felt pretty good.

I have talked with Public Health  again since this afternoon and they are working hard to contact anyone  who had meaningful contact with me in order to provide appropriate  guidance. I have no idea where I caught it and I interacted with no one  in recent weeks who was exhibiting obvious symptoms. I apologize for  causing undue concern for anyone, especially my co-workers at the  Borough. They are a great team of people, committed to serving the  public the best way possible. I would ask that everyone simply stay on  the lookout for the same early onset symptoms - fever, chills, and  headache. If you experience them, isolate yourself. I would also ask  that you join me and all of Ketchikan to actively minimize community  transmission so that we can protect our seniors or other medically  vulnerable folks in Ketchikan. I pray that we all make it through this  largely unharmed, and together.",1584576109,fkvt0ju

It takes time to get home from vacation, by the time you're home and unpacked one of the kiddos has sniffles, so you're not running out right away to go see the grandparents. When you finally do, then they have an incubation period before THEY start being symptomatic. 

I mean, doing the math on it, assuming it's been here a few weeks at least, it should be hitting the populations where it's problematic soon, but not necessarily yet.

I'm using the kind of logic I'd use for a flu, or a nasty cold, though. I'm not a medical expert - I've just been reading up on it.

Racism is hatred for a person due to their skin color. Accurately labeling a virus by its origin is not racism.

In addition, the Chinese Communist Party is an evil authoritarian regime run by an autocrat that squashes dissent among its people. Their people do not have any freedoms at all. The CCP is responsible for SARS, the bird flu, swine flu, and now COVID-19 because they refuse to spend an ounce of their authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese wet markets where people eat bats and civets and other animals that should not be consumed by humans.

When we are done fighting this virus, the United States government needs to grow some balls and have serious discussion about how China is going to pay for this. They are belligerents in the world. They are ruining the global economy with this virus. They steal intellectual property. They are a currency manipulator. They hack our intelligence agencies and our large corporations (Equifax in 2017, target in 2013). They currently are looking to effectively take over the world economy with their belt and road initiative, which most people have not heard of because the lamestream media is too busy reporting on how Trump is a very very bad man.

Fuck China.

Oh and one last thing, it is funny to call it the WuFlu, or Kungflu, or any other nickname.

Enough with the leftist bullshit. Crisis always serves the political left. You already have elected officials in Los Angeles and New York saying they are going to release criminals from jail cells due to this virus. In what universe does that make any sense? You can be arrested, in Los Angeles, if you associate with someone that you do not live with. Do you think that's constitutional?

Every single thing devolves to one recurring and salient theme. Orange man bad.

That's it. People hate Trump so much they will use anything and everything to make it about him in some way. First it was Russia, then it was Comey, then it was Mueller would get him on Russia, then it was Kavanaugh, then immediately when Mueller said there was no collusion they said but wait there's obstruction, then Mueller said he couldn't determine if there was obstruction, Barr said there wasn't, then they said its Barr is corrupt and should resign, then they said it was the phone call, then they said it was obstruction again, then they impeached, then he was acquitted, then they said we should impeach again, and now the coronavirus comes along and it's all ""Trump is terrible and can't lead"" even though his plan is identical to what Biden gave a speech on, and these same experts praise Biden while insulting Trump, and then they claim Trump is being racist by calling the virus Chinese.

13374,k-logg,"I just explained that.  Your link is a summary of an interview with a NYT journalist trying to sell a book.  Using heavily flawed logic to support his agenda, he also fails to acknowledge the dangers of mob rule, which was my entire point, and the entire reason that the electoral college was established.  He claims that 10-12 battleground states decide the election, but doesn't acknowledge that requires overwhelming support in a number of additional, non-battleground states, and that, with a popular vote it's more like 3 or 4 states deciding the election by themselves.  If there is a point you are trying to make with that link, please just make it yourself instead of parroting someone else's opinion.  

To restate my previous comment, mob rule is dangerous, and that is what a popular vote accomplishes.  To win a popular vote, you only need to represent a couple of the largest population centers, and appealing to Alaskans is a complete waste of time.  

There is a quote that says something like pure democracy is 2 wolves and a sheep voting on what to eat for lunch.  Consider this example.  State A is comprised of 3 doctors and 1 auto worker, state B has 3 teachers and 2 coal miners, and state C has 15 farmers.  Appealing to anyone but farmers as a candidate in a popular vote is foolish, as is campaigning anywhere other than state C. The vote is going to go to the candidate who promises to give more of A and B's tax dollars to farm subsidies in C.  The electoral college gives minority viewpoints a louder voice, so the majority has less control over them.  It acknowledges that representing the teachers in state B is important whether the farmers think so or not.   

Hillary won the popular vote in 2016, but did so by appealing to specific values held by relatively few places of the country, with the advantage of dense populations.  [See this map](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-us-election-results-by-county/static/margin.png).

No, they detected at first, because it started there. China started it.

&gt;They want to know precisely what is wrong with a corpse or severely ill person. They will detain you until they know. The rest of the world only starts digging when a lot of people are sick or dead.

That isn't true either. China reacted way too late, and reacted way too slowly, and it cost tons of lives.

&gt; If there is a quarantine and you violate it they send special forces to arrest you and everyone found near you. By contrast in America a kid that tested positive still had a family all around them that just went along with their normal lives, attending concerts, getting nails done, etc.

That's true.

&gt; China is brutal, horrific, and authoritarian. They are also effective.

They're not effective, because it not only is it a horrible and brutal regime, but because their public policies are foolish and backwards. They allow these backwards and unsanitary markets to run unimpeded, and they even promote pseudo-scientific ""medicine"" regarding various exotic creatures and body parts.

You think you're making some grand political statement but you're really just being an asshole. 

If you want to call the virus what it is, then call it SARS-CoV-2. The fact that you're getting so up in arms about referring to China says an awful lot about where your priorities lie. 

And no, the origin of the virus has not been pinpointed. You're hopelessly unaware if you think otherwise. The first OUTBREAK was reported in Wuhan. The origin of the virus itself is unclear, although we know that it's of natural origin, which would normally just be assumed because duh, but people with your mindset tend to seize on conspiracy theories and victim mentalities so we wasted resources on confirming that a dumb conspiracy pushed by the right-wing media. If you need to apologize for anything it's for consistently lying and misleading others.

Lol. Insane far left? Healthcare for all is insane? Most 1st world countries have a much more functional healthcare system. It‚Äôs perfect for you, but a lot of others have been fucked, or locked out by this system. I pay a shitload of money in taxes, and rather than presidential golf trips, endless war, and bailouts, I would expect a return on that investment. A decent healthcare system isn‚Äôt insane. I pay for it. 

A living wage is insane?

AOC, and Bernie Sanders have no power. The House/ Senate do not share their views, and will not be passing a universal healthcare package based on their calls for one. Red hats like yourself, will focus on individual‚Äôs statements, and scream about it all day. People on the GOP say a ton of racist, ignorant, homophobic, lies, and you‚Äôll argue the semantics of what is was supposed to mean. 

Personally, a plan that uses our tax dollars to help the people of this country, is what our tax dollars are for. If we are able to test people for this virus, and save lives...that‚Äôs a bad thing? Providing healthcare for your fellow Americans is a bad thing? Stock buybacks, and cuts for the rich are more important than American lives? 

Adjusting wages so hard working Americans can afford basics is a bad? You might be making millions, buddy, but the GOP doesn‚Äôt look out for the working class. I would like to point out, that you brought these issues up, and I wanted to address them, but again, they are not pertinent to the virus right now. 

As I pointed out, the virus doesn‚Äôt care about your political affiliation. Your business closing doesn‚Äôt care about your political affiliation. This is a problem around the world, regardless of politics. You‚Äôre only seeing what you choose to see. We‚Äôre in this together, as Americans.

13671,OniiChanStopNotThere,"Yes, the federal government forcing down our throats a $15 per hour wage is insane. There are businesses that cannot afford to pay that. A wage is a contractual agreement between the employer and the employee. If you as the employee don't like the wage, don't accept the offer and get another job. If the employer keeps getting rejected, he will raise the wage himself. This is how free markets work.

Yes, nationalized healthcare is dumb, dangerous, and it is unconstitutional. It is a form of wealth redistribution when one parties taxes goes toward paying for another parties care, and it is unfair if the party that paid taxes worked hard and saved money responsibility and the party needing healthcare took bad care of their health (e.g. obesity, alcoholism).

The healthcare system proposed by Bernie, AOC, and Warren would bankrupt the United States. Even if you forcibly took all the wealth of the top 1% (i.e. tax them at 100%) you cannot pay for it. You still cannot pay for it if you tax the top 10% at 100%. The only way you pay for it is if you tax people making as low as $40,000 55% in total realized income tax, which most people do not want to apy.

In addition to national healthcare being unaffordable, it is a terrible system. The system in Canada that everyone on the left praises as being better than the United States' system has long waiting times. It can take over a month to get a hip replacement there. 

Italy has a nationalized healthcare system. They are getting decimated by the coronavirus. A nationalized healthcare system is not a silver bullet.

Lastly, healthcare is not a right. I know you don't believe me, but nowhere in the U.S. Constitution does it talk about healthcare. Sorry not sorry, but if its not in the constitution, its not federally guaranteed to you. The story changes if the state you live in has a constitution that states healthcare as a right, but as far as I'm aware, Alaska, or any of the other 49 states, do not guarantee this as a right.

If you want to make the argument that healthcare should be a right, and the constitution should be amended to clarify this, then at least the argument is coherent, albeit still wrong. If you simply whine and complain about how you hate paying insurance companies to provide you with a product, healthcare, and instead it should be free, not only is your argument silly, but also it carries no weight.

The virus does not care about anyone's political affiliation. Nor do I. I simply refuse to kowtow to the political left and obey their ever increasingly restrictive measures on speech.

SOA simply does not have enough laptops to give to non-essential employees to allow telecommute. I know some that are in that building watching lucky individuals leaving with laptops and VPNs, while most are left to fend for themselves.

SOA should have learned after the Nov 30th earthquake to swap out all tower computers for laptops to allow telecommute in the face of a natural disaster (or pandemic). No, instead more tower computers are bought over and over.

The state needs to send everyone home and allow as many as possible to continue working from home. Failure to do so is only going to allow the virus to infect a slew of government employees, incapacitating them and seriously disrupting government functions.

But I'm not expecting to change anyone's mind, just clearing up information that seems to be misunderstood for anyone who cares.  

What is your reasoning for thinking it's skewed towards less populated states?  It almost always aligns with the popular vote, and only does not under circumstances where a candidate's support is highly concentrated in few, densely populated areas.  Trump won 84% of the counties, and represented a more politically diverse voting base.  I don't think it's fair for Hillary to win with support from only 16% of the counties.  

Like I said, a popular vote is very intuitive because it works on a small scale to a relatively homogenous group.  When applied on a large scale however, across different lifestyles and cultures, it results in a lack of fairly distributed representation.  Applied on a global scale it would be a disaster, wouldn't you agree?  China and India would have an overwhelming influence and they know very little about our way of life, cultures, and values.  Similar can be said for California and New York making decisions that impact the midwest (and Alaska for that matter).",1584653547,fkypny3

&gt;There are many countries that are very far from left politically, like China, as you like to mention. They were forced to lock down, and quarantine. This serves no political purpose to the ""left.""

&gt;Stop trying to politicize this. It's a public health problem. You will believe anything the orange man says, and dismiss everything else? 

I did not bring up Universal Healthcare, or the minimum wage. That's you. I am not talking, about Sanders, or AOC, and have noted that they are two representatives, whose policies will not be implemented. That is not the party line, but it seems to be the only thing that people like you want to scream about. You will not stop, and can't see past it, to the point where it's all you can talk about. 


&gt;Yes, the federal government forcing down our throats a $15 per hour wage is insane. There are businesses that cannot afford to pay that. A wage is a contractual agreement between the employer and the employee. If you as the employee don't like the wage, don't accept the offer and get another job. If the employer keeps getting rejected, he will raise the wage himself. This is how free markets work.

If you can't afford to pay your employees, you can't afford to operate a business. Period. That is supply, and demand. People of this country fought this battle in in the 1900's. You are advocating for corporate welfare. There are people showing up to work, and CEOS are making record profits. We subsidize  the poor through our taxes because of this. Housing, food stamps, etc. A fair wage is a stimulus for the working class. It is good for the economy. It is a better policy than the GOP trickle down economics, which is proven not to work. You're okay with bailouts, and tax cuts for the wealthy, which does not help the working class, and does little for the economy? Congress, mandated by law, gets their wages raised, as to adjust for inflation. Is it not fair to give the hard working American citizens the same deal? We're investing in the American people. The results in the places where the minimum wage has been raised has been positive, and shown to be better for business. So, your beliefs are dead wrong. You know nothing about economics, or running a small business. 


&gt;Yes, nationalized healthcare is dumb, dangerous, and it is unconstitutional. It is a form of wealth redistribution when one parties taxes goes toward paying for another parties care, and it is unfair if the party that paid taxes worked hard and saved money responsibility and the party needing healthcare took bad care of their health (e.g. obesity, alcoholism).

Wealth redistribution? Unconstitutional? lol. We all pay taxes, and get to use roads, schools, and other infrastructure. That's part of a functional country. We pay into numerous government programs such as the FDA, USDA, and many others. If you cared to do any research, or you know actually read anything aside from parroting FoxNews, and right wing talk radio nonsense, you would see that all research points to what you are claiming is dead fucking wrong. The USA has shit healthcare next to other developed countries. We would actually save money as a nation with nationalized healthcare. Nothing you said is based in fact. Period. 

&gt;The healthcare system proposed by Bernie, AOC, and Warren would bankrupt the United States. Even if you forcibly took all the wealth of the top 1% (i.e. tax them at 100%) you cannot pay for it. You still cannot pay for it if you tax the top 10% at 100%. The only way you pay for it is if you tax people making as low as $40,000 55% in total realized income tax, which most people do not want to apy.

Blah, blah, blah...You are obsessed with two people whose policies are going nowhere. 

&gt;In addition to national healthcare being unaffordable, it is a terrible system. The system in Canada that everyone on the left praises as being better than the United States' system has long waiting times. It can take over a month to get a hip replacement there.

Again, incorrect. A month? For a major surgery? That's pretty fucking good. If you dont have insurance, or it is a ""pre-exisiting condition (in other countries this is called your medical history), you don't get a surgery. Ever. One month for a major surgery that would cost an estimated $32000 - over $40,000 in the [USA](https://www.lendingpoint.com/blog/hip-replacement-surgery-what-it-costs-and-how-to-pay-for-it/). How fast would you be able to get in for a hip replacement surgery in the USA? You think it's an outpatient procedure schedule in a week? 

&gt;Italy has a nationalized healthcare system. They are getting decimated by the coronavirus. A nationalized healthcare system is not a silver bullet.

Wtf are you talking about? So, you think our private system is going to be able to handle this? This statement shows the complete lack of knowledge you have. We don't have the capacity to test for the virus. Or treat people. Or, people that can pay for it. The virus is overwhelming health care systems around the world, BECAUSE IT IS A VIRUS, AND DOES NOT CARE ABOUT POLITICS. You are only viewing this through a very narrow lens that leads to incorrect conclusions. Everything about your claim is wrong. 

&gt;Lastly, healthcare is not a right. I know you don't believe me, but nowhere in the U.S. Constitution does it talk about healthcare. Sorry not sorry, but if its not in the constitution, its not federally guaranteed to you. The story changes if the state you live in has a constitution that states healthcare as a right, but as far as I'm aware, Alaska, or any of the other 49 states, do not guarantee this as a right.

&gt;If you want to make the argument that healthcare should be a right, and the constitution should be amended to clarify this, then at least the argument is coherent, albeit still wrong. If you simply whine and complain about how you hate paying insurance companies to provide you with a product, healthcare, and instead it should be free, not only is your argument silly, but also it carries no weight.

This just all fucked up. You're trying to set the terms of an argument, I have continuously tried to steer you away from. We have many programs in this country that are not specifically mandated by the Constitution. Your stance here is nonsensical at best. We do not, and would not need an amendment to create a national healthcare system. This is factually, and ideologically incorrect. Period. you're wrong on that. It is not federally guaranteed. 

Lol, you are attempting to construct an argument for me? Based on your own misinformed nonsense? That paragraph about whining makes no sense. At all. 


The virus does not care about anyone's political affiliation. Nor do I. I simply refuse to kowtow to the political left and obey their ever increasingly restrictive measures on speech. This degree of political correctness is suffocating and prevents people from accurately diagnosing problems that must be dealt with.

&gt;Coronavirus is a Chinese Flu. It originated in Wuhan Flu. Nicknaming it the WuFlu is not racist.

My whole point is that is irrelevant, although you are again, dead wrong. If you want to look/ sound like a fool, that's on you. COVID-19 works, just fine for the medical community. As I am more concerned with science, credible scientists, and doctors are not referring to it with childish nicknames. As I have stated, it takes credibility away from the organizations that do this, and shows they are illegitimate. In this case, the blood bank, a medical organization allowed their PR person to interject their personal opinions, and rhetoric into a document where it should be absent. THIS IS WHAT I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU, but you can't stop bringing up AOC, Sanders, and a million other issues, ineffectively, and out of context. I am trying to talk about the virus, and it's implications. 



Lol, you are dead set on ignoring what I keep saying, and want to create an argument about politics, instead. That doesn't change the fact you are dead fucking wrong, on everything you say. God damn. There is no point in reasoning with you, at all. You have your own version of reality, and only see/ hear what you want. Have fun with that. You can only exist in an echo chamber of your own nonsense. Your reading comprehension is as piss poor, as your attempt at logic.You only care about your very narrow, and uninformed perspective.

We have a lot of remote villages, even ones on the road network, with no true police presence, or very little presence. Harder to handle the criminals, and easier to do crimes.


We have a low, spread out population, like you were saying. Again - harder to have a law-enforcement presence.

I am 500% pro gun, but we have a lot of guns (IMO we need them! See above points, and factor in large dangerous animals), and that skews gun violence stats.

Then there is seasonal depression and season-related psychological problems. Almost everyone seems more depressed in winter, and often super active in summer. Both can mess with ones mind. If one is prone to violence, messing with psychological status can lead to more crime.

I am sure there are a zillion other reasons - but one thing I would put money on, is that all the crime and violence here depends on a multitude of factors.",1584745305,fl28i0b

For me, any checks coming to me from the state or federal government aren't ""stimulus""--they're going into savings and I'm tightening the belt expecting worse later. I suspect that many others like me (median income) will do the same. I'll be thankful for the cushion but most people don't spend money when times get hard--they spend it when they think it's disposable.

That said, I have to wonder if direct checks are really the best approach. I want to keep my paycheck steady so putting that money towards infrastructure or other projects that stimulate employment seem more practical.

Nobody is planning on penalizing students for the outbreak. People are talking about providing transition resources to graduating seniors and promoting as many students as possible. Everybody wants the year to be over. The state department of education has told districts that one of their top priorities is not extending the year. My district's #1 concern is the mental and physical health of our students - how are they handling suicide interventions, student food, coronavirus anxiety, etc. We're trying to minimize the amount of work we have kids do now. 

There are not many teachers in Alaska that I know who are very dependent on textbooks, either. None of the classes I teach even have textbooks.

Also, if you miss ten full days, you get unenrolled, not expelled. You then just re-enroll. PowerSchool even keeps your grades automatically if that happens. And that's an automatic process that almost never happens. You have to ten complete uninterrupted school days of full absences (so no assemblies, in-service, snow days, parent excused absences, medical issues, etc.) to get dropped. I have students I haven't seen since October on my roll.

I guess my point in all of this is that as an insider in this situation, I can tell you that the state is not interested in what you're claiming.

Governments can only take people's money or print money.  This means that they eventually have to pay that borrowed money back, or cause inflation.

I hear people comparing this to WWII. You know who got a bailout in WWII?  The government.  They borrowed money from the American people, which they could do because Americans were savers, which made sense because you earned interest by saving money.

Now we live in Looney toons world where interest rates are held near zero so that when the government prints money and loans it to big banks, those banks can make money for free basically.  

Its very imperative that we do this and is in no way related to the fact the the government's financial advisers are former or future bank execs.

This whole system has been run designed to deliver short term profits to politically connected people while our whole society heads toward a cliff.

When you just print money and don't actually increase real economic productivity, you just make money worth less. America got away with this for a while because the dollar was considered a safe haven, reserve currency, etc.

Now the world is realizing the US is insolvent.  It's pretty much mathematically impossible to pay of the US debt at this point.  The economy would have to grow at 12% a year or something to catch up with unfunded liabilities and pay off the debt.

You do something illegal. You get a penalty.

You ignore the penalty. You get a new penalty.

These are independent actions. You could make the same argument that ""so essentially the result of parking improperly is arrest"" because ignoring fines and fees can eventually result in an arrest warrant.

&gt;Point is that all crime is enforced by imprisonment or death.

Or, in the case of Alaska, imprisonment only. 

That should underline the severity of the danger to oneself and others if you unnecessarily chillax in public spaces right now.

&gt;If you wish to opt out of society for a few months to be safe that‚Äôs on you.

Children, the old and infirm, and many others cannot make this choice independently. It is necessary to enforce it on those they live with, so they are not harmed by someone else's reckless choices. This is the same principle behind making anything illegal.

Clearly.

If people run out of money for rent, heating or food, that is at least a societal problem that we can try to tackle through extraordinary measures that don't put more stress on our hospital system.

We went of the gold standard because it was limiting.  Currency has to represent real wealth, so you can't just create it out of thin air in order to expand in the short run.  When the US started becoming an empire, and engaging in fireign regime change wars they started expanding the money supply.  The rest of the world for wise and started remaining to trade their dollars for gold, and the US didn't have the gold so we went off the gold standard.

The feds job was supposed to be keeping fiat currency stable even without the gokd standard.  They shrink the money supply when goods and services contract and vice versa.  Only problem is thats not what they do.  They just expand the money supply to cover for never ending government bloat and debt.

The town I grew up in in Oregon is basically a bedroom community for Albany, Corvallis, Salem, etc. now as there is no industry there. I'm sure that you're aware of this but one thing that doesn't get seem to get mentioned much with the pro-logging folks is that automation and technology has ended most logging jobs anyway.

Then his log truck had an arm on it to load it. It was insane to watch! He did the entire thing solo in a week.

It's going to twist up the world economy regardless. Young people still get sick and they still need to go into ICUs. That will eventually overwhelm them.

14460,OtherSpiderOnTheWall,"You're calling it ""the fucking flu"" and you have the gall to blame the media for misinformation? You should be ashamed of yourself. Name calling is entirely warranted.

The 60k is an estimate from the CDC. It is likely to include deaths attributable to, but not actually caused by the flu. Equivalent for COVID-19 are people who die of heart attacks without ever being diagnosed with it. Italy actually tracks their flu deaths. They had 300 so far this season, with almost as many hospitalizations. Studies will say 7k to 25k, but those include all deaths attributable to the flu - by doing a complicated comparison of periods with and without the flu re death rates. Someone gets a heart attack 3 weeks later because they had the flu? That's what that counts.. The actual direct deaths from the flu in Italy are about 300. COVID-19 has, in a month, killed 10x what the flu kills in a season in Italy. Directly. We don't know the indirect deaths yet.

The 60k is nothing compared to the 600k to 6 million deaths you're looking at if 10-100% of the US get infected - with treatment. Without treatment, you're looking at a higher number. That's assuming 2% death rate. If it's .2%, you're still looking at 60-600k directly caused by COVID19. And based on studies from SARS in 2003, there will be lingering health effects on survivors (not to mention possible health effects on people who were otherwise asymptomatic). So the deaths attributable is guaranteed higher than that.

The flu also doesn't hospitalize millions.

Last week, Italy had 600 deaths. Today, they have 4000+. They shut down everything in February. I was expecting their number of dead to go down, but Italy (at 1/5th of the population) is seeing 600+ dead per day. Other European countries are rapidly approaching 164 per day.

What makes you think we'll have so many fewer deaths as long as people like yourself think of as ""just the flu"" and don't realize how contagious they are even when asymptomatic? If anything, we'll have far more as our hospitals are overwhelmed.",1584849476,fl5yzd7

Bare in mind, this does NOT mean that that the tenant does not still owe the landlord rent or that the rent would not be collectible the moment the current emergency administrative orders cease to be in effect.  At time of eviction, if that should become a necessity in the future, your security deposit can be garnished for any outstanding debts, late fees, or damages.  Any outstanding amounts in addition to your security deposit can then be collected through an affidavit of damages which can then be garnished from future dividends and whatnot.  Any eviction prevents an individual from being eligible for assistance through housing vouchers for I believe 10 years.  Additionally, evictions can impact your job eligibility for certain positions.

The most prudent course of action that you can take is to contact your landlord, explain your situation, and work with them.  These are tough times and most landlords are willing to work with people.  That said, landlords have bills to and if they see an individual is out making frivolous purchases instead of paying back money they are owed, they‚Äôre not going to be happy campers.  


But seriously, just explain what‚Äôs going on and make sure to maintain contact with them and let them know BEFORE any issues arise.  There is absolutely no excuse for blindsiding your landlord or giving lip service.  Be honest and openly communicate.  They may be willing to lower the amount of rent for the time being or work with you on a  plan to repay the back rent in agreement for an extension of the lease or something.

The Governor issued an order that the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation can't evict for 60 days. Most rentals are not affected by these orders. If your rental doesn't involve AHFC, landlords can still do what landlords do. But they still must go through the court system, and no doubt that process will slow down a lot.

It feels like most of our local eateries have closed. Many are open with limited staff for delivery. One owner in Anchorage let over 200 people go from four locations in one afternoon. Some places sent their long-time staff home with a box of food and toilet paper. Unemployment filings have jumped. They're expected to see a bigger jump. Food banks are getting slammed and schools are struggling to still feed kids two meals a day. 
 
Oil is down. The Universities are cutting. The Governor is cutting. And this is all before this virus. We were at least looking forward to a good tourist season and fishing season and all that. Now we're not even buying popcorn at the theater or going out for a beer. 
 
They won't qualify for PFD or unemployment insurance and they have no jobs with skills in a nearly vanished (for now, at least) industry that this state relies on very much.

Worse than we saw in the 80s and that scares the crap out of me. I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing a serious rise in crime and many more home defense involved shootings. I just took my guns out of storage Friday and have them all loaded and ready to go. I was so hoping we would see things being taken seriously but after what i saw Friday around anchorage, i lost any real hope. It's going to get bad this week. I said last weekend we would hit between 10-20 cases, and i was right sadly. Do you want to know what we will be at by next Friday? I'm not going to say because it really really depresses me.

As far as I'm concerned if he finds a way to put a stop to private evictions and foreclosures and shuts the borders to the state down this week he'll have done everything I expected him to do.

Some of the actions taken could have been taken faster, however, that is an issue we have at a federal level.

Trying to compare Covid to Legionnaires is like comparing apples to moon rocks.

14976,k-logg,"The stock price is the value of a company.  Let's say I own a company and sell you a share for $1.  Then I make improvements that make my company more valuable, but the sale price of a share is still $1.  If you think a share is still only worth $1 and I think it is worth $3, you can sell me back the share that I sold you, which is in your opinion, selling a $1 share for $2, while I am buying a $3 share for $2 in my opinion.  I think we agree that that is a fair and mutually beneficial transaction.  

Now, if I attempt to artificially inflate the value by buying shares at a higher price than I believe its value justifies, that just means I am losing money (along with anyone else who is unwisely or ""maliciously"" buying stock at that inflated price).  Because if my company isn't as valuable as the price I'm buying it at, no one else is going to buy it from me at that price.  In other words, if I buy a $1 share for $10, I didn't profit, I just lost $9 unless I can convince someone else that my company can justify that value.  And that would just be breaking even.  To profit, I would need to convince someone that the value is greater than $10.  

As far as whether or not that is a good business decision depends on a lot of factors.  It's very possible to use stock buybacks as an investment that grows the company and benefits your employees.  Apple did this quite successfully for example.  But if I think my own stock is a better investment than expanding/hiring/etc, that is no business of the government.

15002,k-logg,"&gt;As opposed to simply paying them more with profit?

Yes, but you can also do both - use some to increase pay, and invest some in stock.  If that money is invested, it can grow and result in higher pay increases than it otherwise would.  Do you think Apple employees would have preferred to be paid the amount the company spent on the stock, or the amount they sold it for after it blew up?

&gt;Also, show some evidence that stock price causes an increase in compensation.

I didn't say stock price causes an increase in compensation necessarily.  More valuable companies (higher stock price) do generally pay their employees more, but I just said they have an increased *ability* to pay employees more.  If they would like a stronger workforce, increased pay is a great way to achieve that, and they have more to work with as value increases.  It is also very common to use company stock as a form of compensation, so it is directly increasing compensation in that case.  

&gt;Justify this. Why not?

You tell me why there should be.  We don't start with regulations, and grant freedoms like a god.  We start with freedom, and regulate where it is necessary.  I can sell you a share of my company, but can't buy it back if we agree to?  It's an investment just like any other.  No one is cheating and no one is being cheated.  It is all voluntary, consensual transactions between individuals who believe it is in their own best interest.

For the tourist, understand that you will be scrutinized and judged anywhere you go unless you blend in tread lightly. I've been literally two thirds around this planet and it's been observably true everywhere I've been so far.

Your inaccurate depiction of the fishing industry shouldn‚Äôt go unchallenged.

Certainly there are concerns about some runs but much of that is directly out of our control.  

Plus food processing will have to continue, fish feeds people.

Not to mention what would happen it the 219 million pinks that should be caught show up in the streams all of a sudden, talk about a disaster.

You should do some online research into the various areas of the state, which is huge.

If they attempt to manipulate their share price, that inflates the price of their own (rapidly increasing) shares.  Buying shares for more money than they are worth is a loss, not a gain.  If it turns out that they can actually sell them back at that inflated price or higher, that means that it wasn't inflated, wasn't manipulated, and they were correct about the increased value they placed on their company.  You say it's bad for investors, but if an investor doesn't agree with the value the company placed on themselves, good news, they are looking for investors to buy stock from at an inflated price.

&gt;The disaster in Italy does not stem from gross government negligence. Rather, analysts say it is partly a consequence of the weeks between the emergence of the outbreak and the government decision to absolutely lock down the population. And though many in Italy now argue their government waited too long, democracies across the West have been mulling the same decisions -- and in some cases have acted less decisively.

15223,Ifren,"I also know very little about the stock market, but I‚Äôm trying to piece it together from economic first principles. Discussions like these are very helpful to me. 

Here‚Äôs two scenarios:

A company is about to release a great new product that will boost their value considerably. Having some spare change laying around before the product launch, they buy a large sum of their own stock. After the product launches successfully, the value of their stock increases substantially. They then sell the stock, which everyone wants because the company‚Äôs value is increasing so rapidly, and make a profit. In this scenario, the company takes a gamble by betting that their product will do well. 

Second scenario:

A company with no plan for how to make their company more valuable buys a large sum of their own stock. Investors assume that this choice is because they are betting on a product like in the first scenario. As a result, the price of the company stock rises. The company then sells their stock for a profit, and the investors lose out. In this scenario, the company takes advantage of the imperfect knowledge of the investor and makes a profit without actually providing any benefit to anyone (rent seeking).

15246,k-logg,"Well if they are buying stock based on internal knowledge that is not public information known by the shareholders, that is insider trading, which is illegal and should be.  So any purchase of stock by the company should be based on the belief that the company is currently more valuable than the price it is being sold for, based on the same information available to shareholders/potential shareholders.  

As for your second scenario, I would say that if an investor buys equity in a company without understanding why it is more valuable than its current price, that is simply an irresponsible and unwise investment.  I don't think laws are necessary to prevent people from making bad investments.  

That said, I'm unclear on the final step where ""the company then sells their stock for a profit, and the investors lose out.""  If the company is selling at that price, there have to be buyers at that price.  And if there are buyers at that price, the investors can also sell at that price and profit just the same.  So the investors you are referring to aren't the same one's who were buying simply because the company did, because the company is selling at that point.

There's people getting tested or asking for tests where it won't make a difference. If you're negative, you could get it tomorrow. If you're positive, you should be self quarantining before you get the result anyway.

For some people, it'll let you identify who has been exposed with just one test. Unfortunately, with the gaggle of kids I saw today running door to door, fat chance of narrowing that down anymore. So we're at the ""everyone quarantine!"" Phase, where the most important test is confirming that someone who had it no longer has it, allowing us to presume them to be safe to discharge.

Aggressive testing earlier on would have helped though. If everyone coming back had been tested and quarantined for just a few days, then everyone negative could have gone back out into society and all the positives could stay quarantined for two weeks, and everything could have kept running in Alaska.

We want to do testing because it helps us track it's movements through the state -- and to tailor the precautions that hospital staff takes with you if you are admitted.   Right now I imagine anyone being admitted for a respiratory complaint is being treated as if they have it.   

Everyone wants to do more testing, but Anchorage was begging on Friday for more swabs (because not just any will do), so supplies are low.  It's also still cold and flu season, so there are many other bacteria and viruses out there causing similar symptoms.  The priority for testing in that situation becomes people who have known contact with the virus and people who are severely symptomatic / being hospitalized for respiratory failure in order to protect the staff.",1585115684,flfs0bt

15619,Unhappy-Wait,"I live in the bush. Every community is different. I know some people who spend 16 years in LKSW (the Bethel district) and had good experiences. On several levels, living out here is a big culture shock. Native culture is different, and you will have a lot of work cut out for you in terms of cross cultural communication. Native culture is also in many places, frankly, dysfunctional. And you have to have a particular skill set to be able to live with and mitigate that dysfunction. 

I've been in my village 6 years and I love it. I go out everyday: skiing, hunting, boating, fishing, trail running, trapping, snow-machine riding. It's totally awesome, and you get used to -30 it's actually not a big deal, and the darkness is no big deal either, especially if you stay here during the summer and experience the blissful and wonderful long days. But there's a lot of shitty stuff here. And I love my community, but it has big problems, and those problems are my community's own fault for the most part. A lot of people on the road system or Outside might think that a lot of the bush professionals are racist, but we're not. For thousands of years, for example, I√±upiat practiced wife capture, aggravated rape, and cousin marriage. It was part of the culture. It still *is* part of the culture, except now we have lots of alcohol in the mix. I don't know if incest was common in the past, but we have a lot of that now too in my village, like, lots of uncles raping their nieces, dads their daughters, and brothers their sisters. The Native's like to blame it on cOlOnIaLiSm and hIsToRiCaL tRaUmA, but that's mostly bullshit. Like I said, it was part of the culture and it still is. And is it racist to say those aspects of the culture are deeply dysfunctional and probably ought to stop? Anyway, that question is an academic one. When the rubber hits the road, you'll find yourself in a class of children who live this, and many other aspects of dysfunction, in a community where these and other dysfunctions are the norms and where you are an outsider. I could go on and on. Maybe it's right for you. Maybe it's not. For sure, though, it's a little more of a roll of the life dice compared to other options you may have. 

If you want a romantic take on it, read ""The Last Light Breaking"" by Nick Jans. It's a little dated, but it's authentic, and a respected piece of place based Alaska literature. Another book you could read is ""Shopping for Porcupine"" by Eric Kantner.",1585281808,flmezfw

Weeks ago my wife was telling me about the surge in infant RSV cases that the state (AK) was dealing with and how COVID-19 might affect that since it was already causing a bed shortage.  I feel like this was before we had confirmed cases.

*the airline RavnAir Alaska has stopped transporting patients showing signs of respiratory illness on their commercial flights.*

*Dr. Ellen Hodges, medical chief of staff for the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corp., said that decision could be ‚Äúdisastrous.‚Äù*

*Hodges said the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is enduring one of the largest RSV outbreaks in a decade. RSV is a common respiratory infection among infants and toddlers.*

*This year, there were so many extreme cases of RSV that infants from the Y-K Delta filled intensive care unit beds at Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage. Infants had to be placed in the ICU at Providence Alaska Medical Center, which also filled up, Hodges said.*

*On Wednesday, Winkelman joined the Lower Kuskokwim School District, Yuut Elitnaurviat, the Association of Village Council Presidents and the Bethel Native Corp. in penning a letter to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, asking him to help rural Alaska deal with the COVID-19 outbreak.*

And we don't know *how* many cases we actually have. There aren't enough testing kits do go around. Those *with* symptoms who aren't in a high-risk demographic are just being told to self-quarantine without testing (thus don't fall under the ""confirmed case"" count). And the vast majority of our confirmed cases contracted the virus despite not travelling Outside, meaning we probably have many undiagnosed infected spreading it to others right now.

And this says nothing of the economic hit. Alaska needs intact supply lines. If, say, the Port of Anchorage gets hit hard and has to shut down things could get pretty bad fast. Oil prices have been in freefall, and a big thanks there to Dunleavy et all for ensuring we continue to stake our entire fiscal well-being on the price of oil.

There are so many missed opportunities to prepare for this, so much misinformation coming from a President who spent longer tweeting about himself and blaming Democrats than he did to make sure this country could withstand a pandemic.

Effective at 8 a.m. on March 28, all personal interstate travel between communities is prohibited. Travel for critical needs is allowed, the state said, which includes buying, selling, or delivering groceries and home goods; obtaining fuel for vehicles or residential needs; transporting family members for out-of-home care, essential health needs, or for purposes of child custody exchanges; receiving essential health care; providing essential health care to a family member; obtaining other important goods; and engaging in subsistence activities.

The other mandate, which will go into effect at 5 p.m. on March 28, requires that everybody in Alaska - except for those engaged in essential health care services, public government services, and essential business activities - must ""remain at their place of residence and practice social distancing.""

Among other things, people are required to work from home as much as possible, immediately isolate any family members who are will, and avoid public or private gatherings that include non-household members, regardless of the number of people involved. All non-essential businesses across Alaska must close.

According to the Department of Health and Social Services, ""A violation of a state COVID-19 Mandate may subject a business or organization to an order to cease operations and/or a civil fine of up to $1,000 per violation.""

DHSS also reported 16 new cases of the new coronavirus, as well as the one death, as reported earlier in the day.

Maybe you don‚Äôt understand, that commercial space costs money. If that business is not making money, they‚Äôre still paying for the space. A lot of businesses may not be able to re-open. Keeping the juice running, while no one can make money, is going to hurt the economy. A lot. Loans need to be paid back, with interest. That‚Äôs still going to be damaging. That money was never made, and is now going to be folded into daily operations, causing inflation. 

There are large corporations having problems with it, immediately. Cheesecake Factory announced it will not be paying rent on their spaces. Game Stop permanently closed stores around the country. Those are large operations that can‚Äôt weather the storm. Mom, and Pop shops don‚Äôt have that kind of capital.

15965,OtherSpiderOnTheWall,"&gt; Game Stop permanently closed stores around the country.

Hurray.

But more seriously, and not OP, I understand the challenges. I'm a little worried we're not smart enough to work out the solution, given our initial response (e.g. head in sand, hoarding, etc...), but while people are staying at home, they're also not really spending much. Anyone who is laid off is likely going to make as much or more than they did working until they get back to work (the +600 per week). So when things start back up, I imagine we'll see a flurry of economic activity.

Some things won't start up as fast, of course. And this requires that landlords are smart enough to not drive all their clients out of business. And it requires that banks are smart enough to avoid driving all their clients into bankruptcy themselves. And so on and so forth. It requires action, I agree, and most likely political action. The city is doing a part of it. Hopefully the State steps up as well (though with oil and stocks down, that might be tough), and hopefully the feds step in as well.

It won't be cheap, but recovery pays for itself.

Also, as harsh as it might sound, I'm curious to see how much damage the takeout and delivery of restaurant food is going to cause in terms of infections and dragging this out. There's no foolproof way of guaranteeing employees aren't contagious, and I'm not exactly confident delivery drivers are taking appropriate precautions and either. But at the same time it keeps pressure off the grocery store and keeps people sane, so probably ultimately the better option.",1585374132,flq021a

March was a bust, April will be a bust, and who knows about May. The longer we dick around, the longer the closures last. That‚Äôs o.

I‚Äôm proud of our city for stepping up. You‚Äôre right, they are doing their part, and it‚Äôs nice to see people acknowledge that. 

And, I completely agree on the restaurants. I spent 20 years in the industry. There‚Äôs going to be inevitable cross contamination from cooks, staff, and delivery, if they are contagious. I stopped eating in restaurants about 2.5 weeks ago. I want to support my local businesses, but I can‚Äôt afford to waste the money, or the potential exposure.

Oil is $20 per barrel and every time Saudi Arabia is involved in a price war, it lasts [12-18 months](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/3/18/history-shows-the-2020-oil-price-war-won-t-end-soon) and oil gets down to $10/bbl. [Worldwide storage capacity is currently around 75%](https://fortune.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-gas-prices-oil-industry-storage-crude-production/). Buying to fill up spare capacity is currently giving a little cushion to oil price, when all storage is full the bottom will really drop out. Coronavirus is further reducing demand for oil by depressing travel.

  
However, even aside from that several large domestic investment banks (Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Golden Sachs) have announced they will [no longer lend capital](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/wells-fargo-arctic-oil-1.5483641) to Arctic oil projects. Even if oil price comes back up, lack of access to capital could limit the scope of development which is possible.

Finally, the North Slope is very vulnerable to COVID: lots of men traveling from all over the country, living and working closely in a remote space with limited medical resources. Many of them have underlying health issues from a lifetime of blue collar work.

On the tourism side of things, the tourist season is dead on arrival for 2020 due to COVID. In addition, commercial fishing relies heavily on seasonal labor and a lot of J1 visas, which are also not coming through (both due to [Trump administration policies](https://america.cgtn.com/2019/08/13/us-hotels-struggle-to-find-staff-after-trump-admin-changes-j-1-visa-policy) against foreign labor, and travel bans)",1585531257,flvss4b

16468,ThellraAK,"Super simple recipe.

2 cups rice uncooked, cook then cool ( I have been cooling in freezer)

Dice a can of spam and fry it in a pan big enough for all of this.

Kick the heat to high, drop in the rice, fry it, adding soy sauce in as needed until it tastes salty enough, then add a few tbsp of oyster sauce.

Push all of that to the side and add in 4-6 eggs that are well scrambled and fry them up, breaking into small bits. 

Add in a can of diced peas and carrots.(drained)

This is the game changer part for me, go do something else for 5-10 minutes with the pan covered and if off the stove.

Add in a few tbsp of toasted sesame oil.  Letting it cool down aparantly makes the flavor stay better?  Now would be the time to see if it needs more soy sauce. This would also be the time to add in more neutral oil if the rice seems overly dry.  It seems like the day content of spam, and store brand spam varies wildly.  Jalapeno spam, hickory spam, and regular spam have been used to great affect.

From start to finish (excluding the rice the day before) is maybe 30 minutes and it makes a hearty meal for 2 fat people with enough left over for a normal portion.

Think later this week I am going to try chicken and maybe even breakfast sausage with it to see how that shakes out.

If you can't get oyster sauce I am sure something like hoisen sauce or maybe a fish sauce.

Those substitutes are just being pulled from other recipes I've seen.

During this crisis if I could get Szechuan sesame chicken and hot oil figured out, I wouldn't have to go crawling back to my Chinese place.

For chow mein it's really the same sauces as fried rice, just with more of oil, or a neutral oil if you find the sesame overpowering.",1585542191,flw81ej

To get rid of your ""#DIV/0!"" lines, you can add an ""IF"" around your formula. I assume that the formula for ""Incidence"", for example, is ""population"" (Column B) divided by ""# of cases"" (Column E). So, the Incidence formula for ""All"" I assume is:

=B2/E2

If that's the case, then you can add an ""if"" for ""if there's no cases"", and it would read like:

=IF(E2&gt;0,B2/E2,0)

The last ""0"" is the ""what to show if there aren't any cases. If you wanted this to say ""None"" instead of ""0"", then it would be:

=IF(E2&gt;0,B2/E2,""None"")

Same with the hospitalization rates - I assume that's currently:

Bolded writing on Page 2, the risk is an order to cease and/or a fine of up to $1,000, also potential to be prosecuted for Reckless Endangerment; such prosecution can result in up to 1 year imprisonment and up to $25,000 fine. I expect the Reckless Endangerment would only come in to play if a COVID-19 case was tracked back to being caught at your wedding. For example, if one of your witnesses gets sick 3 days later (so was probably contagious), and then another gets sick 2 weeks later, your wedding would be a likely suspect for causing the spread. Especially if that 2-weeks-later person had a bad result (invasive procedures required, or death), Reckless Endangerment prosecution would be likely. Given that wedding dates, witnesses, officiants, and location have to be recorded, this carries more risk than - say - going to visit the same people, since there's a formal record of what/when/who.

16585,Skeptic_Zero,"I lived in Sitka for about 16 years. It's a great little town - the community is amazing and the people are incredibly helpful and accepting.

That being said, you should know a few things about it if you're planning on moving there. I'm assuming you already have a job offer, and I hope it's a good one at least because it's not the cheapest place to live. Housing can be expensive, and food prices are higher (although not ridiculous like interior AK).

If you're not knowledgeable about hunting/fishing/wildlife but want to learn, you'll learn quick. Everyone is happy to teach and you'll get into it. Trust me. If you're just not interested in doing those things then I'm honestly curious why you'd consider moving there! It's by far the biggest appeal of the place. There's so many outdoors activities and unique places on Baranof and Kruzof that you could spend a lifetime exploring and not see a fraction of it. There's also non-outdoorsy things to do, like the various festivals during the summer.

Second thing to know is that it rains. A lot. There's been summers where we had maybe two or three weeks of sunny days. That's definitely not the norm, but you should know that it's possible that you'll spend the majority of the year with overcast skies and rainy days. Granted, some summers were incredible. That's the downside. The upside is that when it's sunny, the whole community gets out and about, and you'll bump into everyone and their dogs out on the trails because people value good weather down there.

Overall, if 1) rain doesn't bother you and 2) you have a good job offer on hand, I highly recommend Sitka. It's a great place to raise kids (I grew up there from the age of 10 and went to it's schools) and you'll be welcomed instantly. And if you aren't outdoorsy when you move there, you WILL be when you leave.",1585596155,fly5z2v

16587,skiingineer2,"Unfortunately, I do think that we need to be honest with ourselves about the basis for the Alaska economy both now and in the coming years - the extraction of natural resources/AKA raping our own land. Frankly, that‚Äôs what we have to offer. Tourism just isn‚Äôt going to reliably replace the levels of economic exchange, at least not in the immediate future. 

Besides oil, we‚Äôve got mining, timber, fish...if we‚Äôre honest with ourselves, that‚Äôs what we realistically have to bring to the table UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. Our population is not larger enough to be self-sustaining through a service-based economy, and is too large to subsist based on tourism/recreation alone. Perhaps if we had cheap sources of energy we could look to manufacturing a la Iceland, but we would have to really sweeten the pot cost-wise to offset the increased expenses related to shipping things so far.

I say this as a liberal person who cares about the environment, who supports Bernie Sanders style democratic social programs. However, I‚Äôm not blind to reality. And the current reality of our state economy is that we rely on natural resource extraction to support the population size we have. If people think I‚Äôm incorrect, please provide an alternative solution as opposed to just funding issues with what I‚Äôve said. 

One thing that‚Äôs become especially clear given current circumstances on both a macro and micro level - it‚Äôs very easy to find issues or things wrong with a decision, but it‚Äôs harder to offer a realistic solution that doesn‚Äôt have issues of its own. If we‚Äôre not going to base our economy on natural resource extraction, what should we base it on? Is that actually a realistic prospect in the near future?  If so, great, but let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves and think critically about this if we want to actually find solutions.",1585596216,fly637v

I did a house hunting trip recently to anchorage and ignored all the crazy on here then too. The people in Anchorage were very nice and welcoming, not at all panicked. 

Was able to find a nice place downtown, looking forward to the change in scenery. Even if the stay in place order continues through the end of april by then most people will be ignoring it is my guess.

The only effective response is to do mass testing and have infected stay isolated. Just like in South Korea where it's working quite well.

What that means is that it doesn't get too hot in the summer (upper 60s to low 70s at the warmest) and stays in the 20s or 30s in the winter, and the winters are fairly short. It's in the middle of the Tongass national forest and is a temperate rainforest.

Lol yes there's internet, satellite TV, everything you expect from a modern society. Sitka isn't a village. Imagine a small suburb of about 9,000 people, that's what it is. You don't need to own a boat if you don't want one. If you want to go to one of the other islands in the area you can charter a sea taxi or just befriend someone who owns a boat (which is easy).

Yes there's plenty of parks, and they're all well maintained. My favorites are totem park, whale park, and the starrigavan area at the end of the road. Browse through Google maps and you'll see them. But you'll start taking the trails, trust me. They're more fun üòä

Since we are now doing respiratory viral panels on everyone with symptoms we have to put adults with RSV on droplet whereas before we just treated them presumptively as a cold and did not have to use PPE. Our community is rallying and making scrub caps and iso gowns for us. 

We are visitor free with exceptions for L&amp;D, peds, and hospice- each can have one visitor unless they are covid19 positive- then no visitors at all. 

We have around 70 medsurg beds and 20ICU beds- since we are a small facility those are the only 2 inpatient units we have. Right now we‚Äôve cancelled all unnecessary surgery and are on low census- usually we stay chock full. We are expecting a surge in the next week so only time will tell.

Juneau's landfill itself is a capitalism endeavor and is not owned by the public. So even the dump is a profit-seeking enterprise owned by Waste Management (do a little googling for their environment report card).

The theory originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (also known as a ""common"") in Great Britain and Ireland. The concept became widely known as the ""tragedy of the commons"" over a century later due to an article written by American biologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin in 1968. In this modern economic context, ""commons"" is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere, oceans, rivers, fish stocks, roads and highways, or even an office refrigerator.

We should prioritize laying underwater internet cables to better connect our cities to the world and subsidize 5G. With remote working getting popular, tech boom could thrive here.

They are a fantastic business model because they get almost all of the tourist passenger dollars at every step of the way, much like staying at Disney resorts.

When that percentage starts going up, then you are going to be missing some percentage of the population that have the disease but are being missed. In terms of tests per million, Alaska is doing pretty well, with only 11 states having more, and most of those states having higher numbers of positives and higher percentage of positives to total tests.

It‚Äôs super great for kids. You can walk everywhere. It‚Äôs sooooo pretty. Lots and lots of community things for kids going on all the time. 

Rent is expensive. And utilities is expensive. That‚Äôs the biggest drawback. 

Lots of hiking. Even if you don‚Äôt have hunting or fishing experience everyone does here. And you will meet people who will take you out. It‚Äôs lots of fun. 

But there is other places to be outdoors. We have a cross trail that goes all over. Hiking, beaches (mostly rocky) board walks out the road. Fun places for bon fires. Camp grounds. 

New Kids playground. Beautiful national park with totem poles. 
It‚Äôs a super artsy town! Always community events going on. 

It does rain non stop for like September and October. Those are the worst months. 

January and February are the coldest and we get a little snow sometimes. 

The past two summers it was sunny the whole summer. Barely any rain. It was amazing. 

It‚Äôs the best place for little kids. As long as you can afford the rent and utilities.

Fortress of the Bears. Which is a super cool place that has taken in bears who can‚Äôt survive in the wild. 

And we actually have an awesome school system here. K-12

Daycare is kinda crappy here. They have super long waiting lists. And the one we had our little one was in got shut down because some horrible stuff was going on.

16978,anchor_over,"Here's what I had to say several years back on the same subject, which is more or less how I feel today, except that the more I know about Anchorage, the more I secretly like it:

Dissing Anchorage is a thing people do for a while when they move here because it's an easy way to establish your Wilderness Man credentials. I did it myself for a long time. And it's understandable, because a lot of Anchorage really is pretty crappy. You can tell it was all built in the late seventies and later, it's ridiculously spread out for what a small geographical footprint it has, a lot of the buildings are ugly, it's pretty shabby overall.

That said, over time I've come to appreciate a lot of good things about it on my (pretty infrequent, I don't live there) trips there. There's a few good restaurants, Title Wave is great, New Sagaya is awesome, most of the people I've met and know there are pretty cool, and there's interesting little odds and ends tucked into strange corners of the place. It's just that none of the good stuff, except the scenery and the proximity to widely-varied and world class backcountry, is particularly obvious or concentrated. You have to work a little to find it.

I think there's a really cool city inside Anchorage struggling to get out, and frankly the dismissive attitude towards it from the rest of the state and city residents' resulting defensiveness doesn't help.",1585733508,fm3qt4r

There is a fix to that issue. 

1. cut government spending
2. repeal SB21  
.... introduced 1.2 billion in annual tax credits for the oil industry  
3. restore ACES  
.... state received additional percent of oil profit as prices rise

The current situation was avoidable.  

https://www.adn.com/politics/alaska-legislature/2019/04/07/as-alaska-budget-tightens-12-billion-oil-tax-deduction-comes-under-scrutiny/

The state earnings reserve has been drawn down with deficit spending year after year since SB21 passed which repealed ACES.

You can track the current fiscal crisis to the Parnell administration pushing SB21 in April 2013.  There were highly unethical conflicts of interest by current legislators Cathy Giessel, Peter Micciche, and former Senate President Kevin Meyer.

Sean Parnell was a former oil industry lobbyist.  Cathy Giessel's husband owns a consulting firm dependent on the oil industry.  Current state senator Peter Micciche and former state senator Kevin Meyer were working for oil companies while serving in the legislature. 

These three bought politicians served over committees that rammed through the repeal of ACES.

Approximately 90% of State of Alaska revenue used to fund government is derived from royalties from mineral and sub-surface rights.

Politicians are not following state law. They don't want to cut programs. Special interests do not want new taxes.  Reducing PFD payments for all Alaskans acts as a flat regressive tax. All Alaskans are now effectively subsidizing 1.2 billion in oil tax deductions.",1585777392,fm5phpf

You do realize that the Permanent Fund belongs to all alaskans?  There is a long history of discussions during its creation that the fund should be a direct economic benefit to the people and not be controlled by legislators.

Fears communicated by former Governors and legislators are now coming to pass.

Legislators are ignoring the PFD statutory formula and raiding the earnings reserve to fund government.  When that runs out you can expect them (and private interests that control them) to try and convince Alaskans that raiding the principal (corpus) is unavoidable.  Luckily the legislature can not touch the principal without a constitutional amendment.",1585777944,fm5qhs6
17131,charlievanz,"When the PFD payout was first proposed, the fed government was just starting to suggest the 1200 tax credit, and there was minimal hope that they could get such a thing passed and signed in a timely manner.  That's why some legislators changed their minds about voting for it.  

Rght now Russia and OPEC are in a pissing match over oil, and I paid at the Costco pump the same price I used to pay almost 20 years ago to fill up.  Given that Russian wheat is worth more than their oil, and a ""barrel of monkeys"" game is worth more than Canadian crude, now is not the time to be draining our account if we can help it, because we're going to need long term economic support of the PFD fund when this is over with -- like years worth.  

The stock market is tipping into a recession and that's also damaging the PFD reserves.  The only good thing about it is that the fund can buy more now in anticipation of the eventual recovery.

In order to give a double PFD, the state wouldn't have enough money to run the full year -- meaning more legislators traveling and getting paid to figure out how to pay for the rest of the year.

Our state's economy is completely fucked this year because our top three industries: Oil, tourism, and fishing are getting a beat down.  We're potentially facing a mass move out as people go out to find work -- further draining money from the state.

My village did this, and yes it is understandable, but for me there is a mammoth in the room. Tribes in Alaska only have authority over tribal members, so far as I understand it, so they can't really ""ban"" travel for non-members. The regional airlines and some of the school districts are playing along because they have to, but it seems like it's still possible to charter planes in and out. Like, literally the last place a tribe has authority over is the air or a state airport.

I grew up in Southeast Alaska. Hoonah mostly but some on Zarembo Island, some at Cape Pole, a year in Haines.

We‚Äôd go out and play in any weather. You‚Äôd come home wet &amp; cold but it was better than sitting around the house. This was pre-internet days and we only got 1 TV station, the good ‚Äòol Rural Alaska Television Network, or RATNET as we affectionately called it. 

It‚Äôs daylight out now in Ketchikan until around 8 pm, so heading out at 3pm still gives you 5 hours of hiking. Sounds like plenty of time for a stroll. 

At elevation? Have you been to Ketchikan? If it was any closer to sea level it‚Äôd be under water... Yes the terrain around town goes up from there, but I wouldn‚Äôt imagine any thing that is accessible would be any more than a couple of thousand feet in elevation.  

And of course there‚Äôs some danger... there‚Äôs danger in anything we do. When I was a kid we had a neighbor go out hunting on a Sunday afternoon.

My question is concerning the approaching fishing season both commercial and Sportfishing.


Both of these activities generate a large amount of Revenue for many people but if the health of everyone is what is at stake concerning the covid-19 pandemic, why are these activities not being canceled.


Is it purely economic reason that this is not going to be done?


As a resident of the Kenai Peninsula and Soldotna in particular we are at the heart of the tourist fishing and Alaska resident fishing capital of the state. The large influx of people that the sport fishing and personal dip net fishing will bring to this area certainly will not provide adequate room for people to social distance. Also the health mandate for Interstate travel would seem to preclude this or is just an exception going to be made. If the fishing season it's not canceled until after the pandemic is over, meaning there is a vaccine available for all, then why even bother with everything we're doing.¬†

17716,vote_bums_out,"LT Gov. Kevin Meyer was President of the Alaska Senate in 2013.

This wouldn't be the first time Meyer has shown conflicts of interest.  

SB21 the bill that repealed ACES was rammed through the Alaska legislature in April 2013.  Kevin Meyer and Peter Micciche were full time employees of ConocoPhillips while simultaneously serving in the Alaska legislature.   Cathy Giessel also had a conflict of interest, her husband co-owns a company which relies on the oil industry.

All three of those people chaired committees that pushed SB21 (oil tax credits) on behalf of the oil industry.

90% of state income is generated from royalties on oil, mineral, and sub-surface rights.

SB21 has cost the state approximately 1.2 billion annually in lost revenue. 

The Legislature knew what would happen when SB21 passed and did not reduce spending to account for the 1.2 billion revenue shortfall.  The legislature continued with deficit spending year after year until the point they decided to steal from constituents PFD checks to fund government.  

We're now at a precipice.  Alakans are being robbed of their statutory PFD. Politicians are not calling this a flat regressive tax. Alaska special interests and businesses have lobbied against new taxes.  Politicians refuse to cut government or reinstate ACES to increase oil tax revenue.  Corrupt politicians will continue with fake theater for the public and seize all of the permanent fund earnings.  Eventually they will tell Alaskans they  have run out of money and need access to the Permanent Fund principal account (55+ billion)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Meyer_(politician)#Controversy

&gt; Controversy

&gt; In 2013, Meyer voted with the Alaska Senate Majority to pass Senate Bill 21, restructuring the state of Alaska's tax code for oil companies and reducing their tax burden. **This vote benefited Meyer's full-time employer, ConocoPhillips.** (Membership in the Alaska state legislature is not a full-time position, and Meyer, like many of his fellow members, maintain full-time employment elsewhere, taking leave when the legislature is in session.) When the bill came to the Senate floor, Meyer asked to be recused from voting. Under legislative rules, however, a member of the legislature must vote if any other members object, and several did.[15]",1585941856,fmcaatv

For the FY2021 budget (just passed) the legislature transferred over 3 BILLION from the earnings reserve back to the principal fund (which they can't touch).   

Why did the legislature transfer 3 BILLION into the principal fund that they can't touch during a pandemic economic crisis when constituents are hurting?  

The answer is simple.  It's an election year. Constituents were demanding financial help to prevent bankruptcy and financial ruin.  Corrupt politicians (and those that own them) already had plans for the money.  Clearing out the earnings reserve makes the funds unavailable now.  Politicians can then claim they can't give immediate $1,000 coronavirus stimulus relief to all alaskans.

Eventually the legislature will get access to the money again over time as the Permanent Fund Corporation transfers a percent of returns back to the earnings reserve each year in July.

If there was another airline servicing villages on this scale they would still have problems scaling up on such short notice. And for many there is not another option.

All over Reddit I see people missing the fact that starting companies takes money. The economic impacts of the current situation are impossible to predict, but it won't be good.

Plus the cost of doing business in Alaska is high. The places Ravn flew to were not easy to service in and out at times. Unimproved gravel strips, weather, and lack of infrastructure. Makes it hard to run reliable service like what Alaska does. And Alaska is not going to magically start doing most of the places that Ravn flew. Maybe in the future.

I have grown up in Alaska and since the 80's I have seen just how dangerous it can be to fly to many of the areas.  I agree Ravn has/had it's issues, but I know people that worked there and they truly cared about helping their passengers and getting people where they were going safely.  Ravn employed over 1,500 Alaskans and now they all face lay offs.

There are a ton of weird examples of how this is super unevenly applied which is one of the reasons bear hunting I think got reinstated. For instance you could live in a tiny cabin outside of Ketchikan off the road system and you are considered non-rural but if you live in Saxman a couple miles from downtown Ketchikan on the road system you are rural.

**COVID-19 HEALTH ALERT**

Issued: April 3, 2020
By:¬†Commissioner Adam Crum, Alaska Department of Health and Social Services 
Dr. Anne Zink, Chief Medical Officer, State of Alaska
Health Alert 010 ‚Äì Recommendations Regarding the Use of Cloth Face Coverings
Scientific evidence available to date indicates that asymptomatic and presymptomatic shedding of the virus that causes COVID-19 is occurring.¬† This means that people who have no symptoms whatsoever may be infected with the virus and capable of transmitting the virus to others when interacting in close proximity‚Äîfor example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing.¬† This heightens the need for community-wide implementation of control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among people who are not experiencing symptoms of illness.¬† 
The primary ways to do this are through social distancing, frequent hand-washing, and disinfecting high-touch surfaces. Another tool that may help to minimize transmission while people are around others outside of their household is the use of face coverings. Because we are experiencing a nationwide shortage of medical supplies, including facemasks, we recommend that Alaskans make their own face coverings and wear them in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) -- especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.¬† This recommendation aligns with current national guidance: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html 
The following measures are highly recommended for all Alaskans:

Wear a cloth face covering in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). 

Make sure the face covering covers both the nose and mouth.

Do not remove the face covering until you return home. 

When removing the face covering, avoid touching the front of the face covering (because it may be contaminated). Remove it by grasping the ear loops, ties, or bands and immediately discard or place in a designated container for laundering.¬† 

Wash your hands immediately after removing the face covering and before touching anything else.

Wash face coverings in hot, soapy water between uses.

Do not wear N-95 or surgical masks; these are needed by health care workers and first responders.

Do not rely on face coverings as the primary way to prevent COVID-19 transmission, and be careful to avoid developing a false sense of security through the use of face coverings. Continue to follow social distancing measures, including maintaining at least six feet between yourself and others, staying at home, avoiding touching your face, and washing your hands frequently.

What is a cloth face covering? A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.
How do I make a homemade face coverings? Cloth face coverings can be fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost. There are a number of instructional websites and videos that people can refer to for making face coverings; two such videos are available at https://youtu.be/VgHrnS6n4iA and https://youtu.be/1r2C1zGUHbU 
How well do cloth face coverings work to prevent spread of COVID-19? There is limited evidence available on how well cloth face coverings help reduce COVID-19 transmission. Their primary role is to reduce the release of respiratory droplets into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes, including people who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms. Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing and washing hands and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these primary interventions.
How should I care for a cloth face covering? Wash your cloth face covering frequently, ideally after each use, or at least daily. Have a bag or bin to keep cloth face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your cloth face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard cloth face coverings that:

No longer cover the nose and mouth 

Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps

Cannot stay on the face

Have holes or tears in the fabric

¬†
This is not a mandate.

17849,six96,I spent countless hours last year watching the bear cam at Brooks Falls last year. I live by the Great Lakes so we have our salmon run but it‚Äôs nowhere near as amazing as it is up there (instead of bears it‚Äôs just guys with nets and big hooks breaking the law for some fish). Moose are fuckin massive aren‚Äôt they? They gotta cause some inconveniences along the roads and whatnot,1585964001,fmdbwc5

17854,shaidycakes,"They really are insanely big. Even seeing one from your car close up doesn't let you fully comprehend it. Moose kill more people a year than bears combined. Mostly from car crashes I believe. If you're in a sedan and about to hit a moose, counter intuitively you're supposed to accelerate bc if you brake hard the body of the moose will come right through the windshield and kill you, but supposedly if you accelerate it kinda ends up flipping over the car and doing significantly less damage. 

I was in a big crew cab duely in Maine and we almost hit a moose. By the time the truck came to a stop the moose's head was over the hood. I was sitting in the passenger seat and I swear this moose's head was like half the length of the windshield and it we had hit it I would have had it's antlers right through my face",1585964631,fmdctcy

Not very common in my experience, but it's very situational. At home in Wasilla, lounging on my deck? I've never seen one, and I'm pretty sure I've never seen tracks or scat. 4 wheeling at Kings River? You see tracks sometimes. Bears do a pretty good job avoiding people when there's noise.

&gt;is seeing a moose up there the same as me seeing a whitetail deer down here?

Maybe not that common, but close. I've seen 2 moose in the last 9 days of stay at home, eating my fucking lilac trees.

&gt;bald eagles

Fairly common. I'm never shocked to see one. I did see a fox earlier this year, which was unusual, and you can almost always find a roadkill porcupine on the side of the highway driving to Anchorage.

18108,mollymurph,"Nah, Think of this in another way. That strip of shops is literally a bunch of buildings sitting on the deck of a pier.  A pier is nothing but a group of pilings (big telephone poles) driven into the muck at the edge of the water. Then a stout structure of bracing, beams, joists and decking are all bolted and nailed to the forest of poles. Once it's done, a pier is a remarkably durable structure that lasts decades, even centuries,  if kept in reasonable repair. Like every structure in a tidal zone, occasionally they get damaged, or even wiped out in storms. 

One big advantage of a pier, as opposed to a solid structure, built at the tide line, is that a whole lot of energy from pounding waves, storms, storm driven debris, etc. gets washed right through the widely spaced pilings, instead of continually pounding at a solid foundation.  Buildings on piers are actually quite common, including everything from multi-story canneries, and warehouses, to restaurants, and even whole amusement parks, so this collection of shops is actually on the smaller side of what is built on tidal piers all around the world.

It's neither dangerous or scary, from an engineering or historical performance perspective, and it's been done for hundreds of years, all around the world.",1586087654,fmhnsht

At that point they are a huge liability, since the labor to disassemble, and the vast pile of trash created while tearing a big motorhome apart, far exceeds the value in scrap aluminum, copper and steel recovered.

18163,Joppalo,"This is a common policy at most places and with overall good reasoning for it. It's not that businesses don't want their employees to receive more money, but rather they don't want to create the environment where customers feel OBLIGATED to tip, like we do at restaurants. This could actually drive people away from going to certain businesses, because tipping often makes people feel guilty if it's ""not enough"" or puts a strain on their finances if they ""tip generously."" 

It also creates somewhat of an expectation by employees that could form a sense of resentment toward regular customers that don't tip them enough or at all. This happens all the time in the restaurant industry with serving staff. I work at a restaurant and many servers have just come to expect no less than a 20% tip regardless of food or service quality, and actually become upset when not getting that expected amount. So the policy is reasonable.  

So the question is how do we show our appreciation monetarily while being careful not to cross that line? I would suggest a nice card with a handwritten message thanking them for doing what they do, with a little cash tucked inside. Put it in an envelope, seal it, and tell them to open it up when they get off work. Tell them you just wanted to show them your appreciation for what they are doing. In the end, it's not a tip. It's a gift. Regardless of the amount of cash inside, most people will enjoy the thought and effort of the card more once they see you took the time and effort to personalize the gift. Our time is what is most valuable and appreciated in life, not money. It's actually very easy to hand over $20 bill, but taking time out of your day to thank someone with your written words takes effort and selflessness. You could even do this with no cash at all, and the person would still be extremely pleased I'm sure.The whole point of it, afterall, isnt the money but the message of ""Thank you.""",1586110032,fmii4t0

To just say ""companies need to treat their employees better"" is an overall good sounding statement, but it's so incredibly broad that it doesnt really accomplish anything. Which companies? Are we talking about franchises or corporate entities? Are small-medium sized businesses included in this? What other benefits does a company offer to their employees as a compensation package that isn't just a salary or hourly wage? How much are those benefits worth to each employee? Would the employee be able to secure X amount of dollars each week without the logistics, product, location, structure, etc of said company? What are the actual operating costs of the business? Does the company offer their product or service at lower competitive prices due to the public's desire for more affordable prices? Does the job with said company provide a social network and sense of purpose for an employee? If so then how much would you say that is worth if given a monetary value? Does the company offer a pathway to upper levels and higher wages? Above all that, who are we really talking about when we define companies? The CEO? The manager? The owner? The team leader? You can have great wages and benefits and have a terrible management team, do we also hold them accountable in this search for better treatment? What's a living wage to the 18 year old fresh out of school vs a living wage to the 34 year old with a newborn? Both have different needs so how do you determine what a living wage is for each situation? Do you calculate a wage by factoring each employee's individual life circumstances? Would you pay one more than the other if their needs are higher? If so, would you ask both to take on all the same responsibilities during work or would you pay them according to their job duties? If an individual takes on debt due to irresponsible spending habits, does that qualify as a need for a higher living wage over the individual that is frugal with their money and has less financial burden?

18240,johnny_birds,"It sounds like you don't know much about tipped employees, or people not getting paid a living wage. That's okay. I'll assume you are being genuine, but I'm kind of getting the idea, that whatever I say, it may not matter. I'll roll the dice though. 

I spent 20 years in the restaurant industry. I've worked all positions, except GM. I can not give you a breakdown of all companies, everywhere. That's unreasonable, and not possible. In the case of many of these entities, be it franchise, or corporate (which aren't much different, as the standards for the structure would be the same, as there is very little room for expression. Uniformity is the point). 

In many areas of the country, tipped employees are paid [$2.13 an hour](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped#Georgia). I worked in one of these states for a long time. Workers are not paid by their employer, but the patrons of the restaurant. The customer decides what your wage is. It is optional. Often, people are not paid for their work. The staff must then tip-out, which means the restaurant garnishes a portion of your tips, to pay the other employees, bussers, bar tenders, hostess. 3%-5% is pretty standard, but I've heard of higher. That's sales, not what you actually made. On a $100 sale, if the table decides not to leave a tip, let's say because the cook made a mistake, it costs that server to work. On slow days, servers are expected to clean, and do manual labor, when they are getting $2.13 an hour. Now, you might say, that's not the minimum wage. Legally, the business is supposed to bump the pay up to the minimum wage. In 20 years, i've never seen it happen. You can't afford to look for a new job, and usually, the statement is go, ""fine, go hire a lawyer."" You rock the boat too much, ""right to work,"" means your employers ""right"" to fire you for any reason. So, from the worker standpoint, it is a horrible system that exploits people, and it is easy to break the law. 

I do not agree with the system where people get to decide what someone else gets paid. Generally, many people do not know how the system works, and don't realize their servers, and bartenders aren't getting paid. Many states have different rules, and wages for tips, but allowing customers to decide what your workers get paid on a case, by case basis does not provide stability for employees. There is evidence to support that paying a fair wage actually helps these businesses, rather than hinders them. If you truly are interested, [ here's an article that describes those successes.](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/13/20690266/seattle-minimum-wage-15-dollars).

As far as who decides what people get paid, based on their age, I'm not saying this to be rude, but that's none of yours, or my business. There are 18 year olds living on their own that need to pay bills. They are doing the same work as someone older than them, and doing the job at a similar experience, and timeline, why should you get to decide that their work is worth less, because you have determined they don't need the money. Their personal lives are irrelevant, and should not be tied to their pay. I do not agree with this sentiment. Equal pay, for equal work. What you are advocating creates a system where prejudice, and judgment are legal.  If someone deserves a higher wage for their time at a company, their experience, or performance, then that is up to the company. If you want supplemental wages paid on number of kids, that is usually sorted out on your tax documents. I do not think myself, or anyone else should have to pay more because someone has children. 

Congratulations, that your worked for a good company. That does not negate the struggle for many others. If your metric is only your personal experiences, you need to understand there is more out there than your personal experience. We don't all live the same lives.  You started by advocating empathy, and kindness, but with the words you are using you are not giving that to people struggling to pay their bills. I believe tipping should be optional, not part of wages. It should be up to the employer to pay their employees. I would prefer it factored into my bill, so that obligation is not passed on to me. In the context of our workers during the pandemic, protective measures, and hazard pay are reasonable requests. If you don't believe that, your concept of kindness needs to be reconsidered. 

As far as feeling bad for CEO's, and business that do not pay a living wage, especially when they are making millions, I don't have much sympathy.  If your workers are given sick leave, healthcare, and a living wage, then you can reward yourself for the fruits of your labor. In this context, many workers are kept below the amount of hours a company allows for benefits to kick in. This is quite common. Even if you are eligible for healthcare benefits, you can't afford to pay them, due to lack of wages. The government is then forced to subsidize these people with food stamps, and medicare, while the board/ ceo rake in profits. Larger companies, like Walmart, and big chains are famous for this. I agree in fair wages, but at some point the amount being funneled to the top, while workers struggle is too much. If there is that much excess, a wage increase is in order. It is the nature of the market to pay as little as possible for lower positions, and exploit the workers. [Here is an article about wages being stagnant, and the inherent problems](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/minimum-wage-increase-numbers_n_5868848).

In the context we are speaking of, the workers at our local grocery stores, these people deserve hazard pay, and to be treated fairly. They deserve to have their lives to be taken seriously. They are literally risking their own lives, and the lives of their families with exposure to a virus, that can hurt, or kill them. If the company is unable to provide protective measures, they should be shut down. We have organizations like OSHA to protect workers from being placed in harm's way, for the sake of another's profit. Are you saying these people that are going to work every day don't deserve to be treated like human beings? Empty words of ""kindness"" mean nothing, if you aren't going t provide the resources to keep them safe. Kindness is something we should be extending to each other regardless. It is being a decent human being. Another facet of that, is making sure these people are safe. Their lives are important. We don't get to put a price tag on human lives because they're 18, and it's their first job. We don't know their stories, and it isn't our place to. We should be demanding that their employers provide them with some sort of protection, and hazard pay for the risk they are taking, while many of us stay inside. They're going to work, so we can have food, at great personal risk. There are companies that do take care of their people. You need to understand there are many, many companies, and people that will not, unless they are made to. My kindness, and empathy is for making sure the people that are helping to keep this aspect of society functioning are taken care of, not thrown under the bus. Be nice to people, that goes without saying, but they also deserve more. They deserve to be safe, and paid for their work. I don't think these are extreme views. I have less sympathy for someone making millions every year giving up some of the profits they make off the back of their workers to make sure they can keep doing a good job. That's called being a decent human, and having a functional society. It benefits all of us. It's good business, as well. Investing in your workers creates an environment where people are more productive.",1586123735,fmj60cf
18241,Pb2Au,"April 4th ended with 8451 cumulative US deaths and 1330 deaths that day, and we've had another death in Alaska this week.

So the model's forecast was more accurate than my guess (I had assumed we'd be over the 10,000 US death mark by yesterday) but I still think its range of uncertainty is way too narrow. In Alaska, for instance, it was forecasting 2 deaths with no band for a +/-. I think it's overconfident for a model to state 'no one is going to die in AK in the next 5 days'

The State can do ""distance delivery"" to rural areas, lowering costs, and claim that it is ""just as good"" without having to use boarding schools. Will it work? I doubt it. The Northwest Arctic Borough School District, for example, spends $40,000 per student per year, gives all the kids macbooks, provides internet at the school with mixed in class and online learning and...measures of proficiency haven't budged in decades. And that's the other elephant in the room for rural Alaska: the past few decades of decadence i.e. small classes, high tech, and highly paid staff is not working either. 

So, do we double down on rural Alaska, despite the fact that costs are high and results are zero? Or do we throw in the towel, give the kids a fake online option, and look the other way so the state can save some money? I mean, I live in rural Alaska and sympathize with my village, but I also sympathize with any productive members of society out there who get pissed when they see numbers like $40k/student/year and only 5% of students district wide being proficient.

We are a sovereign nation, and responsible for how we handle our business, within our borders. We had time to prepare.

And, let's not forget the president spreading false [information](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/22/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus-false-claims-march/index.html).

I live in the USA, and care about how we are handling it. Our leaders were briefed on the matter, and had disbanded the pandemic response team.

Teachers are hauling ass trying to get online shit together for our students and in they walk with a money sink to another state that's under fire for fucking incompetence. This is besides the part where Anchorage has an absolutely horrendous retirement plan for anyone after 2006, and teachers have been fighting for years to the point of constant arbitration to get a contract where the pay *doesn't even keep up with inflation*.

This looks exactly right. Under normal circumstances I could request *Pacific Homosexualities* from a university in my area, but I'll probably have to wait until after the shutdown to learn more on that front. But now I know where to go next! Thank you.

18364,charlievanz,"According to ADN opinion-ist Dermot Cole, this was being cooked up long before the pandemic -- which makes sense when you look at how ""fast"" it would have had to come together if it were merely in response to the pandemic.

Interestingly -- Ketchikan has it's own online school program -- which Michael Boyle, the contractor responsible for finding us this great deal with FVSD, knew full well about considering he was the superintendent there until 2018.  He resigned after it took basically electing a new school board to get a new contract for the teachers, and questions about whether he covered up for a high school teacher who was arrested for sexually abusing a 14 year old.   [https://www.krbd.org/2018/12/17/ketchikan-schools-superintendent-resigns/](https://www.krbd.org/2018/12/17/ketchikan-schools-superintendent-resigns/) 

In fact, when Dunleavy was superintendent, Boyle was his #2 -- and schemed to get Boyle as his replacement.  Dunleavy kept screwing over teachers and staff, denying them raises, while asking raises for himself because of an extra 25 days of work that he was doing -- approximately $12.5k.  He also bailed on a 3-year contract after 8 months.   [http://alaskareport.com/news39/x71320\_mike\_dunleavy.htm](http://alaskareport.com/news39/x71320_mike_dunleavy.htm)
