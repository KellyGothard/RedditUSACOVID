I’m from the Rio Grande Valley, the southernmost counties of Texas. I seen the length of Texas, as I seen the hill country and panhandle, far north as the small town of Dalhart.

People dress very urban in Austin and it’s very weird to me. I’m not an expert on big cities but Austin is exactly what I picture a big liberal city in Cali or the east to look like. I loved Denver Colorado and that city is pretty liberal. The women literally tattoo the Rocky Mountains onto their tits. Austin felt a bit odd though, unlike anywhere in Texas I been. People in Austin love skinny jeans and timbs, and very trendy and expensive clothing.

One last thing though. Maybe it’s because I came in during winter, but Austin looks kind of ugly to me, sorry guys. The hill country is beautiful but the trees in Austin are sad and dead, and there is too many of them.
It makes me realize how much I like the harshness of South Texas. I love the twisted mesquite trees, the giant cactus, the palm trees.

I think Austin is okay, not bad really. But I don’t think I would want to live there. Something doesn’t feel right with Austin. San Antonio is better imo.",texas,Thoughts on Austin

18,18,Aggravating_Lettuce,1577818408,ei72mg,Nan,"In November 2003 Theresa Hawthorne was my victims advocate in regards to my court case with my father. My father sexually assulted me for the majority of my life. CPS was involved in my life as young as 4 years old, and likely before. He beat my mother, eventually they divorced. My family has slightly varied stories, but I had been making outcries of sexual abuse since 2-3 years old. 


When I was 5, my mother died, with in a month of being placed in my dad's sole custody I made another outcry of abuse, this time to my maternal grandmother. She had asked me what I learned at school, simple question, I told her I hadn't learned much today, and eventually she wiggled a ' well I learned to make babies' I would go on to tell her about how my father had requested that I strip and sit on the bathroom sink as he jerked off to completion into the bathroom sink. 


Theresa was supposed to protect me. Instead, She switched sides and became my father's lawyer and tanked my trial. She pushed for a judicial trial knowing that my father would win the case if she took away the chance at a jury trial.


She guided my father to winning her trial, she left me in foster care to rot for six months, I can go on and on about the injustice of the foster care system I was put in, but I'll move onto the second part of this story, because Hawthornes decision to let my father go ultimately led to my life being fueled by tauma that she alone could have spared me from. 


My grandmother spent nearly 40,000k to get me out of the foster care system after my father was found not guilty. CPS agreed that at the very least, I wasn't going to go back to my father willingly. We lived together, through much hardship, as she had lost my mother and her husband in the span of six months, and I lived with my grandma until I was 12. 



This is where Hawthornes decisions started to cause real impact, as by the time I was 12, my father had remarried a 19 year old and had his first son.


 Understand for one moment that I grew up mostly alone. I have no siblings and my grandmother was very depressed. When I was offered a chance to meet my father and meet my brother and have a family, it was a no-brainer to me. I quickly moved back into my father's residence on good faith, even if something had happened, I figured he wouldn't do anything again, especially now with a wife and family at risk. 


I was wrong. 


That's really all I can say. 


I was so wrong. I was with my father for less than a year when I confessed the abuse to my English teacher. By this time, I considered being molested .. normal... I wasn't raped by him, maybe I can call that a blessing, but when I finally left. It was close. The last time he had abused me he had desperately tried to convince me to allow penetration, then punished me severely when I rejected. 


My life was sad. I had the best grades I had in my life. I felt the most loved I had in my life. I adored my brother and sister. I adored my step mom. I had the structure I so desperately needed to thrive. 


Then I walked in on my dad eyeing my little sister. Everything changed at once. It wasn't just me anymore. I wasn't a special victims in my eyes. He was a pedophile. 


The very next morning, I walked into my English teachers room and told her. For nearly 6 years, saying goodbye to my brother and sister would be my last goodbye. 


My father made me into a monster to everyone he knew. A master manipulator. A promiscuous flirt. I couldn't even begin to regurgitate the things that have been said to me. Can hardly handle thinking about how my step mom and her family stalked me online and desperately tried to poke holes in my story. I wish I could express further, but when I think about the trauma my step mom and father put me through AFTER I was taken from their home. After they realized I wasnt going to suddenly recant my story, they basically disowned me. 


This time though, his personal attacks didn't work, this time I won, this time I was mature enough to articulate the abuse I was going through, not a child who didn't know the word for penis. I put my father in jail for 79 years. It was finally over. This man who was first accused of molesting me when I was there, finally was being held accountable for his actions. He finally couldn't lie his way out of it&amp; he didn't have Hawthorne to guide him to victory. 



Hawthorne had a responsibility to protect me as my victim advocate, and when she choose to switch sides and represent my father, she promoted my re-victimization in my teens directly. She used her inside knowledge about my case to sway the courts to get my father aquited. She does not deserve to be a judge anywhere, and needs to be held accountable for letting abusers off the hook. 

When I read that she had cast doubt on other Victims I knew my story needed to be shared. Her actions have hurt me tremendously, and at the very least she needs to have to face the consequences of her actions head on.  So I'm here. Thanks for reading.

20,20,Bennyscrap,1577820497,ei7kab,Meta,"Recently, our beautiful and glorious /r/Texas has had some pretty serious issues to contend with.  As most of our regulars have probably noticed, our mod team has undergone a few changes.  First off,  Brian has decided to take a bit of time off from Reddit.  Most of you know him as the mod that did pretty much everything around here.  Serious supermod type person.  The stress of the holidays and moderating as much as he did was beginning to be a bit much.  As such, he's taken a sabbatical from Reddit as a whole.  The mod team sends their best wishes to him in his future endeavors and if he ever decides to give it another go, he has an open position waiting for him on our team.  Thanks for all of your wisdom and assistance, Brian.

In his leave, we've acquired the assistance of both /u/Asteroids_are_fun and /u/CaldronCalm.  Asteroids has modded the sub before months ago and left on good terms.  They were asked to come back in the role they filled formerly.  Caldron is a friend of mine who has a good head on their shoulders and will be an excellent addition as well.

These additions come at a good time.  It was brought to our attention that our moderator Scozzar was being doxxed by a now banned, longtime user of the sub.  It came as a bit of a shock to all of us.  Regardless of how you feel about any mod and/or user, doxxing is a **HUGE** issue that Reddit takes very seriously.  Not only that, but some instances of it are illegal in the state of Texas.  The mod team cares not how integral you are to this community.  You could be the pope pooping in the woods, but if you dox, you will be banned and reported to the admins who will take it very seriously.  Doxxing isn't funny.  It's not a game.  If you have an issue with a user, report it to the mods.  If you have an issue with a mod, speak to another mod about it or find another sub to chat on.  There's never a good reason to release another user's personal information.  Because of this very serious issue, Scozzar has left the moderation team and Reddit as a whole.  The mod team thanks him for his service and the integrity that he brought to our team.

Finally, as a personal ask, as a whole, we need to do better about separating individuals from their opinions online.  There's lots of people in your own personal life who hold opinions different than you, and yet most of them that you've interacted with, prove themselves to be good people.  Your disagreements that you have in regards to opinion are totally acceptable.  The world's not perfect and we all have our thoughts on ways to improve it.  But holding personal vendettas against anonymous users on a website is negative stress that will only deteriorate your health(both mental and physical).  If you find yourself getting too riled up from debate, step back and take a moment in the real world to appreciate what exists around you.  There should never be any reason to attempt to ruin another person's life for words on the internet.  Granted, you're all able to utilize the internet how you see fit(to a degree as long as it doesn't harm another user), but with the new year and a new election facing us, please consider the user on the other side of the screen more.  Be considerate in your tone and dialogue.  Nobody makes it out of this life alive, but if we can make life easier for each other, then the world inherently becomes a better place.

Thanks for being the best sub on Reddit and happy new decade!  Wishing positive vibes and good will to all in this new year!

We just got the itemized security deposit deductions and landlord is trying to deduct almost $700 to replace burnt grass in one area of the backyard that isn't under trees or shade. We live in Austin and dealt with that record-breaking 100+° heatwave and are on a one-a-week water restriction so even with the weekly 4am automatic irrigation that one section was burnt out. I had our landscape guy over and he said he sees it at every house and there's nothing more we could have done and that with that type of grass and that it'll eventually grow back.
Can they legally charge for this (lease says to water lawn for 30 min every week and mow lawn - there was an HOA - nothing else about the lawn.) and has anyone else dealt with this and what did you do?

This landlord was awful and so many things broke weeks after we moved in. Central A/C broke, refrigerator started leaking, dryer vents completely clogged and we had to pay for someone to clear them (she wouldn't fix anything related to washer or dryer as it was left by old tenants) was causing ceiling light to burn out when we did laundry, gates broke/couldn't open them, sprinkler head was buried and broken and we paid hundreds on our water bill and had to have Austin Water look for the leak, stove vent broke, cockroaches were coming out of vents the first week we lived there (before our moving boxes arrived and house was empty)... I mean I could go on but you get the idea. Point being, she was a POS the whole time we lived there and now I feel like she's trying to pull one over on us and we'll most likely have to take her to small claims court. She made is pay just under $5k (includes pet deposit) just to move into this damn place. We were on a time restriction (only reason we'd agree to s ridiculous deposit request) and had really great credit but I'm thinking she is a scam artist. She's trying to keep our full deposit AND charge us for crap that doesn't exist like holes in the wall, replacing doorknobs.. Just weird things. Too bad she may not realize I took photos and video day we moved that would show a judge that she's making shit up. 
This thing has stressed us out because even though we know she's doing some weird crap, my spouse and I have never dealt with any legal issues before in the 40+ years of existence and going to try and send her all proof as to why she can't charge for x, y and z but the dead grass thing is an issue I can't find a set answer about online.",texas,"Landlord trying to deduct $600+ from our deposit for ""dead grass"".

I'm a Canadian and I'm going to be applying for jobs in your state. I intend to wait until my car is 25 years old, and then import it into the USA (and I won't perform an engine swap in Canada, as I think that might disqualify it for importation to the USA).

But are there any TX-specific regulations that I should be aware of? How much does the government involve themselves with what's happening in your engine bay?

Also curious to see if there is much of a RHD community in TX.

The sensitivity readers mentioned the Spanish being a bit wonky, and I'm aware that Spanish-English can vary wildly by geographic region, so I want to make sure I get this as authentic and correct as possible. Anybody feel like giving the lines a once-over?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Toyota laid you off?” asked Salina. *“¿Qué coño le pasa a esta gente?* They can’t do that. They can’t. Who do they think they are?”  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Amor,* if I wanted to hurt you, I would hurt you any old time.""  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Estúpida,”* Salina said, cursing in Spanish, snagging her jean jacket. “My only good jacket. Stupid, stupid.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Salina let go of the fence and paced around Carly, gesticulating. “Now you’re talking nonsense. Next thing I know you’re going to be seeing, *como se di ce,* chupacabra and such. Bigfoot.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Her mother gaped at her for a second with a shocked look, but also somehow admiring. “All right then, *mi pequeño ladron.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Chingada madre,”* he said to himself in the quiet trailer.  
&gt;  
&gt;Blood streamed down Isabella’s lips from her busted nose. Elisa took a napkin out of her purse and dabbed it against her girlfriend’s face, tilting Isabella’s head back. *“Si no la golpeó, ella todavía estaría aquí, pedazo de mierda,”* she growled, muffled by the fabric.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gil’s watery yellow eyes searched Robin’s face, and he seemed impressed by what he saw. “Maybe there’s a little steel in you, hon. But it ain’t gonna save you when Santi gets his claws into you. ’Cause I’m here to tell you, he’s got claws. And they are long and sharp, *amiga.* They’ve all got claws. And teeth.”  
&gt;  
&gt;A werewolf clung to the driver door, reaching in through the window, trying to steer them onto the shoulder. Salina threw elbow after elbow into its jaw, fighting with the wheel. “Let go! *¡Hijo de puta!* Stop!”  
&gt;  
&gt;“There has always been a side to him. Another side, something mean. And, well, the motorcycle, it—*como se dice,* magnify that side, it strengthen him, work him up. You know?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“When he was young, before he made road captain, when we first met. His *lujuria por la vida,* his lust for life, was part of why I fell for him in the first place—he was the take-charge kind of man, a leader, I think. Or at least I thought he was.""  
&gt;  
&gt;“You’re done now, *maldita puta,”* a man said, standing over her.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Yeah. February, maybe. *No recuerdo por qué fuimos.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;“No,” he said, tears spilling out of his eyes. Droplets turned blue on the white sheets piled at his feet. *“No, yo la amaba. La amo.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;“No, she’s dead. *Ella está follando muerto. Gracias a esa perra punk que murió en el incendio.* She can’t go anywhere now.”  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Jesucristo, que es verdad, soy un monstruo,”* he said in hoarse Spanish, feeling his face.  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Buen día,”* said Salina.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Is this what it’s like?” asked Salina. “For, *como se dice,* near-death experience? To see heaven, and to experience it, and come back to the real world?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Never really went to church. *Por favor perdoname,* God never did much for me.""",texas,Looking for help with a few lines of Spanish in my manuscript. Any Texas native Spanish-speakers around?

To change the map so it shows the **Texas state senate districts**:

1. Click the basemap button (Next to the ""Menu"" button)

2. Look under the ""Overlay"" heading (mobile users scroll down)

3. Click the house layers to turn them off

4. Click the senate ""fill"" layer and then the senate ""boundary"" layer.

It may take a few seconds for the data to appear.  It depends on how busy the GIS server is and the speed of your internet connection.  

The map is displayed by GISsurfer which is a general purpose web map I developed as a public service and part of my way to ""pay it forward"".  There is a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with some general ‘Help' information.

First of all everyone here is SOOOO friendly! Like what the hell? I feel like you guys out-nice the midwest in how genuinely friendly and welcoming everyone here is.

Where I had been living previously it's rainy 3/4s out of the year to the point it crushes your soul but here EVERY DAY IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY. 

The landscape is breathtaking too, though this might be more local to west Texas. You'll be alone on a flat desert highway and then all of a sudden in the distance you'll see the mountains rising from the nothing into the sky and it's like it's straight out of a video game. I swear to God even though it's 2020 I feel like I'm in the wild west cowboy land and it's amazing the freedom and opportunity I feel.

Then of course there's the great economy, cheap housing, world class cities, but you all know about this already. Anyway, as someone who had never thought much about Texas before or expected to ever live here I'm pleasantly been surprised at how much I'm falling in love with this state. :)",texas,I'm surprised to discover fucking love Texas

Chapter 411, Subchapter H. which lists all the legal requirements for eligibility for a License To Carry (LTC)

The only eligibility requirement I do not meet is the age requirement, and it says

“ Notwithstanding Subsection (a)(2), a person who is at least 18 years of age but not yet 21 years of age is eligible for a license to carry a handgun if the person:
(1)  is a member or veteran of the United States armed forces, including a member or veteran of the reserves or national guard;
(2)  was discharged under honorable conditions, if discharged from the United States armed forces, reserves, or national guard; and
(3)  meets the other eligibility requirements of Subsection (a) except for the minimum age required by federal law to purchase a handgun.
(h)  The issuance of a license to carry a handgun to a person eligible under Subsection (g) does not affect the person's ability to purchase a handgun or ammunition under federal law.”

For clarification, is subsection (h) to say that while I may possess a License to Carry, I may not purchase a handgun or ammunition from an FFL?

382,382,BC3613,1578767846,enb7tu,News," By Tracy R. Mesler - Nocona News  
The Nocona City Council is poised to  adopt a new set of rules and regulations Tuesday affecting Lake Nocona  including the adoption of boat launch fees, dock fees and fees for  conducting fishing tournaments on the lake.  
The council will meet at 5  p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 14, at the Nocona City Hall in a council chambers  with seating for less than 20 members of the public.  
While  technically the city assumed full legal control of Lake Nocona on Dec.  31 including its water pump station, raw water line and water treatment  plant, in effect the city has been in sole management of the lake since  the Texas Legislature passed a bill in May calling for the dissolution  of the North Montague County Water Supply District and its Board of  Directors which built and managed the lake for more than 60 years.  
The  Water District, which was created by the Texas Legislature in the late  1950s and built the lake and water treatment plant, held its last board  meeting last month dissolving all operations and transferring more than  $220,000 to the city on Dec. 31.  
In late summer Mayor Robert Fenoglio  appointed a committee composed of Councilmen Robert Fuller and Steve  Tettleton, himself and City Manager Lynn Henley to look into  establishing new rules for the operation of the lake.  
Committee  meetings, because they do not include a majority of the five members of  the city council, are not subject to the Texas Open Meetings Act calling  for the posting of a certified agenda at least 72 hours prior to the  meeting nor are such meetings required to be open to the public.  
Friday,  at 5:29 p.m. City Secretary Revell Hardison released the agenda for  Tuesday’s monthly meeting of the Nocona City Council to the Nocona News.  Included on the agenda is both a discussion of the proposed rules, and  consideration of adopting the rules.  
According to city officials,  with City Manager Henley secured rules from other area lakes and  Councilman Fuller worked on modifying the rules, to a large extent the  rules are based on similar provisions previously adopted by the Water  District.  
One major change is establishing new fees applied to all  existing docks, for launching or operating any boats or any motorized  vessel on the lake, and for operating a working barge or raft.  
Among the changes, and additions to the rules the North Montague County Water Supply District had adopted over the years are:  
\--""No  swimming, fishing, boating, picnicking or other recreational activities  will be permitted within 500 feet of the water intakes. All water  intakes will be kept plainly marked by all times.”  
\--“All work  barges, barges, rafts, floating platforms or other similar crafts, not  connected to the shore by walkway, must secure a permit from the City …”  
\--“No  type of craft under this {work barge} category shall exceed 300 square  feet in size. Fees will be charged for permits issued to owners as  follows: (On annual basis from September 1 through August 31) at a fee  of $35.”  
\--“Owners of all docks, walkways, boats, houseboats, barges,  rafts, floating platforms or any floating crafts by any other name muse  be allow periodic inspections at any and all times by proper  authorities…”  
\--Fee for operating commercial boats shall be $200 for each boat per year.  
\--“A  permit will be required for the launching of or use of private crafts –  power driven vessels on the waters of Lake Nocona which are used for  pleasure purposed only – such as boating, fishing, skiiting, etc.”  
\--Daily ramp or launch fee of $5 or an annual boat permit fee of $35 for all power-driven vessels.”  
\--‘’No  person shall construct in or upon the shores of Lake Nocona any dock,  pier, wharf or other similar fixed structure without a dock construction  permit and it may not extending more than 100 feet from the elevation,  833 feet above sea level into or toward the lake.”  
\--“An annual dock or walkway permit fee of $150 for each dock or walkway.”  
\--“Dock construction permit fee of $250 for each dock or walkway constructed.”  
\--“A  fishing tournament fee of $200 will be required per every fishing  tournament.” (Paid prior to the fist day of the tournament.)  
\--“Camping  is limited to 15 days at any one time.” (Continuation of existing rules  which also requires a minimum of 30 days between each 15 days of  on-site camping.)  
\--“$25 fee for RV camping with power, water and septic.”  
\--“All permits, fees and fines will also be credited back to the Lake Nocona operation fund.”  
The fine for violating any of the rules is not to exceed $500 per incident or violation.  
The  Lake Committee has not held any public meetings regarding the proposed  changes. Nor has the entire council discussed the changes other than an  agreement that “some fees” should be assessed and the funds used to  maintain and improve the lake’s dam, three parks and its raw water  pumping station.",texas,"City Of Nocona to adopt new lake rules, fees Tuesday"

14 So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, 15 where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”[c]

16 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. 17 Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:

I visited Texas back in 2005, to be fair I was 12, but growing up in Russia I was forced to mature quickly so I wasn’t an airhead and remember things clearly. I was in Texas for 3 months and it was the best 3 months of my life...

Always warm outside, the people, the parks, the sunshine... for someone who’s been freezing her ass off for 28 years, I am so, so ready for sunshine. I don’t mind hot weather at all. 

Now, here is where I need your help... I’m a classic over thinker and also probably an unrealistic dreamer. I’d love to find a place that’s country but I am also sucker for a beautiful city and city events, live music etc. I do love the county and prefer a place for my two dogs to play endlessly in my backyard. I’d love to find a safe neighborhood as well within the city I am settled with. So far I’ve been thinking Fort Worth for the city but not overwhelming city like Houston,  or Corpus Christi for the beaches. We work from home so traffic etc doesn’t bother us.

I am terrified of natural disasters as in WA there are none... I have 5 rescues so at the thought of gathering them all during a tornado is just overwhelming so I’d love to find a place where those are to a minimum. 

Am I being realistic here? If so, what are your recommendations? TIA!",texas,Howdy! (lol sorry couldn’t resist!) my heart longs for Texas but my head overthinks. Help.

601,601,lisa_smithsolar,1579371182,eqjycl,Opinion,"Panasonic solar panels are considered as best efficient solar panels in the world. It has been manufacturing solar panels, since 1980. Since then Panasonic has aiming to provide the best services to the entire world. In spite, it has made Solar panels all around the world. While Panasonic is manufacturing the majority of the best solar panels in Asia. Other Companies in the United States, Canada, and other countries also produce high-quality photovoltaic. Nowadays, Panasonic starts Project in Buffalo city of New York State and over, there Panasonic manufacturing best solar panels. Afterword, the production of the best solar panels still is a quest for customers because they need quality.

**Currently, by applying** the back-contact structure of heterojunction technology. Consequently, researchers are working to develop the conversion efficiency of a practical-sized cell (more than 100 cm2).  Researchers have been able to achieve the world’s highest cell conversion efficiency of 25.6% (publicized in April 2014).  In general, this achievement brings in a lot of attention. In fact, this remarkable achievement broke not just Panasonic’s records for practical size cell to-date.

**Along with breaking** the world record for even small size cells (4cm2 at 25.0%, stated by the UNSW, 1999). Even though it had gone unbroken for 15 years. Currently, Panasonic introduces the features of an innovative hetero-junction cell structure made of monocrystalline and amorphous silicon layers. Specifically, Ultra-thin amorphous silicon layers prevent the recombination of electrons, keeping transfer loss to an absolute minimum. As a result, Panasonic hit solar panels conversion efficiency ratings are amid the highest available today. At present, it is meeting up with all the modern needs of energy.

**Conversely,** in the United States, people are moving towards solar energy in terms of electricity and finding the best efficiency. After the assembling of Panasonic 330w solar panels, everyone could get installation for their residential. As well as commercial areas and can utilize the solar panel system.

**Panasonic hit solar panels** are thumping other solar panels efficiency levels and provide the best services to customers. Moreover, it is sporting the world’s highest conversion efficiency. To sum up, it is supported by technological development spanning 40 years. Among the most significant of which is silicon heterojunction solar cell technology.

**Additionally,** the Panasonic solar panel provides a powerful combination of increased module efficiency, energy savings, and durable long-term performance. Besides, Panasonic 330w solar panel has much-advanced technology according to the requirements of the time with the same dimension. Likewise, Panasonic 330w solar panel produces more power than conventional crystalline modules. Overall this new technology is also environment-friendly its thin amorphous silicon layers reduce electron importer loss to the marginal level. The result is an extraordinarily high-efficiency solar cell that produces larger long-term energy output.

## Conclusion:

Panasonic solar panels are some of the most competitively priced panels offered to solar shoppers in the Solar Marketplace. Comparatively, they deal with some of the maximum efficiency products on the marketplace for a very economical price. Particularly when they matched to other high-efficiency products like SunPower. Similarly, they have an industry-leading warranty of 25 years. Therefore, there are plenty of compelling reasons to consider Panasonic solar panels for your home solar installation.

639,639,texansirena,1579472089,er3a9e,Questions for Texans,"So when I was growing up in TX in the 1990s, there was a store in New Braunfels that we would always stop at on our way to the outlets in San Marcos. I can’t remember the name, but I know they sold a LOT of bedding, sheets, home goods, etc. I think the lettering on the store front was white with some sort of lion or griffin as the logo. Does anyone remember this place??",texas,does anyone else remember this store?
640,640,MaskaPhobia,1579474839,er3x58,Questions for Texans,"So I’ve been dreaming to move to TX for years now and thanks to this sub I got some good ideas for a great town/city (haven’t made final decision yet) but my husband likes to put a negative spin on everything and this time it’s snakes. 

When we go hiking sometimes we have places that not many know about and no one ever goes to so we let our doodles off leash where they run around and play. No wildlife, no dangers, dogs happy.

Well my husband says that TX has snakes and we won’t be able to do that, maybe even not in our own backyard. So of course that made me worry... one of the reasons I wanted to move is because our dogs (and in the future, kids?) can’t really play outside in the winter. It’s not snowy, it’s wet. Always raining. Can’t really go outside for weeks at a time.

So is this true? Any dog owners here? What’s it like being a dog owner in TX? 

What other dangers are there for dogs? 

TIA!",texas,"Is it safe to let dogs play off leash in TX? (Sorry for stupid question, read below for explanation)"

828,828,ultimate_ed,1579908436,etiiy3,Nan,"I keep running into this, including just today - a sign saying left/right lane closed/ends in xxx feet.  Often for construction closures, but I've certainly seen similar for just regular lanes ending (I-10 dropping from three lanes down to two going west out past Katy comes to mind).

A lot of folks will immediately merge a half mile ahead of the merge point and then get pissed off at the folks who continue in the lane up to the actual merge point.

Instead of saying ""lane ends is xx feet"" it would make more sense to have the sign say ""merge right/left in xx feet"" so that everyone knows that traffic should continue to use the lane up until the point it ends and then everyone should merge in a zipper fashion.  There's plenty of info that says this is better for overall flow, but it seems most drivers don't even know about the concept.  This results in a lot of folks out to dispense ""justice"" on the road by not letting people in at the merge point.

I think the key is TxDOT actively using signage (or requiring the contractors that do the work do it) that indicates the zipper merge technique is the correct way to handle a lane ending.

And, let me be clear, I'm talking about actual merges where a lane disappears.  For the cases where an off ramp is backed up down the freeway and folks are continuing down the main lane and then trying to cut in at the last minute instead of getting in line - no sympathy for them.  They end up blocking the main lane while they sit there waiting for some sucker to let them in.

The distance between the end of the highway and the entrance I was to turn into was pretty short. And if there is one thing I am nervous about doing, its trying to cross into a lane that would position me for a turn into the entrance but there are a bunch of cars on the lane that would prevent me from doing so. So I try to get into the lane I need to way before i have to make a turn into an entrance. 

I was coming off the highway and put on my blinker to signal i was going right(right onto the stretch of road but i still would have to turn right again into the lane that lines up with the entrance), but someone was coming into the lane i was about to turn into. His blinker was on to go left, into the lane I was on and about to leave. 

But I am on a highway(that's ending) and from what I get stopping or slowing down is not an option(correct me if I am wrong). So I thought he would let me pass(thats what I do when I see someone about to come of the highway and into the lane I am on. Their speed is so fast i just let them go.) but he didnt. And I almost hit him and when he got to be side my side with me, he was shouting at me.

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

* She had light brown hair, 10’’ long, cut in wing fashion.
* She had hazel eyes.
* She had 1 ½’’ scar at the end of her right eyebrow.
* She had pierced ears.
* Her toenails were painted pink.
* The general condition of the body and her overall health and nutrition indicated she had probably come from a middle class home.
* She may have had an inverted right nipple.
* Her teeth were well cared for. 
* The following articles of clothing were found:  
   Blue jeans  
   Yellow shirt with large pockets  
   Panties and pantyhose - descriptions unavailable  
   A pair of red leather high-heeled sandals, 3"" or 4"" inch platforms with light brown straps had been thrown beside the body.
* She was wearing a rectangular-shaped pendant with a smoky blue or brown glass stone on a very thin gold chain. This necklace was mysteriously lost and was never photographed. Reports are unclear of the description of the necklace.
* The victim was found when a truck driver was passing by the Sam Houston National Forest. She was lying face down on the shoulder of I-45 north, a half mile south of FM 1696 exit, 2 miles north of Huntsville. They then called the police at 9:20a.m. to report his discovery.
* She had been severely beaten and sexually assaulted.
* The autopsy revealed she had been violated both rectally and vaginally by a blunt instrument with enough force to cause internal injuries. There was no semen found on or in the victim’s body.
* She was then strangled with a pair of pantyhose.
* Both the pantyhose and the decedent's underwear were found inside the victim’s vaginal cavity, likely to prevent bleeding.
* Her face and body were covered with bruises from the beating and there was a human bite mark on her back near her right shoulder.
* After the murder became known through media accounts, several people came forward and said they’d seen a teenager matching her description the day before her body was found. These were the accounts:  
   A witness identified the victim as a girl who had been at the South End Gulf station around 6:30 PM on Halloween night asking for directions to the Ellis prison unit.She had been wearing blue jeans, a yellow pullover sweater with big pockets that hung below her waist, and she was carrying high-heeled sandals in her hand. To the best of his recollection, she had been let out of a 1973 or 1974 blue Chevrolet with a lighter colored top, possibly a Caprice, which was being driven by a white male. She looked disheveled like she had been traveling and perhaps sleeping in her clothes. She left the station, walking north on Sam Houston Avenue.  
   A waitress working at the Hitchin’ Post truck stop on Interstate 45 said the girl came into the restaurant the same evening and again, asked for directions to the Ellis Unit, saying she had a friend there. A map was drawn for her and she departed. The waitress asked the girl how old she was and the girl responded 19. The waitress thought that was an obvious lie and then asked the girl if her parents knew where she was. The young girl replied, ""Who cares."" The waitress then asked her where she was from. The girl replied the Aransas Pass / Rockport area. It has not been verified that the girl was the unidentified victim.
* Because of the two sightings, police showed her photograph to every inmate and employee at Ellis Prison Unit, but no one claimed to know the girl. They also traveled to both the Rockport and Aransas Pass districts to alert law enforcement about an unidentified murder victim, but to no avail. Staff at schools in both districts were also contacted by investigators for the same purpose, and numerous Texas high school books were searched for any female known to be missing whose physical features matched her description. All efforts to identify her failed.
* It has been speculated Henry Lee Lucas killed this girl, but investigators could not make a match between the bite mark on her left shoulder and his dental reconstruction.
* She does not appear in any of the high school yearbooks from the Aransas Pass/Rockport area for that era.
* Authorities don't believe that she had been living on the streets for very long, as she appeared to be well-nourished and her teeth were well-cared for.
* Her body was exhumed in 1999 and examined by a forensic anthropologist to obtain better information regarding her age and height, and to obtain a DNA sample. Her DNA profile was then put into the national CODIS database.
* In November 2015, the case was officially reopened by the Walker County Sheriff's Office.  


Theories:

* In December 2015, a [photograph ](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/unidentified/images/7/78/Kathleen.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151215234907)surfaced of a white female, aged approximately 14 years old and 5 feet 4 inches in height and whose other physical characteristics also closely match those of Walker County Jane Doe. The girl depicted in the image is a possible runaway named ""Cathleen"" or ""Kathleen"" who may have hailed from Corpus Christi. This photograph emerged after a brother and sister reviewed a private collection of images taken of themselves—then aged 12 and 10—at a motel in Beeville, Texas in the summer of 1980. These siblings had encountered this girl at the motel in question and recall both that she may have lived with a couple at the time the image was taken, and that she had expressed her wishes to meet a friend from Sugarland Prison. Both of these siblings sincerely believe that Cathleen (or Kathleen) may actually be Walker County Jane Doe.
* She may have been ""Kitty"", an unidentified 17-years old girl who was living in Galveston youth shelter and whose photo - featured in 1980 documentary ""Runaways""- shows resemblance to the victim. It's also possible that Jane Doe, ""Kitty"" and ""Kathy/Cathy"" mentioned above are the same person.
* Some individuals have theorized that Walker County Jane Doe may have actually been assaulted and murdered by a female assailant as opposed to a male. This theory was initially suggested by a journalist named Michael Hargraves, who based this assumption upon the fact that no semen was found upon or within the body of Walker County Jane Doe, or at the actual crime scene, and that the only sexual assaults conclusively proven to have been committed upon the girl were performed by aggressively forcing an object or objects into her bodily orifices. Hargraves elaborated his theory by stating that men who commit crimes of a sexual nature are typically known to bite their victims upon sensitive areas of the body as opposed to the shoulder, as had occurred in this case.   
The act of male perpetrators of murders committed with a sexual motivation occasionally collecting souvenirs from their victims was also noted to be inconsistent with this case, as the necklace the girl had worn was still present upon her body. However, the fact that it is unknown if Walker County Jane Doe had worn other items of jewelry at the time of her murder, and that her ears were pierced yet her earlobes held no earrings may negate this portion of Hargraves' theory. Furthermore, most of the girl's clothing was missing from the crime scene.
* She may have been killed by the same man as Debra Jackson, previously known as ""Orange Socks,"" who was found around the same day a year before. Both were strangled, sexually assaulted and left nude by a highway, except for footwear. Henry Lee Lucas confessed to killing Jackson but later recanted; he was working in Florida the day Jackson was murdered. He confessed to thousands of murders in the country that he did not commit, resulting in coercion by detectives or for fame.
* She may have been killed by a serial killer connected to the Texas Killing Fields.
* She may have also been a victim of the theorized ""I-45 Killer.""
* She may have known the prisoner she was seeking to visit through a prison pen pal program.
* She may have been from the Gulf Coast region of Texas.

We are planning to move from Anchorage, AK to Texas sometime in the next 8-18 months, but we don't know where we should be considering. 

Where do you think we should live, and what should we do/see before we leave next Tuesday?  


Some information:

\-We both grew up in Anchorage, which has a population of about 300k and is very spread out, so we haven't done any real big city driving/living. 

\-We would like to be in relatively close proximity to a city so that we can enjoy the nightlife

\-We are in our early 20s and would like to start a family within the next 5 years

\-My job can be done online, but in the future, I will need to travel about 50% of the time, so access to a major airport is important

\-My wife works in Real Estate, so larger communities serve her job better.

\-We make about a combined $85k, but there is a lot of room for growth in our careers

\-We would like to avoid high cost of living, if at all possible.

\-We would like to be able to afford a 3 bed, 2 bath house with a pool. 

\-We have enjoyed Dallas and Arlington, and we plan to visit Houston later this week

\-What is your opinion on the heat? I have been in Mississippi summer heat, but my wife has never experienced humid heat like Texas gets.  


Thanks in advance for any help you send our way, we really appreciate it!",texas,My wife and I could use some advice on where to live

Why is there no H-E-B closer than Waxahachie (26 miles from me) or Ennis (33 miles) or Burleson (37 miles)??  I know Dallas is supposedly a very competitive grocery market (a buddy of mine is a District Manager for that K branded heathen non-Texan store).  I know that you have a Central Market or two here.  Yet there is no place for our beloved H-E-B?

You know we love you.  It can honestly be proposed that (barring firearms) if H-E-B doesn't sell it, it's not really Texan.  Okay, not really, but you guys really do get what being a Texan is in many ways.  You're as Texan as Buc-ee's, smoked brisket, fierce pride, and good manners.

You treat your employees phenomenally well (wanna open an office in Dallas, cuz I'd love to work for you folks without moving to SA).  You maintain a Disaster Relief Unit (consisting of mobile kitchens, water tankers, and the ability to fill prescriptions in affected areas) and have since the early 80's (neat stories here:  [https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/heb-took-care-communities-harvey/](https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/heb-took-care-communities-harvey/) ).  You support your community with inclusive initiatives, scholarships, and charitable donations.  You even tailor each and every store to the community it resides in (your store off 45th in Austin has everything a college kid could want, and your store in Mueller makes young families happy with craft beers (on tap!) and lots of healthy, kid-friendly choices, literally).

And of course, your groceries!  Fresh, vibrant produce with prices that beat your consistently beat your competitors.  A robust deli.  Featuring tons of Texas native products all across the store.  FRESHLY MADE TORTILLAS in every store (do you know how much I miss that???).  Whataburger Spicy Ketchup on the shelves.  That Green Sauce (oh lort I miss it).  Rows and rows of local Texas products, made by Texans for Texans.

Yes, I make the trek occasionally to the Waxahachie store, but it's a lot of driving for a dude who moved downtown a block from where he works so he doesn't ever have to commute again.  I've written you letters.  Posted on your Facebook page.  Now, I've appealed to you on Reddit.

**You're needed here.**  All there is anymore is Kroger and Tom Thumb - Albertson's is gone from Dallas, as far as I can tell, and there's like one Aldi and two Sprouts in the whole city.  Kroger, no offense to my good buddy, is drab and boring.  The produce section is lackluster, and the meat even worse.  Tom Thumb is stuck in a 1980s time warp except with sky-high prices.  Every time I walk into a grocery store in this town all that comes out of my mouth is ""\*expletive\* I miss H-E-B.""

**Come on, H-E-B, we've been patient.  Waited for decades.  Will you come and help Dallas be as Texan as the rest of Texas?**

**Sincerely,**

**Your Devoted Legion of Fans**  
**and totally this guy who just misses having decent groceries around**",texas,A refreshed rant and love letter - WHY IS THERE NO HEB IN DALLAS?????

I have held a Texas Driver's License since 1988.  

I believe, after some research, that I can get a Consular Report of Birth Abroad from the State Department...  but that is actually complicated by the fact that I now don't have a valid ID.  Even in the best case, it can take 6 to 8 weeks.  Am I just going to miss voting in the primary because of this?

As the last big project we have to make before we go to university we were free to choose whichever subject we liked, and spend at least 80 hours working on this per person with a group of 3. We chose to make a project about the difference in digitalisation between India and the Western world. For example the difference between the governmental actions, Digital India, and a project to fund innovating businesses in the Netherlands. The survey is mainly to compare what we found with the reality, did the differences actually occur, or did some people write about it and everybody just assumed it as the truth.

I posted a while back about a road trip I’m taking my dad on through Texas. We’re from Australia and don’t know much about that part of your state.

The road trip is Austin - San Antonio - Bandera - Fredericksburg - Childress (closest accommodation to Turkey for Bob Wills Day) - Fort Worth/Dallas.

I’ve been over a couple of times before but never been to Fredericksburg or Childress/Turkey. It’s about a 5 hour drive and we’re not in a rush so would love some ideas for stops along the way or even slightly out of the way. Looking for historic towns, antique stores etc. Anything interesting and unique to Texas. 

Any suggestions would be awesome!

my sister and I will visit Texas this year and we hope you would share your insider tipps with us, so we can expierence the best parts of your beautiful state. We visited the US for the first time last year (LA, San Diego, Grand Canyon, Las Vegas) and we really enjoyed hanging out with the locals on our stops in smaller towns over the more touristy stuff.

During this trip we would like to:
Visit a state fair (there are so many, any recommendations which ones are the best?)
Try some Texas BBQ
Go to see and spend time on a farm/ranch (I found a lot of offers for ""dude ranches"" but don't really know what to look for to find a nice/authentic one)
Visit a typical american event like a rodeo, a football game or cheerleading competition (the atmosphere at these always seems to be so unique and unlike anything we have around here)
Visit the cities/places/sights you love most in Texas

We are quite flexible on the date but we were planning to stay for about 2 weeks, we will rent a car for the whole time but are also happy to walk around towns/national parks. We did not book any flights yet so we could arrive and depart in any city.

Looking forward to your suggestions :)",texas,Hoping for some travel advice to expierence the best parts of Texas

1133,1133,realistic-hope-jy,1580750771,eyagtm,Politics,"Hello Texans.  I am sure that, like many of you, while I hope 2019-nCoV is able to be contained, I would like Texas to be as well-prepared as possible in the event that it is not.

**Here are some things I think will help:**

* **Wash your hands** (helps against flu &amp; reduces load on healthcare too)
* Follow the [CDC's general current guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/what-you-should-do.html):
 * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
 * Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
 * Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
 * Stay home when you are sick.
 * Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
 * Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
 * If you feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, and have traveled to China or were in close contact with someone with 2019-nCoV in the 14 days before you began to feel sick, seek medical care. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.

I am also planning to **contact my representatives**.  I am concerned and personally believe this situation should be taken seriously, so I want my representatives to know.  Here are some ways you can contact your reps:

***Texas***

* [Texas Governor's Office](https://gov.texas.gov/contact) | [First Lady's Office](https://gov.texas.gov/first-lady/fl_contact)

***USA***

* Texas State Senators [John Cornyn](https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/contact), [Ted Cruz](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=form&amp;id=16)
* [Find your House of House of Representative Representative](https://ziplook.house.gov/htbin/findrep_house?ZIP=77024)
* [Contact the President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/write-or-call/), twitter [@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump)

***Others?***

the UN? NGOs? Charities? MSF? Red Cross? PeaceCorps? Maybe big &amp; philanthropic companies would help, perhaps by helping fund equipment for hospital staff or sanitation supplies for the public?  Religious organizations?  Would appreciate suggestions.

**Some precautions that I think should be taken at the city/town/community level:**

* Make sure health care workers are prepared and protected
* Increase health care capacity for treating this disease
* Public health campaign to reduce potential transmission rate.  Everyone can wash their hands more. (will help with other illnesses anyway)  Suggesting #washyourhands

If you have family or ties in other cities/communities, feel free to publish a similar message to those communities too (substituting the appropriate recommendations and contact info, of course).

Notes:

* The skeletal remains of a teenager were found at a dump site off County Road 101 and State Highway 288, under a pile of brush and a tire by a man who stopped to relieve himself.
* She had several untreated cavities, but had two fillings. An upper left tooth appeared to have been surgically removed.
* She may have had a tumor in one of her knees.
* Toxicology reports came back negative as there were no traceable drugs in her system.
* She had two fractured ribs.
* The victim wore the following jewelry:
* A class ring from Robert E. Lee high school with a blue stone that was dated for 1975. Alumni of 1974 were interviewed from Robert E. Lee high school were not able to identify her. It is unknown whether or not there were ever engravings on the inner side of the ring's band. The ring was up sized twice, which would have removed evidence of previous engravings. However, it does have an inlaid, ""L"" which many students chose as an option that year that stands for the school mascot, Robert E. Lee himself. The Lee class of 1975 had about 300 girls. I found the supposed [yearbook ](https://www.classmates.com/yearbooks/Robert-E-Lee-High-School/101562?page=64)but am unable to zoom in the pictures.
* I've posted about this case on Facebook groups for the class 
* A silver ring with a scroll design;
* A silver ring with a turquoise stone in a unicorn or horse shape;
* A gold ring with clear stones
* Two “thin” silver rings;
* A pearl-beaded bracelet.
* The class ring may have belonged to a much older boyfriend or a family member. This lead is being considered in this case.
* At first, she was thought to be Hispanic, but later that was corrected. She was found to be White with traces of African-American heritage, most likely having at least one Black parent or grandparent. Some sources indicate she inherited the African-American heritage from her mother's side. Because of this, the sketches may not be accurate.

I moved here from Austin (which was a pretty good place to find work) a couple of years ago to save money and get out of the Austin traffic gridlock.

1. I looked up lists of the best marketing towns in Texas (and best towns for freelancers), and several of them are in the DFW area.

Maybe you could help me decide what area might make the most sense for me, based on the following:
2. I need something on the low end of the rent spectrum. An efficiency would do.
3. I do my work from home, so daily commute wouldn't be much of an issue. But I will want to network as much as I can in both Ft. Worth and Dallas. So... Irving, maybe?
4. I like the fact that I already know and like Denton pretty well, and that it's centrally positioned at the top of the Golden Triangle. But I have no idea how it compares to greater DFW in terms of rent, crime etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I am refinancing this vehicle to finish the loan on my parents credit, have the car under my name and pay less monthly. However, there are some things I don't understand. Do I have to pay sales tax on the remaining amount on the payoff quote? If so, who do I pay it to? Will the bank handle that? Also, are there any other fees apart the sales tax? Title is held by loaner (my parents don't have it until the loan is payed off) and the car is already registered in the same county I live in.

Will take anything apart to fix it whether she knows how or not, loves the beach, but not to tan - we spend our time learning about the weird stuff that washes up in the tides, also loves hunting for arrowheads and relics.

We’re in Austin, but are willing to travel up to 4-5 hours each way if it’s something fun. Last year we learned how to blow glass at Ghost Pepper studios- that was a blast. I’d like to take her somewhere new that will pique her interest. Something hands on and creative.

&gt;""Talking dirty to minors, just like Miley Cyrus ""twerking"" on MTV or Janet Jackson having a ""wardrobe malfunction"" during prime time, is constitutionally protected free speech, the highest criminal court in Texas ruled Wednesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals struck down a section of a 2005 law that banned adults from sexually explicit online communication with children.  
&gt;  
&gt;That means soliciting a person under the age of 17 for sex remains illegal, but talking dirty with a child is protected by the U.S. Constitution.""

Is this true? does this mean that an adult can talk dirty to a minor, and not get arrested?",texas,Is this true in texas?

The title speaks for itself but I'll give you some background. I recently visited a friend in Austin, and feel that it has a very Southwestern flair to it. The climate, architecture, the culture(cowboys, ranches, the latin influence), the surrounding terrain/vegetation- it all felt very much like what I would consider to be the 'Southwest'. It seems that a lot of people think of Texas as just 'Texas' but humor me here, I studied geography and am weird.  I'm from Virginia, so coming from the East I imagine these aesthetics are amplified but it certainly does not have a traditional 'Southern' vibe going on. If it matters to any of you, Wikipedia says Hill Country can be considered where 'The Southeast meets the Southwest'",texas,Texans: Do you consider Austin/Hill Country as a whole to be the Southwest?

I'm sorry Texas is full I would feel the same way. However, living in CA is rough. I have a BA in political science (dumb choice) and a master's in public administration (aka government work) and I have full time experience. 

Point is, I'm 26 and can't get a job in CA where I can afford life. A room to rent 15 minutes away from downtown LA or San Diego is 700-900 dollars. Job competition is fierce. Regardless of getting a job, it's not possible to live comfortably here. How much money do I need saved to make my move? I'm kinda broke. Also, is it easy to make friends out there? I make friends here but people are notoriously flaky here. I appreciate all of your responses.

But she took pictures of my sisters papers and of the accident. My sister didn't call the police because she was in shock and didn't know what to do.

Long story short we originally planned to move to Texas few years back to be close to family but they moved out a year ago to Missouri.

We decided we needed to get out of Connecticut so planned on moving at the end of the year to NC. For some Reas Texas is back on our radar. Job wise there's a lot of LPN jobs for my Wife. Few years back when we tested the waters of moving Texas was the only place where employers reached out to me and made accomodations to do a phone interview. We feel Texas be a lot easier to obtain a job than in NC.

Any thoughts where to move or not move to Texas????

Not sure if this holds true but we feel Austin and San Antonio are too expensive. We are open to moving any place in Texas where there is hospitals and universities. We have a rent budget of $1500 or less.

If we did move to Texas be coming with child now. So going to have to do some research on decent school districts in the area.

Appreciate any feedback or responses?

I'm a Canadian student who will be graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems next year. When I graduate I will have over 1.5 years worth of experience working as an IT Analyst in Government. 

I am hoping to continue my studies by doing a Masters in Comp Sci or MBA in Texas, but I am not opposed to working full time in an IT position for a few years first in order to fund my education lol (if I can get a job secured). My overall plan is to end up fully immigrating to the States from Canada and live there. 

I have wanted to move to the States permanently, specifically Texas for quite a while, as my parents lived there for years before I turned 4, (so it feels familiar). However it's kinda funny because I was born in Canada since my dad's family is Canadian, and my mom soon became Canadian too. 

I honestly just want to move somewhere warmer and the tech economy is doing much better than where I live (Alberta), so I know there is plenty opportunity. As I understand the cost of living in TX is way lower. But I have no idea how the taxes will work once (if) I begin working &amp; studying in TX?

However, if I put off my Masters, should I focus on getting a work visa? How do I even go about applying for jobs in Texas as a Canadian - is there specific postings for international employees? Which type of Visas would I even go about getting if I get a job offer? And if no job offer, how about documents required for schooling in TX for a Master's degree with the intent of living there permanently after eventual graduation? 

Sorry if this is a very uninformed post, I am 20 years old so I am just beginning to experience how adulthood works, lol.",texas,How does a Canadian student go about moving to study/work in Texas?

I was born in Alpine, TX in 87 - I am looking for photos of Alpine from around that time, into the early 90's. More specifically, hopefully, the house my grandparents lived in, or the area around it. I can't remember her address, and the house has since been knocked down, but it was next to a mountain, they had a small water tank in the yard, it was the last house or second to last house on the right side, the dead-end was a mountain. It was a very large, old house. When they knocked it down, my aunts and uncles placed a double-wide (maybe single?) trailer on the property. I remember a church on the left and a baseball field on the right.",texas,"Looking for Alpine, TX pictures."

I bought a course online that uses the concurrent method and completed the first module, allowing me to take the DPS Permit Test online. However, before I was able to take the test, I had to check off a box verifying that I bought the course at least 3 days before taking the test. I did not; I bought it and finished module 1 the same day. It said there may be an issue with the DPS if I bought the course and took the test the same day since Module 1 is supposed to take 6 hours and you can't work on it more than 2 hours a day. But of course, most people go at a much faster pace, so I was wondering if the DPS would actually refuse to issue me a permit due to this.

I am an Engineer in the Bay Area and looking for an exit strategy. I want to buy a house in Austin/surrounding areas so that I can quickly pay it off with Bay Area pay and then chill out when I’m tired of working for a FAANG company.

The houses seem to be super cheap for 400-500s for a huge 3500 SQFT in pflugerville.

I want to rent it out for the next 4-5 years, does that make sense for this area?

Also, I’ve heard that the land is “soft” and the foundations may have problems in this area.

I've lived here for the better part of the last decade and I love it. I've also lived in other states and visited or driven through many others. So what I don't quite understand is why the natives here believe that Texas is the best state in the U.S. and just the best section of land on Earth overall. As I said, I love Texas, but I just don't see what makes it so special or significantly better than the other states. There are certainly some really pretty parts of Texas, but there is also just a lot of ugly nothingness. The drive between Austin and Dallas is literally the most boring and awful 3-4 hours (I live in Austin and go to school in Dallas so I've done this drive many times) I've ever experienced with tons of unfinished construction and piles of dirt along i35 nearly the whole way. Austin, Dallas and Houston aren't really any better than any of the other big cities in the US; all have huge homeless problems, expensive housing, terrible traffic, etc. Again, not hating on Texas or any of its cities, just pointing out that Texas isn't that different from every other state in the U.S. Also, it is so ridiculously hot here in the summer, which lasts like twice as long as they're supposed to. You would expect to get used to it after living here for several years but you just don't. The heat is still awful every year and doesn't get better. So, what makes Texas so much better than everywhere else? Is it purely just a pride thing, you just say that Texas is the best because you live here? Or is there something I'm missing that genuinely makes Texas better than the rest?",texas,Why do native Texans have SO much pride?

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

2374,2374,PauLWaFFleZ,1583556565,feqbgt,Texas Pride,"So its become apparent to me, that almost anytime people talk about TX, there are 5 cities that always come up: Dallas, Houston, Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio. Now this is somewhat understandable, even though I have issues with 2 of those cities listed, which I will lay out. But honestly though, why is Arlington always ignored? We're basically the heart of the DFW metroplex, which everybody knows has the best economy in the nation right now. I made a comment on a post that Texashumor made on IG that kind of sums up a few of the things we have to offer:

 We have AT&amp;T Stadium, which has hosted the Super  Bowl, NBA All-Star Game and Wrestlemania, Globe Life Park, Texas Live,  the Cowboys, the Rangers, the largest university in North Texas (which  has a very close relationship with the largest defense contractor in the  world, Lockheed Martin), Six Flags Over Texas, Hurricane Harbor, the  largest ESports arena in the USA, Metroflex Gym (home gym of Mr.  Olympia, Ronnie Coleman) a few Whataburgers and 2 Saltgrass Steakhouses.   

Now let me lay out my issues with those 2 cities...

Houston, home of the LASTROS. Everybody knows that the LASTROS have brought great SHAME to our state, and that is something that cannot be ignored. It'll take some time for Houston to be forgiven for this transgression. I have a roommate from Houston, I keep my eye on him pretty close. He goes to school at UTA up here in Arlington, so I let him know that people up here in DFW don't cheat for their money like people in Houston do, so just be careful and adjust to our way of doing things. People from Houston may as well be on the same level as people from California right now for the time being.

Fort Worth... Bro, this place is BORING. Seriously, why does Fort Worth have a big name in TX? There is almost nothing to do there. You guys don't have half of the stuff Arlington has. I work in Fort Worth, anytime I drive there I feel like I'm going back in time, you just get a vibe like that place is just old anytime you're there, and I'm not the only one that feels that way. I've had other people say the same.  


So its been long overdue that Arlington gets its due respect. Please do what you can to get other fellow Texans to follow suit",texas,Why doesn't Arlington get any respect?

2392,2392,J_Keezey,1583608126,fezsdr,License and/or Registration Question,"TL:DR - I got there at 10 AM and left at 4:30 PM. 

Because I renewed online last time, I was notified via mail that I would need to renew in person this time. I began researching my options and found that no matter what address I used (work in Las Colinas or home near Victory Park) the only option near me was the mega center in south Dallas. I decided to take my chances there with a stategy of middle of the day, middle of the week. 

Before going to renew my license, I researched all of the options and required documents online. I found that I could fill out all of the paperwork before arriving, that there was an option to virtually get in line, and that I'd need my driver's license and a birth certificate. I got busy filling everything out, scheduling some time away from the office, and gathering the required paperwork. 

Wednesday morning, before heading to the ""mega center"", I got online and tried repeatedly to check in virtually. Each time I tried, I was denied access and told no spots were available. I decided to leave a little early (just in case) and that I'd keep trying on my phone. I was never able to use this function. 

I arrived at 10AM-ish and the place was PACKED. I checked in and was immediately informed that the forms on the website are outdated and that I'd need to get one of the new, updated forms and fill out all of the paperwork again by hand. I'll let you imagine how I greeted that news. Nonetheless, it was a long wait so I didn't argue. I found a pen and place to sit and began filling out the paperwork all over again. 

After I'd waited two full hours, I began getting very nervous. The one meeting I absolutely could not miss that day was at 12:30. I'd been waiting for two hours and was still 50 spots away from being called. At 12:25 PM I went to my car to take my 12:30 call. The call was over at approximately 1:45 PM and, of course, my number had been called. I would add here that if there had been someway to monitor where they were (an app or website or something) I would've excused myself from the call and run inside. Unfortunately, that's not an option. 

I did briefly attempt to plead my case but they weren't having it. I get it, I'm not special and need to play by the rules. So I started over. Just before 2PM I pulled another number and began the wait again. 

At approximately 4:10 PM my number was called and I left the ""mega center"" at roughly 4:30 PM. I was given a temporary license and told my new DL will be mailed to me in a couple of weeks. 

I will say - anecdotally - that I noticed the closer they got to closing time, the faster that line moved.",texas,I had to renew my Texas driver's license in person this year. This was my experience.

My dad just got a job on Georgetown, so they’re moving and I’ve decided to go with them.

In my current state we get ripped with a ""government service tax""  and a "" basic services tax"". So a theoretical $70 registration now becomes a $500 registration.  Heck the trailer I want to buy would cost over $1000 to register because the MSRP is $70,0000 and they base the tax off MSRP.  And no I am not talking sales tax, this is an every year fee.

Looking online all I can find on the Texas DMV website is a schedule fee PDF that lists local fees per county at $10-20.  And then the  $50 or so for actual registration. Is there some sort of additional tax on top of the $70ish that I am just not finding listed?

They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results.This poll  will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

This is not someone else's problem. Its EVERYONE'S problem. It's YOUR PROBLEM. I AM BEGGING EVERYONE TO DO THEIR PART. YOU ARE HIGHLY INFECTIOUS BEFORE SYMPTOMS. I see multiple examples all day every day of people out in groups, pretending like this is extra spring break... when we ask and PLEAD that everyone isolate, we mean it. We are already filling up with patients. Our ERs, ICUs and hospitals CANNOT handle it. Soon, it will be your family that we don't have a ventilator for, or an ICU bed for regardless of WHY they need it. Don't make us make that call, it will haunt us forever... ESPECIALLY because theres something we can ALL do to reduce the blow to our system.

Be nice to all healthcare workers, please. We are flying mostly blind, working mostly without proper precautions and exposing ourselves repeatedly on the frontline. We feel terrible if you were told the wrong thing about getting tested, etc. but please don't take it out on us. We are doing our best and morale is very low as it is. You yelling at us isn't going to help anything.

And for f*** sake, DO NOT GO TO THE ER FOR ANYTHING UNLESS you are really sick and need us but CALL FIRST. We'll be there with or without protective gear to protect ourselves because that's who we are.

However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent social distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [190,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf))

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement social distancing measures.**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

* **Update:** March 17th: [Short video of the situation in a hospital in Bergamo, Italy](https://twitter.com/Laethageal/status/1239699270577553409). Do not underestimate this virus.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. **Update:** [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca). Update: [Speed trumps perfection](https://twitter.com/ConallMcD/status/1238865202868883461).

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement social distancing measures.**

* Practice [social distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing social distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) of source)

* People with weakened respiratory system due to smoking/vaping ([source 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)), ([source 2](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/Abstract/publishahead/Analysis_of_factors_associated_with_disease.99363.aspx))

* Lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function or that require home oxygen (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf), last page)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""**

UPDATE: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds)).

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

** March 16 Update: “This is a serious disease. Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died"" —Dr. Tedros, Director of the WHO** ([source](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1239582322044874752))

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w)

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in [Sydney](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), Australia, or the one over in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), both of which will be kept up to date (as will any of my PSA's that I posted myself, as long as they're still on the main page of that sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

P.S. Feel free to share this post without attribution to me. This was never about credit.

It is very likely that next week we are going to see a big increase in the number of reported cases of coronavirus in Texas. Although the increase in cases will be driven by the spread of virus, it will also likely be driven by the increase in tests performed, and the time between taking a test and receiving the results.

Texas is testing significantly more now than it did before. On March 16, the first day of public testing data, we learned that the state had tested a total 1,268 people.  As you can see in the chart below, over the past three days, we have tested 2,100 on average every day; a huge improvement.

If you combine the increase in testing with the common 3 - 7 day lag to receive test results, it's likely that we will see a big increase in reported cases shortly driven by the additional tests.

But, this is not all bad. The more tests we perform, the more we know who is infected, and the faster we can control the spread of the virus.

If you want more details on testing data in Texas, below is a link to a more detailed write-up that not only digs deeper into the information, but also compares it to other states.

[What 6 days of coronavirus testing data in Texas are telling us](http://guytweetstoomuch.blogspot.com/2020/03/what-6-days-of-coronavirus-testing-data.html)

Don't forget to practice social distancing, wash your hands, and stay home so we can help reduce the impact of the virus in Texas.

Stay safe.

I haven't been able to work during this time because I work in ""luxury"" construction constantly in people's homes and around others. I'm beyond at a loss for words at what this idiot is thinking. in New York people are dying 1 per minute.

I have received many calls, texts, and tweets of concern tonight. Those that contacted me are worried about their companies and workers. Maybe 15 to 20 percent reluctantly want Collin County to Shelter in place.

I have seen this request in many places online as well tagged onto the daily briefing asking to ""shut the county down"" and ""shelter in place."" Ultimately it is up to the County Judge but I will express my inclination on our follow-up approval that would have to come.

I think that a shelter in place order is too extreme. Not a single medical professional at any county-based medical facility nor has CDC or FEMA given me any data to support an order that destroys lives in advance.

Let's be clear about what is at stake. A shelter-in-place order will destroy lives. Those least capable of weathering the storm of a shutdown are those that will suffer when they lose their paycheck. Many will lose homes, apartments, etc. (not at the moment but in the near future).

It then comes down to personal responsibility. A person is responsible for themselves and their family. They aren't a threat to you if you are essentially already sheltering in place or working from home. They are only at risk to others that MUST continue living their lives in order to put a roof over their family's head or to put food on the table.

I am sure that they are weighing the risks and mitigating them as much as possible. Those that aren't are the same people that drive without seatbelts, no helmets on motorcycles, and like to go 90 mph on the highway. And even if we ordered them to stay in place, there isn't going to be county police roaming to chase them back to their house... because they are not responsible.

I am not for this at this time. I expect people to show what you can do and be responsible citizens for your family first and by extension, all the rest of the people that you will be meeting until this Coronavirus threat is put down.",texas,Dallas County has issued a stay at home order.

I Was at the local Walmart this AM. We have 2 Brookshires and a Walmart in the area. 
I was surprised to see the toilet paper stripped from the store 2 weeks ago. I was running
a bit low, but I had enough to last 2-3 weeks, and friends to lend, as well. The clerk told 
me a handful of people came and loaded up their carts 8' high and stripped the store. I can forgive Walmart for allowing this to happen, as it was a bit sudden, and was the same in Brookshires, as well. 


Since then, I've been checking all three stores, and there's been none. I went to
the local Walmart this AM, and there was a half-pallet of it up on the shelves.  I grabbed the one package i needed and watched as people filled up their carts behind me. i asked the clerk at self-checkout why Walmart wasn't rationing, and she replied Walmart was 'asking people not to do it' but not 'telling them they can't'. As she was saying this, there were three hoarders in self-checkout that weren't being asked.

They're out of N95s and are having to reuse them which is very dangerous for them. We're making mask covers to protect the masks for as long as possible. We've had multiple orders from major hospitals and clinics in the central Texas area.

We're trying to streamline the process and one idea was to have cutting dies made. We need people in the area with Cricuts, Accucut, or Sizzix to cut them out. I was about to buy a Cricut for my stickers but since my business is now gone I can't afford to.

Is anyone in the area with these tools willing to help out? I know many of us in the art community have access to these machines and it would speed things up like crazy! No need to use your own material if you can't spare any. We have loads of volunteers (2,000 at last count) and have lots of fabric and people ready to do pick-ups and drop-offs. 

This is the website that was created for the group for more information: http://covidrangers.com/",texas,"Healthcare first responders need our help in central Texas: in need of Cricut, Sizzix, and Accucut machines."

Mayor Update on Coronavirus:
Throughout this ordeal, I have been in close communication with the other Collin County cities and our County Judge, Chris Hill. It has been tremendous to witness the collaboration, concern, compassion and thoughtfulness of all the leaders in our region. We have, and will continue, to work together, challenging ideas and practices, constructively deliberating the best path forward to protect our communities.

Currently, there is consensus on adopting a form of shelter in place among the cities. This consideration was not arrived at easily, as we understand the further, negative financial impact that businesses and the workforce will suffer. However, it is believed that, in the absence of thorough local testing results, we must rely on more comprehensive data that exists in other parts of the world. That data demonstrates the need to take aggressive action sooner, rather than later, especially in our urban areas.

If possible, it is our intent to adopt uniform policies and practices in order to have regionally consistent and, consequently, improved containment results. We will continue working through the day on a final form ordinance for each City to consider adopting. We will hold a joint press conference tomorrow morning, outlining the provisions we will be implementing.",texas,McKinney Mayor and other local Mayor's to announce altered version of Shelter in Place tomorrow morning at 10am.

I’m 26M and a software architect/software startup owner. So opportunity in the field is important (jobs or for my business) as well as other potential business ventures in different fields.

I’m very much into writing and performing music.

I don’t really drink at all (not recovering or anything, just not into drinking) and I never smoke, so clubs and things aren’t really for me, although I’m very much a night owl.

I love to explore/travel/drive around.

I don’t really vibe with stuck up people, or on the other end of things, people who actively try to be weird/unique or too laid back. I very much prefer people who have it together and just kinda do their thing.

I’m looking to, for the most part, settle down and start a family in the not super distant future.

For some reason traffic doesn’t annoy me a ton, but I wouldn’t want it at my doorstep.

&gt;Officers have the authority to stop people to make sure they are essential workers and not people just out and about. Dallas County was the first to issue a “shelter in place” order that began at midnight Tuesday.  
“We did hear some complaints today of people being stopped going to work. Let me be clear, that is perfectly legal from our officers perspective,” said Pete Schulte, Desoto Police Department.

Given that there are all kinds of exceptions - running errands to essential businesses, picking up food to go and outdoor exercise (maintaining social distancing) - what the reasonable suspicion for a stop JUST on this pretext?

There are people who still think that this is just a bad flu. It's not. Reading the below should scare the shit out of you. Wash your hands, don't touch your face, and stay away from everyone you can. 

Found the original post - the doctor is an Aggie: [https://texags.com/forums/84/topics/3102444](https://texags.com/forums/84/topics/3102444)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I am an ER MD in New Orleans. Class of 98. Every one of my colleagues have now seen several hundred Covid 19 patients and this is what I think I know.

Clinical course is predictable.

2-11 days after exposure (day 5 on average) flu like symptoms start. Common are fever, headache, dry cough, myalgias(back pain), nausea without vomiting, abdominal discomfort with some diarrhea, loss of smell, anorexia, fatigue.

Day 5 of symptoms- increased SOB, and bilateral viral pneumonia from direct viral damage to lung parenchyma.

Day 10- Cytokine storm leading to acute ARDS and multiorgan failure. You can literally watch it happen in a matter of hours.

81% mild symptoms, 14% severe symptoms requiring hospitalization, 5% critical.

Patient presentation is varied. Patients are coming in hypoxic (even 75%) without dyspnea. I have seen Covid patients present with encephalopathy, renal failure from dehydration, DKA. I have seen the bilateral interstitial pneumonia on the xray of the asymptomatic shoulder dislocation or on the CT's of the (respiratory) asymptomatic polytrauma patient. Essentially if they are in my ER, they have it. Seen three positive flu swabs in 2 weeks and all three had Covid 19 as well. Somehow this \*\*\*\*\* has told all other disease processes to get out of town.

China reported 15% cardiac involvement. I have seen covid 19 patients present with myocarditis, pericarditis, new onset CHF and new onset atrial fibrillation. I still order a troponin, but no cardiologist will treat no matter what the number in a suspected Covid 19 patient. Even our non covid 19 STEMIs at all of our facilities are getting TPA in the ED and rescue PCI at 60 minutes only if TPA fails.

**Diagnostic**

CXR- bilateral interstitial pneumonia (anecdotally starts most often in the RLL so bilateral on CXR is not required). The hypoxia does not correlate with the CXR findings. Their lungs do not sound bad. Keep your stethoscope in your pocket and evaluate with your eyes and pulse ox.

Labs- WBC low, Lymphocytes low, platelets lower then their normal, Procalcitonin normal in 95%

CRP and Ferritin elevated most often. CPK, D-Dimer, LDH, Alk Phos/AST/ALT commonly elevated.

Notice D-Dimer- I would be very careful about CT PE these patients for their hypoxia. The patients receiving IV contrast are going into renal failure and on the vent sooner.

Basically, if you have a bilateral pneumonia with normal to low WBC, lymphopenia, normal procalcitonin, elevated CRP and ferritin- you have covid-19 and do not need a nasal swab to tell you that.

A ratio of absolute neutrophil count to absolute lymphocyte count greater than 3.5 may be the highest predictor of poor outcome. the UK is automatically intubating these patients for expected outcomes regardless of their clinical presentation.

An elevated Interleukin-6 (IL6) is an indicator of their cytokine storm. If this is elevated watch these patients closely with both eyes.

Other factors that appear to be predictive of poor outcomes are thrombocytopenia and LFTs 5x upper limit of normal.

**Disposition**

I had never discharged multifocal pneumonia before. Now I personally do it 12-15 times a shift. 2 weeks ago we were admitting anyone who needed supplemental oxygen. Now we are discharging with oxygen if the patient is comfortable and oxygenating above 92% on nasal cannula. We have contracted with a company that sends a paramedic to their home twice daily to check on them and record a pulse ox. We know many of these patients will bounce back but if it saves a bed for a day we have accomplished something. Obviously we are fearful some won't make it back.

We are a small community hospital. Our 22 bed ICU and now a 4 bed Endoscopy suite are all Covid 19. All of these patients are intubated except one. 75% of our floor beds have been cohorted into covid 19 wards and are full. We are averaging 4 rescue intubations a day on the floor. We now have 9 vented patients in our ER transferred down from the floor after intubation.

Luckily we are part of a larger hospital group. Our main teaching hospital repurposed space to open 50 new Covid 19 ICU beds this past Sunday so these numbers are with significant decompression. Today those 50 beds are full. They are opening 30 more by Friday. But even with the ""lockdown"", our AI models are expecting a 200-400% increase in covid 19 patients by 4/4/2020.

**Treatment**

Supportive

Worldwide 86% of covid 19 patients that go on a vent die. Seattle reporting 70%. Our hospital has had 5 deaths and one patient who was extubated. Extubation happens on day 10 per the Chinese and day 11 per Seattle.

Plaquenil which has weak ACE2 blockade doesn't appear to be a savior of any kind in our patient population. Theoretically, it may have some prophylactic properties but so far it is difficult to see the benefit to our hospitalized patients, but we are using it and the studies will tell. With Plaquenil's potential QT prolongation and liver toxic effects (both particularly problematic in covid 19 patients), I am not longer selectively prescribing this medication as I stated on a previous post.

We are also using Azithromycin, but are intermittently running out of IV.

Do not give these patient's standard sepsis fluid resuscitation. Be very judicious with the fluids as it hastens their respiratory decompensation. Outside the DKA and renal failure dehydration, leave them dry.

Proning vented patients significantly helps oxygenation. Even self proning the ones on nasal cannula helps.

Vent settings- Usual ARDS stuff, low volume, permissive hypercapnia, etc. Except for Peep of 5 will not do. Start at 14 and you may go up to 25 if needed.

Do not use Bipap- it does not work well and is a significant exposure risk with high levels of aerosolized virus to you and your staff. Even after a cough or sneeze this virus can aerosolize up to 3 hours.

The same goes for nebulizer treatments. Use MDI. you can give 8-10 puffs at one time of an albuterol MDI. Use only if wheezing which isn't often with covid 19. If you have to give a nebulizer must be in a negative pressure room; and if you can, instruct the patient on how to start it after you leave the room.

Do not use steroids, it makes this worse. Push out to your urgent cares to stop their usual practice of steroid shots for their URI/bronchitis.

We are currently out of Versed, Fentanyl, and intermittently Propofol. Get the dosing of Precedex and Nimbex back in your heads.

One of my colleagues who is a 31 yo old female who graduated residency last may with no health problems and normal BMI is out with the symptoms and an SaO2 of 92%. She will be the first of many.

I PPE best I have. I do wear a MaxAir PAPR the entire shift. I do not take it off to eat or drink during the shift. I undress in the garage and go straight to the shower. My wife and kids fled to her parents outside Hattiesburg. The stress and exposure at work coupled with the isolation at home is trying. But everyone is going through something right now. Everyone is scared; patients and employees. But we are the leaders of that emergency room. Be nice to your nurses and staff. Show by example how to tackle this crisis head on.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

Surgical masks are used for several different purposes, including the following:

* Placed on sick people to limit the spread of infectious respiratory secretions to others.
* Worn by healthcare providers to prevent accidental contamination of patients' wounds by the organisms normally present in mucus and saliva.
* Worn by workers to protect themselves from splashes or sprays of blood or bodily fluids; they may also keep contaminated fingers/hands away from the mouth and nose.

Surgical masks are not designed or certified to prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants. These particles are not visible to the naked eye but may still be capable of causing infection. Surgical masks are not designed to seal tightly against the user's face. During inhalation, much of the potentially contaminated air can pass through gaps between the face and the surgical mask and not be pulled through the filter material of the mask. Their ability to filter small particles varies significantly based upon the type of material used to make the surgical mask, so they cannot be relied upon to protect workers against airborne infectious agents. Only surgical masks that are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be legally marketed in the United States have been tested for their ability to resist blood and body fluids.

If you want to buy something - BUY Respirators, they must be NIOSH-certified, selected, and used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program, (see OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.134, or[ www.osha.gov/SLTC/respiratoryprotection/index.html](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/respiratoryprotection/index.html)). It is important to medically evaluate workers to ensure that they can perform work tasks while wearing a respirator. For many workers, medical evaluation may be accomplished by having a physician or other licensed healthcare provider review a respiratory questionnaire completed by the worker (found in Appendix C of OSHA's Respiratory Protection standard, 29 CFR 1910.134) to determine if the worker can be medically cleared to use a respirator. Employers who have never before needed to consider a respiratory protection plan should note that it can take time to choose an appropriate respirator to provide to workers; arrange for a qualified trainer; and provide training, fit testing and medical evaluation for their workers. If employers wait until an influenza pandemic occurs, they may be unable to implement an adequate respiratory protection program in a timely manner.  
I bought myself [here](http://ffp3mask.store/reddit), you can find elsewhere.

Buy and wear respirators, not masks!",texas,Seriously people- STOP BUYING SURGICAL MASKS!

Background: We're a late twenties, mixed-race couple (I'm Asian American and she's white).  She works in finance and I work in tech consulting.  She may need to leave her job but I fortunately can keep mine as long as I'm near an airport.  We definitely lean liberal, but as a former military guy I've got no issues with people owning firearms or anything of that sort.  

She's stayed in Austin before and really enjoys it, I've only been there for a day.  I've only ever been to Plano for work trips so don't know how Dallas proper compares to Austin (We were supposed to be there this weekend looking at apartments but COVID-19 derailed that trip).  

From my understanding and research on Reddit and City-Data, it seems that Dallas is a bit more affordable than Austin rent-wise and has better economic opportunities with respect to F500 company's HQs being located there as well as JP Morgan-Chase moving their HQ to the area (plus for the girlfriend). From my research tech is exploding in Austin with most of the top companies having HQs there

Austin from what I've seen so far is sort of like Brooklyn due to the arts and music scene and the more hippy vibe.  Dallas seems to sort of be like Manhattan when it comes to being more cosmopolitan

I'm interested in using my GI Bill within the next couple of years to obtain a professional degree, something along the lines of an MBA, MD, JD, etc.  My understanding is that UT Austin is a great opportunity 

We're looking at settling into Texas and staying there for a long time, buying property is definitely something I'm interested in when I go into my thirties and we have kids.  

Traffic seems to be pretty intense, and compared to NYC the public transport is lackluster from my research.  That's not a bad thing though, as we're ready to own cars and not be packed into the subway like sardines

Appreciate any advice here",texas,Late Twenties Couple Moving from NYC to Texas this summer . Dallas or Austin?

3987,3987,BCF2000,1585950366,fuh7wh,Politics,"Folks,

I’ve run out of ideas on where and who to ask an oddly specific question about Texas Unemployment. I have been unable to reach ANY state official or TWC representative. 

I have been employed since I was 14 and have never been without a job in my life. Almost 24 years now, but alas, Covid-19 has me applying for benefits. I am now finding myself, along with a number of colleagues and employees of mine, in the unemployment line for reduced salary/hours. Within the first two weeks we fell to 80% and laid off others. Now, with a subsequent reduction to 50%, I have found myself in the clusterf@#k that is the same as thousands and thousands of others. 

I am trying to find out for myself, but also my coworkers and former employees on what to expect. 

It’s not a question about applying or requesting payment. I am familiar with all of that. 

Let’s say that Joe Employee earns $100,000 per year. 

Based on TWC calculations on their site they take the last four quarters ($25,000 each) and use the highest quarter divided by 25 to determine your weekly benefit eligible. In this scenario it is $1000 per week. 

So, Joe Employee has a weekly benefit from TWC of $1000.  Texas has a state maximum or cap to that benefit of $521.

So, here is my question. Based on TWC website this individual will need to make LESS than 125% of the weekly benefit amount in order to receive any compensation from the state of Texas for unemployment benefits. Is the weekly benefit amount the ACTUAL weekly benefit calculated by his salary and the formula above ($1000 per week) granting them to receive SOME compensation for the reduced working hours and pay OR does this individual NOT qualify because their pay is more than 125% of the maximum state payable allowed of $521?

Hopefully that makes sense. Essentially I need to know if the TWC calculates payment requests on the ACTUAL weekly benefit and the state cap is just a payment cap or if the state cap is also an eligibility cap. 

These are truly frustrating times...made worse by the fact that I can’t get anyone at TWC on the phone or to respond to an email or to simply put the info on their site.  

If this shouldn’t be here, then please delete and let me know but I have hit a wall for available resources so I thought it was worth a shot.",texas,Texas Unemployment Question

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/opinion/coronavirus-viral-dose.html

There’s discussions going on within the scientific community regarding the impact of the initial viral load on how well people’s immune systems respond to the virus. Basically, your body can fight off a couple hundred viral particles duplicating exponentially better than a couple hundred thousand or million. This could help explain why there’s so many asymptomatic people, as they could’ve had a low initial exposure amount allowing their body to produce antibodies. It could also explain why NYC is getting wrecked by it because of their density and mass use of public transit. Imagine sitting next to someone for 20min breathing in viral particles. It also explains why healthcare workers are getting hit so hard. On the other end of the spectrum, it could explain why Asian countries that already wear masks in public have a lower mortality rate, because even if they’re catching it they’re getting a lower initial dosage.

Net is that social distancing is key, and even a scarf or other cloth covering is better than nothing, as it could limit your initial exposure dosage. It also means that as we ramp down social distancing, we should still prevent large social gatherings such as sporting events, concerts, until a better treatment is created (vaccine, etc.)

For Texas specifically, while we’re not NYC, you could still be standing near someone who’s asymptomatic &amp; breathing in their viral particles. Either in line for groceries or while at work (if you’re an essential worker). While rudimentary facial coverings aren’t medical grade N95 masks, they could still reduce your initial viral load and result in a better outcome for you. This is similar to how inoculation science has worked for many years (exposing people to a small amount of viral particles), which evolved into Vaccines (exposing people to a somewhat benign amount of viral particles, resulting in less risk).

Again, for Texas, even though chances for high viral load are lessened for most of us, it can still happen and should be protected against via social distancing, wearing masks in public, &amp; practicing good overall hygiene.",texas,Texas is less dense &amp; uses less public transit than the current hot spots but here’s why wearing masks still matters

I’ve been trying everyday to file for unemployment through the TWC unemployment portal and am having a lot of trouble. When I put in my “last employer” and all of their information, I get an error saying that they cannot accept this employer as my last employer and to put the employer i had previously. Does anyone know why this could be? I’ve tried to continue by putting the employer i had previously, putting the start and end dates i had for that job and i get a warning saying I need to make sure to put the LAST day that i’ve worked. And then it goes to ask why I am unemployed. This is all really confusing because obviously that job didnt lay me off from corona, its my most recent job that did that but the portal is not letting me go through with putting them as my last employer. I wouldn’t want to have my claim denied because they call the previous employer I have and are told that they didn’t lay me off. I’ve been trying to call the TWC helpline literally everyday, but can’t get through to anyone!! The line is just so swamped my call doesn’t even go through. I am so stressed bc time is ticking and it’s been over a week now since I’ve lost my job and have been trying to file. I have bills to pay and need those unemployment benefits, but I literally can’t file. Does anyone have any advice for me? Or why this may be happening?

I stopped driving for Uber and Lyft on March 13th.

I applied on March 22nd Online. This is what has happened since then.

I attempted calling April 1st, because I was uncertain about my claim. You can see from the [IMAGE](https://imgur.com/7aLmJ75), I tried calling a total of 480 times to (1-800-939-6631) without being able to get through to talk to anyone about this.

Today April 4th… As you can see I tried again with a number (1-800-215-4812) that my girlfriend saw on Reddit. It only took me 2 tries to get through and this is what I was told while on the phone.

* The funds from the Care Act have not arrived to Texas yet. This is why it shows $0 for my benefits. It shows this because we are Independent Contractors that have not paid into Unemployment. That will change as soon as the money arrives and they are able to allocate it.
* We need to keep submitting the “Payment Request” The link is highlighted in the image so when the funds finally come in, they can get us paid.
* I was also told to sign up for updates at this address [https://www.twc.texas.gov/news/covid-19-resources-job-seekers#signUpForUpdates](https://www.twc.texas.gov/news/covid-19-resources-job-seekers#signUpForUpdates)
* The lady said that submitting a “Payment Request” is for the 2 prior weeks and we will need to submit our wages then. (I didn’t see anywhere to submit wages when I initially applied)
* I was given this number (1-800-558-8321) to do automated “Payment Requests” if I couldn’t get online to do it.
* Be patient!

Now I wait until tomorrow April 5th to submit for Payment. I will try to update after I do that and post what I learn. Not sure if I can answer any other questions right now, but will try if you have any.",texas,My experience with Texas Unemployment as a full time Uber/Lyft Driver

Got laid off for the first time on Friday and immediately filed for unemployment. I just checked the ""Claim and Payment Status"" page and I see that my weekly benefit amount is $521.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.

You might find an outlet selling pizza or sandwich,
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

* 3/16 Began new job
* 4/1 Notified of furlough (unfortunately not an April fools joke)
* 4/3 Last day of work before furlough. Worked for a total of 3 weeks. Applied for UI on this day.

TWC’s website has not been helpful at all. I have received all actual updates from the automated system via 1 800 558 8321.

&amp;#x200B;

TWC Experience via automated phone system:

This system was able to quickly confirm:

* Claim status: pending employer
* Benefits Amount (per week)
* Total benefits amount/balance
* Effective Date
* Date to submit payment request (tomorrow 4/14)

&amp;#x200B;

TWC Experience via their website has looked like:

* Requested electronic correspondence but my inbox has aways said (0). Finally clicked in on 4/11 and lo and behold I had five new messages. Also read that TWC will send an e-mail notification to let me know when correspondence messages have been sent. Have received nothing so far.
* Claim and payment status shows NOTHING. Not even that I have submitted a claim, and that it is pending. 
* I cannot request payments online because my claim is non existent on the online portal.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts:

* My most recent employer said that they have not seen anything come through for me in the mail. I’m assuming this is because TWC probably reached out to my former FORMER employer (had more tenure there vs the three weeks at my latest employer).
* Website is just not being updated as much as it should be. Why else would my pending claim still not show?

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

* Is there anything I can do to help move the process along? Reach out to my old employer maybe?
* Should I be concerned about my online account not matching what I hear on the phone? ***Anyone else in this boat?***
* ***If I am in pending status but my payment request date is tomorrow, should I still request payment over the phone (because the online portal does not let me/does not recognize my pending claim)?***
* Can someone please give me an idea of what I need when I submit a payment request? I have not received any correspondence with detailed info and do not want to fck it up.

I was supposed to start a seasonal job in tourism April 15th; I have been told my start date has been delayed indefinitely. Has anyone been in this situation and filed for UI? This seasonal work was to be my main income for the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know how to fill out my application on line with this info. Especially because, until two days ago, I had been on the books as an hourly employee at another place locally, working from home, but I had not worked any hours since January... They just officially ended my employment, so I'd be eligible for UI based on that -- but those hours were NOT ended due to covid-19 (they just had no more work for me) .

We hope that we can help cut down on the large amount of posts asking questions about TWC Unemployment Benefits scattered throughout the subreddit and consolidate all the information and questions into one thread to make things less stressful for y'all.

We will try to keep this as up to date as possible. Please let us know if there is anything out of date or incorrect and we will address it.

**To keep this megathread from going off-topic, only posts and comments that are strictly about unemployment benefits will be allowed. Comments of any political nature will be removed to avoid this megathread from turning into a debate thread.**

In addition, please do not post or send any personal information to this thread or to any users.

We are receiving an unprecedented number of calls and messages related to the Covid-19 pandemic. We will attempt to respond as quickly as possible, but our reply may be delayed due to email volume. Many questions can be answered by looking at the resources at [https://twc.texas.gov/news/covid-19-resources-job-seekers](https://twc.texas.gov/news/covid-19-resources-job-seekers).

We are unable to take claims for unemployment benefits at this email address. To file a claim for unemployment benefits or reset a PIN or password, please email ui.ombudsmen@twc.state.tx.us. When sending the email, please include (1) your name; (2) the last four digits of your Social Security Number; (3) a good phone number where you can be reached; and (4) a brief description of your problem.

Newly signed federal legislation, the CARES Act, that enacts Pandemic Unemployment Compensation, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance has not yet been put into effect. TWC is coordinating with the federal government and working diligently to begin paying benefits under these new programs. When TWC obtains the funding and has systems in place, we will begin to take claims for those programs.

If you are unemployed due to the pandemic, we recommend that you file a claim for regular UI benefits, even if you are a self-employed individual or otherwise would not qualify for regular UI benefits. The new legislation temporarily expands the UI program to apply to self-employed individuals and other people who do not qualify for regular UI and whose unemployment resulted from the pandemic. If you establish your claim now, you will be notified when the new programs are available that may apply to you. You can file a claim for UI here: [https://twc.texas.gov/news/covid-19-resources-job-seekers#unemploymentBenefitClaimSelfservice](https://twc.texas.gov/news/covid-19-resources-job-seekers#unemploymentBenefitClaimSelfservice)

If you already have a regular UI claim and exhausted all the benefits under that claim, we recommend that you continue to file payment requests every two weeks even after your last payment was made. Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation provides for an additional 13 weeks of benefits to individuals who have exhausted their right to regular UI benefits. Once this program goes into effect, you can be paid for those weeks for which you filed.

You can receive updates regarding the availability of these programs if you sign up for updates here: [https://twc.texas.gov/news/covid-19-resources-job-seekers#signUpForUpdates](https://twc.texas.gov/news/covid-19-resources-job-seekers#signUpForUpdates)

TWC has temporarily waived work search requirements and the waiting week (the first claim week) due to the pandemic. Benefits are paid in the week after you file your first payment requests. You therefore can expect your first payment approximately three weeks after you establish your claim.

At this time, TWC programs for Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA), Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC), or Extended Benefits are not available. These programs will in all likelihood not go into effect and instead will be replaced by the newly enacted legislation described above.

For information on employee rights to paid leave under the newly enacted federal legislation, Families First Coronavirus Response Act, please contact the US Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, at 1-866-487-9243 or see information on their website: [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic)

TWC has no authority to enforce any local “shelter-in-place” or “stay-at-home” orders. If you feel that your employer is requiring you to work in violation of such local orders, you should contact your local code or law enforcement agency.

If you have a question related to an appeal pending before the Appeal Tribunal or the Commission, please see the information here: [https://twc.texas.gov/jobseekers/how-appeal-decision](https://twc.texas.gov/jobseekers/how-appeal-decision) ***Important***: if you have an appeal deadline, mail your appeal information immediately to ""Appeals Department, Texas Workforce Commission, 101 E. 15th Street, Austin, Texas, 78778"", file the appeal online at [https://twc.texas.gov/jobseekers/how-appeal-decision](https://twc.texas.gov/jobseekers/how-appeal-decision), or fax a copy to 512-475-1135.

His gym contacted him yesterday saying they're about to start receiving their regular pay but only working a few hours a week.

We know that when he requests Sunday, he will get his state benefits and the federal stimulus benefits for the past two weeks. He begins working again on Monday but for fewer hours than he typically gets. Even though he will be getting his regular pay, would he be considered underemployed since it's significantly less hours? I know he's going to lose his state benefits which is no big deal.

My husband and I and our 3 teenagers currently live in Southern California. I have desperately wanted to leave this state for as long as I can remember. But my Mom and Dad were both sick so there was no way I was leaving them. 
They’ve since passed away. And we just sold our house, so it’s time to go. I had visited Texas (Austin) when I was a kid and fell in love. Naturally it was the first place I thought of when we considered moving. But the problem we’re having is we plan on buying our new home sight unseen. 
We’re looking at these areas- New Braunfels, Port Lavaca, Port Arthur, Galveston and Brownsville. Do you guys think any of those cities are better than the others for a family with three older teenagers (18, 17 and 16) ?  Or are any of those cities best left off the list ? I’d really like to stay by the water, beach lake or river, but I’m not crazy about hurricanes. So maybe that’s a bad idea? Are there any other cities I might want to consider? Whatever advice you guys can offer will be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you",texas,Where do we go from here?
