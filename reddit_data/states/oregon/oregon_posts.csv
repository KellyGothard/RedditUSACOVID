When the map opens the **Oregon state house districts** are displayed with semi-transparent coloring (red=R, blue=D).  The data for the map is hosted on a GIS server operated by the state.

To change the map so it shows the **Oregon state senate districts**:

1. Click the basemap button (Next to the ""Menu"" button)

2. Look under the ""Overlay"" heading (mobile users scroll down)

3. Click the house layers to turn them off

4. Click the senate ""fill"" layer and then the senate ""boundary"" layer.

It may take a few seconds for the data to appear.  It depends on how busy the GIS server is and the speed of your internet connection.  

The map is displayed by GISsurfer which is a general purpose web map I developed as a public service and part of my way to ""pay it forward"".  There is a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with some general ‚ÄòHelp' information.

He was born with club feet, deformed legs and hands, had to use leg braces and crutches. He was treated by Shriners Hospital for many years and only grew to be 4'11"" tall.. Doug graduated from Portland State University in 1973 with a bachelors in political science. He was smart, funny and could be bitterly cruel. Doug never worked, had an apartment or home, computer, e-mail or cell phone to my knowledge. He always lived with my father until he did not come home in the spring of 1996. DMV records showed his last Oregon address was in Tigard, a suburb of Portland. Various pvt investigators showed records of him being in LA County Calif in cities such as Los Angeles, Inglewood, Santa Ana and Maywood. This activity comes from the early 2000s and it is my belief that his identity was stolen at this time, because I simply think he would be unable to manage life on the edge in LA county. I have the assistance of Senator Wyden's office to work with Social Security to locate him, however, there is no guarantee that SS will help us as a 3rd party. I will file a fraud case if necessary, however I hope not to do that. A missing persons case # 19-00180067 was filed in the city of Tigard, OR in October of 2019. There is a johndoe listing in Sacramento County #00-04624 (ncic U970002240) from October of 2000, but it is taking forever to submit a dna test via Tigard Police.

Federal officials designated money for hemp research at Oregon State University‚Äôs Global Hemp Innovation Center as part of the nearly $20 million earmarked for the hemp industry in the massive [appropriations bill](https://cbdnewsdirect.com/federal-appropriations-bill-includes-nearly-20-million-in-hemp-industry-provisions/) that passed both houses of the U.S. Congress at the end of 2019.

U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkeley, a Democrat from Oregon, said Monday that the Corvallis school¬†[would receive $2.5 million](https://cbdnewsdirect.com/oregon-state-university-gets-2-5-million-in-federal-funding-for-hemp-research/) to use for the new hemp research program.

Development of the Global Hemp Innovation Center and its intentions to further hemp research was announced at an event at the North Willamette Research and Extension Center in Aurora, Oregon, last summer by university officials, including Alan Sams, dean of the College of Agricultural Sciences at Oregon State.

The funding announcement ‚Äúshows the federal government‚Äôs confidence in our work,‚Äù Sams told the Corvallis Gazette-Times.

The money will help establish the center, which will emphasize collaboration with other universities.

In September, Oregon State alumni Seth and Eric Crawford, founders of hemp seed research and development company Oregon CBD, donated $1 million to the center to further research on hemp genetics.

5. What kind of housing is available? If I can‚Äôt find a place in Newport, which surrounding areas have good housing opportunities that don‚Äôt require an hour long commute? (Been there done that. I‚Äôm over it) Also needs to be pet friendly because I have a cat.

Apparently it was about a measure that would:

1. Make it so the State Senate no longer confirms members of the Board. So making it pure appointment.
2. Increase the size to 13 members.
3. Remove all conflict of interest restrictions.
4. **Make it illegal for the governor to appoint anyone to the board unless they come from a list prepared by the timber companies.**

It was one of the most blatant and bold attempts to subvert democratic control I've ever heard. If such a law passed, it wouldn't matter who we elected, they wouldn't have the power to change how our forests are managed. It wouldn't be possible without a follow up measure to change forest policy in the state any more unless the timber companies allowed it.

Has anyone else heard about this measure? Is it actually on the ballot this fall?",oregon,I got a fascinating call about the Forestry Board last night.

I do have a few questions, what kind of worrisome animals live in Oregon?

I ask because we like to hike and adventure the woods with our two dogs. Where we live now the most we have to worry about is Bucks during rut season and copper heads (venomous snakes), bobcat, and maybe mountain lions.

I've never personally never came across a grizzly bear (absolutely terrified worst nightmare), or big cats (also a nightmare for me as well)

I'm sure, like where I live you don't really come across them as much during the day, and if you do they tend to leave people alone.

We live on the east coast so it's all so different to me and a little scary. I don't want to get taken out by a bear or watch my dogs killed by a bear or a big cat as well.

My husband and I are looking to relocate from a small Oregon Coastal town to the Lane County Area. We're looking for a small town about 30 min. to Eugene but want to live far enough away from it to have the peace and nature that we desire.

We've been living in a lush forest wilderness and love its benefits of living remotely, but we're feeling its time to get closer to civilization to make life a bit easier. We're hoping to find a little bit of this type of environment but drive into town for necessities without it consuming our entire day (which is what we've been doing). We are also desiring to be close enough to Eugene and all that it entails to enjoy its unique shops, restaurants, theatre, etc.

We're looking to buy (at least 2+ acres, hopefully more than that if the price is right, in a rural setting. If there's an old country home on the property, good, raw land maybe. If utilities are ready, perfect. We need to be in a rural enough location that neighbors are few and far between, no noise or light pollution. We want to be able to see the stars at night and  hear our rooster crow in the morning.   


If there's a small town/community with an positive vibe, a market, a couple of eateries, gas station, cafe, etc. and then 30 min. to Eugene, suggestions would be awesome.

I‚Äôve done my research and plan to graduate with an AAOT degree and transfer to either UO (main choice) or OSU. The community colleges I currently have/applied on my list is:

Lane Community College (LCC)

Although, housing and transportation is a little difficult to plan out. Tuition for all these colleges are generally in the same range. The location of these colleges are around Portland and in the south and west. My concern at the moment is about the life outside of school and academics.

I plan to visit Oregon on my second trip, coming from Vancouver Canada. We have a long weekend next weekend (Feb 17 Family Day in BC). I was wondering if this itinerary would be ideal, especially with Crater Lake National Park in the winter time. I am driving a Honda Fit 2010 with winter tires if this helps. 

**Itinerary - Feb 12-17**

**Day 1 - Wednesday Feb 12 - Drive To Portland**

I would drive out Wednesday night and get to Portland late night around 10pm. Sleep. 

**Day 2 - Thursday Feb 13 - Drive To Painted Hills, Visit Smith Rock State Park**

Leave Portland early morning (7am), and drive 4 hours to Painted Hills 11am. Spend 2 hours there. Drive to Smith Rock State Park 1.5hours. Get to Smith Rock State Park by 2:30pm. Stay there till sunset at 5pm. Find a motel nearby. 

**Day 3 - Friday Feb 14 - Drive To Crater Lake, Visit Crater Lake** 

Drive early from Crater Lake NP from Smith Rock State Park (3hrs). Drive to south side entrance and park at Rim Village. Walk To Crater Lake and explore the entire day til end of sunset. **North entrance and Rim drive are closed off but my main issue would be the weather. How clear would the lake be? Even on a snowy day. Is it safe to drive with my small compact car with winter tires at this time of the year?** 

After sunset, drive out of the park and stay at a small town motel nearby. 

**Day 4 - Saturday Feb 15 - Drive &amp; Visit Samuel H Boardman State Park &amp; Oregon Coast** 

From Crater Lake, I would drive to Samuel H Boardman State Park (4hrs). I would spend some time there (2hours max) and drive north along the coast towards Oregon Dunes.

**Day 5 - Sunday Feb 16 - Drive Up To Oregon Dunes** 

Spend the day in Oregon Dunes. 

**Day 6 - Monday Feb 17 - Drive Back To Vancouver**

Early day start driving back to Vancouver from Oregon Dunes. Optional (if time permits): Visit Snoqualmie Falls in Washington State. 

**Common Worries**

Would an AWD with winter tires be recommended for Crater Lake? 

Any other places you would recommend to visit this time of the year? 

**About Myself**

I am a 26 year old Canadian photographer so I love visiting scenic places! Oregon state is one of my favorite places to visit. Last time I visited Oregon, I went to Portland, Multnolmah Falls, Trillium Lake, Columbia Gorge, Cannon Beach, Rovena Crest, Hood River Lavender Farm and Mount Helen (unfortunately it was all foggy so we didn't see the mountain.

I don't live in Oregon, but am posting this on behalf of my sister who lives in the Mt. Hood area.
She's been raising awareness locally, but isn't too familiar with reddit so I figured I'd make a post here.

Basically there's been a 20 year period in the ZigZag ranger district where logging and similar activities have been banned. Until now that is. The USFS (United States Forest Service), under the Trump Administration, is proposing the ZigZag Integrated Resource Project.

To summarize (will add links below with more information), this project is going to allow private logging companies to set up shop to start resource farming. 2,700 acres of land will be available to farm. This will directly affect several native species currently residing in Mt. Hood National Forest. Specifically three types of salmon who's population has seen a great resurgence due to efforts by the USFS. Besides the native fauna being affected, this area attracts thousands of visitors every year for cultural and/or recreational purposes. Many areas of the forest and surrounding lakes will see a closure to the public. 

If you live in the Mt. Hood area, or even if you don't, you can still submit a comment regarding why this project should not happen. You have until the 12th of February, 2020.

I know that's only a few days away, but I wasn't aware of any of this until today. I've only been to Mt. Hood once, but my sister has been living there for a couple years now. It doesn't take much to fall in love with the natural beauty it has to offer. Anyway below are links to provide a better scope of what's happening/going to happen.

The food is fantastic, and again its really the people and their friendliness and willingness to help others that really sets this state apart from others . I‚Äôve been all over , Portland, Eugene, the golden coast, Mt Hood and now I am in Eastern Oregon.  And everywhere I go, I just keep telling myself how much better it is than the East coast.

I would be on parole for only six more after my proposed move date, and then probation for another 4 and half years (barring my return to court in my sentencing state to restructure my sentence or get an early termination). The case that this stems from involves some gang related violence and firearms (a past life), so I expect to be graded as a higher risk. 

My supervision here in my sentencing state is lax since I have been home for a couple years and have been doing very well professionally, academically, and in my community involvement. My parole officer here and I are very friendly when we see each other every 3 or 4 months. I do not use any drugs or engage in any crime, so I am not concerned about strict penalties for violation. I am solely concerned about the level of engagement and intrusiveness of state supervision into one's life in Oregon. I would hopefully avoid a situation where I am levied with excessive curfews, and unannounced home inspections, and arbitrary restrictions that may limit my opportunity for success in my academic work.

Thank you for your help. I really appreciate your input.",oregon,Parole/ Probation in Oregon

Background:

30yr old male looking to pursue his happiness of living close to the mountains. I am an Engineer by profession, that has been given the green light to be able to work remote.  Since I absolutely LOVE strenuous day hiking and doing anything outdoors I decided Oregon or Colorado were going to be my places of interest (I've also been to Portland 4 times in the past 10 months where I was able to hike Mt. hood, Smith Rock, Deschutes, Newberry Volcanic area, Silver falls and parts of the coast -  just loved the variety. 

Looking for suggestions on cities that will best suit the outdoorsy lifestyle. (I've been looking into Beaverton, Gresham, SW/SE Portland, Bend, Salem and Eugene). Basically my wants/needs would be living relatively close to a gym, grocery stores, affordable 2BR/1BA living arrangements (ideally $900-1.2k monthly),  has a decent population and close""ish"" to some good hiking. 

\*Side bar\* Does it really rain from basically November until July... Lol Coworker whose from there stated this. 

Anyways, I appreciate any advice or info about this topic!",oregon,Minnesotan looking to relocate to Oregon

The boat aspect isn't the main part of the story, just a sidenote but I'd love to hear more about it. The author also says the population of Lyons as 10k, my husband grew up there and we visit often, I can't imagine it ever being that big - so it must have been when the mill was booming?

It got worse and worse until they told me they thought I was so rude and disrespectful that I was no longer allowed to use the shower or the washer and dryer even though I have paid rent and bills in full. This has been extremely hard on me because I don't have a car and can only access a laundromat by bus. My only access to showers are homeless shelters and friends willing to help me out.

The first day there, we drove up the Steens and did some hiking. It was fun, from what I remember. But, once the sun started to set I experienced something that I still can't describe to people. The amount of stars in the sky that are shaded by light pollution of the cities was absolutely unexplainable. I had never seen anything like. Still haven't to this day. I've seen similar stuff near Crater Lake and Timothy Lake while camping. Nothing as clear and profound as Alvord Desert. 

I have kids of my own now. About the age I was when I first went to the desert/playa. I would love to give them that experience that I had. 

From looking at the moon phases and calendars it appears that May 22nd is a New Moon which should optimize our viewing experience. Added benefit that it also ab extended weekend that weekend. 

My question is; is late May in Southeastern Oregon an appropriate time to visit? I've seen weather differences vary from 50 degree daytime highs to 90+. It seems that May is a bit of a transitional month for that area and can be quite unexpected. Hoping I can get some feedback from some people that have been in that area around that time of the year. Also, if anyone would like to share some added tips, that would be appreciated as well. 

Note: We'll be tent camping. Maybe on the Playa. We've also heard that the wind can be a bit of a pest for camping. When I went when I was younger, we camped on the Playa but I don't remember any wind. But, I also don't remember what time of the year it was either.",oregon,Alvord Desert: star gazing?

One benefit of Salem over Corvallis seems to be the closer proximity to Portland - what are some things to do in Portland that might draw people living in Salem?

A couple things about me: I'm almost 30 and it'd be great to be around other people that age; love the outdoors and hiking, biking, and skiing; into craft beer/coffee

I think Oregon's initiative system has a lot of value. I would like to see citizens more informed, but that's a separate problem with our media bubbles and disinformation. 

What these county initiatives do is increase voter turnout in November in the involved counties. There is no way that the end result of redrawing state boundaries will happen. 

The other impact is that if Oregon counties went to Idaho, they would become even more economically depressed. The Portland metro subsidizes rural Oregon county schools and roads. That includes I5, 84, and all the federal and state routes, as well as payments to counties for road maintenance. 

The state of Idaho doesn't have the tax base to subsidize that. 

Further, the Idaho payments to schools are much less than Oregon's. So the rural Oregon counties in Idaho could go back to the good old days of closing their schools as they did in the 1980's. That will further depopulate those counties of families with children.",oregon,The Oregon to Idaho Secession is not what it seems

Previously I had asked about doing the road trip in February and after some suggestions, I decided to push it later due to the weather. I am now thinking of doing it in mid March. What would you suggest? Again I am driving a Honda Fit 2010 with winter tires if that helps.

**Itinerary - March 11-15**

**Day 1 - Wednesday March 11 - Drive To Portland**

I would drive out Wednesday night and get to Portland late night around 10pm. Sleep.

**Day 2 - Thursday March 12 - Drive To Painted Hills, Visit Smith Rock State Park**

Leave Portland early morning (7am), and drive 4 hours to Painted Hills 11am. Spend 2 hours there. Drive to Smith Rock State Park 1.5hours. Get to Smith Rock State Park by 2:30pm. Stay there till sunset at 5pm. Find a motel nearby.

**Day 3 - Friday March 13 - Drive To Crater Lake, Visit Crater Lake**

Drive early from Crater Lake NP from Smith Rock State Park (3hrs). Drive to south side entrance and park at Rim Village. Walk To Crater Lake and explore the entire day til end of sunset. **North entrance and Rim drive are closed off but my main issue would be the weather. How clear would the lake be? Even on a snowy day. Is it safe to drive with my small compact car with winter tires at this time of the year?**

After sunset, drive out of the park and stay at a small town motel nearby.

**Day 4 - Saturday March 14 - Drive &amp; Visit Samuel H Boardman State Park &amp; Oregon Coast**

From Crater Lake, I would drive to Samuel H Boardman State Park (4hrs). I would spend some time there (2hours max) and drive north along the coast towards Oregon Dunes.

**Day 5 - Sunday March 15 - Drive Up To Oregon Dunes**

Spend the day in Oregon Dunes. Drive back to Vancouver from Oregon Dunes.

**Common Worries**

Would an AWD with winter tires be recommended for Crater Lake?

Any other places you would recommend to visit this time of the year?

Along the coast, where would you recommend to stop by? **I have been to Olympic National Park, Cannon Beach and Big Sur, so any unique stops along the coast would be greatly appreciated!**

**About Myself**

I am a 26 year old Canadian photographer so I love visiting scenic places! Oregon state is one of my favorite places to visit.

I requested from the rental agency they put the fence up and they agreed it would be fixed by the day I moved in. Of course I moved in and the fence was down, but my family needed a place to sleep so I had to suck it up. I then went and spent 200$ to buy some fence and put it up to keep my dogs safe from the creek and my friends kids for when they came over. The rental agency is now saying they never agreed to fix THAT fence, but instead the front yard fence. Despite the fact the fence panels were laying in the back yard on my tour, and had been moved to the street when I moved in. So do I have a good recourse to get them to pay me back for the fence I put in and my time and effort? Not to cry to hard but it set my wife to crying and instead of being able to move in i had to put the fence up to keep my pets and family safe.

1159,1787thecommongood,1583522707,feint9,Nan,"I stumbled across this gentleman claiming to be a LTC in the US Army Reserves. After reading the rather [strange editorial here](https://pamplinmedia.com/ttt/90-opinion/454734-370871-boquist-cap-and-trade-is-a-national-security-threat), I had my immediate doubts. So let's break down his time in service based on the article, his [Oregon Bio](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/boquist/Pages/biography.aspx) and [Ballotpedia Entry](https://ballotpedia.org/Brian_Boquist), then talk some practical CV and resume stuff:

 ""At 17,  Senator Boquist enlisted in the U.S. Army receiving education benefits  that would later aid in his receipt of a college education.  Brian  retired after thirty-four years of active military service as a Special  Forces Officer in July 2011 from the U.S. Army Special Operations  Command.¬† Brian's official military retirement commenced in October  2018.""

* So born in 1958, he enlisted in 1975. **Enlisted is the key here**. So he attained his BA from Western Oregon in 1985. So unless he was given a battlefield commission (unlikely) or a direct commission (unlikely), he earned the ability to commission as a 2LT (O-1) as early as 1985.
* Well he was an officer, so enlisted should mean commissioned, simple error? Unlikely. Anyone who was an officer would say they commissioned via ROTC, Green to Gold, USMA and PROUDLY declare they were also enlisted. So such statements are usually, ""So and so retired as a LTC from the 75th Ranger Battalion in 2000. He enlisted in 1975 as an 11B before utilizing the green to gold program to earn a commission as a 2nd LT in such and such a year.""
* The average LTC spends 22 years in service before attaining the rank. The official rules are actually   ""DOPMA guidelines suggest that 70 percent of majors be promoted to lieutenant colonel after serving at least three years at their present  rank and after 15‚Äì17 years of cumulative commissioned service.""  That puts the earliest he would qualify as 2000 assuming a 1985 receipt of a butter bar That's for active duty. The reserves can vary wildly, but let's assume he made it. He was creme de la creme to make it that fast.
* Also, it's possible he's claiming enlisted as ""commissioned"" in 1975, but that's also weird to say. Furthermore, even then you needed to have a Bachelors degree to be an officer (again, stupid rare exceptions) so I doubt that's the case. Also, he was 17...
* We immediately find some weird contradictions in his biographical statements and CV from various sources:

&gt;Boquist served as a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve from  1975-2012. During that time, Boquist served as Deputy Commander/Chief of  Staff for a Joint Special Operations Task Force in Iraq from 2003 to  2004  
&gt;  
&gt;Brian  retired after thirty-four years of active military service as a Special  Forces Officer in July 2011 from the U.S. Army Special Operations  Command.¬† Brian's official military retirement commenced in October  2018. 

* So he enlisted in the Army Reserves in 1975 and retired in 2018...after 43 years?
* There was a gap of 7 years before retirement commenced? So he was an active military officer and Oregon legislator from 2009-2011? While also serving as a political advisor and activist in D.C. until 2000? While also, ""providing training services, Brian was a partner in an international  aviation company working in Africa, Asia, and Latin America supporting  commercial, humanitarian,¬†and peacekeeping operations""? Man must have fucking clones.
* Another website shows him ending military service in 2012...?
* He was both the Deputy Command and Chief of Staff for a JSOTF in Iraq from 2003 to 2004...the same time he was:

&gt; work\[ing\] with a group of companies  and government entities preparing Marines, Army and Navy soldiers for  service in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, in the defense of the nation  by supplying hyper-realistic simulated training using role players,  pyrotechnics and blank firing weapons to create the feeling of real-life  situation soldiers might encounter in country. 

* So in other words, he ran the MOUT training or NTC BS we all had to go through pre-deployment? This statement is translated to sound crazy to civilians, but hell, I was an observer and trainer on an NTC rotation and it's pretty much just sitting there watching everyone play in Magickastan. All while being upwards of 40 years in the Reserves? Or the Active Army? Or a contractor? Or something? While also running a farm? So many clones.

Let's assume he was a LTC in a JSOTF in Iraq in 2003 and 2004. TF 20 and TF 121 were the big and bad folks hunting for HVTs, including the infamous folks on the deck of cards. These folks were Delta's, JSOC, etc. He was an LTC with that? I get it that you can leave the Active Army and enter the reserves, but it just doesn't add up either way...

&gt;From the Pamplin Article:  *Brian Boquist has represented Senate District 12, including parts of  Washington, Yamhill, Polk, Marion and Benton counties, in the Oregon Senate since 2009. He is also a retired U.S. Army Special Forces lieutenant colonel.*  

Again. He was a Senator in 2009 in the Oregon Senate. So let's build this timeline out:

1. Enlisted in the Reserves in 1975.
2. Attained BA in 1985.
3. Becomes an officer at some point, let's say 1985.
4. Attained MBA in 1989.
5.  Member, Polk County Republican Central Committee, 1985-1989 while on active duty I guess? Or maybe the reserves?
6. Is promoted FAST AS FUCK to serve as a LTC by the 2003/2004 invasion of Iraq. So &lt;20 years to LTC.
7. Came out with a Bronze Star when the ""I served as a certain rank award"" for LTCs is the Legion of Merit?

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety and panic by arming you with knowledge, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from outbreak zones such as Seattle, Australia, and the LA area. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now ready yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**Context:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its exponential spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted in China through stringent measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** COVID-19 has infected over [100,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) people globally. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep. That means there is likely silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186). 

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

#**Important:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets** (coughing/sneezing/breathing). But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and be mindful of everything you touch in public (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source2 ](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.**

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)--especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world and has [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients. [Toronto Star soberly warns hospitals can‚Äôt cope if coronavirus outbreak worsens in Canada: March 6th.](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/03/06/hospitals-warn-they-cant-cope-if-coronavirus-outbreak-worsens-in-canada.html)

* A surgeon working in the heart of Italy's outbreak gives a harrowing testimony and urges everyone to heed the warning that it can easily overwhelm hospitals ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffa2tf/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/fjx5tc8/) / [Original](https://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_07/coronavirus-bergamo-medico-humanitas-facebook-situazione-drammatica-altro-che-normale-influenza-4fdf6866-6088-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml)).

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

#**Psychology**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and make an effort to listen to your local health authorities. 

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper).  The public needs you to be clear, informative, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. 

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**Risk Reduction**

* Practice social distancing.

* Do not touch your face.

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). 

* Carry disinfectant with you.

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. 

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Consider pressing your boss to work from home. Many transmissions happen at work.

* If you have extra face masks, consider donating some to senior care facilities and hospitals, as there is a global shortage and they will desperately need them in the coming months. Masks in the right hands is to your benefit, as they slow the spread. Hoarded masks are actually detrimental to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitaizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Always remember the top three: Disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**Typical symptoms:**

(All direct from [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf))

People with COVID-19 generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days). As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases [in China], typical signs and symptoms include:

* Fever (87.9%)

* Dry cough (67.7%)

* Fatigue (38.1%)

* Sputum production (33.4%) (a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract)

* Shortness of breath (18.6%)

* Sore throat (13.9%)

* Headache (13.6%)

* Joint pain (14.8%)

* Chills (11.4%)

* Nausea or vomiting (5.0%)

* Nasal congestion (4.8%)

* Diarrhea (3.7%)

* Hemoptysis (0.9%) (coughing up of blood or blood-stained mucus from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs)

* Conjunctival congestion (0.8%)

#**Comorbidities**

Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include those who meet *any* of the following conditions:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart, lung or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* People with weakened respiratory system due to [smoking/vaping](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)

What does it mean for you if you fall into this bracket? A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) explains.

#**Additionals:**

* It's still far too early to know for sure, but the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is estimated to be 0.94% (0.37%‚Äì2.9% with a 95% CI) ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Though [here](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html) is a recent Slate piece that mentions a CFR between 0.2 to 0.4. South Korea, after doing 140,000 tests, reports a CFR of 0.6% ([source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-tested-140-000-031000719.html))

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, as SARS-like virus can have long-term consequences: ""Long-term bone and lung consequences associated with hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome: says a [15-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5)"". And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)).

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I'm a volunteer who's put countless hours into this document. Why? I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal--that and I've been following Covid-19 closely since mid January.

Now COVID-19 is upon my doorstep too. 

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it helped you. 
Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

Mods of communities are invited to link this post from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/femw1n/psa_regarding_covid19/), where I keep it updated regularly.

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA.

Every show I do this year raises money for dog rescue. We're at over $17,000 and climbing!

I am doing this because of how important my dog was to me. Walter traveled with me to 48 states (and 6 provinces), and was my constant companion on the road. So I decided to help save a few more Walters.

We donate 25% of every show and the charities I choose in each city don't know I'm doing this til after I announce it - makes it more fun that way.

I'm trying to plan an itinerary for a hiking/nature/exploration trip in the Pacific Northwest but we're so flexible that it's pretty hard to do, I could really, really use some help from you lovely people! 

I want to hike and see the gorgeous nature views, maybe swim near a waterfall or find some hot springs if possible (I'm not sure about the nude springs though). We don't have a car, but I'm hoping we can find buses/public transport to take us from place to place

I'm contemplating hopping from Eugene to Portland and maybe Seattle, but I'm not married to any decisions yet. I think the best way to plan the trip is to start with finding the absolute most important places to see and plan around that. As someone who's never been to the area at all, it's hard to be able to discriminate between all the different parks and forests and such.

If you could be so kind as to share any ideas you might have, like the most beautiful forests in your opinion, secret hot spring spots, or your favorite hiking trails, or even an argument for or against visiting certain cities and what to do there, I'd be very grateful.",oregon,Planning a hiking/nature trip with no car!

Yesterday was my last day in the 90-day treatment program portion of my diversion. I went the whole period was about 100 days, went to classes/meetings weekly and took/passed all of my random piss tests.. I'm at the point now where i just  to stay out of trouble for 6.5 months and i'll have the duii lifted from my record. 

First of all, I KNOW I am an asshole for getting a duii. I have sworn off alcohol for good i really think it only leads to trouble. the duii cost me a ton of money and ive been paying the price. But my question for anyone who has done the program or is in the know: Am I going to be required to take UAs (piss tests) between now and the end of the program? I am not supposed to drink at all for the whole period (which i wont), or use any drugs. But to be honest I wouldnt mind having a bit of weed here and there, in the past it has really helped me with insomnia and anxiety. Hey I know i'm not supposed to so please spare me the lectures :/. So my question is: Anymore UAs?

Thanks to anyone who can answer the question based on their experience

You may also read this if you don't have tickets, but it may be a waste of your time. You have tons of COVID-19 emails to read from companies you bought one thing from 7 years ago. 

We are cancelling the Yakima show as it's at a venue above the state-recommended 250 capacity. Those who bought tickets will automatically receive a full refund. All the other venues are at 250 or fewer, and we are not currently planning on cancelling those shows. 

We are, however, offering refunds to anyone who has purchased tickets that does not feel comfortable attending. If you are 60 years or older, we recommend you take us up on this offer. This goes for Eugene, Everett, Vancouver, Kelowna, Richland, Spokane, Moscow, Couer d'Alene, and Seattle. (That is for the city of Eugene Oregon, not just a guy named Eugene). If you'd like a refund, please email refunds@stevehofstetter.com before Monday March 16th so he has time to process all of them. Please include the name you purchased tickets under and the date/time &amp; city of the show. 

As the situation develops, we will be making decisions on future tours as well. 

In the interests of public health, there will be a few changes at the meet and greet after the shows. As much as I want to shake hands with everyone, there will be absolutely no physical contact post-show, even for pictures. Also, sales will be credit card only to avoid the transfer of cash between parties. The good news is we will still be selling shirts. Even if you don't like the shirts, they can be useful in a post-toilet paper society. (If you're one of those selfish toilet-paper hoarding monsters, I hope you get crushed by a giant pile of it).

If you do attend, of course, I'd love to see you. After the show, we will wave at each other longingly, like one of us is on a train slowly pulling away from the station. 

I do ask that you be mindful of your fellow patrons. Please, please, please wash your hand thoroughly before and after the show. (And just in general, you dirty dirty boy).

I may be young and unable to vote, but what you decide effects us youngins too. Our governor has decided to shut down all after school activities, yet not shut down school. Why? They haven't said. Coronavirus is why they shut down after school activities, yet they don't shut down schools and replace it with a temporary schooling solution like online or handed out work. It doesn't make sense. You have kids going to these classes of 30 or more and possibly schools of thousands of students yet you stop the small group gatherings afterwards and not the large ones. My thoughts on this is that'd it'd cost too much. Our governor has consistently taken down our education budget and made the education system worse and worse to the point that we have no money and the only schools that are doing sensible things are the schools along rich boundaries. End this and organize protests, send complaints, and vote for those who will make our next generation smarter than the last.

1292,Perioscope,1584044855,fhmz5n,Nan,"To all state employees,

¬†

I want to thank you for your continued efforts as we work to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak in Oregon. Now more than ever is the time for state government to step up and show how we are here to support and serve our fellow Oregonians. Your ability to remain¬†calm and flexible in this current situation is incredibly important, and we thank you for that.¬†

¬†

Today, Governor Brown announced¬†urgent new strategies¬†to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Oregon. The following measures are based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Oregon public health experts, epidemiologists, and health professionals.¬†

Large gatherings:¬†All large gatherings over 250 people¬†will be canceled statewide¬†effective immediately for four weeks (excluding worksites). A gathering is defined as any event in a space in which appropriate social distancing of¬†a minimum of three feet cannot be maintained.State offices will remain open because the prohibition on large gatherings does not include places of work, and because state government delivers critical services to Oregonians.Workplace:¬†Recommended implementation, to the extent possible, of distancing measures including an increased physical space between employees in offices and worksites, limited in-person¬†meetings, limited travel, and staggered work schedules where possible.Schools:¬†In addition to¬†previous guidance issued on March 8, 2020¬†to keep schools open, all non-essential school-associated gatherings and group activities should be canceled ‚Äî such as group parent meetings,¬†field trips, and competitions.Long-Term Care and Assisted Living:¬†Strict limitations announced this week¬†by the Oregon Health Authority and Department of Human Services remain in place.

¬†

The Governor is implementing these measures for two primary reasons: to slow the transmission of the disease, and to ensure the healthcare system has the capacity to treat those who are at the highest risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The CDC has identified¬†individuals at¬†high risk¬†to include:

Older adults (those over 60)Those with serious chronic medical conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes and lung disease)

¬†

Please know we care about your health and your concerns about coronavirus. If you are among the individuals in these high-risk groups ‚Äì and you have concerns about your health ‚Äì we encourage you to contact your agency HR¬†staff regarding your work options (such as telecommuting or alternative schedules).¬†In addition,¬†the CDC advises that it is extra important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease. You can find the CDC recommendations¬†here.

¬†

DAS is continually updating the employee coronavirus¬†webpage¬†so please check back on a regular basis. Don‚Äôt hesitate to direct questions to your agency‚Äôs HR staff.

¬†

Thank you,

Katy Coba

I did what I could to not cancel my shows, but the writing is on the wall, and it's spelled out in hand sanitizer. 

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour today so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to Eugene, Everett, Vancouver, Kelowna, Yakima, Richland, Spokane, Moscow, Couer d'Alene, and Seattle will be getting a refund. I am also offering to send $20 to Eugene Levy, Eugene Merman, and Gene Wilder. I just hate cancelling on Eugene. 

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Seattle already has two more shows scheduled for July 10th). Meanwhile, I will be hosting a few free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.) Mainly Q&amp;As, but maybe I'll invite some friends over and we'll live stream some stand-up. I know we could all use a distraction. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the live stream, and the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see. 

Meanwhile, stay healthy and keep your head up. I mean, it's kind of cool we all get to be in a disaster movie.

I've been an employee of Oregon Department of Transportation for a DMV office in the Willamette Valley since April of 2017. This has been my experience.

\* Nepotism - The managers buddy system hire their own family. At least two out of four managers in the Northwest Region have their son working for DMV. An additional manager, previously had a sister working for DMV until she resigned after proof was presented she was stealing money from the safe at the Stayton DMV office.

\* Theft - The employees aren't trustworthy with at least three known theft cases with the worst representing the worst of institutional racism. I was providing relief help away from my home office at the McMinnville DMV in 2019. A Latino customer noted that their other child had previously paid $60 for a driver's permit when I was now charging their sibling the correct amount of $23. I informed them that $60 is the cost for a Driver's license but there's no way the computer would allow us to make that error. They sounded sure they were overcharged so I brought it up the chain and when I got the name of the employee who helped them (who I didn't know had stopped showing up for work because I don't regularly work at the McMinnville branch), the leadership weren't surprised and they only offered the customer a phone number to call, which is about the normal quality of customer service you get accustomed to as a DMV employee. However, an investigation uncovered the employee was meticulously overcharging latino customers for DMV driver's issuances and taking in money for title work, but never submitting the title forms (this was before we went paperless) to DMV headquarters for review. She was pocketing the money for herself. The supervisors of the office uncovered this by dumping the shredder bin and finding completed title work. Her regular coworkers noted they thought it was odd she kept her purse under her desk (I'm not even kidding). The worst of it, however, is the cover up. We were told by management not to tell anyone about the employee and if any customers ask about overcharges or title never received, to be given a phone number to call. The estimated money stolen was in the thousands and customers to this day don't know they were victimized by a racist institution.

\* Racism - in June of 2018, Lori McAllen resigned from ODOT after a viral sh\*tstorm for posting on social media that migrant children should be shot at the border. Her facebook post went viral and the attention went away as soon as people believed that she was fired. I overheard and was told by at least 5 different employees they either agreed with Lori's racist sentiment or shared with me they believed she should still work for ODOT as they liked her.

\* On the Job Injury and Retaliation - in January 2020 I was involved in an on the job car accident on highway 233 which has led to terrible back pain, spasms and lombar spine curvatures. I was rear-ended at high speeds. I've been harassed daily, even after asking for no contact from my interim manager, about when I'd be returning to work. As I developed an upper respiratory infection due to stress, which is ongoing with the back pain and unsure if I have corona virus or just the flu, I did not have an estimated date of return. My job security has been threatened and while I have a union, the workplace is so toxic I fear to return to work even after I am healed.

I am resented at this job because at meetings I bring up ethics, conscience and tearing down unnecessary red tape. The managers openly encourage lying as a way to handle customers. I can't say there hasn't been a meeting where lying or misleading wasn't part of the solution to problems. The business-as-usual DMV is corrupt so maybe that is why these scandals become normalized for the staff working there. Over time, every single one of us becomes jaded and numb to it and the most toxic dishonest liars get promoted. I loved conducting drive tests and the positive experience of first licence's. However, the toxic work environment, theft and racism ruin it for the taxpaying people of Oregon. Unfortunately, being slow is the least of Oregon DMV's problems.

1339,MavetheGreat,1584209107,fimkwq,Nan,"This post is simply a PSA for the Oregon COVID statistics that we see everyday reported by the paper or whatever source.

This week, my 2 year old developed symptoms that checked all the boxes for COVID-19.  Our doctors have confirmed the same suspicions, but have told us that he will not be able to be tested because there aren't enough tests.  They told us that they have even sent patients to the ER directly who were not tested because of a lack of tests.  Additionally, I have an extended family member who is in his late 70s with symptoms that went to OHSU and they could not test him.  The tests don't really matter that much given that the treatment doesn't really change, but it makes reporting to friends and family somewhat anecdotal.  This post is simply to advise you not to rely on exposure only to 'positively tested individuals' because that number is going to pitifully inaccurate for the foreseeable future.  

Right now the [Oregon Health Authority](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx) says there 30 people who have tested positive, 157 who are pending.  While there are 316 who are 'under monitoring'.  However, my family members aren't included in that list.  When I called my county health department to attempt to report, they said there was no way to do that and just to call my primary care physician (which we already had).  

My wife and I assume that we will all get it and of course have self-quarantined.  We likely (hopefully) will never be included in those numbers either unless we develop very severe symptoms.

All this to say that when you read the statistics for who has this thing, the numbers seem to be drastically low.  Of course, the good news is that it is very beatable for almost all people. 

Stay safe out there, and remember to eat a square of toilet paper every 4-6 hours ;)  Hopefully you stocked up :)",oregon,Oregon COVID Reporting

I have noticed, since moving in, that he comes every weekend or randomly into the house without notifying me (I am not sure if he notifies any other roommate). It has made me feel uncomfortable in the house because I never know when someone will be there. I am very introverted and currently studying for an important exam, and sometimes they will come to the house and start doing garden work or go to the kitchen and read their mail. Sometimes it will wake me up and I will get scared of someone foreign being in the house (I grew up in Los Angeles lol).

One time, I got out of school early and when I got home I realized the garage door and house door were open (house mates were at school at this time). I was worried that we had forgot to close the garage and someone might have came into the house. Turns out, the landlords were there. Another time, I was home alone and took advantage of taking a long shower and walking to my room in just a towel. Suddenly, I see the landlord in the kitchen going through his mail. I am just tired of this. So my question is, are landlords allowed to do this? Or do they need to give 24hr notice prior to coming into the house or something like that?

**So I am a local Registered Nurse in the Portland area ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/b3otty/bsn_nursing_student_in_icu_and_soontobe_rn_here)** from a year ago) in a nursing unit that is and will be providing lots of direct, front-line care to COVID-19 pts at one of the hospitals here. I don't want to call it out directly in this post for fear of risking my job during this time I'm critically needed, but I can prove all of this. 

**I am asking for help from the community to get donations of medical supplies you think you might be able to spare: N95 or simple/surgical masks, goggles, face shields, medical isolation gowns, gloves, bleach products of any kind, antimicrobial hand soap, hand sanitizer, hair nets, shoe covers, portable medical sanitizing equipment (e.g. UV-C lights), etc for myself and my coworkers that we can use if we run short in the hospital, which I suspect is a VERY, VERY high possibility in the coming weeks. My coworkers and I would love to have any of these things and we welcome other medical supply donation ideas!!!**

Nurses and other healthcare workers around the state are beginning to see COVID-positive and COVID-rule out pts, myself included. We're waking up to headlines like [this](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8112063/America-braces-coronvirus-collapse-100-00-ICU-beds-10-MILLION-hospitalized.html). We're reading about and watching videos from China and Italy showing the personal protective equipment (PPE) they're wearing [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0EL9vKqRA8) and comparing it to our own. Check out r/nursing for more on what we're seeing and experiencing in real-time.

We are hearing from our work organizations at this time that we're already short because about 80% of the world‚Äôs PPE supplies are produced in China ‚Äì a country that has clearly been hard hit by the COVID-19 situation. COVID-19 caused major disruptions in the manufacturing process. Plants were shut down for extended periods, which halted production. China also stopped exports of these supplies, in part to ensure it had the needed supplies to care for its own population.

My coworkers and I expect to be wearing very inadequate PPE soon when sh*t hits the fan, and expected to continue to work until if/when we get symptoms or test positive. Not just at my institution but across the state, we're already being told at multiple institutions not to wear N95 masks as those are in short supply, though if you look at China and Italy it's CLEAR they're using N95+ equivalents and so much more. Not to mention just how clearly contagious this virus is, clearly our average droplet PPE measures are not enough.

**IF you have to spare any: N95 or simple/surgical masks, goggles, face shields, medical isolation gowns, gloves, bleach products of any kind, antimicrobial hand soap, hand sanitizer, hair nets, shoe covers, portable medical sanitizing equipment (e.g. UV-C lights), probably dang near any other medical supplies you can think of... My coworkers and I would love to have them!!!** 

If you decide to donate, I can then show you proof of where I work, and I SWEAR to it every last piece of medical supplies donated will be used by front line medical staff in desperate need, and I will share it with my coworkers LIBERALLY. Again see [my proof post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/b3otty/bsn_nursing_student_in_icu_and_soontobe_rn_here) above...I am one to share liberally to others when in need. I live on the west side not too far from 217 &amp; 26 intersection. I work again in a few days from now, so for a few days I can drive around especially if on the west side for supply donations pretty easily. I then work a ton of shifts in a row on nights....and possibly then much more than that as needed at work, so I also heartily welcome drop-offs of donations too!!!

Thanks for reading :) Stay safe out there everyone.

**Finally: IF you think I should post this somewhere else as well for max traction, please tell me where! If you think I'm posting too much that's personally-identifiable here, I welcome feedback. Thank you!**

Please feel to comment below, or direct message me ANYTIME with donations or questions going forward!!! I expect to be accepting and welcome supply donations for my work team not just now but for the foreseeable future! Thanks guys.

EDIT: I have cross-posted to r/Portland and expect/hope that might generate even more discussion. See that post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/fjibik/local_registered_nurse_here_my_coworkers_and_i

1373,Impressive_Word,1584359818,fjjsbg,Nan,"Heya Oregon Friends,

I have taken some really hard, unexpected L's in my life in the past month. Sudden death of a young relative, a sudden shitty diagnosis of a parent, abuse in my work environment, and now the ickyness of legit and illogical corona panic is getting to me. And my SO will be off work for over a month; I love him, but he talks to himself incredibly loudly and frequently. I live about 20 miles outside of Seattle and have no virus symptoms. 

I'd love to find a remote(-ish) cabin in the woods and mourn my losses for a while. I've seen so many beautiful pictures of Oregon, but have only stayed in Portland. I'd love to see more for myself.

So I'd love your suggestions for towns and areas where I might be to find a cabin, tiny house, yurt in northern Oregon where I can sob it out, but still have a little electricity or cell service &amp;/or wifi. I assume I'll use AirBnb, but I wonder if there are any services or companies I don't know about.

Thanks all",oregon,Suggestions for area in N Oregon for cabin stay?

I decided to sit down and write a letter to our leaders urging them to impose a rent and mortgage freeze immediately. I can't say it will have any effect but I thought I would share it here for anyone who may want to send a letter to their representatives as well. I know this may serve no purpose but it felt good to put into words and say that to the officials. Feel free to use this exact letter (though you will need to fill in who it is addressed to and sign your name at the end) or edit it to your needs. This letter has stats specific to Oregon but if you are in a different state you can delete that sentence or add your own stats there.

And if you think it's a stupid idea than fine, be that way.

To XXX,

I write with urgency to discuss the housing crisis in Oregon with the onslaught of COVID-19 upon us. As it currently stands, I cannot find one single record of a property management company, mortgage lender, or bank guaranteeing financial relief to the many residents who will be affected by this pandemic. A blanket statement assuring us they care and asking us to call in isn‚Äôt going to cut it. Thousands are losing their jobs, have no paid sick leave and were already living paycheck-to-paycheck. We will not have the money; not now, not later, not retroactively. 

Jobless claims in our state surged by 3,200% in one day. Oregon‚Äôs unemployment is expected to rise to higher levels than that of the Great Depression. Yet many of these companies will still demand our bills be paid and worse yet, they will charge absurd interest and late fees on top of it. Their financial interests should not be above the common good of the people and they sure as hell shouldn‚Äôt be able to profit from this suffering.

As a public servant it is your duty to serve your constituents. That is why I, a member of your community, plead with you to freeze all rent and mortgage payments until the COVID-19 crisis passes.An eviction moratorium isn‚Äôt an adequate long-term solution. This is a National Emergency and now is the time to act. Oregonians do not have the luxury to hear you preach about the difficult legalities associated between city and state laws. COME TOGETHER, FIGURE IT OUT, AND DO WHAT YOU WERE ELECTED TO DO.

This is about keeping people sheltered. This is about preventing people from feeling forced to go out and make money. This is about eradicating the virus. We are tired of coming in second to corporate profits that treat our hardships as an opportunity to more thickly line their padded pockets. Make no mistake; they will look to profit from this unless those in government, YOU, put a stop to it. Please wield this power thoughtfully and wisely. Property management companies, banks, and mortgage lenders will persevere just fine. Without your help we, however, will not.

My fianc√© works at an outpatient clinic that performs psychometric testing and evaluations in primarily geriatric patients.

Anyway, this clinic is continuing with business as usual and my fianc√© is worried about her and her patients health. Management is fairly incompetent so I want to report them to go over their heads. I tried calling the OHA but none of their options seemed like the right ones.

I grew up in Eastern Oregon and I have been an owner / operator of an Oregon based business since 1996 - started while in school at university.¬† I am Oregonian through and through.

Now the failure of our governing bodies to provide adequately for the safety of my family and all Oregon families risks destroying everything I  have worked the last 25 years to build.¬† It starts at the top, where much of it is out of your control, but there is still plenty that COULD  have been done and STILL MUST BE DONE within our own borders in Oregon.

I must protect my family.¬† I must provide for and protect the future of my wife and children.

I will have no choice but to lay off staff in the coming weeks.¬† My business has already experienced a downturn and I have already been flowing funds into the business just to make payroll because I value my people.¬† Now I fear for them being unemployed without income to pay  their mortgages and rents.¬† It sickens me that it has come to this.

And yet still worse - Unless the legislature acts immediately, I will have no choice but to evict tenants from my property when the inevitable time comes that they cannot pay.

I believe several actions are required to address the well being of our  great State and prevent a huge opportunistic land grab like what  happened in 2008.

1) We must start at the top of our financial system, at the banking level.¬† The banks right now have been receiving emergency loans, payment holidays, and ZERO INTEREST from the Federal Reserve.¬† Those same payment holidays and ZERO INTEREST should be extended to ALL OREGONIANS across the board for ALL bank mortgages, student loans, SMB loans, credit cards, etc.¬† Do it across the board, without requiring expensive documentation overhead, and make it sunset when COVID-19 is no longer a risk to the general population.¬† Any bank not cooperating can have their state licenses revoked.

2) We must put all home and condo insurance payments on hold for homeowners that can demonstrate loss of income due to COVID-19. Coverage must remain intact. I believe a statewide fund could be established to back 80% of claims made during this time. This would not be free for  the state like the banking relief above, but would be the most cost effective way to ensure our insurance companies are not bankrupted and no one loses coverage on their homes.¬† Any insurance company not cooperating can have their state licenses revoked.

3) We must provide property tax relief for homeowners that can demonstrate loss of income due to COVID-19.¬†This has an unavoidable side effect on county and city budgets, but I believe that has to be managed, given the far worse alternative of so many becoming homeless.¬†The homeless are a proven far larger financial burden on society than those with homes so the more we can help, the better.

It is not time to allow Wall Street or the money printers to prey on the weak or the unprepared.¬† It is time to stand up and protect those that can least protect themselves.¬† We have a duty to keep people securely sheltered,  both in my property and across Oregon.¬† Your immediate action is  appreciated.",oregon,My open letter to Oregon's Legislators

Cardinal Glass, the largest employer in the Hood River Valley (and one of the largest in The Columbia River Gorge) produces residential and commercial window units. They've taken it upon themselves to decide they're an essential business and are going to remain open even with the Stay At Home Order issued by Kate Brown today, requiring lower-level employees to report to work if they're not using personal PTO. Upper management will be working from home for their safety.¬†

Cardinal has declared they \*could\* be asked to produce windows for temporary hospitals. They've not been contacted for this, or ever done it before, and are instead risking the lives of their approx 350 employees by forcing them to continue making profitable stock windows for customers while they ""wait to see"".¬†

The plant manager, Dave Windsor, has stated they will most likely see a case at the plant, they are after all a facility that puts workers in close contact. However he dismissed this as a typical virus like they've seen before, and that they'll ""clean that person's work station after they leave"".¬†

Does this seem safe? At a time where we are all being asked to take a step back, make hard decisions, and try to stop the spread of this unprecedented, highly contagious virus; Cardinal and Dave Windsor have decided to callously risk throwing their employees, and now the entire Columbia River Gorge, in front of the virus in the name of profits.¬†

I've got a new Rheem 50 gallon in the basement that's almost exactly the same height as the 30 y.o. Rheem 40 gallon it replaces.

Possible issues.  

1. Water heater was positioned away from wall.  To meet seismic code, can I leave the water heater in the same place and loop 2 pieces of plumbers tape around it to strap it to a couple of 4x4 posts?  I'd anchor the posts in the cement floor and to the wooden ceiling (does it matter what a post is anchored to at the ceiling? I'd nail a couple feet of 2x10 to the ceiling to give some meat for a bracket around the post to hold onto).  Or am I going to have to move the heater to the cement wall to anchor it (in which case, I'm calling the plumber)?  
2. The exhaust pipe from the previous heater to the outside window was mostly zero-slope (flat).  Has there been any change in code that requires the pipe to continually slope upwards from the heater's hood to a higher vent in a window?
3. Is a drip pan sufficient or does code require a connection to a drain?  There's no drain nearby except the one 15' away (for the washing machine) that's fitted w/a 2.5"" pipe that's got an open connection 18"" off the ground.

First off, this is a throwaway account, I will not be revealing how I got the info about this for fear of retaliation (hence the throwaway)

Here goes:

Asset recovery group (hereby referred to as ARG) is a debt collection group that specializes in collecting medical debt, headquartered here in oregon.

ARG has announced that they will be remaining open during this health crisis, and that they have no plans of shutting down.

They say that it's in the interest of their employees livelihoods when oregon government has already made it possible for these people to be paid unemployment at least while the coronavirus is spreading

The governor just announced a stay home order, with a 1250$ fine for disobeying it.

And I say again, these employees must go to work, they cant just not show up because of noncompliance of the company because then they wouldn't be eligible for unemployment for the time being.

A lot of their employees are understandably angry about the situation and how they have to keep trying to collect medical debt in this crisis which for many of them just feels morally wrong.

One more time for the people in the back, ARG will continue to collect on medical debt with no plans of closing.

I dont know if this is outrage worthy but it just boils my damn blood, what other business have you seen open that should be closed? How do you feel about ARG? Please discuss I would love to here your thoughts

For the past two weeks, essentially since a state of emergency was declared, I have been hanging out at my apartment (in Portland), going out for an hour a day for some sun and exercise. I've had sub-social distance level contact with only my roommate and two other friends, otherwise relying on distance methods of keeping in touch. *I am doing these things exclusively in order to reduce the significant risk of death posed to older adults.* 65-75 year olds are old, as far as this virus is concerned; y'all are nearly twice as likely to be admitted to the ICU *and to die* as someone just 10 years younger!

Each time I have gone out, I have noticed that older folks make up a greater proportion of the people out-and-about than they did before. Running in my neighborhood, I look ahead to see if someone is coming towards me on the same sidewalk, and move into or across the street to stay over 6 feet away from them. Roughly four-fifths of the old folks I see do not do this. I have seen old people greeting groups of friends with embraces at Portland parks and beer gardens as I've passed. Older adults are the most dangerous vectors, *because your friends are also old.* I am going to have zero contact with people over 65 (including my parents!) until this is all over. *Are you?*

Early this morning, I went to the grocery store, for the first time in two weeks. It was very clear to me that, just by being at the store, I was having far more ""contacts"" in those 45 minutes than I had in the entire past two weeks. It was much more crowded than usual, and again, a greater fraction of the people out and about looked older than 65. Many of them appeared to be purchasing one days worth of groceries. I am familiar with this practice. My parents, both retired, made near daily trips to the grocery store before this all started. I get it: you have extra time, it's nice to go the grocery store, you can get fresh ingredients for whatever dinner seems most appealing that day. But *now is not the time to make daily trips. Stock up, and stay home.*

We (young people, mid-20s to 30s) are putting our lives, schools, work, and recreation totally on hold, solely for your benefit. If there wasn't a large, at risk populations that we were trying to protect, a lot of young people, including myself, would prefer to just get the virus now and get it over with. We are taking this seriously, so *please take this seriously*. Have as little contact, or close proximity to others, *as you possibly can*. That is not what I'm seeing when I (occasionally) leave my house. Being cooped up sucks for everyone, *but we are doing this exclusively for you*.

 To all concerned citizens,

Unprecedented times call for unprecedented creativity.  It is evident that we have what is in essence a two front war:  a global health pandemic, and an economic meltdown of unprecedented proportion.

The best recommended method to fight the pandemic is social distancing.  Therefore, we must implement immediately a stay-in-place policy across the nation and the world.  If the way to stop the virus is to stop the spread through interpersonal contact, this will be the quickest and most effective way to flatten the curve, and stop the virus in its tracks.  Let it play itself out in infected populations, and wait for the coast to clear.

Secondly, the cash flow crisis that is upon businesses and individuals must have a uniform policy across the board that keeps everyone ‚Äúwhole‚Äù as a result of the stay-in-place policy.  The economic consequences of the pandemic so far have dwarfed the medical impacts.  **The best way to combat the economic meltdown and cash flow crisis is to pause or freeze all debt, mortgage, lease, and rent payments in their tracks across the board for everyone.**  I have advocated for immediately passing a national law to do just this.  Once the crisis is over, allow business to recover and then un-pause.

We have frozen millions of businesses ability to make money, pay wages, and economic activity has screeched to a halt.  The only way to effectively keep our nation and the world from a meltdown is to simultaneously halt the need to make payments.  All banks and financial institutions must get on board with a uniform policy enacted across all platforms to make this work.  If banks cannot receive payments on the loans, we are facing another financial crisis.  By halting the requirement to make payments, banks can then work within the framework of the Federal Reserve System, and interbank lending to create and maintain liquidity for essential services.  We can reduce or stop business failure in its tracks, and thus, the need to bail out industries and financial institutions.  Federal and State aid can then be most effectively used for the basic survival needs of food and utilities.

We must have the mindset to create a national protocol for these situations; protocols for health systems and economic systems that protect everyone on both levels.  The current paradigm of tax credits, loans, and bailouts cannot possibly keep everyone ‚Äúwhole‚Äù.  The government cannot and should not create untenable amounts of debt or print money in the volume needed.

Many banks and individuals are working out these very solutions on their own.  What is needed is a coordinated, coherent and effective policy across the board for all people.  We must stand united and demand a national economic freeze for both our health needs and economic needs.

Please share this letter, its ideas, or both across every platform you have and to every political and business leader you can.  We must create a movement that begins with the premise that all people will equally be kept whole throughout this crisis.  That means with healthcare and economic needs.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: In order to combat the economic fallout this pandemic is creating, we must push for a ""debt freeze"" to pause all debt, mortgage, lease, and rent payments. Without action, we will be hit hard by the economic mess COVID-19 is wreaking.",oregon,Protocols for Health and Economic Survival--Please Help!

1620,markarrot,1585071775,fo9dfy,Nan,"  Hello everyone... my name is Mark Duncan and I am running as Oregon's next Governor. Everyday, I am asked all sorts of questions about me, Oregon politics and my plan. People want to know who I am, why I am running as governor and how do I expect to win. I have decided to write this article in hopes of answering people's questions 
  The first question I am going to answer is, ""Who am I?"", My name is Mark Duncan and I am 42 years old. I was born in Lakeview Oregon. I have lived all over Oregon and I currently live in southern Oregon. After graduating from high school, I took a few years off of school to work as a farm hand on my grandfathers farm. Farming was hard work and very time consuming. I was awake at 3am and wouldn't be back in bed until 11pm. In 2001, I decided to go back to school. I enrolled at Klamath Community College. I majored in history, minored in law and I took psychology for fun. After four years, I transferred to University of Oregon and then I went on to law school. After college, I found it hard to get work so I began a fighting career. I began boxing, kickboxing and doing MMA. I fought over 75 times professionally and each time I represented Oregon. People all over the country got a little taste of just how tough Oregonians are. I retired from fighting in the beginning of 2017. It was then that I began training at risk and low income kids in my gym for free. I am now a husband, a father of four young girls and I am chasing my next dream... to become Oregon's next governor. 
  Now, why would I want to be governor of Oregon? For far too long, I have seen this state deteriorate with Liberals in charge. I have witnessed taxes continue to climb, industries close or leave state because of insane restrictions. I have seen our education levels and scores hit an all time low wile the homeless population hits an all time high. I have watched super majorities build sanctuary for undocumented while stepping on the rights of legal Oregonians. Enough is enough, it is time to redeem Oregon. 
  How am I going to win the election? I will start by uniting the silenced 29 counties in Oregon under lower taxes, less restrictions on our industries and smaller government. I will unite them with business owners, land owners, workers and everyone else that has lost something or will loose something because of Liberal politics. The final phase will be to go into Portland and to charge the young fight fans and fighters. I will pull the largest number of 18-35 year old voters Oregon has ever seen. We will win and we will redeem Oregon!",oregon,Redeem Oregon With Duncan For Governor
1621,WorkingInOR,1585071951,fo9ff4,Nan,"Dear friends and colleagues,

I am a long-time local small business owner, son, husband, and father. I am writing this to ask you for a moment of your time.

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID-19**

As many of you know first-hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit our community hard. There are already some local deaths recorded. Many more have already been hospitalized. Even more are probably already infected but showing no symptoms.

Realistically, we know concrete help is not coming any time soon. The fact of the matter is: there is currently a grave shortage of tests for the pathogen, there is no working vaccine, and there is no known cure. **We have been left to fend for ourselves.**

The general population is fearful and is avoiding common habits like eating out, walking around, and patronizing local businesses altogether. Furthermore, rampant racism has hit Asian-owned businesses particularly hard. It is no longer ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù. Without the foot traffic that we typically see, the vast majority of businesses will soon be forced to shutter permanently. **This is why we now need to stick together as a community.**

&amp;#x200B;

**SOLUTION**

I am proposing a bold solution: **NO MORE RENT COLLECTION** for the foreseeable future! **If we are forced to close our doors, we CANNOT be forced to pay for rent!** This is a simple concept to grasp.

There **MUST** be a moratorium on rent collecting effective immediately, lasting through the summer, and *possibly* until the end of the year if this virus continues to gain strength over the next few months.

**Will this solution affect YOU negatively?** No. I am proposing that the moratorium be placed exclusively on businesses that collect more than $50,000/month from rent alone. This will not affect businesses such as restaurants, cafes, bars, manufacturers, car garages, shops, spas, or salons. If you‚Äôve got an extra bedroom you‚Äôre renting out, this won‚Äôt affect you. This will only affect businesses that already collect an ungodly amount of money each month purely from rent and nothing else.

&amp;#x200B;

**ECONOMIC ARGUMENT**

**Is it fair practice to target these large businesses?** Yes. These businesses often have a crew of administrators that can do their work remotely and they WILL NOT see the negative effects of this pandemic.

These are large real estate companies that draw their income purely from owning land and property. These are businesses that don‚Äôt contribute anything to the economy. These are businesses that don‚Äôt produce any goods, don‚Äôt manufacture anything, and don‚Äôt service anybody. These are businesses that live off of our hard work simply due to the fact that they happen to own the ground we walk on.

Over many decades, these land owners have collected enough money to last them several lifetimes! **They do NOT need more money!** Do they want more money? Hell yeah! They‚Äôre always going to take and take and take. It is time for us to demand that they pause and take it easy on everyone else during this time of emergency.

**You may be told:** ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry! There‚Äôs money coming down the pipeline to help with your needs.‚Äù **DO NOT** take the bait! **DO NOT** be fooled by grants that temporarily give you a bit of money, as the money will simply just flow towards the landlords and we will be back right at square zero the following month. This false solution will only serve to continue enriching them at our expense!

**Imagine this scenario:** Even **IF** a $1,000/person check from the federal government does *magically* go through for us (let‚Äôs not hold our breath on that), without my proposal, those checks will immediately go directly to paying rent! **And WHERE does that leave us?** The landowners will continue to collect $50,000+/month just sitting on their asses in ADDITION to the the extra $1,000 they‚Äôve also just gotten from the government as well. **How does that sit with you?** While we‚Äôre left fending for ourselves and seeing where the wind takes us, the wealthiest continue to rake in money hand over fist! Money that they (*again*) DON‚ÄôT NEED! This is an **unacceptable** distribution of wealth!

If nothing is done, the majority of us will see a crater of red in our bottom lines within weeks. Let‚Äôs **NOT** pretend that the virus will disappear in a month (it won‚Äôt). Let‚Äôs **NOT** pretend that even if it does disappear tomorrow, the economy will bounce back immediately (it won‚Äôt). For the majority of us that survive this outbreak, business will most likely take an entire year to get back to pre-pandemic levels. For those of us that have lived through the 2008 recession, we know that the upcoming recession will be just as difficult, if not worse.

Many of us support our businesses using our personal checking accounts, our personal savings accounts, or our mortgages. If we fall behind on these payments, there exists no sympathy for us. Our properties will be seized by creditors and our livelihoods (possibly even our homes) will be stripped from us through no fault of our own. **Are any of us ready to live on the streets?** Many of us, despite our best attempts, still live paycheck-to-paycheck. **Many of us cannot afford 3 months of rent without income!** The homeless population is large enough as is, we cannot be adding to it.

&amp;#x200B;

**STEPS TO TAKE**

What you need to do: Contact your landlord and ask them politely to cancel your rent for the next few months. They will refuse, because that‚Äôs what they do, but it‚Äôs good to **get them on the record** anyway. Then, reach out to your **mayor**. Then, reach out to the **governor**, and the **secretary of state**. Then, reach out to your **representative in congress**. Then, reach out to our **senators**. Don‚Äôt forget to also reach out to the **news outlets** as well ‚Äì¬†make sure the newspapers are calling out the politicians and questioning them regarding what they‚Äôre doing. Make sure our stories are heard far and wide!\*

We all know, from painful experience, that landlords will never do the right thing when left to their own devices. Ever try to get them to fix anything ever? Their business models are premised upon making money at any cost. We cannot allow that to happen in this environment ‚Äì the cost to us and our families has become too great.

We, as local small business owners, are the backbone of the economy. If the majority of us are bankrupted because we have no income stream, **who will benefit?** It‚Äôs always the big guys. If you get evicted from your home, **who benefits?** The bank does! Tourism has been wiped off the map. If you get evicted from your food cart pod, **who benefits?** The lot owner does; they‚Äôll just build another hotel and wait until the good times come back!

To make sure we are serious, we must also demand audits of their business practices after the fact. Make sure someone competent is looking over their books to ensure they are indeed doing what they‚Äôve been told to do. Make sure that they won‚Äôt resolve to doubling our rates in a few months, or adding the missing money back in some form next year. **There needs to be a permanent cut. It is the only method of relief!**

One man yelling into the void means nothing. I alone can do nothing. But together, our voices will be loud. Please consider spending some time to contact your representatives. **Put their feet to the fire.** Tell them that this is a life-and-death emergency and that it cannot wait until 2 weeks from now. Ask your friends, family, and favorite customers to support you! Ask them to speak out on your behalf as well! Make our demands heard!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time. Please stay safe out there.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Many relevant contact information is compiled at the end of this post for your convenience.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*On an unrelated note, let‚Äôs get real and accept the fact that the time has come for Medicare for All. We needed it 30 years ago! We need  it today! And we will need it always! Use the urgency you have now to demand change from the legislature! If the White House and Congress in DC can‚Äôt get their shit together, we can still effect change here at home! Let‚Äôs work towards a future where all Oregonians can have the ability to visit the doctor without fear of losing their livelihoods! **We all deserve to be treated humanely! Together, we are strong!**

For a bit of background: my wife's grandmother has been slowly dying of liver cancer for the past several months and it looks like she is about to pass away this week. My wife had already visited her and said her goodbyes several weeks ago but her mother would like her to be there while she passes.  It is already decided that there will not be a funeral until after the virus passes so we wouldn't be missing that either. So far we both have been extremely vigilant about staying home and socially distancing ourselves for a few weeks now, and we both are taking the COVID19 very seriously. Obviously we are torn between being there while a family member passes, and the very obvious risks of going to two different airports, and the large family gathering that will take place as well. I know there are many things to consider, but I would appreciate any thoughts or advice others may have on this situation as we are both pretty split over what to do.",oregon,Stay-At-Home Order Dilemma
1624,crazed_n_blazed,1585074753,foac2l,Nan,"Hello everyone! :)
Please know this was written with love, not anger.

I‚Äôm currently living in an area full of vacation rentals on the Oregon Coast. We‚Äôve been coast residents for years but didn‚Äôt move to this specific neighborhood until December. So not too long but before this virus was a threat.

As of Saturday the pretty much 2 blocks around me, littered with vacation rentals, all filled up. Big families and large groups. For me this is really scary, I have a bad heart due to congenital heart disease and a weak immune system so if I was to catch this, well to put it bluntly, I‚Äôd be fucked.

A lot of the people staying out here are from Portland and Washington. They‚Äôre shopping at our small stores, walking in groups down the streets and crowding the parking lots. Beach entrances are busy enough that people are passing shoulder to shoulder up and down the staircases or pathways. I think because there‚Äôs no KNOWN cases out here they feel it‚Äôs safe to not follow guidelines. 

I‚Äôm not going out, I‚Äôm not going to risk it, but my live in partner is required to go to work. Thankfully he‚Äôs not exposed to public. However, he does have to go to the same stores as the tourists to get us groceries/supplies/meds. So as careful as he is, tourists are everywhere. 

Truth is..
There‚Äôs many asymptomatic carriers who don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre spreading it. There‚Äôs also entitled people that jdgaf.
Our hospitals are small, few and far between. Our communities mostly consist of the elderIy. We don‚Äôt have enough resources for even our own people let alone extra people. Our stores aren‚Äôt stocked as often or as much as the bigger cities. The level of quality healthcare just isn‚Äôt as available out here and what we do have will be used up by panicked travelers.

While I‚Äôm of course worried for our small businesses that rely on tourism, if we don‚Äôt stop the spread early they could be closed for months not just weeks. Worst case we watch our small business owners and workers get sick and possibly pass. These are our neighbors, our friends and some of our family.

So my request... Is it really too much to ask for people to stay within their own counties/communities? I understand wanting to get out of the house and go for a walk or a hike. Maybe could you explore locally? So much of Oregon is beautiful and worth appreciating not only the coast.

Please be considerate to our small communities.
Much love to everyone!!",oregon,"Hate me if you want but at least hear me out. If you‚Äôre a tourist on the coast, PLEASE, go home for now."

Any information that I'm providing here is second-hand information from him and my mother-in-law, and I do not want to provide any further information that could risk identifying him. I apologize if you feel that this discredits the information, but it's all I have at this point.

Two weeks ago, he stayed home with a 102-103 degree fever, a cough, and a sore throat. He went to a hospital and was first tested for the flu, but the test came back negative, so the hospital decided to administer a COVID-19 test.

The test was sent off to the CDC for verification, and three days later, my FIL was informed that there was something wrong with his test, so he was asked to come back to the hospital to get re-tested. This was at the beginning of last week.

Today, he called down to the hospital to see if they had received the results, and now they are refusing to tell him where his test is, what stage of testing it's in, and they're also refusing to provide him with a work release.

I don't want to fuel conspiracy theories, but if this doesn't present itself as a red flag to you, I don't know what to say. The first concern was the hospital improperly administering a test, causing the loss of a test when they are supposedly scarce. The second is that it seems (emphasis on ""seems"" because I can't possibly provide proof at this time) as though the State of Oregon is doing everything in their power to hide the numbers of confirmed cases.

We don't know what to do at this point...

We are spending as much time sanitizing as possible, but that pen attached to my register and the card machine buttons can't get wiped down after every single person when you have a never ending line.

If you have a pen in your pocket, you can sign for yourself without having to touch anything else AND you have a dialing wand for pushing those buttons. The eraser end of a pencil works best for buttons but an unclicked pen or one with a flat end works well also. Gloves of course are ideal but as we all know are hard to come by and should probably all be diverted to hospitals and nursing homes anyway seeing as how people keep stealing them. I mean WTF?!? Who fucking steals from a nursing home? 

My customers think I am more essential than I do, I want to stay open because I love this job, I am grateful to have it, and I really need it. I know folks need us too but this isn't food or medicine, it is boredom control. There are those who will literally die if we close and I relate to that a little closer than I would like too. It is a messy situation no matter how you look at it. We have been packed and selling out of stock for a week straight. We are not a safe space, but we have been deemed essential, so here we are.

I have organized my speech patterns so that I do not have to touch your payment card or id unless absolutely necessary, but the rest is up to you. I or one of my associates has touched every single bottle, box, and can in this place, there is no helping that. If you are one of those people who thinks we are a necessity then help us, help you, help us, stay open. Don't come in if you are sick or have been exposed. Don't touch ANYTHING you don't intend to buy. Stop fiddling with the impulse purchases at the counter, I know they are colorful and enticing and you want to see what other flavors are available, but they are a center for contamination because people won't stop touching them. Don't lean on or touch the counter unless you have too. Do not put your personal belongings, purse, or reusable shopping bag on the counter either. We don't know where they or you have been and you don't know whose stuff was there last or where they have been. I have worked in hospitality most of my life, cross contamination happens with every single touch. If you don't police yourself, you will endanger me, my family, the safety and the sanity of yourself and your whole town.

Employment Department Staff have been deemed essential staff and are required to report to work and must receive management approval prior to using leave.

Employment Department staff have not been provided tissues, Clorox wipes, hand sanitizer or promised protection.  They will not provide masks because it is a liability to them they said. 

Staff members are coming to work coughing hard and clearly sick. They are not being sent home. Staff members are coming to sick after visiting people in quarantine. Yes, you read that right. They visited someone in quarantine and are so selfish they came and exposed hundreds of people at work. They were not sent home because they were not showing symptoms. 

The cleaning staff is using the same dirty rags they used on multiple other buildings to ‚Äúclean‚Äù the common areas. They are likely bringing in more contagions than they are removing. People are coughing over cube walls. It‚Äôs not ok. 

Are your managers completely unfamiliar with how this illness spreads or do you guys just not care about your employees, their family and the rest of the community? Isabel Joslen, the Tax Director is admittedly against telecommuting and was unwilling to expand or be flexible more than 100% required. 

The entire staff wants to help get Oregonian‚Äôs the benefits they desperately need. We should not have to risk our lives to do our job. We should not have to risk our lives when the technology is available to work from home.

Kate Brown's decision to go along with lifting the self-serve bans have been utterly ridiculous in my not so humble opinion.   
I like to do a bit of a social experiment because I have two jobs. One job is a gas station attendant. The second job is a video editor for a local company here in Eugene. When I tell a stranger I'm a gas station attendant, I'm met with an ""I'm sorry for your fall to rock bottom"" look. However, when I tell someone I'm responsible for video you see on the tv, out of thin air I become a respectable human being; much to their shock. A gas station attendant is not a pity job for people with room temperature IQs who would otherwise be unemployable. It's a job like anything else. Not the highest paid one mind you, but what else can you do when college doesn't send you straight to your career, despite them saying that magic piece of paper is supposed to do so? I don't know the answer, because the six figure workers that come to the gas station won't tell me when I ask. I'm not worth their time... until now. I'm going to go ahead and provide some advice, tips, help, and encouragement for you in these hard times.

1. 48 STATES HAVE SELF-SERVE LAWS - and yet the world is still in tact, and a nuclear winter has been avoided.

2. STATION ATTENDANTS WILL NOT LOSE THEIR JOBS - If you've ever been to a neighboring state with self-serve laws, and we are surrounded as Oregon is one of TWO states left with these arbitrary regulations, the gas stations are well staffed. There will not be job loss unseen since The Great Depression. Someone still has to be there to take your money. Self-serve doesn't mean free gas.

3. IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE - Why would you put your trust in a room temp IQ idiot to pump your gas if it's so unsafe? Also, I can tell you from inside the dirty biz, there are more safety mechanisms in a gas station than your car. The most important thing being, THE GAS IMMEDIATELY STOPS PUMPING IF ANY MAJOR ERROR OCCURS. Gas being pumped is not made any safer because someone else is doing it for you. You are more familiar with your car than an attendant. The gas is NOT drinkable. I know it comes out like soda.

4. OLD PEOPLE/DISABLED PEOPLE WILL NOT BE LEFT BEHIND - Other than taking your money, station attendants in self-serve states must be at the station for this exact reason. The rule is you honk your horn, explain you cannot physically (not I don't want to) pump your own gas, and the worker will then pump your gas. Same thing would happen in the (glorious) world you pump your own gas in Oregon. Also, there are areas of the station which are full service or attendant pumped gas. Go there. My grandmother from Washington would go to those stations because she didn't want to pump her own gas. A perfectly fair thing to do, but you tip those attendants. 

5. IT'S NOT HARD/YOU CAN LEARN IT IN THREE SECONDS - I've heard too many times ""No one knows how to pump our own gas in Oregon"", ""We didn't grow up this way"", or ""How are we going to learn?"", and it makes me sad for the collective intelligence and intestinal fortitude of the great state of Oregon. While I can translate those phrases to ""I'm lazy and it's convenient to have someone else do it"", this is where Papa Sean's Advice corner comes into play. When pumping your own gas here's the break down.  
PAYING IN CASH:  
\- GO INSIDE STORE, TELL THE ATTENDANT HOW MUCH YOU NEED IN GAS.  
\- PAY ATTENDANT YOUR CASH.  
\- RETURN TO YOUR CAR  
\- PULL THE NOZZLE OUT  
\- PRESS THE GRADE BUTTON (87,89,92, or Diesel)  
\- PUMP GAS

PAYING WITH CARD:  
\- SWIPE YOUR CARD  
\- FOLLOW PROMPTS ON SCREEN  
\- PRESS THE GRADE BUTTON  
\- PUMP YOUR GAS

I'm sure you'll find this is much quicker than you would think. You don't have to wait for an attendant to run his ass your way after ten cars. One final thing on the ""Too hard"" point. If it's sooooo hard for someone to pump gas, then how do we mongoloid station attendants figure it out? If we can do it, your brilliant butts can pull it off. If pumping your own gas becomes too difficult of a Rubik's cube, then I strongly question how you got your $60,000/year job. Frankly, I think the law should be I get YOUR job if that's the case. Was it too hard to get trained for that job?

The quarantine is non-existent to me. Working two jobs at six days a week, I've had a grand total whopping three days off in the month of March. It's been business as usual the whole time. I have a co-worker at the gas station who works six days a week at the station. This outbreak has been a time to think about other people. I know station attendants aren't ""people"" per se, but they're humanoid creatures you can communicate with, and they are exposed to your dirty debit cards and cash. They don't always get the breaks you get in an office. They don't have the luxury of being safe from an outbreak that shut the rest of the world down. Gas station owners wanted the lift on the ban for the GAS ATTENDANTS to get a break. This isn't about you, and if making the sacrifice for a couple weeks to help those who need it is too difficult for you to handle, then honestly I question your character.",oregon,Pumping your own gas from a gas attendant

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

1836,NewEnglandHappierMan,1585725275,fsuu9n,Nan,"Hey Vsauce, Michael here, and skeletons are scary and spooky, but you know what else is? Blacks. 

According to the U.S Justice Department, in 2006, 32,443 women of Caucasian origin were raped by men of African origin. That same year, the number of African American women raped by Caucasian men.. was.. zero. 

In fact, 90% of all interracial crimes in the U.S. are committed by blacks... against whites.. So what if all blacks were to... suddenly... disappear from the U.S.? Murder would go down 49.7 percent, welfare recipients would go down 40 percent, SAT scores would go up about 100 points, the average IQ would go up 7 points, and AIDS victims would go down a staggering... 67... percent. Significant changes for race that only makes up 13% of the population. 

In biology, races are distinct genetically divergent populations ""within the same species"", with relatively small morphological and genetic.. differences. Populations can be described as ecological races if they arise from adaptation to different local habitats or geographic races when they are geographically isolated. However, if sufficiently different, two or more races can be identified as... sub... species. So how long do two races have to be isolated from one another before they're considered separate species? Earlier this year, Archaeologists found artefacts in a cave on Western Australia's Barrow Island dating back more than 50,000 years, making it Australia's earliest known site of human occupation. In contrast, the domestication of the dog began just 15,000... years... ago. This distance, some several thousand miles between the mainlands of Australia and Asia also caused another kind of distance. Genetic... distance. 

Genetic distance is a measure of the genetic divergence between species or between populations within a species. Dogs and wolves have been found to have a shorter genetic distance between each other than Negroids and non-Negroids. The distance between Eurasians and Africans being even larger than Homo Sapiens and Homo... Erectus. Well, it kinda makes sense. I mean, can two races with diverging skin tones, eye colors, behavioral patterns, intellectual and athletic capabilities even be considered the same subspecies? Is it even a question? Is it even a question you're... allowed to... ask? In October 2007, geneticist James Watson, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and the familiar double-helix model we all had to leam in High School, was lambasted by the scientific community for a response he gave in an interview regarding the divergence of intellect between geographically isolated populations. ""There is no fim reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically,"" James wrote. ""Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so"". 

The response resulted with a suspension of Watson's administrative responsibilities and was forced to... cancel.. his book tour. And tragically, in 2014, Mr Watson auctioned his Nobel Prize medal he won in 1962, stating that ""no-one really wants to admit I exist"". Harsh. 

But people tend to react this way to ideas that go against their own personal world view and... cognitive.. biases. Confirmation bias. It's the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one's. own. preconceptions. This effect, stronger for emotionally charged issues, warps your interpretation of data in a way that keeps you from... being... wrong. There is something fundamental in our minds that makes us hesitant to question ideas that we've... already come to a conclusion to. We all do it. But who could blame us? That's just part of being a member of the human... species. 

And as always, around blacks, never relax.",oregon,Oregon facts

So my boyfriend and I live in an apartment with a friend, and she is the only one of us that's actually on the lease. (the other person named on the lease is our her mom, who doesn't actually live here)  It has been this way since all three of us moved in to this place together at the end of 2017. My BF and I pay 2/3rds of rent, utilities, all other bills, and have done so for nearly 2 years now, it's all in our roommates name and we pay her cash. 

I have bad credit, my BF has no credit and we both have no proper rental history, so our friend didn't even want to try applying with us on the lease when we were looking for places in 2017, whatevs we just needed a place to live and had no other options at the time. Regardless, the landlord has no idea we live here and thinks it's our friend and her mother that live here. 

Now in the last 2 weeks I've lost my job, my car has broken down, I've applied for unemployment and am still waiting for that to be processed, waiting for the stimulus check, trying to sell off things that I can, etc etc, and I am nowhere near close to the amount I need for rent.  

My boyfriend has said that our roommate has hinted in the past that 'the second we can't pay rent, she's gonna kick us out and move her mom in for real'... 

Basically, my question is this, what are our rights here? Do we even have any since we're not on the lease? Any other advice at all? I'm going to have to talk with her any day now, she's gonna come asking for rent money and I'll have nothing to show for it essentially. Is she then legally able to throw us out immediately? I'm just a little worried at the moment, about a lot of things but especially this. I'm doing all I can to get a job and get unemployment, We've applied at so many grocery stores and fast food joints, but yet to receive any callbacks. We have no transportation except a bicycle now.

1873,Booji-Boy,1585858404,fttl9m,Nan,"An open letter to a friend- inspired by their post on the current state of McMenamin's.

I debated for a minute here on writing this, because I know the way that McMenamin's treats its musicians is really good. I've seen that firsthand, and wouldn't know you and several other great people from the music community if not for my former gig managing at XXXXX.

. Getting to meet, and experiencing the creative world and personalities of others was, and remains the highest point and greatest privilege I took from the job.

While there are some amazing people within the organization, the amount of abuses perpetuated against the day to day workers are unacceptable. I should know, I'm complicit in them, and perpetuated them against my coworkers. 

I personally worked an extra two to three hours for free nearly every single day over my four years, first as a cook, then as Assistant Manager, so as to not get in trouble or fired for not making the impossible labor goals set by the company. This is the same at nearly every property. I have a titanium hip partly in cause from lifting beer kegs chest high by myself, despite policy preventing doing so. It was expected of us. Again, we would get in trouble if there were empty taps. I have widespread joint damage from 10-12 hour shifts without any break because that's what business demanded. 

Business also demanded a sign in sign out sheet for these fictitious breaks. Many nights as we locked up at three in the morning after clocking out at midnight, we would laugh as we wrote on the sheet. We would claim our breaks at the height of the biggest rushes, figuring the ludicrous thought of multiple staff taking 30 minute lunch breaks simultaneously at 6:30 PM would at least let the higher ups know that we were onto their shit. 

I helped perpetuate this and I have to share in the responsibility for abuses against the staff, as I was there to manage them. I watched as secret shoppers rightfully failed my hardest working coworkers and myself for not hitting the eight points of service at every table. It's difficult to do so when you have between eight tables, or thirty six- as I had on shifts that demanded I work solo so as to appease those labor gods. 

I watched the best get burnt out, fired for technicalities, while the worst, knowing the right things to say in front of the right people, or through backstabbing their way through the corporate waters rose to the top. 

I don't feel any sorrow for the McMenamin brothers, as they represent an uglier America to me that is insidious through simply trying so hard to not appear to be. They smile and point to pretty paintings, or scenic properties, hoist that Hammerhead and smile big, while weaving a web of distraction to the public so that they don't bother looking ""behind the curtain."" Hundreds of dancing revelers, hands in the air at Edgefield, hundreds of workers exploited for their labors, denied basic worker protections and rights. 

I have seen medically fragile coworkers have their hours reduced by two per week so that they do not qualify for the minimum hours worked to receive health benefits at the end of the quarter. I have seen employees (and have personally) work with 103 degree fevers, barely able to function, highly contagious, because the company does not provide sick days and operates from a ""cover it, show up for it, or lose your job"" mentality. 

When I lost my job they fought my unemployment benefits for THREE MONTHS. The amount they spent on legal representation dwarfed what they would have had to pay on my unemployment. Over the course of three telephone hearings, they tried and failed to paint me as an incompetent employee, sacrificing the skin of my ass to save their own, despite the fact that I worked Tuesday through Saturday nights for years, getting rocked time and again due to their understaffing, and still managed to cultivate great relationships with employees, customers, and musicians. I grieved the loss of my job, but soon I realized that I didn't love or miss my job, rather I was experiencing a strange version of Stockholm syndrome and the further away from it I got, the more bizarre and unacceptable it felt.

You hear about the ""Family"" of McMenamin's employees, but I wouldn't do any of these things to my daughter, or my mother, or my brother. If anyone did, I would encourage them to either quit or lawyer up. 

I hope that McMenamin's takes a hard hit, shutters many of their chain, and looks back to the time where the people made the pubs, and things weren't so cut throat. I want to see them fail their way to success of a different kind, the kind they once knew, because the vision they once had grew sick and distorted, and in the end, we all reap what we sow. In a post-Corona world, we're going to hopefully see a return to values, and not of the stock kind.

Brown giving/loaing 140 respirators to NY. There were similar threads here in r/oregon. [My response to the story very critical of the governor as to the motivations behind the aid](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusOregon/comments/fuvlbw/oregon_gov_kate_brown_givesloans_140_ventilators/fmfarux/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Downvotes were to be expected, and r/oregon gave me plenty. However, in addition to downvotes r/CoronavirusOregon gave me a permanent ban. 

After no warning and 3 attempts to find out why I was banned, the reason given was for 'Threatening, harassing, or inciting violence'. [My speech was purely political and did not threaten, harass, or incite violence.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusOregon/comments/fuvlbw/oregon_gov_kate_brown_givesloans_140_ventilators/fmfarux?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) You may disagree with me, but we should all agree that political censorship has no place in the midst of a crisis.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza,
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?
