Apparently I harshed some serious mellow, by a reference to a particular group that support highway encampments of homeless so I removed that. However most reasonable people are not 'all in' on a particular issue, allowing for some nuance in their beliefs or politics that might support a cause but with caveats. People with extreme all-or-nothing beliefs tend to have extreme problems. I like to think most people who support resourcing the homeless with their own shelter and dignity are also sane and **sober** enough to see significant problems emerging that might require attention and enforcement of public safety guidelines for the good of everyone including homeless.",Austin,What's going on with the massive homeless tent encampments on the south side of east bound Ben White before I35 interchange?

The letter of intent to buy the property was from Jay Paul Company, a powerhouse commercial real estate developer in the San Francisco Bay Area. Silicon Valley Business Journal named the company its Developer of the Year in 2018.  While the deal never materialized, it speaks to the huge sums of money being aimed at downtown Austin property. The land comprises less than a full square acre and was most recently valued by Travis Central Appraisal District for tax purposes at a little over $16.5 million....""",Austin,Silicon Valley real estate magnate offered World Class $60M for sub-1 acre land downtown Austin property

My girlfriend and I moved to Austin from Boston \~a year ago, and ever since have been trying to find good doctors here. Obviously, reviews on Google only tell you about everything wrong with particular practices. Honestly, I'm yet to have a single decent experience. I've had everything from rude staff to having entire offices ghosting me after taking my money. I moved my company here, so plan on sticking around. I was hoping to go somewhere more regularly then a walk in clinic if I plan to spend a large portion of my life here. 

With that said, I was wondering if any of you living South have had any luck at all finding a knowledgable doctor that runs a good practice of their own. I really don't want to rely on ARC, considering how horrible everyone makes them out to be. Any male and female physician recommendations are greatly appreciated! I know my girlfriend would like to have a female primary care physician, but I don't mind either for myself. I just want to see someone who knows their stuff!

**October**

The unemployment rate remained flat at 2.6% in October. 10,600 positions were added, but 10,100 workers entering the labor force balanced out the unemployment rate. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 12,900. No individual sector saw significant employment changes.


**November** (preliminary)

The unemployment rate fell to 2.5% in November. 4,300 positions were added, and only 4,300 workers entered the labor force so the unemployment rate decrease must be some kind of rounding error. The overall Nonfarm Payrolls figure did not change significantly. No individual sector saw significant employment changes.

Recently, a man who beat 3 people mercilessly and put one man in the hospital only served 2 weeks (after sentencing) in jail. A friend of mine's coworker was attacked with a rock outside their work. A woman was attacked with a rock in her car. Attack after attack after attack is met with a simple Class A misdemeanor.

I just heard that Leaf (the build-your-own salad joint off 6th street) closed days before Christmas. Life happens, businesses close - however the owner of Leaf had clearly planned the closing to coincide with other year-end events, and only gave her employees (some of whom had worked for her for several years) a few days notice before Christmas. 

No severance or arrangement to get them through the rest of the year, or suggestions like ‘I talked to my buddy who’s opening a new restaurant and put in a word for anyone who wants to go there’ - just “BYE!”

Before anyone says it first, yes Texas is a Right to Work state. Of course it isn’t the responsibility of owner/operators to disclose every detail to their staff, but isn’t the decent thing to do to tell employees to start looking for new jobs at least?

 I live in West Campus and (used to) drive a Yamaha r3 motorcycle. Unfortunately, it was stolen this past Friday. I need your help to see if I can find an archive of traffic camera data. 

The main purpose of this post isn't to have you keep an eye out for it (although that would be nice) but if you could help me potentially catch the thief via local traffic cameras. Just to be clear: I've already filed a police report, had cameras looked at by nearby apartment complexes etc. Here's what I already know form the sorority camera on the corner: The thief stole my motorcycle putting it into the back of a dark grey Nissan Titan pickup truck between 5:50 and 6:17, leaving at 6:17. 

I searched IP and traffic cameras nearby, some of which I’m sure have a clear shot of the truck passing by which can help by narrowing down A) direction of travel and B) potentially identifying distinct features and plates. Unfortunately, these are only live feeds from what I can see but I have a hunch there’s an archive somewhere, especially considering the traffic cameras are just screenshots, not live video. 

Another disclaimer: I’m not on some vigilante witch hunt, just haven’t been assigned a detective yet (it’s been 4 days) and going to pass all this info forward to law enforcement as soon as I can. If you see a black 2017 R3 with red accents in the back of a truck, let me know!

446,446,LegalBegQuestion,1578424177,elg27y,Nan,"OK all, I took a deep dive into solar panel installation companies and costs, after reading a post by u/bboarder4 around 7 months ago.  I interviewed 3 different solar installers, had them submit proposals and reviewed their estimates, and went ahead with installation back around the end of October. I wanted to share everything I learned, and answer questions, because it was really helpful when that was done for me.

I'm not going to name the specific company I went with here, but if you are interested DM me and Ill give you the contact info.

**Planning**

2 of the 3 companies came out to the house, and offered the basic sales pitch on site. They went over how the panels work, what to expect regarding production and how the billing offset works, as well as explained the financing options. They also took pictures and advised a full proposal would be created and sent out within a few days.

The 3rd company offered to review the other proposal info and get me prices to compare. Not really ideal, but I definitely wanted more numbers to compare so I rolled with it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Design**

Below is a rendering of our hose w the panels. For clarify sake, its a two story, 2090sq/ft new build in NE Austin. The 1st and 3rd company claimed they could only mount panels in the center and outside the eves, which would generate about 65% of our avg consumption. I was pushing for closer to 90-100%, as long as cost was within reason. The 2nd company, after some back and forth with the cost, offered this solution; they could mount panels on the back side of the house, on risers. They are visible from the back yard, and many homeowners dont like the look, but it was the only way to increase production. *I was, and am still fine with it.* 

&amp;#x200B;

[Design Render 1](https://preview.redd.it/l6fm8dba3e941.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b93d4d0e0d98fbb7cbe5cd386aa3f9d884c4b1e4)

[Design Render w Annual Production info](https://preview.redd.it/4zt4cak54e941.png?width=574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe4762f752d93d9eb2071064057f68a1d701b1b6)

There are a couple of vent pipes and things coming out of our roof, so it did make for a problem with centering the panels. At first I was hoping for a clean look, but TBH it doesn't matter. I hardly even notice them up there at this point.

**Decision**

So company #1 had actually cold called/knocked doors in the neighborhood. The appointment setter had come by the day we moved in and went through a quick rundown and we agreed to meet their sales guy. He came by a few weeks later when things settled down, but honestly just seemed like he was phoning it in. During the in-person meeting the salesman inflated the possible production numbers, while underestimating our would-be consumption. The biggest problem I had, was we had only been in the home for a month, in a brand new neighborhood, and there were no prior bills to share and compare. He was guessing based on the sq/ft alone. He had claimed our roof would not have been able to generate more than 30-40% of our needs. 

Company #2 is the company that had been recommended by u/BBoarder4, and was very easy to work with. Their salesman came by my office for the first meeting, had requested some info upfront in order to put together a first look estimate, and offered to meet at our home again a few days later to review w my SO. I was impressed by how relaxed of a sales pitch it was. He answered questions about average installation issues, timeline, possible disruptions and city of Austin issues. He did give us some examples of similar homes and their production, but wanted to have an engineer come out and measure the roof etc. to share a true and accurate estimate. This was a much more professional process IMO. He revised the design a few times based on further discussions as we moved through the process. Super easy to work with, convenient communication, and once installation began he was available to discuss any concerns.

Company #3 reviewed the other proposals and then shared a vague email that explained they could meet any price. In an effort to be transparent I shared everything with each company.   
 Company #3 did not have anything to say about system size. They wanted us to make that decision. I felt uncomfortable moving forward without a professional assessment and reasoning behind it. 

Company #2 explained that Co#1 was under-sizing our system in order to decrease costs, which would actually have made us ineligible for the CoA rebate program. I confirmed this w CoA, and then asked Co#1 about it- they claimed I was wrong and CO#2 was wrong as well. After some back and forth I decided that the cost difference was an important factor, but I would rather be sure that we would receive the rebates, and that we could come as close to 100% production as possible.

Co#1 proposed this-

[Small System Design](https://preview.redd.it/8z85cch96e941.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be22c5c3349e39c335c95e907d1f5f254093703b)

They explained a 2.24 Kw system was all we needed, and all we could fit on the roof. They explained it would generate around 35% of our needs. This was disappointing and their costs were much higher than I would have expected for this little production. Their cost was around $12500 but again they pushed that we would be eligible for the CoA rebate (which they inflated, and we were not), and said our cost would be around $6k. Again I confirmed w CoA, and declined their proposal.

&amp;#x200B;

Company #2's proposal included the images toward the top of the post. They were significantly more expensive, but proposed a 6.82Kw system. They explained it would cover between 85-89% of our estimated needs. Gross system cost was around $23k- CoA rebate was $3500, and CO#2 estimated around $6k federal tax credit. Net cost comes to just over $14k.

&amp;#x200B;

\*The rebates and tax credits will be getting smaller beyond 2020. If this is something you're looking into, get started asap.

* 1st was the panels on the roof, which started October 24th, 2019. I was advised 1-2 days for install, but we had some rain and bad winds, so they were delayed a bit. The roof work was completed by Oct 28th. 
* 2nd came the panel and electrical connection, which was completed around the same time and took a few hours at most.
* 3rd was the most difficult part- the City of Austin/Austin Energy has to come out and inspect the system twice, and then approve connecting the house. This took FOREVER. the CoA was really back logged, and then something was missed in the paperwork for AE. They reached out trying to deny the application and have us start all over, but Co#2 stepped in and got it corrected. 
* Everything was turned on and we began generating on 12/18. In Dec we produced *238.61 kWh*, and so far, 7 days into Jan were already at *143.77 kWh*. 

Counting from my first meeting w Co#2, the whole process took about 6 months. I started working on proposals in February of 2019 though, but I dont think its fair to blame anyone but myself for the first half of the year's delay- I was still on the fence about the whole thing for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall**

Im a huge fan of Solar Power, and I'm really glad we went ahead with it. It was definilty a bit more expensive than we had originally planned on spending, but we are hopeful (with good reason), that it will be a worthwhile investment. To date the system has only generated around $40 worth of energy credit for us, but with the cloudy/rainy weather Austin has had over the last 2 months, I still think we're going to be glad we did it. 

Things to consider, 

* our house is a brand new, purpose built to be energy efficient. This may impact your RoI if you live in an older home. 
* We have no trees near the home, nor any shade blocking the panels, so in the summer I expect to be at max generation every day. 
* The company estimated an 11.50% return. where we would be cash positive around year 17. (We went with the 20 year loan, for the lower payment but obviously plan to pay off the system ASAP) Hopefully we can update the math in a few months and do better than their estimates.
* If we overproduce, we are given credit toward the following bills from AE - one thing to understand is you will never see any money from AE or the city. The credits stay with the account/home. You will not get a check at any point. The goal is to decrease your bill and allow the cost of the panels/installation to replace the bill until you are generating free energy.

**FINAL THOUGHT**

If you plan on staying in your home 7-10 years, now is the time to get on the solar powered train. Take all the rebates and tax credits you can get, because they are only going to get smaller. All the Dave Ramsey types will say pay upfront or pay the system off ASAP if you can, but keep in mind if you sell the home, in most cases you have to pay the loan in full before you walk away. This may not be the case with every loan/installation. We're really happy with the company we chose and the system as its designed. The warranty is great, and the app is viewed on a cell phone, so if there are issues you know right away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im going to update this post in a few months with more of the financial info once we can compare to last years numbers without the panels.

&amp;#x200B;

Please feel free to DM any questions or if you'd like info on the companies I worked with, id be happy to share.

&amp;#x200B;

We have generated the equivalent of planting nearly 15 trees and the system has only been on for about 3 weeks.

The short version of the story is that it’s about a man giving a woman a ride home and he gave her his jacket because it was cold outside. He dropped the woman off at her house on Spicewood Springs and then went to his home. The next day, he went to the house he dropped the girl off at and knocked on the door, asking for his jacket back. The lady at the house told him the girl had been dead for 12 years and that she was buried at a cemetery on Spicewood Springs. The man went to the cemetery and found his jacket hanging on a grave marker.",Austin,Spicewood Springs Rd Ghost

Are there any publicly available purpose built storm shelters in Austin?   

I know of one place in a parking garage that would be pretty much tornado proof, but I don't have access any more.   In general, I wouldn't consider parking garages tornado proof, but this one has a spot that was pretty much 100% enclosed.  Are there any parking garages with underground sections?   Any multistory buildings with publicly accessible basements?  

The bottom of a concrete stairwell in a parking garage or a big building might be pretty good.   

The walk in freezer at some grocery store might be a possibility, but a lot of those have glass doors that probably make them problematic.  

A central area in a large multistory building has some possibility, but if they're an open space layout with glass windows, they might be worse.  Also, most of those aren't that publicly accessible.

Last night I went to the HEB on Lakeline, I grabbed the stuff I wanted to buy, went through the self checkout, paid, waited for my receipt grabbed it and threw it away in the trash cans that they have there for people who want to trash their receipt. As I was leaving a woman stopped me and asked to see my receipt. I said I trashed it but she was more than welcome to go fish it out or confirm it however she feels fit but she started getting really close to me and asking for me to produce the receipt I said again that it was in the trash can and I’d wait for her to go grab it. She didn’t. So I tried to leave but she kept getting in front of me, then started using the walkie-talkie telling someone I was trying to leave the store with stuff I hadn’t paid for. By this point I was boiling! I went and grabbed the receipt myself and showed it to her but she still would not let me leave! Wtf?! People were staring at me like I was a criminal and everything! It was so embarrassing. The reason why I feel as though I was profile is because tight before she asked me for my receipt she let many people walk right by and didn’t ask them for anything. I’m a Hispanic male with tattoos but I’m a working class dude. I pay for everything that I own and I’m not a criminal and she really made me feel like one. 

Needless to say I was pissed! I started talking loudly after she wouldn’t let me leave and I cussed a few times because my this point it was turning into something that never had to be! I felt like she was making a show out of it! People stopped and started asking her IF SHE WAS OKAY? And one man and I ended up getting into an argument too! For what?! I paid for everything!!

Mind you, producing a receipt when asked is not necessarily legal and most certainly not illegal to refuse to show them your receipt. But I do want to make this clear, I wasn’t being uncooperative, I just felt as though if she wanted the receipt that bad then she could go get it herself. It’s not my fault Austin doesn’t provide bags and people might look like they’re stealing (depending on how you look I guess) 

Anyway this sucks because I go there every day. Every day. It part of my daily routine.

I'm moving to Austin this summer, and I'm really excited! 

But, I was wondering if someone could tell me more about ""cedar fever."" I tried to do some research, but I thought it would be more beneficial to ask the locals. 

1. If I have never had ""regular"" allergies, does that mean my chances of being affected by this goes down?
2. Can you prevent it by wearing a face mask? (Like they wear in Asia)
3. Are most people who live in Austin affected by this or only some?

Thank you very much!!! :)",Austin,Cedar Fever?

1) How is Austin Maker Faire? I know there's the ATX Hackerspace which is 45 minutes away from the house but I intend on a membership once I can figure out the best method of getting there once a week. 

2) What cosplay/convention events are in Austin and when do they occur? I'm very big on cosplay and love cosplaying, so if there's anything like Comic Con or MegaCon in Austin, I will be incredibly happy. What about furry conventions? 

3) Are there any arcades that have Tetris? This is an oddly specific question, but it's important to me. Tetris is very important to me. 

4) Where are the best places for me to go talk to EDM artists (not just watch and listen, I wanna talk to them, as I'm a very small producer myself)? Especially indie artists who aren't that big and would love to have an in depth conversation to me about how they produce music and show me their equipment. 

5) What are the must-dos in Austin? I've already seen the river bats when I visited, but I want to know what else I can do there. 

6) What's the best way to have fun for under $20 within 10-15 miles of my home? 20-30 miles?

7) Are there any retro computing groups in Austin? I'm a huge fan of old tech, especially Commodore stuff, and would love to talk to people who feel the same way. Even if it's a store that specializes in retro tech, because that way I'll be able to get my own Commodore 64 working again. 

8) When are the Pride parades? I'm sure Austin has them, but I'm wondering if they have any outside of Pride month. Where are the Pride parades held? Are they generally accepting of non-binary MOGAI people? .

9) What are some things I *have* to know about Austin law-wise, especially if they differ from Florida? I know that in Orlando, you can put on a fireworks display to rival Disney, but in Austin you can't have anything more than sparklers.

10) Fireworks are a big tradition for my family, so if we can't do fireworks, where can I go to watch professional fireworks displays on New Year's and July 4? 

11) What sort of nerdy stuff goes on in Austin? 

12) What can you tell me about Austin Community College and UT that I can look forwards to? At UF, we had a Friday nightly event called Gator Nights which was free with your UFID. There would be themed performances, crafts, movies, and events that would go on during it. Is there anything like that at UT? 

13) What sort of clubs related to programming, space, gaming, and general nerd/geek stuff are at UT? 

14) Is there a 3D printing Meetup in Austin anywhere? 

15) Is there anything else I should know?

Thank you so much for your help!",Austin,"Moving To Austin, How's the Nerd Life? What should I know? How is ACC/UT?"

—————————

DETAILS:

We live in North Austin near the Domain, but want to take her out anywhere that’s awesome in Austin!

We’ll have about 4 hours on Friday (2-6) after picking her up from the airport. Then we’ll take her to dinner and relax at home for the night. 

Saturday we’ll have about 9 hours (12-9), but some of that will be taken up by our photo session. We’ll want to treat her to lunch and dinner that day as well. The photo session will be around 4 at either Mt. Bonnell, Mayfield Park, or Red Bud Isle depending on what direction she wants to take. So, we’ll already be in that area. 

As I said, she’s a photographer, so she loves anything aesthetically pleasing to the eye and has an appreciation for really cool/cute/eclectic coffee shops, cafes, and places. 

I’m already considering taking her to South Congress because I think she’ll love all the murals there, but we haven’t explored that area much yet so not sure what to do/see there besides the coffee shop “Love You So Much” mural and some food.

I recently tried out the new Facebook Dating app, with limited success. However, I did manage a meet a cutie named Christine on there, and we kicked it off pretty well! After getting to know each other a bit, I even managed to score a date for this Friday with her. Things were looking up!

Then, disaster struck.

This afternoon when I went on to check our conversation, I noticed Facebook decided to arbitrarily shut down my account with no notice or reason. This locked me from my conversations, so I was no longer able to talk to her. 

After finding there is no way to actually contact Facebook support in any meaningful way, I figured I would just delete my account and start a new one, cycling through the results until I found her again. Upon trying to create a new account, I find that I'm completely locked out of the app entirely, unable to rejoin.

I kicked myself for not asking for her number, and started to feel like there might not be a chance for me and Christine. I realize this might be a hail Mary, but she seemed really neat and I felt like we had pretty good chemistry with what little interaction we did have. Worth a shot, right?

All I know is:

Her first name is Christine;

She is a science teacher, unsure which school;

and he has a birthmark over her lip on one side.

If anyone knows her, please let her know that I didn't actually ghost her and would love to still go on a date with her this Friday.

From coffee shops to bars.. comedy shows to museums, I feel we did everything an average visitor can do. 

We’re from San Antonio, so we aren’t far from home. Other than the half dozen times I’ve been to 6th street for a night, I haven’t experienced anything “Austin.”

I want to write about my take away and would love for you guys to tell me what you think about it. Some of these are statements, some are questions. 

1.) The homeless epidemic is terrible. 
As I said, I’ve been to 6th street before. And each time, of course, I recall the homeless people. But being in every other street this time around, and being in the “East side,” I noticed it a serious problem. Can anyone explain it me? Why is it so damn bad? 

2.) The cost of living there is crazy! Am I wrong? For those who do live there, how much would one need to make to live in a Condo downtown? What about a nice apartment in South Congress? Duck tour driver said decent homes are half of a million!!  

3.) You guys look out for your visitors. Never once did someone treat me and my girlfriend like we were stupid when we asked stupid questions. We asked a lot of them. I’ve been told countless times that people in San Antonio are rude to tourists. 

4.) Coffee is life. How many people who live in Austin drink coffee daily? As a coffee lover, I’m thrilled to say I tried a local coffee shop every day. I enjoyed Joe’s on South Congress the most! 

5.) Being older is cool in Austin. Let me rephrase, I see a lot of men and women in their 30’s and 40’s out and about. I absolutely love that. Can anyone explain why that is? Again, just 80 minutes down the highway in San Antonio, if you see someone in their 40’s out having fun in a bar, it’s looked at as taboo.

[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/torchy-tacos-lights-investor-crowd-182601786.html), CEO G.J. Hart appeared at an investment conference in Orlando this week and indicated plans for the Austin-based chain to expand to numerous new states. Hart predicted that the chain would jump from 71 restaurants now to around 160 by the end of 2023 — in less than four years. Hart also said he hopes to have restaurants in a total of 15 states by that time.

At present, Torchy’s has locations in Arkansas, Colorado (mostly in Denver), and Oklahoma, with imminent plans for three restaurants in Louisiana. However, it’s heavily concentrated in Texas — the majority of Torchy’s outlets are in Austin, Dallas, and Houston alone.

The Yahoo report suggests that investors have taken an interest in the taco chain, which has built a reputation for itself by putting a focus on fresh ingredients — for example, it makes tortillas in house at each restaurant. The article also notes that Torchy’s restaurants rake in particularly high revenues — an average of $4 million annually at each location (for comparison, Chipotle draws an average of $2.5 million per restaurant and [Taco Bell, $1.5 million](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/content/qsr50-2017-top-50-chart)).

It hasn’t yet been revealed where Torchy’s is planning to open new restaurants — however, past expansions have focused on states in relatively close proximity to Texas, suggesting that it might continue focusing on expanding outward from its hub, rather than jumping straight to the coast. The chain has also not been afraid to open in small to mid-sized cities, suggesting that it could focus on branching out into the Midwest, rather than setting its sights on flashier markets (for example, it has plans to open in Lake Charles, Louisiana, but not New Orleans at this stage).

Hart also noted that Torchy’s does solid sales in places close to the Mexican border, where it would generally be expected face stiffer competition from other taquerias — meaning that expansions towards New Mexico or Arizona could be on the cards.",Austin,Torchy’s Tacos Is Aiming to Double in Size Over the Next 4 Years

We love the location (great schools, nice neighborhood, convenient location). However, when we signed the purchase agreement, we noticed a few mentions of ""condominium,"" and when we asked the builder's sale agent, she said that the home is considered a detached condo. This was a bit of a surprise for us, since the floor plans are quite large (2600 - 3400 sq. ft.), and they are the same floor plans as other subdivisions that I'm fairly sure are considered single family homes. The HOA fee is also a bit on a higher side ($150/mo). I asked if that means we won't have to maintain our own yards, but she said no, owners are still responsible for their own exterior maintenance, but the HOA will replace the fences if something happens to them.

I've owned a home before (the one we're currently living in, which was also a new construction). However, never a condo, detached or otherwise. I've read that for condos, you only own the building but not the land.

Will this be an issue in the future if we decide to sell the house?

I’m not going to include the name of the author because he doesn’t need to be doxxed or whatever, but if mods need a name for the credit I will happily provide it privately.**

Long ass post about the service industry in Austin warning: 

I’m seeing the News story about Trudy’s Tex mex being shared all over my timeline and I think it’s important to talk about the blowback. I’m not going to share the article because if you know what I’m talking about then you know what I’m talking about without me needing to drag any of my friends. 

So here it is. Hot take coming at ya. 

For ex employees It’s really easy to talk shit about Trudy’s. The hours are ludicrous. The side work is beastly. The whole rank your coworkers like it’s an episode of hit Netflix series “the circle” should be/probably is illegal. The managers are allll the way up your ass over the littlest things. (I know ‘cause I was one.) And the guests could be just awful. Just ask anyone who ever worked the patio during a spurs game. So yes it’s really really easy to talk shit. It’s really easy to say “fuck trudy‘s”

But you’re wrong....kinda.

Now let me break that down.

I remember my first visit to Trudy’s as a guest. I’d been living in Austin for a little over a year, I was working my ass off for nothing at the chili’s on South Lamar pulling in a whopping $45 every lunch just so I could go drink it away at the Texican (formerly known as Trudys Brody oaks lol) across the parking lot.
A friend came in to town to visit and wanted to go to Trudes. She was shocked that I’d never heard of it and insisted it was time for some mexmarts before we made our way downtown.

So here we are, it’s a Friday night and we’re waiting an hour for our table. I’m two margaritas deep by the time I’m finally sat and already lit up and having a great time. We all have this story by the way. Every drinking age (or close to drinking age) human living in Austin for more than a year has a great (fuzzy) memory that starts/ends with getting lit up at a Trudy’s. 
My servers name was Nacho.
I shit you not her name was Nacho, and she’s incredible. She’s knowledgeable, funny, attentive but not overbearing and never once did my drink go empty. All this while keeping the floors clean with some weirdass manual vacuum in what looked to be a 10 table section. 
I’d later go on to love Nacho but HATE that damned Bissel. 
So I asked her the question every server asks or at least wants to ask at a new restaurant. 

“Nacho, how much do you make on a shift?”

A few days later I was in for an interview and Nacho earned herself $150 bucks in referral bonus.

On my first day there where 5 people in my training group, on my last day of training I was the last man standing. This was pretty standard for training back then. I’m positive that if you were to ask those 4 other people why they didn’t make it they’d feed you a line about a manager being too mean, or the trainer being too harsh, or the menu test being too difficult but I’ll tell you the truth. The truth is they didn’t make it because they weren’t any good. This brings me to my first point. 

If your line is “Fuck Trudy’s, I got stuck in the D-tier and all I ever got was rolling shifts and patio opens. The system was rigged” bad news man, Trudy’s probably wasn’t the problem, you were. Former D tiers please take the following quiz to find out if I’m right.

Did you ever come to work absolutely stoned out of your mind and we’re you proud of it?

Did you hide in a closed section/walk-in/server station/bathroom on your phone?

Did you run away instead of running food?

Did your stoned ass pocket tickets?

Did you serve a vegetarian borracho beans because your menu knowledge was garbage? 

Did you ever greet a table with the phrase
“hi what do you want to drink”?

If you answered yes to one or more of these questions then I’m sorry, but your just not good at this job. And that’s okay. Despite what society and your mom might tell you. Serving is a learned, valuable skill. It is an honorable position deserving of respect and not everyone is built to serve. 

It’s 👏🏻 a 👏🏻 hard 👏🏻 job 👏🏻 

Waiting tables at Trudys is like boot camp. It’s Incredibly difficult, but you come out the back end better and stronger. The expectations placed on the employees are remarkably high. But is that a bad thing? Is it bad to want to create a great guest experience? The kind of experience that makes you want a job?
Trudy’s is the New York New York of the service industry. If you can make it there you can make it anywhere. 

I know a certain d teir server that worked his ass off to learn, grow and get better. He didn’t cry about rolling silverware, I mean he bitched about it at a parking lot party or two, but he learned everything he could and took those years of experience with him when it was time to move on. Now you can find him in Fredericksburg with his beautiful family about to open his own place. And while I can almost guarantee he will be a much more kind and generous leader than the grumps we all worked for at Trudys. I know full damn well his expectations for guest experience will be sky high. Because plain and simple, that’s the business.

On to point two.
“Fuck Trudy’s. They treat their employees like shit”

Two words:
Christmas Party.
Two more words: 
Easter Party.

I’ve worked in restaurants for 17 years now and with the exception of my current restaurant. I had never worked for a restaurant that spent more money on celebrating and rewarding the hourly employees. I drank a Fair deal of free pappy and ate a fair deal of steak on my ecard back in the day. 

(It’s important to note that these things I’m talking about were the good old days, I know that this is not the current state of affairs and that makes me really really sad. Not paying employees absolutely qualifies as treating them like shit. If you are a current trudys employees Your anger is absolutely justified.)

Okay so. “Fuck Trudy’s, the managers are mean and I’m constantly being micromanaged” okay I’ll admit Trudys managers are famous for being grumpy. But I’ll fill you in on a secret. None of them started that way. The expectations being placed on the management staff are simply unattainable. If you think it was difficult being a Server for Trudys you should try being a Manager. The hours are ungodly, the bonus structure is literally non existent, the job security is nada. You can wake up one morning and be told that you were getting transferred to a new location that day. 
Think about that for a second. Imagine you’re a parent, you need to get your kid to and from school everyday, make it to ballet recitals and soccer games, and still work a 14 hour shift every day. It puts an incredible strain on your marriage but you finally work out a schedule that works for you and yours and you wake up the next morning and learn that you don’t work up the street anymore. You have a brand new 2 hour commute to fucking dripping springs where the alcoholic pill popping owner built a temple in his own honor and he just might walk into the kitchen and fire you because a stoned 15 year old host used the word “just”! 
There is a reason that trudys promotes all leadership roles from within. It’s because an outside hire with management experience and a degree in hospitality would never ever stay in that nightmare role for the compensation that was offered. Because of this trudys does offer one very valuable benefit to its managers...education. You learn everything you need to know to run a successful restaurant in a very short amount of time. 
Profitability and cost management, labor control, recruitment, retention (believe it or not), administration, payroll, scheduling, All of if. A trudys managers job is that of a full team of people at any other company and you’re expected to perform those duty’s at the highest level in a high volume environment. But what this means for the hourly employees of Trudys is this. Mangers lack one very important thing. Time in role. 
Plain and simple they’re placed in a pressure cooker with no experience and they either sink or swim. Those that make it become jaded and as such yes, your manager was probably mean. 
But I’ll promise you this, every manager you ever had at Trudy’s had your back.
Every manager you had at Trudy’s was fighting for you. Yes even MJ.

But who were they fighting? 
Gary. 
Gary started a company in 1977 that would go on to change the lives of thousands of people in and around Austin. He had a real good thing going. He also had a crippling pill and alcohol addiction. He had an ego that wouldn’t allow him to trust or listen to those who loved and respected him most. Trudy’s could have been Chuy’s if Gary would have released his choke hold on the company. But he didn’t. He did whatever the hell he wanted to despite everyone’s best advice and he very slowly drove a great company full of incredible humans into the ground. Everything you ever hated about Trudys was because of Gary. 
Full stop. 
Trudy’s was amazing. Gary simply drank himself to villainy 

So here it is. Here is the summation. Here is why I felt the need to spend my evening typing this ridiculous novel. 

I. Love. Trudys. 

If you are reading this right now one of two things probably happened. We went to high school together OR you know me because of Trudy’s. 

As I type this, my smart and adorable daughter is sitting in my lap watching Mickey Mouse club house on a big ass TV in a home that I own with my beautiful wife. 

Let me type that again to explain myself.

My adorable daughter is a human that exists because I got to make sweet sweet love on a boat with a woman who I met...at Trudy’s 
She is watching Mickey Mouse clubhouse on a big ass tv in a pretty nice home that I bought with money I earned as an employee of the greatest company I have ever worked for. A company that hired me because of the skills I learned the hard way at...Trudy’s 

I am blessed with so many friends because of trudys. I met incredible leaders who helped to shape me into the man I am...at Trudy’s. 

My years living in Austin were some of the greatest years of my life and I owe a lot of that to Trudys. 

So am I angry? 
Hell yeah I’m angry! 
I have friends who are reading this right now who still aren’t sure if they’re going to get paid or wake up with a job tomorrow! That really pisses me off! That makes me really sad. 
But I refuse to let Gary tarnish the work, love, blood and sweat that all of those humans put into that company. 

So here is my challenge. 
Let’s take it back. Let’s celebrate the work we pit in and the friendships we made.

If you made it all the way to the bottom of this thing please tag or share this post with any of your old trudys friends and comment your favorite memory of your time at Trudy’s. 

Good vibes only!!!

And more important IF YOU KNOW OF AN AUSTIN RESTAURANT CURRENTLY HIRING PLEASE DROP A LINK so we can find current trudys peeps a new home before it’s too late!

If you are thinking of driving for favor with those flags you could have just asked for them.  ;-/

I would have been glad to give them to you.  I drove about 1000 favors and don’t drive for favor anymore.  

I would have been happy to share the news that if you divide it up on a week by week basis, your income with favor is predictable.  If you have a 4-5 rating-good tips making up for bad combined with the $2 (out of 6 that the customer pays) fvr payment, you can bet on $8 per favor. Figure out what multiple of 8 you need to earn, and earn it.  

Once you see how long a single favor usually takesyou must decide if $8 every XX minutes is acceptable income.  

It wasn’t for me.   

I have driven for multiple other delivery services as an independent contractor.  There is one company in particular that I would have suggested you check out.  

Instead, you just snagged my flags that I frequently use to park in commercial zones downtown while making deliveries.  

I have other flags, I’ll be fine.  It’s just such a super unimpressive (and useless for most people) item to lift.  

If you see this please know-   I would still love to do you a favor and warn you- if you need to earn money, don’t work for favor.   

Also if you see this and you just stole them to be a jerk... mission accomplished, it was a real dick move, and I think you’re a jerk.

I've worked in the downtown service industry scene for years and have always heard local lore about a tunnel system that runs from the Capital to the river and underneath a lot of the bars on dirty sixth, but I wanted to see if and what anyone else knows about it because it's always fascinated the crap out of me and information is EXTREMELY limited online about it. Does anyone else have something on this subject??? Really hoping someone can shed official light on this subject I've periodically obsessed over.

This is what I've heard through the years from others who have worked downtown too:

\- When Texas was a republic, apparently it was used as an escape route for the president in case of attack.

\- Back in the day, the tunnels were used for politicians to have a discreet pat to get from the capital to brothels that were on sixth street. 

\- When the Yassine brothers' cocaine/ money laundering conspiracy happened in 2012 (owners of Kiss &amp; Fly, Pure, Treasure Island and more), they used the tunnels to distribute their narcotics throughout the bars.

\- There are various entrances to it from multiple bars' basements (most older bars on and around sixth  that have a basement have access. 

\- Apparently the city made allllll of the bars with access to it cinder block their doors up the other year which is a BUMMER because in my prime, younger, dirty-sixth street swag god legend days, I made it my life mission to get access to the tunnels and never did finally get down there.

\- One time some years back, the door guy at Mugshots caught me trying to sneak down to their basement after he told me about their access to the tunnel then explicitly told me ""do not try to go into our basement dude""",Austin,Anyone else know about the old hidden tunnel network underneath downtown Austin?

Today I bring you some Austin UFO stories from 50 years before the Roswell incident of 1947. I've seen and participated in a few discussions about this topic here before, but [some new shit has come to light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbIv7W7rhx4), so I've got to get this one off my chest. The acronym ""U.F.O."" gets taken for granted as something extra-terrestrial but it really means anything flying that's unidentified. Besides something alien, in today's world that could be anything from a weird looking drone or an Air Force test plane, or even a Chinese lantern. 

There comes a time when technological progress advances to a point where the materials needed to invent something new and great are available to many people at once, so you end up with different people inventing things like the telephone, or the television, at roughly the same time. That's also kind of what happened with human flight. A few years before the [Wright Brothers glided over a beach in North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers#Flights) and before [the Germans perfected the Zeppelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship#19th_century), there were apparently a few different people flying around the country in what was at the time referred to as [""mystery airships""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_airship). These were cigar shaped craft, sometimes with elaborate sails or wings mimicking those of many different bird species, that could carry passengers and/or cargo flown over great distances. If you saw one today you would probably call it a blimp with wings, but it was really more like a floating paddleboat. Back in the late 1800s the thought of attaching a mechanical engine, whether steam or oil powered, to a balloon to guide it places was experimental and revolutionary. Different types of airships began test flights over Europe in the 1860s and by the 1880s there were Americans doing it too, although it would be more accurate to say these early inventors had very little idea what they were doing at all. They were basically trying out different forms of balloons with accessories more than inventing the blimp.  But one thing is for sure, when these things would ""fly""/float over anywhere near a populated area they would scare the crap out of the public and become the talk of the area for weeks. These were the UFOs of their time; some people thought they were from Mars. 123 years ago these things captivated The City of Austin when they began appearing over our violet crowned skies. There were more than a few sightings, locally, statewide, and nationally, and the Statesman of the time covered most of it. One Statesman reporter even had a sighting himself. The Legislature was freaking out over how to regulate them, and there was an incident at The Driskill. But as usual I'm getting ahead of myself.  

The most famous incident during the ""mystery airship"" wave of 1896-1897 is probably the [Aurora, TX UFO incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Texas,_UFO_incident). To quickly sum it up, an airship with an alien visitor on board is supposed to have crashed after hitting a windmill in the small North Texas town of Aurora on April 17, 1897.  The ""martian"" was said to have died from the crash, and was buried in an unmarked grave in the local graveyard. 

That's a very important date to remember: April 17th, 1897. The following day on the 18th, the Statesman announced a ""Strange and Startling"" discovery. A few years ago [Michael Barnes did a writeup on this in the Statesman](https://www.statesman.com/NEWS/20171227/UFO-reported-over-Austin-in-1897), from which I quote:

&gt;Balloon? Airplane? UFO? What flew over Texas — including Austin — with searchlights in April 1897?

&gt;Bob Ward of the Travis County Historical Commission drew our attention to this airborne mystery. We’re not suggesting aliens, but the reports fit the definition of an “unidentified flying object.”

&gt;A headline in the April 18, 1897, Austin Daily Statesman shouted “Strange and Startling: A ‘What Is It?’ Serenely Sailing over the Blessed Long Star State.” Texans in Sherman, Fort Worth, Hillsboro, Marshall and Paris spotted unusual objects in the night sky. This was six years before the Wright Brothers took off from Kitty Hawk, N.C., and 50 years before an unexplained object crashed in Roswell, N.M.

&gt;On April 26, the Daily Statesman reported that airship had made another appearance, this time behind Mount Bonnell traveling north. “At least, three young men who were camping up on Bull Creek at Huddle’s Point say they saw it. Messrs. Geo. Powell, Ted Tobin and Jas. Caldewell went up the lake Saturday afternoon for a couple of days’ camp and pitched their tents. ... About 3 a.m. it began to rain and the men were compelled to get up and fasten the tent. It was at this time they saw the mysterious aircraft. They claim it was in sight fully 15 minutes and are positive they could not be mistaken. At intervals of every few seconds, it would throw its searchlights, and the boys say the light looked as big as four ordinary arc lights.”

&gt;Of course, those interested in UFOs have not let the subject of the 1897 aircraft go. An April 15, 2016, story in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reached back to revive the tale of an airship that crashed into a windmill, “killing a spaceman,” in the North Texas town of Aurora on April 17, 1897. (In other words, before the Austin sighting.)

&gt;The town recently celebrated the crash with an event called the Aurora Alien Encounter with talks and shuttle tours, including a stop at the cemetery where the alien nicknamed “Ned” was supposedly buried.

This 2017 Statesman article was I think the first time I had heard of this story. So the same night a UFO allegedly crashed in Aurora, airship(s) were seen all over North Texas. The Statesman of 1897 reports on that, but then eight days later comes another report of some boys seeing an airship near Mt. Bonnell. Well come to find out that was only one of many local airship stories dating back to that Spring and Summer of 1897 in the old Statesman archive, and not even the best one in my opinion. Allowing for the yellow-journalism tendencies of The Statesman and newspapers in general at the time, some of the reports are made with intricate detail by otherwise credible people from all walks of life, while others seem obviously a hoax too fantastical to be believed.  

I'm just going to go through Statesman articles in chronological order.  We will start in 1896 with a bit more backstory:

#May 31, 1896 - [A New Flying Machine](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42508886/a_new_flying_machine_may_31_1896/)

&gt;Prof. Samuel P. Laughley's Successful Flying Machine. 

&gt;Professor Langleys has invented a flying machine which is a success. At Occoquan, Va.. near Washington, D. C. the Smithsonian Institute Professor recently tested this machine to his complete satisfaction. The machine rose 200 feet in the air and flew steadily for half a mile. Fuel in the engine then gave out and the machine sunk gently to the ground. The flying machine carries a small steam engine of one-horse power. The whole contrivance weighs twenty-five pounds. Its light steel frame work holds extended horizontally three sheets of thin canvas. one above the other. The length over all is fifteen feet. The engine runs two propellers. 

&gt;The machine could fly 100 miles, or even a much greater distance with a sufficient, supply of steam. But the small engine employed is not of the condensing pattern and has no means of using the same water over again.

#October 2, 1896 - [Flies Like a Bird](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42509013/remarkable_success_of_the_lamson/)

&gt;Remarkable Success of the Lamson AirShip at Portland, Ma. 

&gt;Big machine rises steadily to an altitude of six hundred feet and then gracefully settles to the ground again. A New York Sun special from Portland. Maine. Charles H. Lamson performed a feat here the other day practically demonstrating that a large airship or kite capable of carrying a man can be floated successfully and steadily. He raised his ship with a dummy man on it 600 feet. The retaining rope broke when the ship was at that altitude. Had it not been for this break, Mr. Lamson would have sent up a man to navigate his ship. As it was, W. A. Eddy, of Bayonne, NJ. an authority on aerial experiments, declared that Lamson'a achievement was the greatest step toward solving the problem of aerial navigation of the age. Two records, at all events, Lamson made. He flew the largest kite or airship ever floated. He carried by mean of this kite the heaviest weight to the greatest altitude on record. Tbe kite which made the flight is an invention of Mr. Lamson and is called ""The Lamson Airship."" The kite, when in the air, resembles two large, oblong j boxes parallel to each other and attached to each other in the middle. It took 15 men to carry the kite or ship into the field from which it was to be sent up. The cord tested to a pull of 500 pounds This was made fast to a reel and four men attended to it. About 400 feet of the rope was run out along the ground, and at a signal from Mr. Lamson the snip was released. It quivered a m ment and then steadily rose skyward. Seated on the car of this ship was a dummy weighted to 150 pounds. The ship rose to an altitude of 600 feet, and was rising steadily, ""when, with a sudden gust of wind, snap went the rope, showing what a tremendous pressure was brought upon it by the soaring of the ship. The ship floated out a half mile and descended as easily and gracefully as it went up. Had a man been in the car he would not have been harmed in the slightest.

#November 23, 1896 - [An Airship Sure Enough!](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42509090/an_airship_sure_enough_november_23/)

&gt;Frisco lawyer says one is perfected and has had a successful trial. 

&gt;San Francisco, Nov. 22. The Chronicle printed a story which would indicate that the airship in practical form is at established fact. About 1 o'clock last Monday morning. the inhabitants of Sacramento who astir at that hour claim to have seen an airship passing rapidly over the city (Some merely say they saw a bnght light, while others went so far as to say they saw a cigar shaped flying machine and heard human voices from it.)  The residents of Oakland also say they same the same sight. The story of the mysterious airship ha been told all over tin state and has created considerable amusement, as it was generally believed to he a hoax. 

&gt;...

So you can see that at least a few people were experimenting with airships in various forms at that time. This brings us to 1897, and the first incident mentioned in the 2017 Statesman article. This was written the day after the Aurora incident but doesn't mention Aurora by name.

#April 18, 1897 - [Strange And Startling](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/26614007/austin_americanstatesman/)

&gt;What is it serenely sailing over the blessed Lone Star State? Be it a big airship or something else seen in the heavens at various North Texan points. 

&gt;Keep a Watch Out Here. Of late strange sights have been witnessed in the heavens and some day ago. 

&gt;The Statesman obtained a dispatch saying that an airship or something of that sort had been seen sailing over Oklahoma. Now the mysterious aerial craft has been seen at various points in Texas and from all accounts it is a fast sailer. Friday night at Sherman, Mr. W. S. Hellyer, cashier of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad, saw a mysterious oval-shaped object of large proportions plass over the moon. On the same night, Conductor W. M. Honney of Fort Worth, his wife and mother saw a strange object pass over the city. 

&gt;On the same night Hon. J. S. Bound of Hillsboro, on his way to visit a sick friend, had an experience he will not forget soon. He was jogging alone quietly, when suddenly his horse whirled around and came near overturning the buggy. There was a brilliant light, as if coming from an arc light. This light, he says rested on him less than a minute and then he saw it gliding over a field nearby. It then turned upward and he watched it until he says it must have been 1000 feet in in the air. The light appeared to him to be the headlight of some kind of it ship. While he watched, the light went out and small ones such a incandescent lights, appeared all around the body of the vessel, or whatever it was. 

&gt;The strange craft sailed slowly in a southernly direction and while Mr. Bounds watched it all the lights  were extinguished and then it disappeared. 

&gt;On the same night, about 2 o'clock, J. A. Black of Paris, Tx., night watchman at the Paris Oil and Cotton company's plant, observed a faint but luminous body in the northeast heavens. It looked at first like a luminous cloud, but as it drew nearer he saw it was some, huge monster. He hurried over to the cabin of a negro named Jim Smith and woke him up,  and when Jim caught sight of the heavenly visitor his wool promptly straightened out and Jim piously went to praying. Mr. Black watched the object carefully, and to a Dallas News reporter he said its body was shaped something cigar, and appeared to be 200 feet long. It carried sails and attachments that looked like great fans. It finally disappeared, going in the direction of the Mississippi river. Mr. Black's dog was with himi when he first discovered the monster and he was greatly agitated and moaned until the thing disappeared. 

&gt;On the same night Conductor Virgil Brown and his brakeman on the Texas-Pacilic Railroad saw the curious monster near Jewella. La., about thirty miles east of Marshall. It appeared to have a search light attached to it that threw out rays in several directions. It appeared to be going in the direction of Marshall and traveled faster than his train. On the same night at Marshall, Marshal Dick Wentberby. night watchman at the Pacific Railroad shops, saw the monster pass over. From Jewella to Hillsboro is some 300 or 400 miles, and the ship being seen at both places only a few hours apart shows it is a traveler. Whence is it? 'What is it and whither is it going, anyhow? Are we living in the days when strange sights are to appear in the heavens?

From this point onward the word was out that these things were being seen in Texas. What follows in the coming days in the Statesman seems like borderline mass hysteria.

#April 20, 1897 - [Rickety Airship](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41959741/rickety_airship_april_20_1897/)

&gt;The report that Deputy Sheriff Thorp and Uncle Dick Boyce, afraid of the airship, were sleeping in the boiler room at the court house, is untrue. They stay in the basement of the Capitol. No weak boiler room for them with a rickety airship sailing overhead.

#April 20, 1897 - [The Heavenly Mystery](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25618937/austin_americanstatesman/) 

&gt;Possible soldiers from warlike Mars out on a terrestrial reconnoiter

&gt;An astronomical theory about the mysterious stranger as seen in Chicago. The celestial craft the talk of the town. 

&gt; The great and mysterious aerial vessel that has thrown north Texas and many parts of the country into a state of excitement and commotion, was first seen sailing over Kansas, but the stories about it did not excite much attention. Since then, however, the mysterious stranger has been seen in many parts of the country, and Friday night last reputable citizens in scores of Texas towns had a view of the aerial vehicle. It has traveled over Illinois, Indiana, Iowa. Wisconsin, Arkansas, Louisiana and other states, and everywhere has excited great curiosity and in some places provoked consternation. On Friday night, April 9, the strange light skirted over the northern border of Chicago and could be seen, according to the numerous reports of residents in that neighborhood. A great crowd gathered at the corner of Milwaukee and Oakley avenues and gazed at the object, trying to figure out to their satisfaction what it might be. It was an ""airship"" for lack of a better name to designate it by, but most were skeptical about the identity of the ""manifestation."" It was said the object looked very much like a balloon, but the ""red light"" was plainly discernible. Many of the people mounted the roofs in the neighborhood and all the field glasses in the vicinity were called into play.

&gt;...

&gt;In Texas:

&gt;The strange craft seen at many points in North and East Texas Friday night has thrown those parts of the state into a whirl of excitement. Col. R. N. Burt, cashier of the National Bank of Ladonia, Texas, saw the craft, or whatever it is, last Friday night. His description varies very little from that of others, only that it appeared much larger to him, as he says that it seemed to be about 300 feet long, its wiungs being enormous and looking like huge sails. It seemed to hover for a short time over the city and then rise and go rapidly in a southwesterly direction. At Farmersville, Texas, Friday night, as reported in the Dallas News, about 9 o'clock a dim tight was seen in the northwest, apparently moving slowly to the south or southeast. When first seen it did not look larger than an ordinary 30-cent silver piece. Those watching it soon discovered that the object was approaching the city. It traveled; at the rate of sixty or eighty miles an hour. Some thought it to lie a cloudless tornado, and those who had storm houses lost no time in getting into them, whilst the more unfortunate waited and watched the result, of the approach of the queer object. In a very short time fully two-thirds of the citizens of the city were out looking at what they then supposed to be a large planet or meteor approaching the earth. In a few moments, in fact, in less time than one can tell it, the queer thing was almost hanging over the city. City Marshal Brown was in the western part or the city making his rounds before going home and says the ship or balloon passed over him about 200 feet from the ground. Mr. Brown says he could see two men in the ship and something resembling a large Newfoundland dog. Mr. Brown says he was close enough to hear them talking, but could not understand one word of their language. 

&gt;Mr. Walter L. Norwood, an undertaker at Galveston, had a professional call about 3 o'clock Saturday morning, and he says he and his driver. Bob Tevis, saw the airship and said to a Galveston news reporter:  ""The moon was shining brightly, and we could see almost as fully as in daylight. There was not a cloud in the sky. When we were out on the beach not far from our destination I happened- to look up and saw the thing. It moved to the eastward down the beach, following the line of the beach as closely as one would do in driving a buggy. We stopped and watched it. When down about the end of the island it turned and followed the bay front until almost Tremont street, when it turned and went south out over the gulf, disappearing in the distance."" It was pointed at both ends, according to Mr. Aorwoods description, and the headlight was directly in front. It looked like a great big bird, with wings flapping regularly and it traveled swiftly. 

&gt;Statesman's Mystery Man. 

&gt;The mystery man of The Statesman heard yesterday that Mr. R.H. Cousins had caught a glimpse of the mysterious ship Friday night, and Mr. Cousins was seen about it. 'No, I saw no ship,"" he said. ""I stepped out into my yard and my attention was attracted by a moving light which appeared to lie some distance above the earth, not far from the residence of Mr. J. W. Graham. I first I thought it was a meteor, but I soon discovered it moved too slow for a meteor. In the light was not very large, I think possibly I could have covered it with my hand. I watched it as it moved and it passed over and down in the direction of Shoal Creek. I saw no dark object, nor anything that resembled a ship; I saw nothing but the light, and at the time thought nothing about it. The story, as reported, was that Mr. Cousins had seen a large ship-like shape, with the light attached to it. To the Statesman's gang last night the mystery man, to the utter consternation of the boys, gave it as his unalterable opinion that there was something in this airship business. ""Where there's so much smoke there must be some fire,"" he said. ""So many reports, from so many different points can not be fabrications. People may say what they will, but there's something in it."" 

&gt;The gang was visibly moved. ""It is my opinion,"" continued the mystery man, ""that the airship, so-called, is nothing more nor less than a reconnoitering aerial war car from warlike Mars, investigating the Conditions of the United States to see what reinforcements we'll need when the country is invaded by the allied armies of Europe, the Mars soldiers having no confidence whatever In the American jingoes as real fighters,"" ""With these soldiers of Mars cavorting around over our heads, do you think there is any danger to us of the earth?"" asked the gang in concert,' ""I most emphatically do. 

&gt;Last Thursday night one of their aerial boats exploded, and scraps of steel and piece of electric wire were found on the school house, the roof of which workmen were repairing. They heard an explosion during the night, and just before it took place the aerial vehicle was seen sailing through the air. There is great danger in venturing out these nights. What if one of those fellows from Mars should tumble out and fall on you ? The city editor and telegraph man were profoundly impressed, and last night they slept under a table in the editorial rooms. 


# April 21, 1897 - [Shadbolt gets a package at the Driskill](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41959903/shadbolt_and_the_driskill_airshp/)

&gt;Say, you people all know Shadbolt, manager of the Driskill, and are acquainted with his reputation for veracity? The fact that he is in the category with George Washington in this line, inclines me to take stock in these airship yarns that are at present flooding the country. Shad asserts that while on the roof of the hotel last Monday night engaged in taking clothes off the line, he was astonished first by a peculiar sizzling noise, followed immediately by a biff, bang, whiz, and a current of cold air that chilled him to the marrow. Dodging behind a chimney pot, he saw coming towards him a frightfully constructed cigar-shaped balloon, or something of that character. 

&gt;His heart was in bis throat for a moment, but swallowing it with an effort, be sang out: **'Ship ahoy!'** A voice replied: **'Howde? Is this Austin?'** **'You're bloody right,'** yelled Shad, whereupon the main guy on that flying monster called out: **'Stand by you lubbers, and let go that freight'**. Something struck the roof, and the startled manager says as the thing went out of sight there was a man sitting cross-legged on the quarter deck, working a concertina. and grinding out the music of 'Me 'Art Is True to Poll,' *(???)* In the bundle, which smelled of stale fish and a few decayed things of that kind, was a note stating that the ship was en route to China, but would return in October next, by which time the writer hoped the Texas legislature would have passed all the blooming (democrat) platform demands formulated at Fort Worth. Now Shadbolt will not deny bis fondness for potted cheese and a bleeding glass of 'alf and 'alf, but be says neither of these appetizers had the slightest connection with his experience on the roof. He's got the note, and the brick that came with it, and will take pleasure in showing it to his friends.

# April 24, 1897 - [Airship Resolution](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25619266/austin_americanstatesman/) 

&gt;Proposal to have the commission regulate them. 

&gt;Yesterday morning, in a spirit of fun, Mr. Brigance offered the following resolution about airships: ""Whereas, There is an airship sailing around Texas, carrying freigbt and passengers; and whereas the owners or incorporators of said airship pay no taxes for said traffic; and whereas, the railroad commission have been derelict in their duty in fixing rates tor said airship: and whereas, The State of Texas is badly in need of fund to run the state government; therefore, 

&gt;Be it resolved that the advocate of revenue measures. Hon. J. T. Curry. the representative from Van Zandt county, is and is hereby requested to be the master of making rates for the government of said airship before the railroad commission of Texas and request that said commission proceed at once to make rates and charges for the transportation of passengers and freight in Texas, and in default of the payment of said rates, asid commission shall apply to the Justice of the Peace of Precinct No. 1, Travis County, and procure an attachment and proceed to levy the same upon said airship for the purpose of collecting said rates, etc.

Now comes the second instance mentioned in the 2017 article. 

#April 26, 1897 - [Airship Again](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25617682/austin_americanstatesman/)

&gt;The airship made its appearance again early yesterday morning. At least three young men who were camping up on Bull creek, at Huddle's point, say they saw it. Messrs. Geo. Proctor, Ted Tobin and Jno. Caldwell went up the hike Saturday afternoon for a couple of days camp, and pitched their tents at Huddle's point. About 3 o'clock yesterday morning it began to rain, and the young men were compelled to get up and fasten their tent. It was at this time they saw the mysterious air craft. They claim it was in sight fully fifteen minutes and are positive they could not have been mistaken. At intervals of every few seconds it would throw its searchlight, and the boys say the light looked as big a four ordinary arc lights. It made its appearance from behind Mount Bonnell and traveled north. The boys broke camp last afternoon they say because it was raining so hard, but that mysterious light probably made the rain seem wetter than usual.

&gt;It seems impossible to hide anything from the ""argus eyes and ears"" of a Statesman reporter. Mr. Teagarden of Teagarden &amp; Shumate, ""The Peacemakers,"" has been in ""telepathic"" communication with the inhabitants of Mars for some time past. In fact his summer location on the summits of various mountains in Colorado has been the means of enabling him to adopt a system of telepathic communication, and he intimates that ""the airship"" now voyaging around us is for the purpose of discovery, and not war, as some suppose. The ship is named ""The Peacemaker"" and is now used in the interest of his manufacturing centers of goods kept by this firm and perfect such arrangements as may be necessary for their interests. Upon his return early in May, Mr. Teagarden designs taking a trip over the eastern continent as a guest of the representatives of the fiery planet. No alarm need be felt by the inhabitants of Earth as the appearance of the ship only betokens peace. In fact, wars are a thing of the past in Mars, and the art is lost with them.

#April 29, 1897 - [Airship Seen Here](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25618010/austin_americanstatesman/)

&gt;It passed over the city yesterday morning in a rain.

&gt;Moved Slowly, Plainly Visible

&gt;Seen by more than one person. Work of Hiram Wilson, son of the master-mechanic for the New York Central *(Railroad)*. 

&gt;The airship, carrying a large headlight, passed over the city yesterday morning, apparently about 300 or 400 feet above the earth. It moved slowly at first, traveling in a northwesterly direction, but its speed seemed to lie greatly increased when it reach a point probably over Shoal creek. A gentleman out north of the capitol saw it, and a colored man living on Robertson Hill had a sight of the aerial visitor. A fine view of it was had by Mr, Otto F. Porsch, an intelligent and wholly reliable gentleman living at the corner of Colorado and Second streets and doing a grain and feed business at 402 East Sixth street. He is well known and has a large circle of friends. A Statesman reporter saw Mr. Porsch at his place of business yesterday, and he told the following story: ""I was aroused from my sleep by my dogs barking and growling, and I went to a window and looked out. It was very cloudy and dark, and I saw the glare of a big light on the clouds. I thought a large fire was in progress and hastily put on my clothes and went out into the yard to see where it was. As I opened the door to go out, my young dog, greatly scared at something, pushed by me and went into the house. My old dog stayed in the yard, and I noticed he was barking at something overhead, and I looked up and saw great light slowly moving over the Salge Hotel. It was coining from the southeast and moved in a northwesterly direction. It appeared to me to be about 300 or 400 feet above the hotel, and it traveled very slow, the light being so blinding that I could not see the shape of the vehicle or whatever it was carrying it, I watched it carefully, and after it had gone some distance and has passed me, I could see the shape of the rear end of the vessel, and it appeared to be in this shape."" And Mr. Forsch arranged his hands in a V shape, somewhat like the tail of a fish. ""It was still moving very slowly, but as I watched 1 saw a movement on each side of it like a bird flap ping its wings, and its speed was once greatly increased, and I watched it until it disappeared, which was not long after it began to increase its speed. It was drizzling a little, and it rained  pretty hard after the light disappeared.  Asked if he saw any colored lights, he said ""No, I did not. It was a very large, ordinary light and very blinding until it passed me."" Mr. Porsch said that a gentleman living out north of the capitol told him yesterday forenoon that he had seen the ship at the same time Mr. Porseh did. Mr. Porsch said: ""After it had disappeared I went buck into the house and looked at the clock, and it was exactly fifteen minutes after 4."" A colored man named Gray saw the ship as it passed over yesterday morning.

&gt;The Galveston News of yesterday contained a story that the vessel landed in Uvalde a few days ago near the residence of Sheriff H. W. Baylor. Two men were aboard, with whom Mr. Baylor talked, one of them giving bis name as Wilson, and he said be had lived in Fort Worth, and the News of yesterday confirmed bis story and shows he did live in the Panther city, where he worked on an arship.

&gt;The airship has been heard from at Cripple Creek. The information comes through a letter dropped from the airship. The letter states that there are three person in the airship, and that they are out of water and can not make a landing on the earth and have given up in despair. A man who could invent such an airship a that would have the ingenuity to condense water from the clouds, but the whole thing about the airship seems to be getting to be ""in nubibus."" *(?)*

Professor Barnard said he would land at the starting point tonight. The ship is 4 feet long and 20 feet in diameter

&gt;In a burst of confidence yesterday, Uncle Dick Boyce informed a Statesman reporter that Joe Costa had seen an airship sailing majestically through the deep blue heavens.

&gt;Joe was hunted up and asked if he saw the aerial mystery.

&gt;""I have not seen an airship, nor do I want to see one,"" he indignantly said. ""If I wanted to see an airship I'd build one and be done with it. I know exactly how one should be constructed. You know I've watched buzzards and a ship modeled after them will fly""

#May 23, 1897 - [Webberville Airship](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42512037/webberville_airrship_may_23_1897/)

&gt;It was seen in Austin and Webbervllle Friday night. 

&gt;Friday night, about 12:30 o'clock, Mr. O'Brien, the Associated Press operator in the Statesman office, while standing on the gallery in front, saw what was evidently the airship, or at least the mysterious aerial body that has been seen several times in these parts. Mr. O'Brien watched it about a half minute, and then hastened to the window and called to the telegraph editor to come quick. The latter, although mentally absorbed in the interesting St. Louis produce market, hastened to the gallery, but when he got there the airship had passed out of view behind the business buildings southeast of the office. Both watched for some minutes in vain, and then returned to their work, the operator with a puzzled look, and the telegraph editor with an incredulous smile flitting across his face. They resolved not to say anything about it till next day, to see if any other night hawk had seen anything of the sort. Yesterday word came from Webberville announcing that John T. McCall, a prominent citizen of that section, had seen the airship about 10 o'clock Friday night. It was sailing very low, and he had a good view of it. He said it looked to be about fifty feet long, and was brilliantly lighted, looking something like a steamboat at night. This description tallies exactly with Mr. O Brien's description. There is about two and a half hour s difference in the time the two men saw it, but this could be easily accounted tor. There is evidently something prowling about the heavens in this neck of the woods, whether it is an airship or some other illuminated body.

#June 2, 1897 - [Legislature Sees An Airship](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19132185/austin_americanstatesman/)

&gt;Along about 10 o'clock some enthusiastic member saw what be thought was an air ship hovering over the university, and in a many seconds as it take to tell it, all the dear solons were rubbernecking toward the airship. The House and Senate both were nearly disbanded in their vain endeavor to see the airship. It could be plainly seen hovering over the university, and the members spent some time in discussing exactly how the ship was operated. They will probably not feel so cheerful in the morning when they discover that the impossible airship that excited their admiration was but a kite -an aeroplane- the university professors were operating for the purpose of trying to secure electrical experiments. The horse is on the solons, and they might as well give in.

Well I'm almost out of space but I think you get the picture. It goes on like this throughout the summer of 1897 and into 1898 when primitive airships were used in the Spanish-American war. There is an old truism that says necessity is the mothers milk of invention, but I have always said ubiquity does the same thing. In this case it seems to fit, the materials for flight were available everywhere and a few visionaries put it together. As for all the Austin sightings, I can't say who it was or what they were trying to do. But I do think if even one of those sightings was real then there is probably a chapter on human flight in some history books that needs a little expanding.

I was a resident at 3401 for eight years. I've seen several management changes, owners, and names of the place. This place was formerly:

- Mint Urban Red River
- Century Square

When the latest management (Horizon Realty out of Seattle) came in, I was at first very impressed with the improvements they were making to the property and the individual units. They spruced the place up rather nicely. There were some minor inconveniences, like A/C going out or garage doors being left open, but for the most part it was alright. The worst thing that happened is that they lost the key to my apartment. Supposedly it might have gone home with one of the maintenance men. I'm not sure why keys are leaving the property, but they re-keyed my apartment and replaced the keys, so whatever.

Then it hit. Fox Plumbing was in the building sweating pipes when they set a fire. The fire destroyed several units on the south side of the property. My apartment along the east side had to be used to ventilate smoke (per AFD), so they busted down my door and punched a hole in the roof of my bedroom. Now, commendable work on the part of AFD for controlling the fire.

Several hours after this incident (I was out shopping), I was informed that a fire had happened and there was a hole in my ceiling, but not much more. I drove down to the building and checked it out. Yep, big hole in the ceiling. Door busted in. The apartment manager told me that they would have my door secured by the end of the night. My boyfriend and I waited well into the night, sweeping up bits of ceiling, and nobody came. We barricaded the door with a heavy piece of furniture.

It was a couple days, if I recall correctly, before they informed me that asbestos was exposed. We had been sweeping up bits of cancer. Thus begins a several month long process of waiting, emailing, and just trying to get my stuff back. It was weeks and weeks until they finally started abatement, and the only way I could get updates from the community was by mass-emailing everyone in the company. Seriously, that's the only thing that got a response out of them.

This ruined my life. I had to take time off work, and eventually lost my job because I was focused on dealing with this ordeal. I understand this hasn't been easy for them either -- they've had to replace their entire HVAC, and several units are still shuttered. But I'm just a guy trying to keep his life together, and to this day they are still being evasive and impossible to work with.",Austin,Do not move to 3401 Red River

Buddy and Max were all my dad had with him for the past few years and its killing me to think about having to give them up. I'm moving this summer to a place I could care for them, but I can't right now, so I desperately need someone/some place to foster them until July.

My wife and I live in Austin and are looking for any help/suggestions around the area. Boarding them would be such a huge cost that would probably force us to give them up to a shelter, but they'd most likely be split up and that breaks my heart. These two have lived together for the past 5 years and I know they'd have a hard time being a part.

I'll gladly send more information if someone is interested in helping. We aren't looking for anyone to do this for free. We just need a little help until we're able to take them on full time. 

Please, if you know of anyone or a place that can be somewhat flexible while we get things in order to take them, let me know!

A new job opportunity has come up for me and it's just about perfect, in my exact field with lots of room for growth, a good friend already works there, good benefits (including a car/cell phone stipend), flex hours, and not to mention that it pays at least 10k/yr more than what I'm making now, with bonus structures built in.

They did an x-ray on him and he had a broken jaw and broken back leg, he was so skinny it was hard to tell it was him, we got him tests done and they came back telling us his jaw was infected and his tooth was completely broken. They told us that the infection was so bad that even if we got him proper care  that he would be in pain for the rest of his life, we as a family had to decide wether we wanted to end his suffering now around us or prolong it. We had to choose and i think it may have been the hardest decision of my life, but we ended up choosing to euthanize him, we thought it better to let him die happy with us rather than die hurting and traumatize his sister.

1534,1534,Jbear205,1579738319,esksr7,Ask Austin,"A bankruptcy attorney for Trudy’s Texas Star, Inc. made several Chapter 11 filings this afternoon. Stephen Sather of Barron &amp; Newburger, PC tells the Chronicle that the total sum of the debt surrounding the filing is around $4 million.
“The goal is to get the business stabilized, pay the employees and win back the goodwill of the customers,” Sather wrote in an email.
As the Chronicle reported last week (“Trudy’s Employees Revolting Over Late Pay”), the Tex-Mex institution had been the subject of social media rumblings about missed paychecks and limited inventory at restaurants.
The emergency motion notes that company founder Gary Truesdell has stepped aside, due to health concerns, and his son Stephen is now seeing the reorganization. It also lays out that the company’s financial problems began in 2011 with the opening of the enormous Trudy’s Four Star restaurant in Hays County. According to the filing, that restaurant lost nearly a million dollars a year until it closed last January.
“The losses from Trudy’s Four Star placed a substantial dent in the company’s finances. The company became delinquent upon its payroll taxes, state taxes and obligations to suppliers and employees,” the filing reads.
The documents also reveal that the declaration of bankruptcy comes in response to a levy from the IRS, which has frozen the company’s credit card receipts.
One of the filings, a motion to pay pre-petition wages, states that the company is currently delinquent $13,000 from the payroll of Jan. 1 and $237,161 from the pay date of Jan. 15.
Among the 35 entities listed as being owed money by Trudy’s Texas Star, Inc. are the food distribution company Sysco, Wells Fargo bank, and the company’s insurance provider Blue Cross Blue Shield.

 They also would not provide photos or documentation upon ask which I was under the impression is required.

The upgrades won't work on a flight purchased with miles/points, or a flight purchased by the government/military.

I'll need your flight record locator number to make it happen. DM me the record locator and I'll call it in. It also helps if you provide me the first name and destination, as they ask for a confirmation after I give the record locator.

1762,1762,superimportantposts,1580055546,eu8pe2,Nan,"Hi Everyone,

My current lease in Houston is coming to an end over the course of the next few months, and I figured that I would ask for a second opinion from the wide world of Reddit before taking any concrete next steps.

Some background information, I am a 28 year old, single male, and have lived in Houston for the past three years.  I work remotely and am considering moving to Austin, since it falls within my territory for work.  I travel to Austin for work every 2-3 months, but am not overly knowledgeable about the different neighborhoods, which is why I ask, **if I do move to Austin, which neighborhoods should I consider?**

In regards to life in Houston, I have lived in apartments in both Midtown and Rice Village, and ideally would like to move somewhere that I can conveniently access a good mix of restaurants, nightlife, intramural sport leagues (and other activities for making friends), etc.  As stated above, I am still single and am looking for something serious, so I would like to be in a good area to maximize my chances of meeting someone with long-term potential.  If I stay in Houston, then I will most likely just move to The Heights, but I am honestly not a huge fan of the area, which is why I am looking into Austin.  I am aware that Austin is more expensive than Houston, but I am willing to spend the extra money if the move seems worthwhile. **I know that Downtown is out of my price range, but ideally I would like to find a 1-bedroom apartment that is reasonably close to Downtown for under $1700/month.**

I appreciate all of your insight in advance.",Austin,"Austin, TX- Which Neighborhood?"

1770,1770,clearancelegalhelp,1580066018,eub6rm,Nan,"I ordered a Tyson's Tacos order at 11PM last night. But here's the thing: because they're out of my delivery area, I list my address as Tyson's Tacos address and in the special instructions I state the real address and add that I will tip BIG for people delivering this order. 

Now, I know this is a way to circumvent the system. However, delivery drivers accept this about 90% of the time and as a result I will tip them between $25-$50 for the drive (a 25-35 minute drive depending). The other 10% of the drivers don't accept it and the Favor gets cancelled. It's normally a mutually beneficial situation. However, in comes Carlos last night. Carlos accepts the Favor within a couple minutes of it being placed. Fast forward OVER AN HOUR. He still hasn't ordered food according to him. All of a sudden I get texts from Carlos. 

C: ""Hey I noticed the order was for a different address. That's 25 minutes away.""

OP: ""Yes, that's correct.""

C: ""Just to clarify, you'll tip really big yeah?""

OP: ""Yes, that's correct.""

C: ""OK""

Twenty minutes pass by. He has ordered food now. 

C: ""Hey, so how much are you going to tip, I'm skeptical at this point.""

I don't receive this text as I put my phone down and was watching a movie with the wife. 

Eight minutes pass by.

I get a 'delivered' notification. I check in and see that the driver has not delivered my food. I text Carlos. Carlos states ""Yeah I didn't get a reply about how big the tip would be so I delivered to the address in the original location ;)"". Like a cunt. Then immediately completes my order. So I can no longer text him. I text Favor support and was told sorry you're SOL. Even though he acknowledged the different address. Even though I've done this before. Here's where it really pisses me off: I called Tyson's Tacos. Turns out the guy got the order voided. So it will be refunded to his card. Yet Favor is still charging me for the whole cost of the order. 

I told Favor to send me their legal address because at this point I'm pissed off enough to just hire a lawyer to take them to small claims court and cost them money well beyond the \~$60 taco order. However, I wanted to see if anyone else had this type of experience with them?",Austin,Has Favor wrongly refused you a refund before?

Speaking of moving forward, who is Texas's name is in charge of whatever is going on at 183 and 71? Today I had the displeasure of coming back to town on 21 to 71 and due to incredibly bad road marking for the new ""traffic flow"" I found myself and what appeared to be an archeological dig to uncover an entire lost civilization, or a new a toll road.

We passed the exact spot where my wife got side swiped and right in front of us the same ballet played out between a sedan and a cargo van. The van came right out of the dig, cutting the sedan off to make 71 south. 

I really don't remember voting for this toll road.

How can the CTRMA approve such public works without us getting to vote on this crap? We can't build a party train from Austin to San Antonio, with a spur almost directly to Schlitterbahn and other glorious places in the Guadalupe Valley without half of Texas having to vote on it, but the CTRMA can just plop down a road like they were playing SimCity?

And while we are on the subject of the CTRMA, what is up with them jacking up existing highways, putting an A after the name and now charging us to drive on the same roads we already paid for via taxes? All they do is add a lane in a medium that use to be full of wild flowers and force us to drive on once was the feeder unless we put coin in what I am sure some donor of some back of the whole crazy Texas experience that is the CTRMA.

And if the CTRMA must rebrand our Texas highways into various toll roads, they should not be allowed to use the same names as the highways that already existed.

Maybe start them all with 900, so we all know we are paying.

At DPS the DL fee is $25 for the test and everything. This all smells of corruption to me. I bet some driving school owners lobbied hard to obtain such privileges.

1868,1868,kvngk3n,1580228156,ev7ijq,Nan,"Hey guys,

I’m from a medium sized school both across my state and the nation in terms of national ranking. It’s far from a community college, but it’s also not a big, nationally known school. I’m 23, currently majoring in business-finance with a 3.3 GPA with an expected gradation date winter on this year, if I take summer classes which I plan to do. Also, currently working as a long-term intern as a financial analyst for an automotive supplier. Post-graduation, I aspire to move to Austin, TX. Where I live currently, I’m ready for a change in scenery and I think Austin has so much of offer. In March, I’m coming down to the convention (I can’t put the name because it was removed last time I posted) and I’ve heard that it’s a great place to not only network, but to also try to nail a job that you’re searching for. As a finance major, I want to try to get that job in Asset Management but I’m flexible all over, IB and WM are both in play for me as well.

My questions are:

1.      For those with knowledge of Austin and the convention, what should/do I need to know on getting in to that field?

2.      I plan on taking business cards with me and a few resumes just in case, should I go tech savvy and get a QR code that can link to my LinkedIn account for those I don’t hand a resume to? I’ve had more positive feedback in terms of going this way than negative, leading me to really entertain the idea of it.

3.      Outside of the convention, what should I do and where should I go to try and put myself in a position that could lead to an interview/offer?

I know I won’t be graduating until December at the earliest, but I’ve seen/heard stories of people having job offers lined up after they graduate but that would be almost 9 months after I conclude my trip that I would be able to start working.

Thank you for any and all advice!",Austin,Coming to the convention

1930,1930,RelaxedChap,1580316636,evpfvv,Nan,"Short back story: When I bought my house back in early 2018, I replaced the standard doorbell with a Ring security doorbell. This past week I received a notice from my HOA that this is in violation of their bylaws. Essentially, nothing can be changed on the exterior of the house/property without their approval and a payment of $95 for their ""Engineering Firm"" to review any proposed changes. I am being told to revert any improvements I made and to go through the proper process or else I will be slapped with fines.

Question: Bylaws aside, are there any restrictions or reasonable timeframes that an HOA must bring violation notices against the homeowner? I've found that the HOA must provide notice within 30 days of determining that there is a violation, but (not surprisingly) I haven't found anything regarding if the HOA can or cannot pursue violations 22 months after the fact. **Does anyone know if such a restriction exists in Texas?**

Follow-up question: I receive a decent amount of packages delivered to my front door. Some neighbors have complained that their packages have been stolen by porch pirates, but I haven't had that problem. That being said, I have a Ring system and they do not. I'm guessing that any would-be thieves are leaving my house alone for easier prey. **Is there a Texas property law that protects homeowners from HOAs demanding limiting personal security on the property? Especially if it can be argued that said security is actively dissuading ne'er-do-wells?**",Austin,Question about Homeowner Rights vs HOA

I'm 21 years old making 28k a year in retail. Today my boss, who knows I'm interested in Cybersecurity and working on getting some basic certifications, told me about an interesting opportunity. There's an open position at our corporate office in Austin for an entry level Cybersecurity role. She said she would write me a letter of recommendation and personally contact corporate's HR about me applying. This new position (even at it's lowest estimation) would triple my salary, this is huge! 

But I don't know anyone in Austin, I think I have some distant cousins but that's it and I'm not even 100% on that. What's it like living in Austin? Is it a walkable city? Public transit? I live in a small town that you have to drive everywhere to get around. I'd be looking at a studio apartment since I don't know anyone. I'm in a relationship but my boyfriend is new to the military so he'd be moving around a lot for training (at least two years before he's settled at his first duty station and that might even be out of the country). Of course I want to be with him but it makes more financial sense for me to get started in my career before leaving my job to be with him. It'll beef up my resume and make it easier to apply for jobs with this experience when we do end up marrying and changing duty stations.

There seems to be a general attitude of ""go back to where you came from, you don't belong here"" towards anyone who has moved here recently or is planning on doing so. My parents live nearby in Hill Country, so it has always been my plan to move here too after college. I currently stay with them  about an hour away from Austin while I've sorted out the job search, saved up some money, and scoped out some apartments in/around the city.

Along the way I've come to this sub a few times for advice and just general questions about the city, and have ran into *so many* people with just the most piss poor attitudes. Things like: ""You won't be able to afford living here, you should leave"", ""Good luck getting a job in the most competitive city for new grads, not gonna happen"". I've been scoffed at for the idea that I'd be able to find a studio/1 bedroom for my budget under $1000 in the suburbs (which I have... there are many). Been called a joke and other things for expecting to find a job here at all with my Marketing degree (I have). And for suggesting that it's realistic to live by myself off an $18 an hr starting wage in the city/surrounding areas (it totally is). Clearly I've been told these things as an attempt to make me feel discouraged about my decision to move here.

I moved here because I love Austin and I think the good far outweighs the bad. And @ all of the Austin natives to whom this post doesn't apply to: Thank you for your advice and positive words of encouragement. I like to think that you are the ones who truly represent the city and what Austin is all about. 

**TL;DR Dear Austinites: If you no longer like what Austin has become because of people moving here from out of state, I have a wild suggestion for you:** ***Y******ou*** **can leave! Stop telling newcomers to go back to where they came from.

From his pitch, I misunderstood and thought $5/month gets you a bunch of HEB coupons in the mail. He gives you a $20 HEB gift card just for signing up. I hesitated so he added another $5 gift card and threw in the 2nd month free. And then I gave him my credit card like a dummy. 

I checked my email when I got home and read the terms of the receipt. It's for coupons and a $27/month digital subscription to the Austin American-Statesman, automatic billing. I'm setting a reminder to cancel before end of month so I don't get charged. 

The guy said he has to get 200 signups by this weekend and according to his list, he was almost at his goal. And they're doing the ticket raffle weekly so I'm sure they'll be at other HEBs too. He works for the Statesman, not HEB. So if you got suckered in like I did and didn't realize what you were signing up for, make sure to cancel timely.

I attended a Travis Audubon advocacy meeting last Tuesday after seeing a rendering of some of the planned highrise buildings coming in the next couple years. I have taken responsibility for helping in the collection of data on bird strikes downtown and around Austin, with the goal of compiling information to obtain pricing of 3M UV film for several buildings. 

The meetup has done iNaturalist bioblitz hikes in the past, and I plan on organizing more when spring rolls around and migration season begins, so we can combine a social hike with a fun and educational species collection game with prizes for winners who photograph the most species. We had great success with this last year and iNaturalist is kind of like Pokemon Go, but with real plants and animals. 

In the meantime, if you work downtown, or really anywhere in or near buildings with glass facades, I could really use your participation in this!

Download iNaturalist on your phone, and every time you find a bird at the base of a building that may have been killed by window strike or cat, upload a photo to this data set: 

""Austin Bird-Building Collisions""   
(You'll need to search under ""Projects"")

So far we have 47 species of birds but only a small number of contributions and contributors. Migration season is starting soon so we expect numbers to increase as it warms up. 


If you can help, we would be most grateful, it really makes a difference in preventing thousands of needless deaths, and the solution is simple, but we just need more info! Thanks so much!

2171,2171,HarmlessNormie,1580676985,exv24x,Ask Austin,"No matter which direction you're coming from, this intersection is stupid as hell.

Traffic going west can't turn left onto the bridge, not even at 3 AM when the coast is clear. How hard is it to add a flashing yellow arrow for a left turn timed to only activate when it isn't rush hour?

Traffic going south down 1st is constantly flirting with disaster. Morons are completely unable to stay in their lane as they wind around the intersection to continue down the bridge. You need to be hypervigilant and watch to see whether the mouthbreather to your left is drifting into your lane, which he probably is, in which case your only option is to drift into the lane to your right, and pray that the person in THAT lane is paying as close of attention as you were. Also, the second lane is only allowed to go straight down 1st, but idiots always think that both of the left two lanes are allowed to turn left. Often the person in the first lane is trying to legally continue straight while the person in the second lane is trying to complete their illegal left turn in front of them. Worst of all, I'm pretty sure the second lane was allowed to turn left two years ago, then they silently changed it one day to be straight only. So most people doing this might not even be idiots, they just haven't been downtown in awhile and are operating based on their prior memorization of how that intersection works.

Traffic going east and trying to make a right turn onto the bridge will have a green light in their dedicated right turn lane and assume that it means they can just go. Barely anyone notices the small unimportant-looking white sign with black text saying ""yield to pedestrians"", especially not people new to the city. Why the fuck don't they put an actual triangular red yield sign so the 14% of people in Austin who don't know much english who otherwise assume they are supposed to continue onward at 35 mph will instead know they are actually supposed to yield to pedestrians? Or I don't know, how about an actual fucking green and red arrow cycle for the dedicated right turn lane, like a normal city would have?

Fuck this intersection, its very existence makes me embarrassed to be here.",Austin,Why is the intersection at Cesar Chavez and 1st designed in such an idiotic way?

She was waiting for a green light in the 3rd left lane at the front of the line. There was also a left turn lane, aka the 4th lane, where there were people waiting for a green arrow or for westbound traffic to clear and yield turn left on Trinity. When it turned green, she spaced, and turned left...cutting off the people waiting in the actual left turn lane, but also hitting oncoming traffic, which was me. I slammed on my brakes but we still collided. Since we weren't injured and the cars weren't destroyed we moved over to the curb on Trinity as not to be blocking traffic.

In the moment, I was thinking about how awful I'd make traffic by staying in the middle of the intersection during morning rush hour. But in retrospect, since her insurance says they're not liable, I feel like I should've stayed and taken pictures right there. The cops wouldn't come out since there were no injuries and the cars weren't disabled.

The day before Christmas Eve, my best friend (and coworker) died very suddenly. It was very traumatic - it happened at work (andacross from mine). I called 911 immediately, and the paramedics worked on her for over an hour, but they couldn’t resuscitate her. She was 29, a month younger than me.

I’d really like to get a tattoo in her memory - there’s a phrase I have in mind already, and we had gotten tattoos together two months before she died, so it seems appropriate. Unfortunately, I don’t know any solid text tattoo artists here - I moved here from northern VA almost four years ago, and I’ve only gotten two tattoos in that time (Friday the thirteenth flash tattoos by a visiting artist).

2416,2416,please-help-mereddit,1580977204,ezpbjn,Nan,"Up until I was 7 I lived in Austin, I was born there. I remember loving the city, every day was great and I felt so good just waking down to the capital with my parents every week. It's my favorite memory and I cherish every thought of going to Barton springs. My parents moved to California to be closer to my grandmother in her final days. They sold everything they had in Austin, car and all. My mother Inherited the house and we stayed here ever since in a city that has been ranked California's most miserable city(that's true). 

I hate it here with all my heart but I'm 20 now and I've spent most of my life here. I have only visited Austin twice since I left and everytime I'm brought to tears when I have to board the flight back home. I met a girl here and it has been great, i brought her with me the 2 times I visited and she instantly fell in love with Austin.

 I took her to all the places I remember going to as a kid and a few more I didn't know about. She's from mexico originally but moved to California when she was 4 because her mother passed and she was handed off to her aunt. She said Austin strangely feels like home despite never living there. She has a very bad homelife as she's emotionally abused but has nowhere else to live.
 
We both decided a couple of months ago to move to Austin to continue school there at whichever school we got accepted to. Our schooling would be done in California but june of next year. She was so happy that we decided to do it. We're supposed to leave july of 2021 just in time for our classes here to end and classes in Austin to start. The only problem is that I found out we can't. I don't care much for politics and such so I won't try and get on my soapbox here but minimum wage is so low in Austin we can't afford to live there even if we're both working full time. 

She never stops talking about the move and how excited she is and I don't know how I'm going to tell her without breaking her heart. There's not enough time to save enough money to live in Austin for 2 years while we finish school. The only other option is to quit school here and be 4 semesters behind to maybe save enough money to move 2 years from now but even then we'd be on a short timer to finish school and find a better job. It's heartbreaking not being able to return to the city I love so much and I guess I just wanted to rant a bit to some people that might understand.",Austin,I used to live in Austin and now I feel like I can never go back

Anyway, I'm someone who loves to swim year round but NOT necessarily in an indoor over-chlorinated pool. I live outside of Tyler and all you can get this time of year in that realm is an indoor salty pool at a fitness center. Thus, Barton Springs really appeals to me, and last Tue I was off work, it was in the 70s and sunny, and I said ""heck with it"" &amp; went and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I was so in my element--so much so, I have said if I could afford to live in Austin &amp; could tolerate city life (neither of which are the case) I'd do so simply for Barton Springs alone.

(Well, I couldn't handle the over the top ""doggie culture,"" I am ok with dogs in principle but as a peace and quiet type of person I'd be very intolerant of barking from the neighbor's pets or loose dogs harassing me or our kids uninvited in public, but anyway.)

Here are my questions.

Where I live, about an hr away, we have a similar spot called Camp Tonkawa, it also has an underground spring situation where the water temperature is rather constant all year (although it's a BIT colder), but they won't let me jump in, or sometimes they do but they go on and on about how ""crazy"" I am, constantly coming around asking me ""are you sure you should be doing this? What if you get hypothermia"" and I want to scream ""just leave me alone, I'm not a child, and they do this l all the time in Austin like it's the most normal thing."" I mean, if the water is in fact warm enough, what's so crazy about what I'm doing? I swear I want to grab those people and show them what everyone, not just me, was doing at Barton Springs (BS) last Tuesday. It's not weird.

Two, I know BS closes on Thursday for cleaning, and they periodically close for weeks for maintenance. Does anyone know when the next scheduled such longer closing is scheduled? We 4 may vacation there this upcoming March.

Three, I found a spot on the ""walkway"" near a canoe renting business where you can jump in and someone even put ladder steps on the tree and a rope swing, and the water was DEEP there. Wouldn't swimming be disallowed there?

Lastly, other spots in the area that would be suitable for March. Jacob's Well, I'm told they have a ""swimming season"" but I believe it also has a constant temperature year round. Couldn't you still jump in ""out of season"" so long as no one notices? Deep Eddy, how does it compare to Austin?

(I know you also have Hamilton Pool and Wimberley among other spots, but I can't imagine they would be suitable until at least April.)

I may have other questions, but that's all for now.",Austin,"Wonderful Day at Barton Springs Last Tue (77'F &amp; Sunny), Comments-Questions"

Hello r/Austin,

I am pleased to tell you all that I have enabled the Austin area on the Plan Together Platform. Austin was chosen due to a growing urban renewal and community improvement movement.

Plan Together is a website which allows citizens to freely collaboratively discuss and plan the future of their communities. Users are able to post items to a map, each tagged as a suggestion, news, criticism or praise. Other users can comment on these items; leading to ideas, understanding and unique viewpoints to surface. To better understand how this works, please visit the site.

I am very excited about this project. It is my hope that by empowering users to talk about the world around them it can change their attitude towards their communities. Most people believe their voice and input end with their house or apartment; I want the scope of their belief to include their streets, parks, communities, and cities. As Plan Together grows and municipal officials and planners begin to use the platform's information gathering and analysis tools, a new continuous, iterative, relationship-based urban planning paradigm will hopefully emerge.

Feedback is appreciated and have fun on Plan Together!

Thanks,
David",Austin,Austin Area is now Enabled on Plan Together (Map-based Community Planning Discussion Platform)

This is probably equal parts emotional venting, PSA, and advice seeking. (If you are one of the homeless-hating-and-proud, people - g’head and take a knee on this one.) 

I’ll keep the details sparse, I’ve lived in the Aboretum/Great Hills area of Austin for about half a decade. My immediate block is the type of place that posts on NextDoor “Some a guy with a backpack just letting you know, just in case!” USUALLY. 

Anyway - last Thursday night, my partner is leaving for a rare third shift at 2:00AM. He opens the door and there’s someone standing on our porch by the front door (standing so close the door hits him when it’s opened) the guy says “Good morning!” And saunters off like it was totally normal. I figure it’s a weird one off, but double check the locks. 

Monday night I’m crashed out and hear someone trying to open sliding door from the patio to my bedroom. I had a friend from out of town (a 300 pound mountain of a friend) sleeping on the couch in the living room. I tiptoe to the living room and tell him what’s going on - he throws the lights on and opens the door, no one is there. He walks around the perimeter of the place, talks loudly, looks around - no one. I decide maybe I was dreaming or it was an animal or something. 

Just now, I walk out to my patio and see my bike has been hoisted over my 4ft fence (and abandoned possibly when realized it was locked) and my patio furniture is moved around. I notify the neighborhood association who is unsurprised. Theres a new homeless encampment half a block from my place between the office park off 360 and the woods between the apartments building across the street. 

I am sympathetic to the homeless issues in our city, but this has scared the shit out of me. I feel very helpless. I don’t want to just surrender that “that’s just how our neighborhood is now.” I’m creeped out that when I’m walking the dog there’s could be ANYBODY hiding in the woods.

Has anyone else experienced something like this in other neighborhoods? How did you handle it? These people have to go somewhere, there isn’t a good solution for them right now so what are they supposed to do? But then again...please don’t take my stuff. Especially don’t look in my windows or make me resent your presence.  

Conflicting feelings. IS there a way to coexist with down ‘n out people getting desperate?

I've been cleaning houses, pet sitting, and driving for Favor and Lyft during this time because I can choose when I work and adjust my schedule daily according to my needs. Now that I'm doing better, I would like a more ""formal"" job but I need to take it easy at first. Some people have suggested Goodwill to me but that's not something I would be happy doing. I'll likely keep doing these freelancing things on the side but I'm tired of having to \*hustle\* for every dollar.

My skills and background: extensive experience in the service industry/retail, office management/retail store management. I do have a BS in earth sciences as well as some graduate school and teaching experience. I'm comfortable with computers and tech, I have a GIS certification and experience in data analysis. I wouldn't mind a job in these areas but I don't know where to start looking. I feel like it would be easy for me to get another service industry job but if I go that route I think I would do better in back of house - I definitely do not want to wait tables or stand at a register. I need something part time as well. I don't really want to get any more education at this point though I am open to it in the future.

I would appreciate any help brainstorming, or if yall know of any specific employers that are good to check out where the company culture is understanding of the challenges people face when returning to work, please let me know! Thanks!",Austin,I'm re-entering the workforce after having to take time off due to medical reasons - can yall help me think of places that would be understanding to this and jobs that aren't too mentally taxing?

I recently interviewed and received and offer from Samsung Austin Semiconductor in Pflugerville for their entry level engineering rotation program (CORP). I was wondering if anyone on here happened to work/has worked for SAS and could give me an unbiased view of what working there was like? Specifically, what the work-life balance is like? Almost all the glassdoor reviews seem to indicate that SAS is a fast paced, stressful environment where, if you work in engineering, you have to work super long hours and will undoubtedly get put on the shift schedule at some point. In addition to this, nobody I talked to during the interview actually sounded enthusiastic about working there. They all emphasized that SAS was a fast paced environment and that not everyone can adjust to ""Korean culture"" (Working 46-50 hour work weeks). All these things seem to indicate to me that SAS is a terrible place to work, which, I find really unfortunate because it was a good offer and Austin seemed like such a beautiful city to me. I guess truthfully I have a good idea of what life is like at SAS, but I just wanted some final confirmation.

I love running, hiking, biking, and live music (not a big drinker) but I tend to be a bit antisocial, so as a young guy in his early 20s, the prospect of living within walking distance of the Barton greenbelt and Lady Bird Lake is really exciting to me.  I've looked at the Domain as well, but the apartments seemed shoddily constructed and...well...my view would be a Dilliard's.  Any thoughts?  I have no student loan debt, so I can afford a studio at Skyhouse, Camden Rainey, The Bowie, etc. but I'm just trying to decide if the lifestyle is worth it.

TL;DR Downtown worth the money?  Or drive in on the weekends from suburbia?",Austin,Is living downtown worth the long commute/rent?

He alone flat-out killed CodeNEXT which would have allowed granny-flats and other actual affordable housing and I'll never understand why. I'd love to see a true progressive like Greg Casar be the mayor of this still-awesome city some day.

So I'm not Adler's biggest fan but yet I see this continued trope that he and city council are somehow profiteering off of the homeless crisis by Austin spending a record 64 million to do something about the problem while Abbott and Texas do as little as possible while somehow trying to grandstand. Simple question: where?

And where is this corruption supposedly happening? Anybody have even an anecdote as to how this corruption is supposedly happening?


While Abbott berates us in Austin as if we caused all the homeless in Texas and while he offers no money or real shelters or jobs programs like Austin tries to provide, but hey, he's got a spot a hundred people can camp at!

**Want to take action?** First, make sure you've [filed an official rezoning protest](https://fileyourprotest.com/?link_id=6&amp;can_id=e792ae2d1751ec17dd0f5b98fa367ccd&amp;source=email-tell-city-hall-to-slow-rezoning-plan-down&amp;email_referrer=email_722576&amp;email_subject=city-holding-vote-on-next-codenext-tomorrow). Once you've done so, our legal team believes the City of Austin will be unable to legally rezone your property without support from three-fourths of the city council (9 of 11 votes).

Then consider attending the council meetings being held [today](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/mps2/c/FwE/ni0YAA/t.2z7/5TCXsIyYRfmVDYrEbRLiSw/h7/MqBMdYgxou6YqMdAfhhdDwL841GxznVzQmCFIbqwzBixWTjuzrNJwawPH7jkYpqGq3eThaXZNPP1irPc9bQR-2FyiIki65hUNhgLDbsfdn4wdDAWVrf8v6xwNWm9NZY0WtksO5o7MTgsuToGzCzQa1fU1OiFR-2FBbR0EkMR1JULcd-2FE2AT9T57hSwWS6QeTg9SE0xb-2B-2Bdodqg2q-2BEFD8XqlfrjGQxREHBukWiicPCNQLXsnOznRegK6pWuiNda0wTgk14XKzjdr1TLIC-2FYoY3Okmp4ePSMH3cBu-2BqKfbaUN7ag3Gl0Q2KXVNdsRG9XkrVnEoY5thWz0toCFwKCMOrC3dQ-3D-3D/asRM) and [tomorrow](https://u1584542.ct.sendgrid.net/mps2/c/FwE/ni0YAA/t.2z7/5TCXsIyYRfmVDYrEbRLiSw/h8/MqBMdYgxou6YqMdAfhhdDwL841GxznVzQmCFIbqwzBixWTjuzrNJwawPH7jkYpqGY4Q3YeuuLbn4MCVemFzGxGsy1hYfPryNSkI6gXc7kICb6J5FN4O-2FnhrI55p9BoVtPCzXgKPRB-2BdelED1ASUMJyN-2BiNfX7o8XkF33U5-2FPxBYVtdFPF6Lxw09zP12LRz-2B3KIhjvlF150SdPrXnXuRLDr1Iik-2BTzEZX54O6i5Vh6U3P2z1Q32WfW3xG4jF7pH0Cy2yOFeUDZ5nGEVT-2FtMa0Og0ccv7S0H3X58-2FIC1DDZ2QfUzUbh-2Fkm4d6E-2F218tr-2FPXLngI3zlerbkXTfPHVNKwg-3D-3D/KGHA).

Public transit, and the large investment required is currently a talking point for the growth of Austin, but I am of the mindset that it is not a practical solution for Austin, or cities in the south in general. Summer heat, and the sprawled out nature of the city are not selling points, and often I see empty buses/trains blocking 50-100 cars of people so 5 people can use them.

Wouldn't a smarter use of Austin's time/money be to optimize future growth for the coming autonomous vehicle wave? I could envision an infrastructure set-up that allows vehicle speeds in the order of 100+ mph, or an intelligent traffic/vehicle communication network that could optimize traffic around the city via automatic navigation re-routing via the swarm of autonomous vehicles.

2989,2989,hollow_hippie,1581714893,f3yx57,Nan,"&gt; AUSTIN, Texas - A 24-year-old has been arrested and charged with aggravated kidnapping, a first-degree felony after he had physically assaulted the older sister of his friend and forced her into his car. The suspect then brought the victim to his house in southeast Austin and wouldn't allow her to leave until police officers arrived. 
&gt; 
&gt; Police were dispatched to the home after a friend of the victim called dispatch for a welfare check around 12:30 a.m. on Wednesday, February 12. When officers arrived on the scene, the victim was crying, very distraught and only wearing a bra and underwear.
&gt; 
&gt; Police officers also noted she had visible injuries, including heavy bruising from her toes to her knees on both legs, bruising to her hands and inside of her upper arms, swelling to her face and lip, bruising under her right eye and some slight bleeding from her mouth.  
&gt; 
&gt; Despite it being cold and raining, the victim quickly exited the house. 
&gt; 
&gt; Officers spoke with the suspect, Alejandro Ruiz, who told police officers that the victim was his girlfriend. Ruiz told officers that he had picked her up from her home earlier that night and that the two had gotten into an argument about text messages. Ruiz claimed that when he attempted to leave, the victim became physical with him and forced herself into his car. 
&gt; 
&gt; When officers asked Ruiz how the victim got her injuries, he claimed the victim was intoxicated and fell down several times as well as ran into a wall. Police officers also noted in the affidavit the Ruiz was very condescending with them and irritated with their questions. 
&gt; 
&gt; The victim told police officers that she was not and never has been in a dating or intimate relationship with Ruiz. She also said that she only knows Ruiz as her little brother's friend, according to the affidavit. According to the victim, she had texted Ruiz around 4 p.m. asking him if he could bring her some marijuana. Ruiz did not message her back so the victim went downtown with some friends. 
&gt; 
&gt; Around 8 p.m., the victim took an Uber home. When she arrived at her house, she said Ruiz was waiting for her and that he was intoxicated and angry that she had not texted him back earlier. The victim told police that she went into her house after Ruiz got angry and grabbed her cellphone from her.
&gt; 
&gt; Ruiz followed her into her home without her consent and grabbed her. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ruiz then forcefully pulled the victim outside and began to drag her towards his vehicle. The victim attempted to hit Ruiz to get away but was unable. According to the victim, Ruiz was pulling her by her pants, which were nylon tights. The tights were pulled off her body, along with her shoes, while Ruiz was forcing her into his vehicle. The victim said she was left in just her underwear, bra, and a tank top. 
&gt; 
&gt; The victim attempted to get out of the vehicle and continued to yell and beg with Ruiz as he drove her to his house. 
&gt; 
&gt; Once at his house, Ruiz grabbed the victim by her hair and forced her into the home. At the house, the victim was forced into Ruiz's bedroom. The victim could hear Ruiz talking to his aunt and another man in the house and they were telling him to let her go. The aunt brought the victim some ice for her face, which was swollen.
&gt; 
&gt; The victim asked Ruiz to let her text her friend to let her know she was okay. Ruiz agreed but said he would take the phone back immediately after. While in the bathroom, the victim texted her friend that she was in trouble and attempted to call 911. Ruiz caught the victim and made her disconnect the call. 
&gt; 
&gt; Shortly after, police officers arrived at the house to perform a welfare check. 
&gt; 
&gt; 24-year-old Alejandro Ruiz was arrested and charged with aggravated kidnapping. His bond was set at $40,000.",Austin,Suspect charged with kidnapping friend's older sister

I've been around the culture long enough to get it, and besides being a lot less friendly these days, people are pretty much the same.

3029,3029,foxphace,1581787293,f4cg1z,PSA,"I only chose this place because it was close to me, in network, and open on Saturdays- so I figured why not. 

When I called to schedule the appointment, I was redirected to a call center where they kept pushing their free orthodontist/braces exam.... even after I said multiple times I had already had had braces as a teen and I still have a permanent retainer. That should have been my warning to run. 

My first appointment was canceled. I figured, ok no big deal. I was rescheduled for the next week.

I get to my 9:15am appointment early, as that’s the polite thing to do. It took them 55 minutes to enter my information from my new patient paperwork. During this time NOTHING was said to me, and the front desk staff was watching the movie that was playing in the waiting room. There was certainly no sense of urgency. 

After I was finally called, they took me back to do XRays. I definitely did not ask for XRays, but I figured since I do need to get my wisdom out soon, it would probably be for the best. 

The tech doing the XRays really seemed to be struggling. It took her 40 minutes to do them. Never in my life have I had dental X-rays take more than 10 minutes. She kept dropping the equipment and kept having to open up new bags of the plastic pieces.  I felt like I was being punkd. She also had really horrendous body odor. She was a sweet girl but the smell was really overpowering and I was struggling with the fact she was putting things in my mouth with potentially lacking hygiene.  

After XRays I was taken over to the cleaning chair FINALLY after almost 2 hours. I proceeded to wait about 15 more minutes before I up and left. I got the hell out of there when I took a good long look around at the room I was in... and it was filthy. There was dirt and all kinds of gunk caked on the floor. I would seriously put money on the fact that floor has not seen a mop or broom or swiffer in months. I’ve worked in healthcare before, and every facility should be sparkling from top-to-bottom, with a daily cleaning schedule. They definitely do not have one. 
I thought, Christ— if their floors are this ill-kept what the hell are they doing with the rest of the equipment?

3096,3096,dotastories,1581867519,f4s8lx,Nan,"I was walking through an apartment complex in South Austin, and a pitbull with no leash ran out of some bushes to me and seemed friendly before becoming VERY aggressive and barking and snarling and following me. Its owner could be heard yelling the dogs name, but it was honestly a terrifying experience and the owner didn't even leave his front porch or run over to get his dog or do anything except just tell his dogs name.... This seems highly dangerous and irresponsible... I don't know exactly which apartment he was in, but I know the building. Should I report this to somebody? The dog was VERY aggressive and letting a dog like that just roam off it's leash seems pretty bad... The owner didn't even start calling his dogs name until after it had been barking and following me for a bit so clearly they weren't even supervising the dog... I don't want anyone to get hurt, not even the dog, I feel that the owner needs to be spoken to regarding this.

He typically puts them out a little before 7am and leaves them outside pretty much all day until around 11pm.  He never walks them, just puts them out back.

Unfortunately my family and I like to use our backyard.  I grill a lot, my kids play back there.  This of course makes his dog bark even worse.  He then responds by blowing an airhorn at my kids in an attempt to chase us out of our own yard.  He's even yelled at my kids ""harassing his dogs"" because in his mind us simply being outside means we're the problem.

The bad news for him is, we're going to use our yard.  My question to y'all is, can I do something legally about this?

The road network is already in a grid. I see this horrible traffic from commuters and I just don't understand why we aren't allowing 30-story residential high rises in all parts of Austin that are within biking range of the central business core. Who says downtown needs to stop at IH35? 

And before you comment. I have three points:

1) This has nothing to do with gentrification. I feel the same way about Tarry Town. Imagine if NYC still had protected ""historic neighborhoods"" in Manhattan (that are only 60 years old). I can't think of a bigger example of government protecting a spoiled minority to hurt the masses. My intent is not to attack any neighborhoods or any class or color of people. I only want to attack the people thinking that they deserve a single story existence while living in the urban core.

2) People are going to get priced out no matter what. With the 3-story/duplex/fourplex garbage they're pushing now the home/rent prices are still rising. New houses are being built in E. Austin and they aren't affordable, regardless if you restrict the height. I would even argue that heigh restrictions speed up gentrification in a sought-after neighborhood (see my point below on drastically increasing supply). 

3) I feel like the ony way to reduce the price of square footage is to flood the market with square footage. If adding 500SF to a house adds another $100,000 to market value, maybe we have a drastic shortage of SF here. I feel like this is economics 101. Here's an example, you have 300 tech bros wanting to live within walking distance of downtown. You can either put them in one luxury tower taking up a block, or you can house them in 200 luxury converted bungalows in E. Austin spread out down 20 blocks. I'll let you guess which one keeps the neighborhood affordable for longer.

Can anyone explain the economics on how restricting building height ends up creating affordable housing? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.",Austin,Why aren't we getting serious about developing E. Austin?

* We will be seeing MST3k at the Paramount at 7 p.m.

* Looking for a coffee shop near the Blanton Museum of Art as we want to start the day there. Alternative museum options we are definitely open to. Love art, cool installations, natural history (y'know dinosaurs).

* Stroll through the capital after that and hopefully find a good lunch spot. 

* After the show we want to check out some of the bars like Garage or Seven Grand. Then maybe walk back up toward the capital to check out The Cloak Room and the Texas Chili Parlor. 


**Monday**

* We always like to do a ""brewery"" day when we visit a city, so, we thought we would venture down to West Congress.

* Again, hoping to start at a coffee shop. I've saved this place called ""Spokesman.""

* We're going to try to check out (512)Brewery, Skull Mechanix, St. Elmo, Still Austin Whiskey.

* Wanting to swing by the Cathedral of Junk on our way to or from (512).

* Is S. Congress okay to walk up past the highway toward downtown or should we maybe just uber? A friend of ours suggested the Beer Garden Brewing and it's a little out of the way. 

* Still trying to figure out a good way to end this area. We would like to stop by Tacos Las Amazonas Estilo Jalisco for food.


**Tuesday**

* This day we figure we would go check out East Cesar Chavez. Coffee at Figure 8?

* Get some BBQ from Micklethwait's and dinner at Kemuri Tatsu-Ya

* Planning to walk up and down East 7th and hit more breweries/shops/murals. 

* And on Wednesday as we go to catch the plane we figured we would hit up Juan in a Million for breakfast. 


So, yeah, rough plans. We love coffee and beer and good cocktails. Wanting to try at least one BBQ place but most seem to be closed Monday/Tuesday so our options were limited. We're not the most outdoorsy (meaning forests), but do love urban trekking and want to get to some of the awesome murals we keep hearing about. Definitely would love to chill at a dive bar and sip fernet, too.

Thanks y'all! Can't wait!",Austin,Our upcoming trip to Austin: What do you think of this itinerary?

&amp;#x200B;

RM1 zone is the new transition zone for single family homes on select busy streets. I looked up the RM1 zoning for the transition zones, and was surprised. You cannot cover a lot in housing like Mountain View. You are limited to 60% impervious cover, and while that is obviously greater than the 45% for a single family home, you don't get 60% to build a duplex. In fact, duplex's are still at the same 45%. Impervious coverage is the same until 3 units (50%). Four and five units get 55% and 6 units get 60%.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is pretty well thought out. Large single family homes on small lots aren't going anywhere anytime soon. It just won't make sense unless the impervious coverage was more relaxed. But small homes on big lots zoned RM1 should be developed differently. Instead of becoming a huge house on a huge lot, I would think they would turn into at least three housing units in order to get the extra impervious cover.",Austin,Proposed RM1 Zoning Thoughts

Typically I'm told ""this is where the homeless people are"" to justify the location.  

If the homeless people want to be near these services, wouldn't this be a chicken v egg situation?

The only common explanation that
makes any sense is the people that work for the service providers... for some reason they want to be in downtown.

Hypothesis - the people who choose to work in human services supporting the homeless prefer to work downtown, rather than outside the city.  This choice makes the services expensive and forces homeless into downtown.

I have been working for a university in town (lets call it Big Cow), now in my 4th semester of employment.  The entire time I have been working, I have been designated as an Independent Contractor, and given 1099 forms. 
 Recently, the university program has been imposing more restrictions on my work and changing policies without notifying me, leading me to look at texas employment laws, and it sure seems like I should have this entire time been designated as an employee, and not a contractor.  
I am not a legal expert by any means, but am basing my opinion on the requirements defined in this chart

She couldn't get him to answer his phone so she called my husband, who also got no answer.  They still don't know why he died at such a young age so the body hasn't been released yet. The memorial is this Saturday and frankly, it's horrible. We are taking his wife food but want to do something for his daughter. for perspective, we gave his daughter a piano we got for free, she's taking lessons, and we've babysat her before so the mother trusts us.

We want to give mom a break and take her daughter somewhere fun for the afternoon, and also to let her know that she isn't forgotten about either. Most of the attention has been on the mom, not the 8 year old girl who lost her dad.

So, anyone have any suggestions? I thought of The Thinkery. A movie is ok but we want to do something special for her. She calls my husband, ""Uncle \[Name\]"".

My husband and his friend saw each other every single day. They lived across the hall when we lived in apartments and he came over every night. We moved to a new neighborhood and he moved a couple blocks away so they could still hang out. He called my husband every night to come hang out. Once, my husband found their dog after it got out one 4th of July, it was 2 days later in a ravine, alive.

they were like brothers and we always watched out for each other, their last words to each other were, ""I love you man"" and they fist bumped and my husband drove home. 

The wife was more standoffish but still liked us, she's kind of a loner. I've taken her food and she was extremely grateful for that. I don't want the daughter to feel left out, so we want to treat her as well.

I’ve always admired Austin from a far, but have never done a ton of research into it. My homebase will be based out of Creedmoor, but we travel all over, as I work on transmission lines.
They will be starting me at 17 an hour, and hours can go anywhere from 40 a week upwards to 80. So there’s a lot of overtime, but nothing is guaranteed. As for perdiem 90-200 depending how far I am from home. 

I am 23, have a girlfriend not sure if she is coming, and have a dog. I am just so overwhelmed I don’t even know where to begin looking for places. Unfortunately I don’t have a lot of disposable income until the new checks kick in, so that is something I have to keep in mind when looking for apartments.",Austin,I am moving to Austin in 11 days and I am so overwhelmed.

I know this because we arrived for a 6:45 reservation a bit late and ""Find My Mac"" pinged at the Guerro's outdoor patio area between Guerro's and Hopdoddy at 7:14pm when they wiped it.

The thieves broke the driver's side rear window in my vehicle and grabbed the backpack that was sitting on the floorboards behind my seat. In it were such gems as my 3 month old old MacBook Pro which I use for work and is maxed out well beyond a consumer model such that it's...very expensive. Also, several hundred dollars in cash, several more in dongles and hubs, a backup drive for another computer (encrypted), several micro SD cards with photos and movies on them (all backed up elsewhere), some IDs and my passport card, tax docs, and...some drawings and cards from my children that I kept with me always because they were very meaningful to me. I have a complete bootable encrypted backup of the computer that was stolen in an offsite location that was performed within the last week. None of the data is easily accessible and it's all backed up elsewhere such that if anyone even connects the computer to the internet and it phones home, I will have the IP address. 

The personal effects alone are worth a lot to me. The computer obviously has intrinsic value. This post is my  attempt to appeal to the thieves' better nature with the lure of cold hard cash. If you have my bag and my laptop, let me know. More so than pawning it or selling it on Ebay. I will make it  worthwhile to you and I will not report you to the police.

And if anyone has good tips on how to get it back, please let me know. I have already filed a police report, Find My has been set to ""Lost"" so it will alert me if it shows up anywhere. I will attempt to get camera footage from Hopdoddy and Guerro's tomorrow. The bag is a black (with gray and red trim) OGIO laptop backpack and it was stolen from a vehicle that is easy to identify in my post history. My business card is inside. Call me if you have it. Or send me a PM. 

I suffer from anxiety, and this has only exacerbated it and put tremendous stress on me and my family. I am blessed to be in a position not to have anxiety about money, so if someone took this to sell it and they want easy cash, I have a simple trade to offer you. Just reach out and we can both have a better week next week. Thx.",Austin,"STOLEN! Laptop and Bag, along with sensitive personal documents, stolen from SoCo parking lot near Hopdoddy Friday night.

I thought these things were already paid using funds from the sales tax and property taxes we pay.

I stayed in 1 lane the whole time and barely pressed my brakes. Everyone felt in sync almost. It was crowded but it felt efficient.

He initially stopped, claiming he did not see the red light, that he was looking at the light after that which was green.  He pulled out his ID but took it back before my mom could get his name when she told him she wanted to call the police.   He failed to provide any insurance information. He then proceeded to hide his license plate with his coat before she could take it down.   He wrapped his license plate with his coat, shut the back of his car door to keep the coat tucked in place.  My mom got this picture of him before that, in which he stood in front of the plate.  Then he got back in his Ford Escape and drove off, my mom chasing him in her car for blocks before he got away.  She called the police after that.  The female police officer was rolling her eyes at my mom and said it was not a “hit and run” because the driver initially stopped before he drove off.  He was gone before the police could come.   Both APD and UT police were very unsympathetic and mocking of my mom.  This was bullying by the police, and gravely mishandled.

Don't sell Texas whiskey short. There is some crazy good and unique stuff being produced. The flavors are intense and full. Do they taste exactly like Kentucky Bourbon? No. And that's a good thing. Texas whiskey is its own category. It has its own special and unique flavor profiles that you can't find anywhere else. Part of it is the extreme temperature shifts and the local grain/water.

One I recommend: Balcones FR.OAK Single Malt. Absolutely stunning! I put this head to head with any Scotch/Bourbon on the market at its price point. Its amazing.

Then of course we have the Wizard Academy with the Whiskey Vault and the Whiskey Tribe. Which is quickly becoming the capital of whiskey fandom in America. It already is the biggest Whiskey channel on Youtube.

SXSW is upon us and the mod team wanted to clarify what our posting/content policy for SXSW is.

We generally take a hands off approach and allow downvotes to steer content. For specific SXSW content though, we'll be exercising a bit more moderation.

We will remove event promotion, deal promotion, sxsw-related promotion of any sort, as well as questions specifically about sxsw, wristbands, what to do/where to go for specific sxsw events, etc. We'll also ask that the removed content be reposted to /r/sxsw if applicable.

As for other semi-related to austin SXSW content, such as ""Best ways to get around Austin during SXSW"", they will not be removed.

Feel free to ask us any questions about this.

**2020 Update**

Yes - we're aware that this year's SXSW also increases the risk of COVID-19 being transmitted in the Austin area.  

We will still remove repeated posts about it - there are already threads to discuss it in. As soon as a case is reported in the Austin area, we will sticky a post with relevant info and remove reposts that repeat the same thing.",Austin,SXSW Content Policy 2020 Edition

I am a student at UT and it was late at night. I didnt wanna walk to pizza press so ended up parking at the 7-eleven that is 50 feet from Pizza Press. 

The only reason I did this was because the road that provides entry way to Pizza Press was and has been under construction for weeks. I can't access the pizza press parking lot, and as such, had to park in 7-eleven. 

As I left this lady was giving me the stink eye the entire time, I felt weird but decided it was okay and grabbed my pizza. Max 10 minutes. 

I come back and my car has a wheel lock on it. I ask ""you made eye contact with me the entire time and you couldn't even bother signaling or telling me I can't park here?"" She says it isn't her job. There is also a sign that says no leaving the property after parking here.

To clarify - I did check on resident advisor and it looks mostly like crap here in Austin. All i could see here is either EDM or some one time gigs of decent djs from good labels but in a ""concert buy tickets"" style hosted mainly by the same people and in the same venues they play their stupid EDM most of the time. So no, these are not my people :(
Where are you my industrial rebels, freedom warriors and hyperspace astronauts? What are the spots, IG handles, after parties that don't stop till the last dancers, where are the parties where people don't take pictures because nobody cares about phones, only care about enjoying the music in a mutually respectful non judging atmosphere, protecting the vibe.

Sorry, I just had to get this off my chest. It doesn't matter who you vote for, what party you're a member of, everyone deserves anonymity. 

/rant",Austin,This is my first time voting in a primary. I cannot believe that they have openly separate lines for Democrats and Republicans.

Here are a list of grievances:

1. Predatory management is trying to nickel and dime you. Apartments are overpriced and poorly managed. Maintenance takes forever to come. Parking fees are ridiculous, and rent just goes up every year.

2. The elevators break on a regular basis. For what you pay, it's absolutely not justifiable. 

3. Bullshit fines. There are people who leave literal trash on the floor in the trash rooms, but if you oh so dare to not properly fold your cardboard box in the recycling bin, you get hit with a fine. This is so unjust and a blatant cash grab that it makes me physically ill. 

4. Back to poor management, we had loud neighbors for like months and management didn't do shit about it for weeks. Almost got the cops involved.

5. You can't even use the amnesties downstairs like the pool or grill because it's locked basically 24/7. So we're paying extra for nothing, thanks s1909!

6. Another story of management incompetence: the fire alarms were going off for no reason during the day, and at night the idiot management forgot to leave someone here. The fire alarm went off at 4:30 AM, waking everybody up, and it took like half an hour for the firemen to get here, who were pretty pissed off themselves at the management for not having someone here. 

7. Unfriendly management. A while back I was looking for this mail that never came in that was pretty important to me, and the manager just looked annoyed that I had the audacity to bother her day. Real classy.

At this time, there are no plans by the City of Austin to postpone or delay South by Southwest (SXSW) due to COVID-19. The Austin Public Health Department will continue to monitor the situation, and provide updates as necessary. The health of the Austin community and those who visit our City is our highest priority and we advise SXSW attendees to practice personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, avoiding touching their face with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a sleeve or bent elbow. We also ask that individuals who are sick not attend this or other public events to help in protecting the community from influenza and other respiratory illnesses.


If local public health officials report any change in their assessment and recommendation, immediate action will be taken.  Know also that this situation is being constantly monitored and re-evaluated daily. Our public health officials are in constant communication with other professionals in cities across the country evaluating information and practices from around the world.


On Wednesday, March 4th, at 10am, the City of Austin will hold a press conference to discuss COVID-19 with Interim Health Authority, Dr. Escott, Mayor Adler, and Travis County Judge Eckhardt. Watch it live: http://www.austintexas.gov/page/watch-atxn-live

4349,4349,prodromal96,1583342966,fdgf2z,Ask Austin,"Hi all,

I’m originally from Boston but have been living in San Diego for two years. I’m interested in maybe going to graduate school in austin. However, I have some major concerns.

1) heat. In Boston, summers are typically in the 80s, with any day above 90 being sort of noteworthy. It gets very humid as well. You definitely get sweaty. However, I’ve heard that Austin can be over 100 for many days in the summer and even for months. That sounds really rough. But I’m wondering if the humidity is less severe than Boston?

2) allergies. I suffer from seasonal allergies pretty much everywhere I go, and am a notoriously sneezy person. I’m very concerned about how I’ll fare with the intense polllen and other allergens that I’ve heard about in Austin.

3) growing up in Boston, I’m not really used to seeing large bugs or many bugs at all. Unfortunately I’ve become rather phobic of them, which I would like to overcome, but I still think It’s going to be a bit much for me to all of a sudden encounter large spiders and crickets everywhere, or worse, those flying roaches I’ve read about. What has been your experience?

4) living in the middle of the country vs a coast. I don’t really even like going to the beach, but it’s always been something that was available. Do you ever feel trapped/ like you’re in the middle of nowhere?

Thanks!",Austin,Has anyone moved here from Boston?

At this time, there are no plans by the City of Austin to postpone or delay South by Southwest (SXSW) due to COVID-19. The Austin Public Health Department will continue to monitor the situation, and provide updates as necessary. The health of the Austin community and those who visit our City is our highest priority and we advise SXSW attendees to practice personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, avoiding touching their face with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a sleeve or bent elbow. We also ask that individuals who are sick not attend this or other public events to help in protecting the community from influenza and other respiratory illnesses.


If local public health officials report any change in their assessment and recommendation, immediate action will be taken.  Know also that this situation is being constantly monitored and re-evaluated daily. Our public health officials are in constant communication with other professionals in cities across the country evaluating information and practices from around the world.


On Wednesday, March 4th, at 10am, the City of Austin will hold a press conference to discuss COVID-19 with Interim Health Authority, Dr. Escott, Mayor Adler, and Travis County Judge Eckhardt. Watch it live: http://www.austintexas.gov/page/watch-atxn-live

I’ve shopped at HEBs all over Austin before and since, and I haven’t had any other tortilla chips like that batch. Did HEB change its recipe? Is it trying an experiment with a new one?

I am moving to Austin soon, and do not know anyone, so I am looking at various intramural sports leagues as means of making friends early on.  Would any of you possibly be able to advise regarding which leagues and sports are the best for meeting new people and making friends? 

I ask because typically some leagues/sports are more focused on the competition whereas others lean toward more of a social/networking focus.  I am ideally looking to join a league where the social aspect is the primary draw, so I have mainly been looking into sports that lean social such as kickball and volleyball as opposed to ones that are typically more on the intense side such as flag football and basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I've done some research on the following organizations:

1. Austin Sports and Social
2. ATX Sports &amp; Adventure
3. Clubwaka
4. Nakid Social Sports

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight pertaining to these four leagues, or additional suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

I am leaving this city because I don’t want to stick around for what this city is becoming.

I’m tired of getting exited to eat somewhere or go camping/hiking only to find a 1 hour+ wait at the restaurant, no vacant camping spots, and the trails packed with dog shit and litter. Most of all I am bored of finding a cool hangout spot only to have them forced out because so and so venture capitalists raising their rent and forcing them out.

Background on her: She's lovable, sweet, and loves her bird feeders, lighthouse pictures, and cats.  She effectively does not drink.  I plan on giving her a nice camera to bring along anywhere we go, so she can take snapshots.

Mom is visiting from Saturday evening until Tuesday morning, and I'm trying to collate a list of ideas for things to do with her.  I'm hoping y'all have some solid suggestions.  Chili's is her jam, so I may actually take her to Chili's on Lamar if things get hairy.  Help me prevent that from happening?

**\*FOOD\***

I love Torchy's and it's an approachable kind of Mexican food.  Food trucks might have more authenticity and better food, but it's harder to convince your mom to stand in line outside a truck.

Terry Black's is my favorite BBQ in town that's easy to get, so that's the plan for Texas BBQ.

Trace at the W has $5 mimosa pitchers, so I'm inviting all my friends to brunch there on Sunday morning.

Arlo's food truck has amazing Vegan burgers, and I think I want to take her there and not tell her they're vegan until after she's started eating.  I didn't notice my first time!

**\*OUTDOORS\***

Zilker Park will be nice to walk around, but I think that doing the Greenbelt in any meaningful way is too much outdoors and walking for her.

The Bats on Congress is definitely a thing she wants to do, but I'm worried it's too early in the year.  Does anybody know if the bats are out yet, or what time to show up?

To qualify:  
\- Must be between the ages of 18 - 65 years old

\- Not lactose intolerant

\- Sits for a prolonged period of time (maybe due to work? &lt;4,500 steps)

Don’t touch me. Give me back my phone. I want to leave.” She was obviously crying and upset and wanted nothing to do with you at that moment. 

I don’t care if she is your girlfriend, sister, wife, friend, whatever. It doesn’t matter. If she says back off, you back off. Just like if my wife of nearly 20 years were to tell me to back off, I comply, immediately. And you especially do NOT touch her again. You did and that is why those of us there got physical with you. 

No we did not know what was going on or anything about you, but you damn well bet that we were not going to stand by and do nothing. I understand that in the heat of the moment you may not have realized that you had crossed the line, but if you still don’t realize that then you are action-packed with issues, and you need to talk with a therapist or a mature adult mentor ASAP. PM me if you are looking for the latter. I will always make time for someone looking to better themselves. 

On another note, a huge thank you to everyone who stepped in to help, especially the lady who escorted the young lady to the Beta store and the other one who called the police. To the guys who helped me physically get between him and her, you make me proud to live in this city. Given a chance I would buy all of you several rounds gladly.

Q: What is your advice for someone who can barely get outta bed due to the mold, naturally?

A: The mold comes from the Texas Panhandle. When they harvest the cotton in the fall the leaves are crushed and alternaria mold (which is what makes most leaves turn brown) is aerosolized and blown into Texas with the winds of winter, starting around Labor Day. it is best to either go north or medicate.

Q: How far north do you think would be good, like out of Texas?

A: Yup, in the mountains where the air is frozen and sterile

The student and their family are in self-quarantine after one family member began experiencing flu-like symptoms. 
 
The college was notified Monday, March 9, and immediately began working with local and regional health partners to identify best next steps. Austin Public Health determined that any potential exposure with this student is considered low-risk. Neither the student nor their family has been in direct contact with someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and no members are being tested at this time.  
 
The safety of our students, faculty, and staff is our top priority. ACC will continue its increased efforts of disinfecting and sanitizing all campuses and facilities. We recognize that there are a lot of concerns. Our goal is to minimize risk.

I started doing a little research on the Austin job market, and of course I like to check reddit out because people are generally pretty rational, knowledgeable, helpful, fair, etc. 

But damn, I noticed pretty quick anyone who posted about this subject was getting put on blast for being naive about it! You guys seem sick and tired of us darn immigrants coming in and ruining your lovely city, and I don’t blame you honestly. 

Anywho, here’s the top result when I searched Austin job market, and you can be sure they’re all pretty much the same: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/9p19rc/why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_a_job_in_austin/

To be fair to this sub, I guess all those articles praising the job market here really aren’t painting the whole picture. 

But comments like, “You need to apply for jobs 8 hours a day for months to even have a shot,” “There’s only jobs if you know people,” and “there’s no jobs in business related fields, only tech,” seem a little whack to me. 

I haven’t tried looking yet, I’m working in NYC right now. But, I did a study abroad here at UT a few years back and loved it, and since then I’ve wanted to come back eventually. I’ve got a good degree and exp in large MNCs, and I’ve never struggled to get a job before. But for whatever reason this sub is convincing me I’d be better off moving to the North Pole for opportunities. Which is a shame, because this place is so affordable, friendly, and I just love it (I’m actually here right now for a week despite South by being cancelled!). 

I’m just looking for more level headed advice on the job market for business related roles? Its hard to fathom how business jobs are 10 a penny in places like NYC right now, but Austin has is supposedly impossible to get in the door. 

Please advise me you beautiful, warm, funny, kind-hearted, Austinites!",Austin,Is the Austin business related job market really that terrible?

4811,4811,austingarrett,1583812660,fg7wrm,Nan,"June 4th, 2021. The apocalypse has happened. COVID-19 mutated, taking an extremely high death toll of 30 percent of people. In late 2020, martial law was declared in the US, leading to societal breakdown. The virus mutated again, taking an even higher percentage out as the Grim Reaper swung its scythe across the world. Law and order disappeared and chaos reigned.

The HEBs, Randalls, and even the Whole Foods have been picked clean months ago.  Food has run out. Roving bands of cannibals roam Austin looking for fresh meat. Vegan scavengers are forced to subsist on grass, which certain cannibals seek out for the gamey lean meat taste. 

There are two tribes that have formed, both set on taking control of what is dubbed ""New Austin"". They are at war. Gunshots ring out in the streets. Terrified citizens hide behind dumpsters. No one is safe. The once futuristic skyline of Austin has been reduced to smoldering rubble.

One team, the MAGA Hats, from the area surrounding ""New Austin"" has flooded the once democratic haven of Travis County, wearing football pads, red hats, and committing heinous atrocities akin to the ancient Romans. They are Republicans. Alex Jones is their leader. They eat and drink the flesh of people as their communion. They play American football with human heads and make sport of their brutality. The democratic forces are known as the Blueshirts. 

Downtown is a mess of broken windows. West Campus is a lawless wasteland, though this is nothing new. 

The scientists studying the disease have all but died. Some people did get together and make a blood test, involving electrocuting petri dishes of blood, as seen in that one John Carpenter movie. 

Another pasttime of the MAGA hats is dumping petrochemical waste into the watershed, in an attempt to cleanse the weak from the area. They are republicans after all, and republicans love poisoning the environment with excessive pollution. Nothing makes a republican happier than poisonous chemicals dumped into drinking water without that ""pesky government regulation"".

The democrats are split into two sides, a side that is trying to hide, and a side that is trying to fight. The democrats are grossly outnumbered by the encroaching forces. 

The war to retake the abandoned Texas capital building as a base was won by the Democratic forces, at first, but the MAGA Hats, who moved into New Austin from the surrounding areas due to lack of resources have retaken the rest of the city, to plunder and commit atrocities. The democrats are surrounded. 

All the older people who grew up in Old Austin lament on how the city ""used to be way cool"", though those days are long gone.

I completely understand that we want to avoid over-sensationalized, low quality or unverified content that could create panic.  However, deleting quality news articles that are directly relevant to Austin does us all a disservice. Our community will fair better if everyone takes this seriously and practices basic social distancing and hygiene. If they stay home when they are sick.

ACC’s Emergency Management team would like to share important updates regarding coronavirus (COVID-19) and steps the college is taking. Our goal is to keep you informed and our community safe.
 
SITUATION UPDATE
As you’re aware, on Monday, March 9, the college was notified that a student opted to self-quarantine as a precaution after a member of their family began experiencing flu-like symptoms. We have confirmed the following:

The student attended classes at Riverside Campus. 

The student has not exhibited any symptoms to date. Austin Public Health determined that any potential exposure with this student is considered low-risk. 

Additional deep cleaning was conducted at Riverside Campus overnight including rooms, walls, windows, furniture, equipment, restrooms, etc. 

Austin Public Health determined no further action is recommended at this time. 

CAMPUS OPERATIONS
At this time, ACC does not anticipate closing the college or any campuses, but we recognize the situation changes daily and we are prepared to adjust our response. Changes to college operations will be done in coordination with state and local health officials. ACC faculty and staff are preparing for a possible transition to a virtual learning environment. In this situation, courses would be taught online. The college also would increase the availability of online services for employees and students to ensure their needs are met including free online tutoring, advising, library services, and support for financial aid and admissions and records.

There was a dude laying in a recessed alcove, directly across from the Dell Hospital, on the south side of 15th. He was asking for help, but people kept on walking by. I didn’t know what was up, but the dude seemed desperate, so I asked him how I could help. He said that he had a broken leg and needed to go to the hospital. I helped him up and my wife (what a champ) stopped traffic on 15th street while I helped/carried/supported the dude as we crossed to the hospital. I dropped him of at the front, and was going to leave, when my wife told me that I was covered in blood. I had to throw my shirt away. Blood was all over my arms, neck, shorts and shoes. My wife said that she heard the dude tell the intake folks that he had fallen off of the parking garage. 
Whew!
Anyone know anymore about this? I hope the dude is ok. I have a bunch of his blood all over my clothes, in case he wants it back.
I maybe have a few more details about the dude, but don’t want to make it public, as I want to respect his privacy.

I know you were planning to write about entertainment, but you’re coming to Austin and it seems like you’re missing out on the really big story. 

The tech jobs that exploded here have caused housing prices to skyrocket. Developers can’t build enough giant ugly boxes of condos to house the workers relocated here. “Code next” ensures that every neighborhood is riddled with pockets of tacky structures -usually 3-6 of them crammed onto a lot that used to have only one house.  Even these houses are incredibly overpriced.  Of course existing homes for sale are suddenly 5x more expensive.  Unless you are wealthy or become wealthy, if you don’t already own your home, you never will in Austin.  

Solutions that involve more compounds of “affordable housing” apartments are non-solutions.   

The numbers show that Austins rental cost has doubled in the last decade, but for many of us it has tripled or quadrupled.  (Because we were living below the median rent rate). Areas that have been overlooked for development ( due to environmental disasters, lack of infrastructure etc) are being rapidly converted into crowded islands of supposed upscale living in neighborhoods that have been already been rocked by gentrification.  

There is actually a building going up right now right on top of the tank farm that was closed in the 90s.  Storage of petrochemicals poisoned the neighborhood and it’s residents.  Supposedly it has been cleaned up by the big oil companies that caused the problem, but how?   There’s no way to excavate and remove everything poisoned without removing the homes, and replacing all soil for miles.  

A park was installed (Govalle) right in the worst spot, there is a swimming pool under construction set to open this summer.  The building going up is a fancy new apartment complex. (Alta trailhead) it’s not the first apartment complex on site though, there’s another new upscale complex pretty much right nextdoor on shady lane.  

Even toxic sites like this are becoming outrageously expensive neighborhoods.  Where are all the poor people supposed to go? And how can we just ignore the homelessness that is certainly related to lack of affordable housing.  Even the student housing complexes on east riverside are about to be replaced by a massive shopping mall and housing complex like at the domain.  

I am an artist, so I always have another job to make up for the inconsistent income.  I can somehow afford my $1250 rent payment for a 600 square foot duplex in tank farm poisoned Johnston terrace, because I live here.  Where am I supposed to go?   This is where I live.  I’ve been in Austin for longer than anywhere in my life. I’m not alone either. If only I could get a mortgage loan and move to Lockhart or Bastrop. 

Why is it that paying this much rent doesn’t help you get a mortgage to own a place?  Whether or not it’s most of someone’s income should not matter.  My own bank won’t give me a loan that would cut my housing cost in half.  Really?   I can’t afford to pay half as much as I pay in rent every damn month?

The big story is not about entertainment.  It’s about unsanitary tent cities under every bridge while a huge corporate sponsored event takes over downtown.  How have we been conditioned to just walk by?   How have we been conditioned to accept that some people don’t really count? And how much longer can we stay in our city?",Austin,The big story that gets missed by sxsw press

If you are a 'high risk' individual get prepared. Have enough food, medication, and toiletries to last at least 2 weeks. This isn't a joke.

Most who catch the infection won't be able to stay at a hospital. Most will be quarantined at home. You need to be prepared. Its going to be much harder to get supplies once the outbreak begins. 

This is serious stuff. 

IMO, there are already hundreds if not thousands of infected people in the greater Austin area. And they are sleepers because hardly anyone has gotten tested. The data collected sucks and it will continue to spread exponentially in the next few weeks.

IMO, its basically too late to stop an outbreak. In one month I think close to 20,000 will be infected in Austin. In two months 100,000+

No individual who meets the clinical criteria has been denied a test due to shortage of kits.** The health of Austin and Travis County residents and visitors is our highest priority. Our public health officials are taking appropriate actions to ensure the health and safety of our community. 
 
**A few of these actions include:**

•	Austin-Travis County leaders have declared a “local state of disaster” to more proactively increase preventative measures and require mitigation plans for events in the region—effectively canceling SXSW. The declaration was made ahead of this month’s Spring Festival season following recommendations from interim local health authority Dr. Mark Escott, who acted on advice from an independent panel of experts. 

•	Events with 2,500 or more people are prohibited unless organizers are able to assure Austin Public Health that mitigation plans for infectious diseases are in place. Events are being evaluated on a case-by-case basis. City staff are proactively reaching out to impacted Event organizers and venue operators. 

•	Despite the disaster declaration, the health authority still anticipates significant numbers of visitors to the Austin-Travis County area over the Spring Festival season. The planning and coordination efforts therefore continue. We are in constant communication with other professionals in cities, counties, and states across the country, evaluating information and practices from around the world. If local public health officials report any change in their assessment or recommendations, immediate action will be taken.
 
•	The Austin-Travis County Health Authority has issued a control order which requires nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care facilities to take a range of immediate actions to enhance protections against the spread of COVID-19. Measures include screening visitors, staff, and patients prior to entry, additional signage, access to hand sanitizer, and additional reporting requirements to Austin Public Health.

•	**The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with underlying health issues are at a higher risk of severe symptoms for COVID-19. We are advising those people to take proactive steps to protect themselves including stocking up on supplies, practicing social distancing, and avoiding non-essential travel.** 
  
•	We have implemented a broad-based community outreach plan to keep the public informed both about the current situation and actions you can personally take.
 
If people feel unwell, they should contact their health care professional before going to a clinic, urgent care or emergency department, to prevent any potential spread.

**All information and resources about COVID-19 are available at AustinTexas.gov/COVID19**""",Austin,"COVID-19 Update: ""To date, all tests have come back negative. No individual who meets the clinical criteria has been denied a test due to shortage of kits."""

This was in spite of the fact that I travel for work and have been to DFW, IAH, DEN, AUS, and other large airports within the past few weeks. My temp has stayed under 100.3 and I have not yet had any respiratory symptoms (fingers crossed). It's clear that they do not have enough tests and should save the ones they do have for much more serious cases than mine. Regardless, I feel that a test should be made available to someone with symptoms for the benefit of the community. I will assume that I have it and plan to put myself under quarantine.

I'm not trying to induce panic. My point is, we need to take reports that there are only X number of COVID19 cases in Y cities with a grain of salt. It does not seem the authorities are equipped to make an accurate statement about infection count when they are unable to even test those with flu-like symptoms. Don't act like this pandemic doesn't affect us yet because it's likely already here. I'm saying this because that's how I felt until I got sick...

Tonight we have been made aware of the first two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Austin-Travis County area. We are focused on providing these individuals care and ensuring that we mitigate the spread of this virus to other people in the Austin area.

 

**Both of these cases are not believed to have been acquired in this community.**

 

This is not been an unexpected development. Austin Public Health and other City and County departments have been preparing for this development for months. Our staff have been working with Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Texas Department of State Health Services to ensure we are following all best practices around containing the spread of COVID-19.

 

At this time, there will be no significant changes in City of Austin operations. It is important that you know you are not powerless in this fight against COVID-19. You have an important role to play in helping us. We continue to urge everyone to help limit the spread of disease through proper hygiene practices:

-Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. 

-Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. 

-Avoid close contact with people who are sick. 

-Stay home when you are sick. 

-Cough or sneeze into your elbow or use a tissue to cover it, then throw the tissue in the trash. 

-Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. 
 

Sharing this information with your family and organizations you are involved with will help us in our effort to keep the community safe and healthy.

 

As this situation evolves, we will provide updates as necessary. For more information, visit www.AustinTexas.gov/COVID19.

5164,5164,StellaVerde,1584109282,fi0dis,Nan,"I went to HEB to pick up a prescription on Monday morning. It was 8:50am. I started work at 9:30am. The store was a ghost town. I asked an employee, ""Is this normal? For it be this quiet?"" She said, ""No. Not normal at all. This is really weird."" I was able to purchase tissues, water, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, paper towel and even got some disinfectant wipes without a problem. I would have bought these things anyway because I'm recovering from a surgery and I have 2 kids at home, so I needed these things anyway, but there really was something eerie about it. 

I wonder if the psychology of people on Monday after SXSW got canceled was, ""I'm staying away from large crowds and public places because it isn't safe."" 

Flash forward to Friday - people are all - OMG PANIC! I waited too long! What was I thinking! And they went in there to punish themselves, but to also gain a false sense of control and power in this powerless situation? 

I keep hearing about social distancing and introverts saying, ""Hooray for me!"" That's cute and somewhat true, if you're an introvert. However, I think it would be really important during these times (before something like this happens again) to get to know your neighbors and have a more robust sense of community. 

My anxiety is through the roof - not for our family - but for everyone who is experiencing food insecurity already. How might we show up in a light/easy as well as safe way for those families who might be especially hurting right now?

5175,5175,Ezzar,1584111807,fi100d,Ask Austin,"I've been renting my house in Techridge for a year or so and our neighbor situation has been comically horrendous. Were renting a 1200 sqft house with 2 people and our neighbors house is roughly the same size with about 11 people living in it. They have come with a lot of problems but the absolute WORST problem we have to deal with from them is the 7-8 year old living in the house. From as early as 7:30am to as late as 10pm, this little girl will banshee screech on their patio for up to an hour and a half at a time, up to 4-5 times a day. Originally, we let it continue without intruding because she seems to be special needs and it just feels a little cruel to literally take the song out of a special needs child's heart but after a year of it I simply cannot continue. Weve tried to lightly approach the neighbors about it one morning in the past when she was screaming at 7am on a Saturday but they didnt seem to care about our pleas for silence. Want can I do here? I know the noise ordinance is between 7am and 10:30pm, but there has to be some kind of local law against constant sound above a certain decibel coming from your house everyday. It's a touchy subject, but I honestly would have called the cops by now if this was some other noise problem happening everyday. I'm at the end of my rope.

Dear Longhorns,  
Today, we canceled classes at UT and closed the university. My main concern at this time is the health and well-being of UT students, faculty, staff and community members. We took this action because the first case of COVID-19 (coronavirus) within our UT community was confirmed this morning.   
   
It is difficult for me to write this because the person who tested positive is my wife Carmel. And a second member of my family (who works at UT) is presumed to have COVID-19 as well. I have now been tested for the virus, and the three of us are in self-isolation.   
   
Carmel and I have compiled a list of individuals who might have recently been in close contact with us. UT Health Austin nurses will be reaching out to those on the list who are affiliated with UT to screen them per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.   
   
If you have had close contact with me or my family members or another person with COVID-19 and you are not exhibiting symptoms, we strongly recommend that you [self-isolate](http://app.econnect.utexas.edu/e/er?utm_campaign=PRES_FY1920_LHN_COVID19_UPDATE_EML&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Eloqua&amp;s=1740541080&amp;lid=19408&amp;elqTrackId=29F1A9C27DF905E6A37823C60DD23777&amp;elq=efb89806814e4e7b9ddaf4fc7a24e5d8&amp;elqaid=17001&amp;elqat=1) starting today. You should continue to do so until it has been 14 days since your last contact. If you develop symptoms at any point, please contact your primary care physician. If your symptoms are urgent, please call 911 or seek care immediately at the closest emergency facility.  
   
Regardless of whether you are showing symptoms, please remember to take [preventive measures](http://app.econnect.utexas.edu/e/er?utm_campaign=PRES_FY1920_LHN_COVID19_UPDATE_EML&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Eloqua&amp;s=1740541080&amp;lid=19409&amp;elqTrackId=F329B8FD15F54B88CD8941612CDEA99C&amp;elq=efb89806814e4e7b9ddaf4fc7a24e5d8&amp;elqaid=17001&amp;elqat=1) and be cautious when traveling and interacting with people. This includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and avoiding shaking hands and other physical contact.   
   
Last week, Carmel and I traveled to New York City for several events with alumni and students. We returned home on Saturday afternoon. After the trip, Carmel started exhibiting mild flu-like symptoms. She tested negative for the flu yesterday and was then tested for COVID-19. This morning at 5:30 a.m., we received the news that she had tested positive. This news came several hours after local health officials had announced two other, separate cases in Travis County.  
   
Under normal circumstances, I would not describe the details of an individual’s illness. However, given the widespread impact of COVID-19, Carmel and I want to share this information with you so members of our community can take proper precautions.  
   
We had been anticipating that someone in Austin or at UT would test positive for COVID-19 in the coming days or weeks, and we will be making modifications for the rest of the semester. The university is working around the clock to adjust to this rapidly evolving situation, and I suggest you check our [website](http://app.econnect.utexas.edu/e/er?utm_campaign=PRES_FY1920_LHN_COVID19_UPDATE_EML&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Eloqua&amp;s=1740541080&amp;lid=19326&amp;elqTrackId=FE2B22D8A840734A123630359B390BC3&amp;elq=efb89806814e4e7b9ddaf4fc7a24e5d8&amp;elqaid=17001&amp;elqat=1) frequently to stay informed.

Latest update, Please pass along to your staff:
1. Non-essential travel is highly discouraged.  If you willfully choose to travel to a ""hot spot"" ( Washington, NY, or another location that is considered a ""hot spot"" you must quarantine for 14days and use your own leave. 
2. If you come in contact with a family member from an area that has confirmed cases; unless the family member has symptoms or direct connection to a confirmed case then they may report to work as usual.  If symptoms were present or the family member has a direct connection to a confirmed case then they must quarantine and again they will use their leave. 
3. If you simply travel to an area with confirmed cases you may report to work and the area is NOT a hot spot then you may report to work as usual. 
If after number 2 or 3 you develop symptoms you must quarantine for 14days and emergency leave may be granted.

We want to be cautious, but of course still plan to go to restaurants, local shops etc.  We WANT to support the local Austin business while we’re there and I was wondering if someone can send me some ideas of places to add to the list? With the event being canceled, we have more open days than expected. 

Will be there Tuesday- Saturday. Obviously I understand the situation but I also want to show my friends why Austin is one of the best cities. Even if it is without the packed bars, festivals and nightlife.",Austin,Local Businesses to support next week by tourists

—

Dear Readers,

Like many of you, we at BookPeople have spent the last several days and weeks learning about the coronavirus (COVID-19) and how it is impacting our world. For BookPeople, that means understanding how it affects our employees, customers and communities, and then making the necessary adjustments to our work and operations. 

We have one simple objective that guides us: keeping our employees and our community of readers safe. This has been at the center of our conversations every step of the way. With that in mind, we have made several moves in our business in response to the threat of the coronavirus.

What we are currently doing:

* We are closely monitoring daily updates and recommendations from the CDC.
* We have ramped up cleaning services and have added hand sanitizer at the front entrances and at all cash registers. 
* We have sanitizing wipes at all of our information stations. 
* We have implemented a heightened sanitizing schedule to all areas accessible to customers throughout the day.
* We have transitioned to all to-go utensils in CoffeePeople and removed all lids, sugars, etc. from customer access. Cafe servers can assist with all customer needs. 
* We have cancelled or postponed all events, book clubs and storytimes until April 1st. 
* We’ve stressed to our entire staff that they should frequently hand-wash – including fronts, backs, wrists, between fingers – with soap and water for at least twenty seconds each time.
* Employees have also been instructed to never come to work if they experience fever or any Coronavirus symptoms.

PAID SICK LEAVE FOR OUR STAFF

Our employees' safety and security are extremely important to us. Coronavirus tests are covered by our insurance. If a doctor orders an employee to be tested, we will pay for their time away from work while they are waiting for test results. If employees are told to self-quarantine, we will pay for their away from work during that time period. If an employee tests positive, we will pay for the 14 days of quarantine sick leave without deducting it from their paid time off.

CONTINUITY PLANNING FOR FUTURE SCENARIOS

We request that you notify us should you become aware that you or anyone you have come in contact with begins to show signs of potentially having this virus and have recently been in our store. You can email us at: customerservice@bookpeople.com.

Know that when you come to BookPeople, your health and safety are top priorities today and every day.

**It's going to be very important in the next few weeks that folks stay calm and take proper precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Austin. This will save lives if we stay calm and follow them. The best thing you can do to help is NOT become sick.**

**COVID-19 is going to be a weeks to months long event. Austin as a community is going to need to act unified to help each other and get through this.**

HOW TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19: 

- **Wash your damn hands** - I don't mean a quick rinse with a drop of soap. I mean wet, LATHER, scrub for 20 seconds humming your favorite songs, then rinsing. 
- Stay home if you are sick. This means dry coughing, aching, or pretty much any allergy symptoms along with a fever. Yeah. Bad time of the year for COVID-19 to happen, right?
- Stop touching your face, eyes, mouth, ears, nose, forehead, chin, cheeks, neck, and so on unless you washed them prior. 
- Disinfect frequently touched surfaces, including your cellphone. Alcohol wipes are great for this or just some 60% alcohol on a gauze/paper napkin. Good luck finding it you haven't.
- Practice social distancing. This means, rather than clump together like y'all are going break out in dance, stand a 6-7 feet away when talking to your friends/neighbors/weird dude you always run into on your way to the mailbox. This applies to grocery stores - if you can't have space, maybe come back later. 

WHAT TO DO IF YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE COVID-19:

- **CALL, do not GO to,** your health provider. They will instruct you on what to do.

Look here for more info on the city updates on this as well as recommendations and links: http://www.austintexas.gov/COVID19

This thread is going to act as a discussion and questions thread for folks to corral everything under. We'll remove general questions and ask they repost here.

We'll also have a ""I need help/I can help"" top level comment to reply to. Use this to get help or offer it. We'll make a separate post for it if it turns out to be popular.

If you want state or general info, check out /r/CoronavirusTX or /r/Coronavirus. 

We'll continue to allow individual posts on a case-by-case basis, but most discussion threads will be removed and asked to post here instead.

**The ban on public or private gatherings, part of Orders adopted by Austin Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, takes effect 2 a.m. Sunday, March 15, and will continue until at least May 1, 2020.**


Examples of events potentially included in the ban are weddings, religious gatherings, parties, funerals, sporting events, social events, conferences, and other large gatherings of 250 or more people.

**The prohibition does not generally include:**

- Office spaces or residential buildings
- Transit including airports, bus stations, or terminals
- Grocery stores
- Shopping malls
- Hospitals or medical offices and facilities
- This is because while large numbers of people may be present, it is considered unusual for them to be within arm’s length of one another for extended periods.

Dr. Mark Escott, interim health authority: “Many event organizers have already made the difficult decision to cancel events of this size already, in the best interest of the community. Now we need to make sure the City and County as a whole share the responsibility of halting the spread of this disease while it’s still in its relatively early stages in our area.”

 

**Businesses with questions about the new Orders are asked to call Austin 3-1-1.**

 

The Health Authority has also made a number of other recommendations for vulnerable people, workplaces, schools and parents.

- **Individuals who are at the highest risk from COVID-19**, including elderly people or those with underlying health conditions, to avoid community gatherings or events that will likely have 10 or more people.


- **Workplaces** are urged to consider use of telecommuting options, suspend non-essential employee travel, minimize the number of employees working within arm’s length of one another, and encourage employees to stay home when they are sick. Anyone who is feeling ill - even if they are not aware of any contact with a COVID-19 case - should stay at home.

- **While there are no imminent plans to recommend closure of schools,** they are advised to explore remote teaching and online options to continue learning, reschedule or cancel medium to large events that are not essential, develop a plan for citywide school closures, equip all classrooms with hand sanitizers and tissues, and frequently re-educate students and staff regarding personal hygiene measures.

- **Parents** are urged to keep their child at home if they are sick and prepare for citywide school closures.""",Austin,COVID-19 Update: “Community gatherings of 250 people or more anywhere in Austin-Travis County have been prohibited for the next few weeks to slow the transmission of COVID-19.”

Americans tend to waste a lot more toilet paper because we crumple it or wrap it around our hands like it’s a mummy instead of taking two sheets and folding it. 

“We use more toilet paper than Europeans because we’re in the habit of bunching up a wad of it rather than unspooling a few sheets and neatly folding them. Roughly 70 percent of us bunch, while 90 percent of them fold.” - NYT

It got me thinking that maybe that’s something we can try out during the great toilet paper shortage of 2020 and potentially learn a new productive habit that can save resources, panic, and money. 

A physicist even did an experiment about which was best to do from an effectiveness standpoint and his answer confirms what I thought. Crumpling is not superior to folding. 

“A sufficient wiping area, for increased efficiency, is more easily reached with a fold of a few squares and would take twice as much wadded paper.”

So, try something new in 2020 and spread the good word!

Then you have to pay $40 for an in-depth online intake form that asks you about your symptoms, who you've been in contact with, if you're immunocompromised, or if you're around the immunocompromised. 

Then when you're done they notify you that you'll be contacted sometime between Monday and Friday from 8am-5pm. Then you'll do an e-visit and **if** the clinician determines you qualify for the test you can receive it.

From a family member in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

A short plea from this ER doctor...

This is not someone else's problem. Its EVERYONE'S problem. It's YOUR PROBLEM. I AM BEGGING EVERYONE TO DO THEIR PART. YOU ARE HIGHLY INFECTIOUS BEFORE SYMPTOMS. I see multiple examples all day every day of people out in groups, pretending like this is extra spring break... when we ask and PLEAD that everyone isolate, we mean it. We are already filling up with patients. Our ERs, ICUs and hospitals CANNOT handle it. Soon, it will be your family that we don't have a ventilator for, or an ICU bed for regardless of WHY they need it. Don't make us make that call, it will haunt us forever... ESPECIALLY because theres something we can ALL do to reduce the blow to our system.

Be nice to all healthcare workers, please. We are flying mostly blind, working mostly without proper precautions and exposing ourselves repeatedly on the frontline. We feel terrible if you were told the wrong thing about getting tested, etc. but please don't take it out on us. We are doing our best and morale is very low as it is. You yelling at us isn't going to help anything.

And for f*** sake, DO NOT GO TO THE ER FOR ANYTHING UNLESS you are really sick and need us but CALL FIRST. We'll be there with or without protective gear to protect ourselves because that's who we are.

Sincerely, 
This tired ER doctor",Austin,A short plea from an ER doctor

Many of us, myself included, WANT to stay home to avoid the heightened risk of contacting said virus by going to work, or going out to eat, etc. But, the reality is, we just simply don’t have the option. Currently, my employer is furloughing various venue locations. Said company is NOT paying the staff to stay home. If said staff has PTO, they’re welcome to use their hard earned PTO to cash in on as a means of income for a moment. No PTO? Tough luck. They’re also cutting insurance at the end of March. Now, correct me if I’m wrong, but, this is on another entire level of fucked up, right? Basically, while the hourly and in-venue employees are fucked, the corporate staff remains in good condition as they are able to work from home, and also will still receive their bi-weekly paychecks. They then try to ensure us “nobody is winning here” &amp; “all is fair”. There shouldn’t be a “we’re trying.” It’s either you DO help, or you don’t. They’re taking the DONT route and chocking it up to, “we’re trying.”. Mind you this is a multimillion dollar company. This isn’t some mom and pop coffee shop.

There will be no changes to essential city services including public safety, trash, recycling, and compost pick up, Austin Water service, Austin Energy service, and transportation services.

Beginning tomorrow:

- All library branches will be closed
- All non-essential Municipal Court dockets will be rescheduled
- Austin Animal Center will be closed to the public
- All pools, golf courses, athletic programs, recreation centers,
and cultural centers will be closed*

*Camps and spring break activities will happen Monday through Wednesday and be suspended following the completion of activities Wednesday. Additionally, meal services for kids and seniors will continue

“We believe these changes in City services are measured steps to help prevent the spread of this virus in our community,” said City Manager Spencer Cronk. “We asked our department directors to look at their operations and decide how to transition as many of those functions to facilitate social distancing. We understand that we have to strike a balance, and many critical City functions will continue at their normal work locations.”

City employees that are able, will begin transitioning to teleworking schedules throughout this upcoming week. Our approach strives to create internal equity among City employees while balancing the need to continue or modify City services. For employees unable to telework, increasing the physical working space among employees and modifying operations are among the options being evaluated.

In many cases, in-person stakeholder meetings that are not time-sensitive will be canceled. Additionally, many boards and commissions meetings this week will be rescheduled or canceled.

“We continue to urge the public to remain calm, to be responsible, and to prepare appropriately,” said Dr. Mark Escott, Interim Health Authority for Austin-Travis County. “Our personal hygiene and social distancing messages are still the critical pieces for stopping the spread of this virus.”",Austin,"COVID-19 Update: Modifications to City Operations - ""Some public services will be suspended until Monday, March 30, 2020."""

I am impacted at work, and I have so many friends and family who are as well. The loss of income is going to devastate this town for years to come.

I don't mind seeing the occasional person at HEB picking up essential supplies. But it's a slap in the face to those who are dealing with immunocompromised people, looking at pictures of people in full bars, playing volleyball in public, and pretending like this all isn't getting worse. It genuinely feels like they don't care about anybody beyond themselves.

What we've seen from other countries is that self-quarantining works. Other countries are weeks ahead of us in this, and if we don't learn the lessons from them and continue to be stubborn, it's just going to be... Well I don't even want to think about what it's going to be.

We don't currently have enough tests. We don't currently have a good way to get access to people that have exhibited symptoms of this virus those tests. The friends I know who have exhibited completely similar symptoms to this virus don't qualify for testing at this point in time because they weren't exposed in ""the right way."" They're self quarantining at home, and hoping it's just allergies.

I really hope our city steps up, our state serves up, and our federal government steps up, and offers compensation, and I feel like it's our biggest failing that we haven't already. If you were going to go out this week, find a service worker friend of yours and donate what would have been the full bill to them. Take care of each other, until there are better measures in place. Before we self quarantined I started tipping 50 to 100%. It's the right thing to do at this point in time. I should note, I'm not really wealthy enough to do that. Heck I'm not wealthy at all. It's just how I chose to spend my money.

Please don't ask people to risk their lives to serve you a cocktail. Please call out businesses that don't close and offer paid time off. Please donate to your friends that need it. And for God's sake learn how to cook some rice and beans.

I was trying to comment on a thread answering where to buy face mask but that thread was deleted. I think someone might need face mask, so I post it here.

Right now N95 on Ebay is rather expensive, around $5 to $15 each. The orginial price is $13 for 20-pack 3M 8200 and $20 for 20-pack 3M 8210. I wouldn't suggest go Ebay. 

Also, a normal (not N95) face mask might be good enough. One argument why non-N95 works is that you stop touching your face with your hands when you are wearing a face mask.

I came across a site looks like they are still selling N95 not at a crazily high price [https://www.n95breathingmask.com](https://www.n95breathingmask.com). I bumped into that site from the owner's video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDfmZ1lqMZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDfmZ1lqMZM).

If you are feeling overwhelmed, I highly recommend that you reach out to one of the many wonderful therapists in Austin. Most of us are currently offering Telehealth (video sessions). 

Where to start? If you are planning to use insurance, please call the number on the back of your insurance card and ask:

	1. What are my outpatient mental health benefits?
	2. Does my insurance cover Telehealth mental health benefits?
	3. Do I have a deductible? 
	4. If I do not have a deductible, what will my copay be? 

**A note on health insurance in Austin:** The most popular health insurance that therapists take in Austin is Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO. Very few therapists take HMO plans. Aetna has limited how many therapists are credentialed on their panels, so it may be difficult to find someone who takes that insurance. 

For clients who are using out-of-network benefits, many therapists in Austin provide “Superbills”. This is an itemized receipt that you can submit to your insurance for possible reimbursement. 

[Reimbursify](https://reimbursify.com/ )  is an app you can file your superbills through for $1.99 per claim.


**Some resources for locating a therapist:** 

[Sondermind](https://www.sondermind.com/ ): This may be the best option if you have Cigna and United Healthcare insurance. Many therapists in Austin are not individually credentialed with Cigna and UHC, but they are able to see clients with this insurance through Sondermind. It's weird, I know.

[Psychology Today Therapist Finder](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists ): You can look up therapists in your area and filter by insurance. A lot of therapists are full, so it may take a few contacts to find someone with openings. Keep trying! If therapists are full, ask them if they have anyone they refer to who may have openings. 

[Just Mind](https://justmind.org/affordable-counseling-in-austin/) Has a great list of low-cost counseling options in Austin. 

[Open Path Collective](https://openpathcollective.org/) You pay a one time fee of $59, which then gives you access to therapists in Austin who provide services on a sliding scale between $30-$60/session.

[Betterhelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/) Betterhelp and Talkspace make me a little wary, as they do not pay their therapists well. They are between $40-$70/week billed monthly and provide online counseling support. 

If you are already seeing a therapist in Austin and have not discussed moving sessions to Telehealth, I highly recommend you have that conversation with them. If none of these options have worked out for you and you are needing some additional guidance on finding a therapist/mental health services, please PM me.

Dear Lake Travis ISD Staff, Parents and Guardians,

Upon extensive communication and consultation with Texas Education Agency representatives, area school district leaders, Lake Travis ISD senior staff and Board President Kim Flasch, and in a concerted attempt to help prevent the spread of the Coronavirus in our community, I am suspending all normal school operations for Lake Travis ISD through Sunday, April, 5, 2020. 

There are approximately 1,250 school districts and charter schools in Texas. As of Saturday, March 14, approximately 300 Texas school districts had announced closures following spring break. On Sunday, March 15, that number nearly doubled to 569 school districts. As of this morning, approximately 730 Texas school districts are now closed. I fully expect this trend to continue over the next few days as the number of confirmed cases of the Coronavirus rises.

During our closure following spring break, all Lake Travis schools and facilities will be closed for instruction and all other functions until further notice. This includes UIL academic, fine arts and athletic events; facility rentals; field trips; student and staff travel; our Child Development Center, our Extended Care after school program, and all other activities districtwide. Students and staff should not return to their campuses or work locations until notified to do so. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the avoidance of large gatherings can dramatically flatten the curve for the spread of the Coronavirus. I urge everyone in the Lake Travis ISD community to do their part and closely follow [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html). If you believe you may have been exposed to the Coronavirus, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

To our teachers and staff, I know the closure will add stress and anxiety. I want to reassure you we will get through this challenge together. Rest assured, we will continue payroll and benefits for all employees without interruption. 

Furthermore, I am aware that an unexpected school closure creates a hardship on our parents due to work, childcare, and other commitments. Please know, this difficult decision is being made in the best interest of everyone involved. Our district will continue to maintain close contact with the CDC, state and local health officials, and the Texas Education Agency (TEA). Superintendents and other district leaders in Central Texas eagerly await guidance from TEA on course credit, attendance, accountability standards, school funding and other measures to support the continued education of our students for the rest of the 2019-20 school year.  I learned just this morning that Governor Abbott has cancelled all STAAR testing this spring. We are all grateful for the suspension of state testing requirements during this uncertain time.

As of noon today, our buildings will be closed for two weeks following spring break. I want our staff, students, and parents to be prepared for the possibility that this closure could last much longer. Without a doubt, these are unprecedented times and there is much to do. While our buildings will be closed and normal operations suspended, we will provide modified instruction and services to students. We will have more information for parents next week. I ask for your patience and understanding as we work in the best interest of our students and staff. We will continue to monitor this situation daily and will communicate updates as quickly as possible via email, our district website, and our social media channels. In the meantime, I want our staff, students and parents to enjoy spring break. I wish you and your family continued good health and tranquility during this time.

I never thought I would be doing something like this, but I've decided that my family matters more to me than my dignity. I don't know if this post violates rule 4, so I won't name the business.

My mother's business is getting hit really hard by the COVID19 panic currently sweeping the nation. She runs/owns a specialty crafts store, and much of their clientele is older. As you can imagine, their business has been hit very hard. In the past two weeks, their foot traffic has plummeted to basically zero. Not a single person came in this weekend. This business means everything to my mother, and she means everything to me. Seeing how much joy running this business has brought my mother has made me happier than I can express. For many years during childhood and adolescence, my mom was, to a large degree, unable to fully function due to chronic depression. In the last few years, she has been able to get the help she needs and has become an almost completely new person. She never would have been able to open and run a business when I was a kid. That's why watching her do this has brought me more pride and happiness than I could ever describe with words. I am so worried that she is going to lose everything. There are tears running down my face as I type this. I just don't know what to do. All I want is for my mom to be happy. It will absolutely crush me if they have to close, and I can only imagine how it will affect her.

I know everyone is worried about getting the disease, or passing it on to others, but I am here to beg you: please don't stop buying from local businesses. Even a month of no business will mean ruin. I'm not the kind of person to beg, and I never have before. That's how much this means to me. 

I guess that's all. I understand completely if this post gets removed. I didn't mean it as an advertisement, but I still understand. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest more than anything else. Thanks to whoever took the time to read this. I hope y'all are staying safe and that the people you love are doing well.",Austin,My mom needs help

The problem I feel compelled to address is the lack of readily available chicken wings at grocery stores. I've been everywhere hunting for my preciousnesses and all I've found have been smothered in buffalo sauce (a travesty as vile as COVID19 itself) or come as part of a whole chicken. This simply will not do.

So, I have a proposition. You, the collector of featherless fowl forelimbs, agree to part with several packages of delectable amputated avian appendages so that I might cook them bitches up nice and proper. They'll probably be Korean flavored, possibly garlic parm, or I might try something new. Who the fuck knows?  The possibilities are limitless, but the store shelves are barren of bird biceps.

You're probably thinking, ""This idiot redditor can go fuck himself! Why would I give up dem wingies?"", and to the first part I could only reply, ""I have."" In fact, I have fucked myself multiple times. Because I'm bored. Because I'm also socially (sexually?) distanced. Because it's too early to pour a drink. Because work sucks a fat one and the kids are driving me batshit. Because it takes my mind off COOKING SOME FUCKING CHICKEN WAAAAANGS!

Apologies for the tangent. You're still wondering ""why"" you might feel compelled to anoint a total stranger with a portion of your unrationally rationed deplumed appendages. Well, you want to share them because once I'm done cooking them (I'll wash my hands of course, bc reasons), they'll be transformed into irresistible pieces of perfection. I'll give you half of them and you can fuck right off back to your lair and gobble them up, gristle and all, as you usher in the end of mankind.......or better yet, if you're slightly flexible in your distancing tactics, you can come over and have some drinks as they cook. We can eat the delicious bastards (wings, not kids) then have some more drinks while attempting to not sneeze on each other.",Austin,Can a mofo get some chicken wangs?

5669,5669,olliepots,1584391360,fjs0ns,Nan,"My friend posted this on Facebook who works at HEB.  Thought it'd be good advice to share:

I’ve bagged groceries for nearly 5 days straight. This is the first time since high school I’ve done so. I post this as a worker with boots on the ground. I do not represent an organization or company. Here are some tips for leaving the registers in a way that’s fast for the cashier, the person bagging your groceries and ultimately- you and everyone else in line.

\- If you’re using reusable bags, have that at the front of the conveyor belt- separated and ready to be filled. If you want paper bags, please make that known before your first item is scanned. If not, cashiers and baggers- especially busy ones- will assume plastic is fine.

\-know what limits may be in place for items during high demand. A cashier couldn’t sell you all 48 of your 36 packs of bottled water even if they wanted to because the store’s computer system won’t let them. And don’t be that person that’s all like, “WeLl I gUeSs I’Ll Go ThRoUgH 48 mOrE tImEs! LOL.” Nope. Nobody’s LOL-ing. Not me. Not my cashier and not the other 7 people in line behind you who have been in the store longer than they care to be.

\-as soon as the belt starts making space, please start unloading your cart. Dedicate both hands to this and please get off your phone if other people are waiting. If you have family members with you, employ them to help bucket-brigade your shopping cart.

\-keep all your heavy items at the front of your order: cans, soda, bags of pet food, bags of sugar, flour.... I will work my danged-est to not smash your groceries but when there’s a line going to the back of the store and I’m on hour 3 with no break, whatever’s in the front of your order just might be at the bottom of your shopping cart (basket/buggy).

\-please bag and label your produce. Plastic sucks. I get it and I respect it. It’s horrible for the environment. Where possible, bagging and labeling your produce makes it faster for the cashier (scanning versus keying in items one-by-one)- especially if you got in line with a greenhorn cashier. Also, bagging your produce beforehand makes it easy for me to place them in your bag instead of having to chase limes all willy-nilly around the staging area.

\-keep all your similar items together. This is imperative. I can’t tell you how many times I’ll get an order that comes down the belt like: tomato, pint of ice cream, loaf of bread, deodorant, avocado, package of cookies, cup of yogurt, can of green beans, tomato, bleach, can of green beans, bacon, frozen bag of spinach, rotisserie chicken (hot), snickers bar, market fresh fish, dish soap, cup of yogurt, contact solution, ground breakfast sausage, sack of potatoes, cup of yogurt, eggs, cough syrup, cup of yogurt. This makes it challenging to bag because I’m waiting for similar items to make their way down the line to be bagged together. Please keep all your frozen stuff together, all your produce together, all your soft goods (bread, tortillas, muffins) together. It makes it easier for the bagger to do their job instead of “hunting” for similar items to place in a bag. I’ve dealt with this several times this week and I’ll continue to do so happily but being organized helps everyone out.

\-as soon as the cashier starts scanning, if there’s a good bagger, that bagger is going to start hustling. If you’re still emptying your shopping cart by the time the cashier starts ringing you up, the bagger will likely run out of real estate fast. Your bagged groceries stack up in the staging area at the end of the register pretty quickly. Empty your cart as expediently as possible and get it down the line so the bagging team can fill it up.

\-have your method of payment ready to go well before the end of scanning. If you’re paying by check, have it filled out in advance. If you need change, communicate that to the cashier as they process your card.

I know it’s hard out there. It’s hard out there for all of us. For what it’s worth, everyone I’ve served and worked with has been kind, patient and gracious. I believe we all can get through this.

My dumb ass decided to go for a long walk during lunch today. On the Hike and Bike Trail. I’m here to summarize my experience and implore you all to stay away until COVID dies down.

I work downtown and haven’t had any issues the past week staying at least 6ft away from other pedestrians (or my coworkers). Thought I’d be fine today walking on a loop down the trail, since social distancing/shaming people for not social distancing is all over social media. NOPE.

During my 4 mile, 1.5 hour long walk, I encountered the following:

* 52 runners who did not leave at least 6 ft of space between us when they passed

* 23 cyclists who didn’t leave at least 6 ft of space between us as they passed

Tallying up totals? **That’s 75 people not practicing social distancing.** With a few exceptions, that trail is at least 8 feet wide in the distance I hiked.

* Of the 52 runners, about 50% appeared to be college-aged women; another 30% were college-aged men; the remaining 20% were a combo of 40-somethings and 60+-somethings

* Of the 52 runners, one was a 60+-year-old man who passed within 2 feet of me, then proceeded to rest at a bench within 6 feet of two other women

* Of the 23 cyclists, one was a father piloting a tandem bike w/his child in the back

* Of the 23 cyclists, one was a father who allowed his sons (also on bikes) and free reign of the trail

* BONUS shout-out to the middle-aged couple who hogged the trail for 1/4 mile, making it impossible for anyone to safely pass",Austin,"PSA: If you care at all about your health and the health of your family, STAY AWAY from the Hike ad Bike Trail."

If an infected human here in Austin comes in close enough contact with a bat to transmit it back to the bat population here, one would think it would spread quickly through the bat population due to them being huddled in close quarters (unless they have a degree of immunity to this strain). But if it does spread through the bat population, then there could be a way of symbiotic transmission.  Highly unlikely that humans come in to close enough contact to make it happen, but interesting to think about.

Get a chemical peel on your face - this takes a few days to recover from
Try out a crazy temporary hair color (pink? Blue? Who cares!  It will wash out in a few weeks anyway)
Clean out your closet and donate clothes you haven’t worn in at least 1 year 
Clean out your junk drawer
Organize the crap under your bathroom sink 
Paint a room in your house or hang some peel and stick wall decals
Research your family tree - this can also involve calling family members you haven’t talked to in ages...they’d probably appreciate the call
Take a walk in a park you haven’t been to before
Learn how to bake bread - drop off the extras at your neighbors
Wash your windows
Clean out your garage/attic/junk room
Is your home office set up efficiently?  Spend some time making it work for you
It’s spring - buy a young plant and tend to it over the next few weeks.  You’ll enjoy the payoff when it blooms this summer
Call your old roommate, best friend from college or high school. 
Foster a kitten or puppy 
Try something new: meditate each day for 10 minutes, ride your bike, make at least one vegan meal each week
Give your dog a bath
Read a book
Take a long bath
Use that kitchen gadget that is collecting dust-juicer? food dehydrator? Slow cooker?
Detail your car

Mind you, most of the office jobs are non-critical and can easily be done remote. On top of that, each employee is exposed to around 4,000 other people on site every single day.

**Austin-Travis County is closing bars and suspending dine-in service at restaurants for 6 weeks under new Orders aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19. These Orders go into effect at noon today, Mar. 17, until at least May 1.**

Bars must close common spaces and prohibit consumption on-premises. Food establishments must close common dining areas open to the public and are encouraged to provide take-away, delivery or drive-thru, to limit exposure between individuals.
 
Additionally, **community gatherings of 10 or more people in a single room or other confined indoor or outdoor space are prohibited, due to the substantial risks to the public.**


Critical facilities like schools or colleges, grocery stores and pharmacies, and hospitals and medical facilities are exempt from the Orders. In these places, social distancing and frequent cleaning are strongly encouraged.


Critical infrastructure including communications, emergency services, energy, transportation systems, and water and wastewater systems will continue operating. These services are also encouraged to implement screening precautions to protect employees.

**We understand there will be impacts to the physical and mental health of business owners and employees. We are advocating for social distancing but at the same time solidarity.**


**We have updated our website with resources, including immediate economic support, to help our community during this time: AustinTexas.gov/COVI19.**

In small and large ways, Austinities looked after me - a single mom - and my little girl. 

I was closing a deal at Las Manitas (I remember that Richard Rodriguez and Tarantino were there that day) and was so close that I decided to eat any parking ticket I might get for the extra time with my client. I didn't get the deal but when I walked out some unknown angel had fed the parking meter for me. The post-it on my dash said ""pay it forward."" 

Six months later, I was running down the stairs to answer my mobile when I slipped and tore all the muscles in my lower back. At least a dozen of my neighbors - some I didn't even know - held a meeting (that I wasn't even aware of!) and split up the work of taking my daughter to school, going shopping for me and taking me to physical therapy. 

Thanks for reading this. My point is... I've lived in a lot of cities, but I have never, ever come close to encountering a nicer bunch of people. Austin has changed a lot since then but I'm seeing so much of that generosity **right now**.  

So, how has Austin been kind to you?",Austin,Austin isn't just weird. It's kind. How has it been kind to you?

With universities and workplaces closing all over the country, blood donation banks are hurting for donations. Most of their donations come from group donations at places of large gatherings. 

A blood donation facility like [We Are Blood](https://weareblood.org/) is one of the safest public places to be right now - all visitors are required to be healthy, they already have medical grade sterilization and cleaning practices, and now they’re enacting even more rigorous cleaning, screening and testing to ensure the health of those offering donations. 

According to We Are Blood’s page on [COVID-19 safety measures](https://weareblood.org/blog/we-are-bloods-safety-measures-for-donors-and-staff-in-response-to-covid-19-coronavirus/), there’s no medical information that indicates you can contract COVID-19 through a blood transfusion. Please, do your own research and make your own health decisions, but I strongly urge you to consider donating blood or other blood products to We Are Blood during the social isolation of the coming weeks or months.

Meanwhile there could be some joints whose ownership is swimming with cash and they're hoarding it one way or another. That, or they're putting the health and well being of their employees at risk for their bottom line. Those are the types of places we'd like to avoid. 

Is there a list or can we start a discussion about it?

Today was their Senior Day, where seniors could shop for the first hour without having other, younger potential ""spreaders"" around.  They completely blew it off.  They let senior go to the head of the line, then let everyone in!!!!  

I went specifically for this time, because I'm a high-risk person.

Talking to the girl, she gave me several lame excuses, one which was a lie.  She said they just heard about it at 4:00 am.  Well, it was in the news yesterday, when I made plans to go to this Senior Hour.  Then she said, ""Well, we couldn't just turn our other customers away.""  Well, yes you could.  Wouldn't that be the whole point?  Then she asked why I didn't do online shopping.  One, that's irrelevant and two, the wait times are at least a week.

So, Target said they were going to take steps to help a high risk population and they completely failed.  And their employees have no concern from keeping this virus in check.  There wasn't any distancing at the registers.  Target has failed completely to help seniors.",Austin,Target Lied about Senior Hour - They let everyone in!!! Did not protect seniors at all!!!

5988,5988,americanhideyoshi,1584542030,fkqfun,Nan,"My fellow Austinites, as the economy seems to be descending into chaos and uncertainty, many of us are probably wondering how we as individuals can help. The economic crisis is already unfolding in a pretty stark pattern: those like myself with good corporate jobs can just work at home, while those who work in the service industry, contractors, and some gig economy workers are either out of work or soon will be. Now, we who are privileged to still have steady incomes may not be able to help the airline industry, the hotel industry, or your local travel agency, but what we can do is support our local service jobs. One might even say it is incumbent upon us to keep the local economy going.

&amp;#x200B;

This does NOT mean we should take unnecessary risks. If you are, or live with, an elderly person, have health problems, or are part of any other high-risk group for COVID-19, you should probably shelter in place at this point and have minimal contact with others. The city has been advised that there is 'community spread' in Austin as of yesterday (3/17). However, for those of us who are young, fit, and healthy it is not unreasonable to order take-out or delivery from local restaurants, have the landscaping crew come by as scheduled, and order groceries online so your delivery person has a job. In particular, I'd advocate for restaurant delivery or take-out and I'm not even going to be picky and say 'locally-owned' only. Austin's restaurants, local and national chains alike, employ tens of thousands and dine-in was just shut down by the city. Yes, it is important for employers to treat their employee's health with the utmost regard, and I sincerely request that they do, but it's also important for us, the customers, to make sure they still have employees and everyone isn't just laid off. (And no, I do not work in the restaurant industry; I work for a tech company).

&amp;#x200B;

We need to strike a balance between common-sense precautions and keeping the economy going. I urge all service industry employers to give your employees paid sick leave(!!) and as much of it as you can afford. If people would like to comment with the names of service businesses that we know do this, all the better so we can support them first and foremost. For the rest of us, put instructions on your Postmates account to have the delivery person ring the doorbell and leave items on the mat. Pickup food that was paid for online to avoid paying cash or touching the card payment terminal and use the drive through if one is available. Even if you absolutely do not want any contact with others, go online and buy gift cards for your favorite local businesses. And for god's sake wash your hands y'all! Soap and water works better than that hand sanitizer you can't find at any store anyway. But so long as we have good jobs, keep the money flowing to local employers as best you can. That may mean the difference between a total economic meltdown and a few months of mild recession.

&amp;#x200B;

It may be an unpopular opinion, but this crisis is not just about illness. Economic disasters kill people  just as surely as disease and that's a statistical fact. If you can keep putting your dollars into the local economy without putting yourself at risk, I urge you to do so. Stay safe y'all!",Austin,Support Local Service Industry!

For so many service people I know this is such an anxiety inducing time, and many people do not have the money to make it a few months, much less a few weeks.

But I want to give a shout out to the restaurant owners who are doing everything in their power to keep their people working in as safe a manner as possible at this time. The owners of Batch are the most generous people I have ever worked for. They treat their employees like a family and are in the position of staying open just to give hours to people, even though it is a losing proposition from a business standpoint. They closed their dining room ahead of the curve because it was the right thing to do, and are constantly coming up with new ideas to make the best of a trying situation.  It takes a lot to deal with the stress of not being able to pay people you care about, so I encourage anyone who has the means and interest to go find these restaurants in your area and spend your money at them. Times like these show what the priorities of owners' are, and even though I am not relying on the front of house for my income, I thought this would be a cool place not only to list the places that are open, but also the places where anyone who works in service can appreciate their owners/managers.

I'm a mental healthcare provider in Texas and available to help you get connected if you need support during the pandemic.  My personal caseload is full, but I am aware of many resources in the community including therapists who take insurance or who are available to do low-cost short-term support.

1) If you are a **healthcare provider** anywhere in the country, there is a spreadsheet going around where therapists are listing their contact info and availability to support you.  If you want therapy, you need to find someone who is licensed in state.  If you want coaching or support, any licensed provider will do.

2) In Texas, Governor Abbott just passed a bill requiring your health insurance to pay for telehealth the same way that they pay for in-person sessions.  Almost all therapists in town are using a platform like [Doxy.me](https://Doxy.me) or [Zoom.us](https://Zoom.us) to continue to meet with their clients.

3) If you want to send me a DM, please include what you're looking for, if you're able to pay or not, and if you have insurance or not.

I work for a large social media company in town and my team is trying to find different local businesses that we can establish partnerships with to hopefully help spur business between them and our employees. The jist is we we establish some sort of online discount code (most businesses we've talked to have down 20% discounts but it can be whatever kind of discount they want. Buy one get one, 10%, whatever) and share it with our office and hopefully spur sales for the local businesses during this hellish time (for perspective we're all still getting paid, working from home, and some are even getting $1k bonuses so we want to help).

If you recently started working in Texas and have not worked in Texas before Sept 2019, you cannot receive unemployment benefits in this state *right now*. 

You have two choices:

1.  Wait until April 5th, at which point anyone who has worked in Texas in December 2019 or earlier can apply for unemployment
2.  Apply for unemployment in the state you worked in last. 

You might want to find out how much your state of origin pays for unemployment. For example, when I talked to the guy at TWC, he said that Texas could pay up to the maximum of $512 a week. My state of origin only pays $240 a week. So it's something to keep in mind when deciding what to do. 

He also mentioned that if the situation is declared a national emergency, then you could also apply for some kind of disaster relief, which would combine with your unemployment if you decide to go with a state that offers lower unemployment benefits. 

He also told me that the process usually takes 3-5 weeks to approve an unemployment application, but that he has no idea whether or not the current situation will speed up or slow down that process. 

Hopefully this information is helpful to others in my situation, and keeps people from needlessly calling their office and waiting in long hold time queues. Stay strong, stay safe!",Austin,"If you started working in Texas after Sept 2019, you cannot apply for unemployment in this state YET"

I have a feeling that the craziness at HEB is going to last quite a while and will result in some families having problems getting what they need since they can't arrive early enough to wait in line.

What do you think about if they created different bundles of essentials and allowing households to register for a wait list on these bundles? They start setting aside product and creating these bundles, then go down the wait list and starting letting people know to come by the curbside pickup so they can get their bundle. This would give them an idea of what is needed at individual stores and make sure they are getting enough. HEB has said their isn't a problem with a supply, just they can't meet up with the demand.

They mentioned that there are no plans for discounts at this time. They said they can offset the shutoff date for service (if someone is on the brink of losing service) or push a due date for a bill until the customer returns to work. This would still require the customer to pay that full amount at a later time despite the unintended increase. I let the supervisor know that there are people who are out of jobs and/or budget for their utility bill. These people may also spend more (unnecessarily) by being at home, whereas they wouldn't be using as much if they were at their place of work or out in a public location.  


I think it would be worth several people calling them to share that opinion to see if that invokes change. The supervisor seemed to take the feedback well. Should you decide to call, please also approach it with kindness and logic — they're doing the best they can. In that same breath, though, ""the squeaky wheel gets the oil.""

Drive a Senior West Austin has the infrastructure, safety measures, training, and plans to help our high risk senior population during this epidemic.  We have been meeting twice a day since last Monday preparing plans.  Our response plan includes reassurance calls, delivery drivers, food prep and delivery (under specific protocol), and beginning next Monday, an emergency food bank located in Tarrytown exclusive for West Austin seniors.  Do any of these things sound like something you all would like to help with?  
At this time, we have not received any critical food needs from seniors.  Generally, they seem to have enough food to hold them over until next week. At that point, we do anticipate receiving calls for food from our senior neighbors.  We know that the wave of high food insecurity is coming, so we are planning now to make sure we are ready to handle the situation with the highest safety standards.  We ask that you have patience with us during this time, and be assured that if you sign up to volunteer with DASW, we will contact you as soon as we have a need.      


Also, would you mind providing us with some of your information (if you haven't already included it in your previous email), so we can best connect you with a senior close to you?  
Here are the things we will need:   
\-Phone number  
\-Home address  
\-An emergency contact for you

&amp;#x200B;

Second Email:

We are in great need of supplies such as:

\-Antibacterial cleaning supplies (spays,wipes,etc)

\-Face masks, gloves, and reusable grocery bags

\-Food donations for our food pantry

\-Other essential supplies for seniors, such as toilet paper, depends, paper towels, hand soap, etc. 

You are more than welcome to share this list with your friend groups, as well as share anything from the email! 

Thank you again for your willingness to help.",Austin,Suggestions for ways to help from Drive a Senior Austin

6211,6211,medullaoblogatata,1584624494,fla0mn,COVID-19,"I work in a pharmacy in a store (can’t disclose, due to idk policies?) I have access at times, to grab toilet paper and such before the store opens to the public. Just a couple times a week. 

I understand most stores are limiting the amount of ppl entering the stores and I feel bad for the older folks, who has to stand in line outside, exposing themself to risk before entering the store, and realizing that we’re sold out of TP.  

I’ve dropped off a packs of TP to some of my frequent elderly pharmacy patients to their homes. (Shhh...kind of against the company rules to interact with them outside of the work place) 

So DM me if you know any one who’s old, immunocompromised, or in a rut, that may be running low on TP! I can’t guarantee anything, since TP is like GOLLLLDDDD. But when I am able to pick up several packs, I can drop it off at your doorsteps. 

PLEASE - respect my wishes, only looking to help out the older folks or ppl who have a difficult time leaving the house. 

If you’re healthy but TOOO LAZY to go into a store yourself to shop, go wipe your bum with some newspaper. I deal with WAYY to much STRESS at my pharmacy to cater to ‘lazy people.’ (Sorry...been a rough couple of months)

Our leadership has had multiple hours long meetings about how to handle this, and not once has the topic of WFH even been seriously considered. Instead it is immediately dismissed as 'impossible'. Which is absurd considering our high risk employee population of older overweight people is basically the equivalent of a nursing home on a cruise ship. 

The best they can do is take our temperature with shitty forehead thermometers before we can enter our building, and if anyone has a fever, they are forced to take their personal leave or go on LWOP until they can get a doctors note saying their symptoms aren't from COVID. 

Only the director level and above even have the capability to remote work, but even they aren't allowed to WFH. Which I suppose keeps morale up in our office of 100 that still has to go on business as usual because in 2020 our agency that literally deals with decisions of life and death still fiddles about with paper files for most of our cases. And our small, but well meaning IT team is powerless and without the resources to make anything happen.

Our agency head is headquartered in an unaffected small town whose HEB is still reasonably stocked with toilet paper. And the only way I see us getting any kind of real action is in the event of a state or federal mandatory shut down, which frankly, I don't see happening.

So here's to you. And to everyone still coming into work to put money into the pockets of a company that DGAF and refuses to change, or to keep an antiquated system afloat when it doesn't even matter because everyone else is shut down anyways. 

My agency is small enough with very few young people working there, so I will not identify, but I know the situation is the same for many governmental agencies at the state level, as well as the city and federal levels. Feel free to vent and shame your agencies and companies for doing their part!

We all know gas stations, bodegas, and convenience stores for things like toilet paper and laundry detergent.  What you may not be thinking about is the weird places in stores you may find some merchandise.  

As an example, I've been on the hunt for a thermometer for the past week.  I finally found one in CVS today with the pregnancy tests.  It's marketed to check your fertility, but it's a perfectly functional digital oral thermometer.  

Also, if you're on the hunt for hand sanitizer, sometimes check those cute makeup kits for young girls that may have a tiny bottle of sanitizer in it.

No to all of these questions so I proceed to walk in. I’m greeting by an employee wearing nitrile gloves. He asks me to stop 6 feet from him and proceeds to ask all of the questions on the door. No to all of the questions and we go on with our business. I toss the keys over and all is cool.

6298,6298,elvisjulep,1584647363,flgg2r,Ask Austin,"Fact 1: Toilet paper has been sold out pretty much everywhere for close to two weeks now (and not just in Austin)

Fact 2: There is no shortage of supply, i.e. the manufacture, transportation, etc. are not ceasing and 90% of our toilet paper is made in the US

Fact 3: Under normal circumstances, people take a couple of weeks or longer to go through a 4-pack of toilet tissue, so those who rushed to the store last week should not have a need to get more, at least not in this short of a window.

(Anecdotal) Fact 4: EVERY person I have spoken with about this TP shortage thinks it is stupid, ridiculous, panic buying, idiotic, unnecessary and everyone should calm down. I have yet to hear a single person suggest that this is anything but a fictional shortage.

**SO...who's buying all the toilet paper?**

There is a plentiful supply, the panic buyers should be stocked from their rush to the store last week or yesterday, everyone else thinks the mad dash for Charmin is foolish, yet TP is sold out everywhere.

**Who's causing the shortage?**

Are people with ample supply simply snatching it up because it's there? Are all the people decrying this herd mentality just lying and secretly hoarding it? 

What gives?",Austin,Who is responsible for the toilet paper madness?

Here's the deal, I'm living in a vehicle, have been for a while. 

I ain't got the typical problems of the homeless, I ain't on drugs, I just don't really have a support network and I've landed in some economic hot water. 

I work, but it's remote. Everything is done online. This typically means I end up at places with Wi-Fi and power. 

The coronavirus has put all those places out of the equation. 

Wi-Fi ain't so much a problem, I have found connections here and there. 

Power seems to be my issue currently. Power in a spot that I can use it either to charge my battery on my laptop and drive to a WiFi spot that I know, or perhaps some place with power and Wi-Fi both. 

I think I can hold out in the vehicle itself, it's getting uncomfortable to be in it for all these hours every single day with nowhere to go, but I think I can handle it. 

But this looks like this virus thing is going to be going on for a while, so I'm here to ask y'all if you're aware of some place with a power outlet and Wi-Fi -- bonus points for shaded - and I could probably squeeze up to five bucks a day to pay.

The problem is that I can't get through at all! Not even to be put on hold! Just told that the call volume is too high, and to try calling again later. I've called so many times and i'm really starting to lose my mind and worry that i'll never get unemployment. If anyone has an email or anything they think would be helpful, please please help me out.",Austin,Need help getting through to TWC for unemployment

So, when they closed all the restaurants and bars, that's when I realized I wasn't going to be able to have a pint with the boys and 'wait for this whole thing to blow over'. So I started putting in some orders, not panic-buying, but simply trying to prepare myself adequately for a potentially month-long quarantine. 

I've never had my groceries delivered before. I guess I'm just old-fashioned. So this was my first ever Instacart order. When I put it in, they had a 3-4 day backup. I'm sure their backup is over a week, now. What a terrible time to do this to someone, but I guess when it rains it pours. Things are tough all over. Society is breaking down.

This shady MF says he left my order on my doorstep... I was WFH all day, and had the windows open, in preparation to see this delivery person, and direct them to my apartment. I had pre-tipped them well. Any time a car turned onto my street, I glanced up from my work, to see who it was. If he had come anywhere near my building, I would have seen him. My address was entered perfectly, and every other delivery person has found it, without issue. 

Now I know, there are going to be some people on here who, out of some bullshit Marxist idealism, are going to be apologists for this man, like 'Feel sorry for him, he's hungry.' Feel sorry for me. I'm hungry, and I paid. Even if I get a refund, my options are waiting probably 2 weeks for a new order, or simply braving the store myself, and wasting my valuable time and will to put up with everyone's BS.

So there you have it, folks: trust no one.",Austin,Beware of idiots tryna grab e'rythang fo demselves. Instacart shopper jacked me

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/fk3nu1/large\_tech\_employer\_in\_austin\_refuses\_to\_allow/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/fk3nu1/large_tech_employer_in_austin_refuses_to_allow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Anyways, I'll keep this relatively vague. Almost nothing has been done to reduce the number of non-critical employees on site. There have been pseudo-policy changes since this post, but it is so painfully obvious that it's nothing more than low effort posturing to give an illusion of taking action. 

The largest policy change to date: remote login will be allowed for 7% of the entire workforce.

There has been absolutely no communication or explanation why only such a select, random few will have the ability to work from home....Morale is getting dangerously low. 

If the truth behind why nobody can work from home was communicated, I have a strong premonition it would open the doors to criminal negligence due to all the city and state mandates recommending that businesses allow non-critical employees to WFH.....If you're curious on the reason, it's purely because of the culture at this company.",Austin,Update: Large Tech Employer In Austin Refuses to Allow Work From Home

So if you feel like it, it takes less than one minute to sign this petition asking the Governor of Texas to provide further support and assistance to breweries and brewpubs across the state. The petition asks the Governor to allow breweries and brewpubs to ship and/or deliver beer directly to customers (did you even know this is not legal in Texas!!), to provide a temporary reprieve from paying excise tax, and an excise tax credit for any beer that has to be dumped due to the COVID-19 crisis. (Don't worry if you don't know what an excise tax is...just know that it would be beneficial to craft breweries not to have to pay it or to get a credit.)

I live with my brother and he still thinks Covid-19 is just a bunch of bullshit. Although, I did not panic buy, but I did stock up over a week ago because I have to quarantine until this mess is entirely over. I really can't risk going out, even for essentials, other than literally getting gas to get to work. I literally can't be around other people at all. 

My brother doesn't seem to understand any of this at all. Despite my safety and my parents strong opinions and their wishes, he still decided to spring break with his girlfriend in New Mexico this past week and got back to our apartment last night. He then threw a tantrum immediately about my boyfriend quarantining with me because my brother doesn't like him. My boyfriend lives in his car when he's not here, so he's actually homeless and my brother is trying to send him out in the streets in this dumpster fire. My brother did stop at my parents in DFW on their trip, exposing high risk parents and diabetic brother to whatever germs they were carrying, and brought back a bunch of frozen meals my mom had for the two of us to share. Within an hour of the tantrum I re-explained my current situation and the severity of him also needing to self-isolate as much as possible, or stay at his girlfriends indefinitely because with us living in the same house it's too risky. 

He then decided to invite his girlfriend over, and feed her one of the frozen meals my mom had sent for him and I, and have her stay over. Because fuck me right? And my clients?

6621,6621,argomux,1584821156,fmlbu4,Nan,"For those of you who are relying on deliveries to help reduce crowds at the stores and practice good social isolation, What has your experience been?

OP goes first: I've tried Amazon and Walmart (so far) and both experiences are unfortunately lacking.

&amp;nbsp;

**Amazon**

I'm not currently at a location where I can get 'fresh' or 'pantry' or 'whole foods' Amazon options to deliver, or they're just so booked up there are never available delivery slots. Regardless, the website repeatedly listed those things anyway making sorting through the list of items frustrating. Many of the items that are deliverable are like massive bulk orders. $45 dollars worth of a condensed soup, for example. I ended up settling for some snack food just to make a delivery actually happen. Crackers and mixed nuts showed up on time, nothing expired, boxes in good condition, etc. OK... Would be fine with ordering more through Amazon but hunting and pecking through lots of items that are unavailable, can't be delivered, are gouged in price (non-prime stuff), ...etc, makes this problematic at best.

&amp;nbsp;

**Walmart**

The closest store to me is a Walmart so I tried their website. They absolutely deliver. I was all optimistic going through the website and just loading up on the basic items I'll need for about 2 weeks of average diet chow for 1 adult. There were no same day time slots available so I selected a next day delivery in the early afternoon. While selecting items that were ""in stock"" before I could complete ordering anything, some of these items were going ""out of stock"" and had to be removed from the online cart. This had to be done manually, even though the website won't process it at checkout, it requires you to manually delete it from the list. Anyway, without too much trouble, most of the items I wanted were in the cart. I accepted a $10 one-time delivery fee and done. (there is a subscription option for multiple deliveries monthly.

On the day of delivery, items that I had ordered were now out of stock. About half of them, including all of important things like lunch meats and eggs. Because my delivery time slot was in the afternoon, the panic shoppers had already gone in and raided the store, and I didn't find out about it until the delivery driver dropped off much less than I expected to receive. The driver maintained distance, had placed the items at the door step, rang the doorbell and knocked. He was very polite, explained the missing items are a common occurrence right now. No problem, not his fault anyway. I tipped him $7 online. End result is, no meats, cheese, paper products, or eggs received, bagels substituted for sandwich bread, and nothing to put on the bagels other than what I already have in my fridge or pantry. No frozen veggies either but I did get some apples. Received the pasta and potato flakes.

TL;DR I paid Walmart $17 for delivery (and tip) to get half my shit and no protein because people won't stop panic shopping.

""Beginning on Friday, March 20, seniors across Texas, aged 60 and older, will be able to place orders with Favor using a curated list of grocery essentials available from H-E-B."" 

Notice  ""curated"" list. So you can only order what they are letting you buy from the list, not from what is available from HEB. Check out the prices below, HEB and Favor should be ashamed of themselves for what they are charging seniors and what is available. Apple a dollar forty. Canned Fruit a dollar fifty (what kind of fruit, generic brand?) IMHO, this is price gouging one of the most venerable sections of our society. Sure, free delivery, but we're overcharging for vaguely described food at prices much higher than you would find in the store. Shame on you

As I was passing people - runners, couples, groups, dog walkers, families - I realized this probably wasn't a safe situation for me (old guy) or them. I was coming up directly behind people, some of whom were respirating hard, many side-by-side and ignoring the center line, many thinking they were clear of everyone. Then I'm having to pass when there wasn't often more than 2 feet of clearance on the 8 foot wide trail. Many smiled, a few were freaked out. One guy had spit just as I was coming up to him. I called out ""on-your-left"" quite a few times. 

When I returned home, I used Parmer Lane. Ironically, that felt a lot safer.  What do you think? I know how it affects me when I behind a smoker walking the same direction on a sidewalk, and it's not great.

* Empty dairy shelves, *except* plenty of Mexican-style sour cream.
* No dried beans, *except* lots and lots of chickpeas.
* No canned beans, *except* food service size cans of baked beans (and others)

Hope to have you there!

\------------------

In case you haven't seen these posts yet, I host these events called Skip the Small Talks where I put strangers in a room and get them talking to each other about more meaningful and interesting stuff than social norms generally allow. My background is in social and clinical psychology research, so my approach is informed by the literature on self-disclosure, question-asking, game theory, and some other stuff that I can nerd out about in person if you end up coming to the event and are interested in hearing me ramble for a while. But basically, we use cards with questions written on them and a lot of structure to allow people to open up to strangers more comfortably and quickly than you might usually.

People have reported finding Skip the Small Talks useful for meeting new people, for becoming more comfortable in social situations outside of Skip the Small Talk, and for interacting with humans in a low-effort context. Some Redditors said some nice stuff about us [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/b0146n/experience_with_skip_the_small_talk/) if you want to check out other people's take on it.

You can check out all our events [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/skip-the-small-talk-10841599652) and you if you want to keep up with our events, you can sign up for our e-mail list [here](https://www.skipthesmalltalk.org/) (I don't spam, I don't share your e-mail address with anyone, and I really genuinely do hope you'll let me know if the e-mails ever start getting annoying).

I recently moved back home from Seattle to help my mom sell her house. During that move I had a steady job that I was capable of working remote, which was great! Well, my company was sold and subsequently my division was slowly laid off. I've been jobless for a few months, but the severance and unemployment was still sufficient while we did our work. I thought no big deal, I have plenty of time to find something else while we sell the place.

Turns out, the house went to market, received a great offer a few days later, and now it's gone to closing. So I have to leave way sooner than expected.

I have a 40lb, 3 year old black lab, and a healthy bank account from saving up, and no place to live. Because of my income being much less than on a monthly basis, no apartments are accepting my applications because of income requirement, and I don't have anyone who can be a guarantor seeing as my only family is my mom, who can't be on a lease right now since she's in the middle of buying a new house. Although realistically, I have enough money saved up to pay for rent for 7-8 months.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After many hours of deliberation and balancing our social and employee needs, we have made the decision to close all operations across all three Pinballz facilities until at least April 4th. We will re-evaluate opening one or more locations, in a limited or full capacity, at that time based on the recommendations of the City, State, and National Government.  
&gt;  
&gt;As you know, we have tried to remain open in limited capacity while complying with every city, state, and national mandate for public safety. We waited as long as financially possible to delay layoffs through hours reductions and voluntary layoffs. We have stayed open in a limited capacity to reduce the number of layoffs despite staggering daily losses, more than if we had closed our doors two weeks ago, believing this was best for our employees and their families while still being socially responsible. We closed attractions that were in confined areas, turned off games so players were at least 6’ apart, cancelled all parties and events, and maintained areas of isolation across the facility. We even paid our cleaning company to perform Covid-specific sanitizations of our facilities. We set up employee relief funds and food relief programs to help our employees get through, and added paying all laid off full time employee’s cobra health benefits through May 1st. We believe in our hearts that we took every precaution to remain open safely, but at this point is it most prudent to temporarily close.  
&gt;  
&gt;We will continue to sell gift cards and receive donations for our employee relief fund, rent and sell games, and any other way to bring in a trickle of money so we can reopen once it is safe enough to do so. If you want to support Pinballz and more importantly our employees, please do so through the gift card or ERF donation program on our web site. Stay healthy and safe and please revisit us once we can open again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Best Wishes-  
&gt;

It is very likely that next week we are going to see a big increase in the number of reported cases of coronavirus in Texas.  Although the increase in cases will be driven by the spread of virus, it will also likely be driven by the increase in tests performed, and the time between taking a test and receiving the results.

Texas is testing significantly more now than it did before.  On March 16, the first day of public testing data, we learned that the state had tested a total 1,268 people.  As you can see in the chart below, over the past three days, we have tested 2,100 on average every day; a huge improvement. 

If you combine the increase in testing with the common 3 - 7 day lag to receive test results, it's likely that we will see a big increase in reported cases shortly driven by the additional tests.

But, this is not all bad.  The more tests we perform, the more we know who is infected, and the faster we can control the spread of the virus.

If you want more details on testing data in Texas, below is a link to a more detailed write-up that not only digs deeper into the information, but also compares it to other states. 

[What 6 days of coronavirus testing data in Texas are telling us](http://guytweetstoomuch.blogspot.com/2020/03/what-6-days-of-coronavirus-testing-data.html)

Stay safe.

6846,6846,bemba_radio_bemba,1584964844,fnisb9,COVID-19," Although the number of coronavirus cases in Austin is the most common metric we look at to understand if things are getting better or worse in the city, the data can be misleading due to the small number of tests.

It is very likely that this week we are going to see a big increase in the number of reported cases of coronavirus. Although the increase in cases will be driven by the spread of virus, it will also likely be driven by the increase in tests performed, and the time between taking a test and receiving the results.

Texas is testing significantly more now than it did before. On March 16, the first day of public testing data, we learned that the state had tested a total 1,268 people.  As you can see in the chart below, over the past three days, we have tested 2,100 people on average every day; a huge improvement.

If you combine the increase in testing with the common 3 - 7 day lag to receive test results, it's likely that we will shortly see a big increase in reported cases driven by the additional tests.

But, this is not all bad. The more tests we perform, the more we know who is infected, and the faster we can control the spread of the virus.

If you want more details on testing data in Texas, below is a link to a more detailed write-up that not only digs deeper into the information, but also compares it to other states.

[What 6 days of coronavirus testing data in Texas are telling us](http://guytweetstoomuch.blogspot.com/2020/03/what-6-days-of-coronavirus-testing-data.html)

Don't forget to practice social distancing, wash your hands, and stay home so we can help reduce the impact of the virus in Austin.

Stay safe.

Samsung Austin Semiconductor still has over 9,000 employees coming to site every single day still, working in extremely dense office spaces during the worst contagion in a century. Uhm, what???

Only 350 randomly selected employees have been granted remote access from home. 

At this point, if Samsung is incapable of allowing the other 8,000 nonessential employees to work from home, due to security vulnerabilities or whatever...then they NEED to send them on furlough ASAP.

Samsung refusing to allow employees to work from home is 1 thing, but Samsung ALSO refusing to reduce hours or send employees home on furlough. I get it, furlough would suck. But we’re all going to pay a greater toll the longer this contagion lasts.

I did make an offer to the group to run a Virtual Table Top game of D&amp;D so we could continue to play, but got very little interest.  My son (being his first game) was super excited about it, and I thought I would test the waters here to see if there are any parents that would be interested in allowing their kids to play D&amp;D with a group of other kiddos.

We would be using [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php) for the VTT and either Discord or Google Hangouts for voice/music/video (if you are okay with it).

Guessing sessions would run 3 hours, most likely on Sunday's from 2-5.

There would be no costs, other than the time commitment.

The hardest part is I would not be able to accept more than maybe 4/5 kiddos as the games would be too chaotic trying to keep it on track.  Also ages would be 8 to 11 (as I want to keep them close to my sons age)

The settings would be the Sword Cost, a homebrew campaign geared towards the younger audience and avoiding some of the more adult themed aspects of the game.

Everyone is having a hard time right now. Everyone. So if you’re checking in on people’s well-being, make sure you’re including those in your life that are pregnant. 

The hospitals in Austin have just limited their visitors even more, allowing only one person for the entirety of labor, delivery, and post-partum. And they are all waiting for the other shoe to drop and have them limit it even further to no longer allowing any visitors (even fathers) like NY and WA have done. 

Many have family out of town that will most likely be unable to come to be their support team post-partum. 

Not to mention all the women who are trying to prepare their homes for baby’s arrival and are unable to get items shipped to them, unable to find diapers/formula/medicine, etc. 

It’s not just simply “oh my birth plan is changing”. Pregnancy, in all species, creates a NEED to have a safe and comfortable environment, a plan set in place, preparedness, a nest. This is biological and creates an enormous, unprecedented amount of stress when you’re unable to feel safe, comfortable, and prepared. 

So if you can, send them a message or FaceTime them and check in on them. Some things they’re stressed about might sound silly to you, you might be thinking: you are going to have a healthy baby to love, what does it matter? Please don’t tell them that. It matters so, so much to them. It’s terrifying to be completely out of control of a situation where every cell in your body is telling you to take control and protect. Acknowledge their fears and stresses and just be there to talk to them. They will never forget it. And it will make them feel better, if only for a moment.",Austin,This is just a tip to check in on your pregnant loved ones. They are not okay.

They're out of N95s and are having to reuse them which is very dangerous for them. We're making mask covers to protect the masks for as long as possible. We've had multiple orders from major hospitals and clinics in the central Texas area.

We're trying to streamline the process and one idea was to have cutting dies made. We need people in the area with Cricuts, Accucut, or Sizzix to cut them out. I was about to buy a Cricut for my stickers but since my business is now gone I can't afford to.

Is anyone in the area with these tools willing to help out? I know many of us in the art community have access to these machines and it would speed things up like crazy!

3. Reduces the use of toxic chemicals being used that kill people, wildlife, and ecosystems
4. Reduces the demand for GMO / GE corporate products that rely heavily on chemicals which destroy diversification / ecosystems

This new patient went around and shook hands with several staff members. Drug Rehabs are not true medical facilities, and many do not have any doctors on staff. They are ill-equipped to treat the residents they already have should there be an outbreak, and have no medical expertise in the realms of decontamination or quarantine.

These facilities have large numbers of people, many with health issues beyond addiction, living in close quarters. Additionally, they funnel those who complete their programs into sober living facilities all over the Austin area, where they continue to live in close quarters with upwards of 10-15 people in a single home.  


Additionally, those facilities with which I am familiar are not allowing their counselors to work from home/leverage telemedicine,  putting them and their families at risk.

I kept seeing the available delivery time field on the main page show ""available within the next 5 hours,"" but when I tried to check out, it was taken. It took me a bit to find the URL you need to stay on to grab a slot and I've included some tips to streamline the process.

Just make an account, fill your cart with your order, and once you get to [instacart.com/store/checkout\_v3](https://www.instacart.com/store/checkout_v3), refresh it periodically while working or Redditing or whatever it is you do to stay sane. Shoppers will pick up shifts or orders will be canceled or whatever it is that creates new same-day slots.

Sometimes on the cart page, a pop-up opens asking you to add new things to your cart. This blocks the view of available delivery times and would normally need to be manually closed.  Another extension can help with that: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-editor-for-css-less/ifhikkcafabcgolfjegfcgloomalapol](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-editor-for-css-less/ifhikkcafabcgolfjegfcgloomalapol)

I am looking to provide assistance for any elderly people within our community. I will be calling nursing homes today to see if they are in need of any supplies. Does anyone know of any couples that may not have family in the area?  Beyond providing supplies I am also hoping to help out with their mental health so any ideas like being able to provide artwork or maybe have musicians play some songs outside their windows. If any artists are available or interested in helping that would be a great way for them to get some work as well. 

If you are aware of anyone that could use help or are interested in helping please pm me.

I had a reservation to camp at Inks Lake (made months ago) this Thursday - Saturday. I called the park this morning to confirm status. The person I spoke to said that most campsites there and the majority of the park is closing today or tomorrow and they're issuing refunds to everyone who had a reservation. At inks lake only water + electric (RV sites) will be open and part of the park will be open for day use. All of the tent-camping sites are completely closed.

However, I need to occasionally need to go to the corner store, a 2 minute walk from my house, to get supplies and food.  I don't have any facemasks and I'm leaving those to the medical pros, so I was wondering if this homemade mask, combined with gloves and full sanitization of myself and everything I buy upon returning home would help at all to keep me safe.

I cut the bottom off a t-shirt, then cut a latex glove in half and sandwiched it in the shirt, and tied it tightly against my face.  The glove does not allow airflow and it is slightly hard to breathe, but it is manageable for quick trip to the corner store.  Anyone, especially nurses or doctors, have any advice? 

Thanks in advance.

7083,7083,JewishDoggy,1585073140,fo9svr,Nan,"Hi all! Not sure how many people this will reach, but I figured this is valuable information for most. I’ve done a lot of research on what is the best thing to do to get your groceries. These are the conclusions I’ve come to.

Overall, the best method is curbside ordering, and to only get items with an outside packaging that is disposable.

Here is this presented in list form because it’s easier to read.

*Curbside*
1. Order curbside online. Spots might not be available. Keep refreshing multiple sites throughout the day. 
2. Drive to the store at your curbside time without your A/C on or on the circulatory function. Optional, you can wear a doubled up 100% cotton t-shirt as a mask. (too safe?)
3. Open up your trunk for the groceries. Don’t roll the window down. Stay inside.
4. Bring your groceries inside and wipe down everything. Including your counter afterwards. 
5. Throw away all external packaging (unless you need it, maybe store it in old external packaging you may have OR let the external packaging sit in an area you won’t touch for three days) and put your items up
6. Wipe any personal items you may have touched
7. Put everything you’re wearing in the washer for three days or to wash
8. Wash your hands thoroughly
9. Take a thorough shower

*Social Distance Shopping*
1. Wear a doubled up 100% cotton t-shirt as a mask. (long clothing optional) It’s 75% as effective as a surgical mask. Gloves too if you can. 
2. Drive to the store with your A/C off or on the circulatory function to prevent any COVID-19 from being blown in your face.
2. Stay 6 feet away from everyone.
3. Wipe down your cart, including the bottom. 
4. Don’t touch your fucking face.
5. Take your groceries home
6. Bring your groceries inside and wipe down everything. Including your counter afterwards. 
7. Throw away all external packaging (unless you need it, maybe store it in old external packaging you may have OR let the external packaging sit in an area you won’t touch for three days) and put your items up
8. Wipe any personal items you may have touched
9. Put everything you’re wearing in the washer for three days or to wash
10. Wash your hands thoroughly
11. Take a thorough shower

*Why should I do any of this shit?*
Coronavirus lives in the air for 3 hours and on surfaces for up to three days. Also lives in the freezer for two years. Your biggest risk is being near someone who has COVID-19, except the thing is you could show no symptoms for up to two weeks (the average is 4-5 days). COVID-19 is special because it produces an insane amount of virus cells. 1000 times more than SARS.

Two weeks ago my 2013 Honda Ruckus was stolen from my apartment near West Campus...again...first time was back in 2016. It was likely picked up and thrown in the back of a pickup because Ruckuses are so light. This obviously sucks, but it's even worse because I am a college student and neither my vehicle insurance nor renters insurance is covering the loss, it was my sole mode of transport, and there is no security cam footage of the theft. So I thought it wouldn't hurt to make a desperate plea for help here about keeping an eye out for my Ruckus.

Here's some info about my Ruckus:

\- Black with red lettering 

\- Missing front and rear fenders (probably the most identifiable feature)

\- UT motorcycle parking permit stuck to the front-left side which is extremely hard to remove without scratching the hell out of the metal

\- No mirrors

\- A Two Brothers Racing Black Series M-2 Aluminum Exhaust System, it's a large silver muffler with a black tip and a lot louder than the stock exhaust (I got it because it was surprisingly a lot cheaper than a stock replacement system and helps cars notice me).

\- The left blinker is bent and on the left side of the handlebars where the mirror is supposed to attach the silver-colored metal is ground down from a previous accident.

\- TX Plate

Sadly I do not have a photo of my ruckus, but the attached photo is almost identical.

So, if by some miracle anyone is out on a walk or searching the internet and sees my ruckus, I'd greatly appreciate it if you would call the police or send me a dm here. My case number with APD is 200711426.

Thanks to those who spent their time reading all that, stay safe out there.

But with frozen foods, it’s best to wait until they’re semi-dry or not covered in frost, which is the case once they’re brought home anyway. 

Could spray 409 all over them, let it sit for a sec, and wipe it with a paper towel, or just use Lysol wipes. 

If you have neither of those, another aseptic technique is to remove the contents directly into the freezer and tossing the box. Or frozen veggies, you can dump them into Tupperware and toss the bag.

Might sound stupid as hell, but yea.

Also wipe your fridge handle.

7187,7187,RationalAnarchy,1585103678,foikvj,Nan,"Dear Austin,

My mom is in an ICU unit downtown. She has been there for 4 weeks after having emergency surgery late last month. She has battled through sepsis, 2nd surgeries, 3rd surgeries, and multiple complications. She is now starting to recover; she’s a fighter and we are proud of her. In the next week our goal is to get her off the ventilator and out of ICU. 

Everyday I go to and from the hospital, I see a problem brewing. You see, the hospital won’t have enough ventilators to go around if too many people get sick at the same time. Yet, I see people in the past 5 days not practicing good social distancing. I see people hosting car clubs in the County Line parking lot with 20+ attendees. I see joggers stop to shake hands and chat for a bit. I even see people hosting private parties at their homes. Now I’m seeing pics of people packed into  Zilker...

Austin, stop. Please take this seriously now that an ordinance is being issued. Don’t make this a game, because the prizes for “winning” aren’t worth it. 

Best case scenario if you get sick and require hospitalization is you get a ventilator, or other help, and recover. Just know that if you get put on a ventilator, it is possible that you are being given that ventilator after medical staff had to decide who to give it to. Meaning someone else didn’t get the support they needed to survive, so you’d have a chance to live. This is happening right now in Italy, and it will be happening soon in New York and Washington. My mom is 68. Don’t take her ventilator because you couldn’t follow the rules. 

Think about my mom. Think about yourself. Be safe, and don’t take stupid chances with your life or the lives of others. 

We can do this. We can make this a safe place and flatten the curve. To do it we have to do it together though.",Austin,"A letter to Austin, from someone you can help. (COVID-19)"

 Dear Austin ISD Family,

I hope this note finds you well. I am writing to provide a COVID-19 update, learning at home and meal distribution resources. I know you are concerned, and so am I, so I wanted to make sure we shared some helpful reminders on how you can keep your family and our community safe. 

In response to the Stay Home - Work Safe Order issued by the City of Austin and Travis county, AISD schools are closed through April 13. Even though our schools are not open, we will facilitate continuous learning opportunities for our students. Austin ISD staff and families should prepare for schools to be closed for a longer period of time.

Austin ISD is committed to providing ongoing communication regarding district measures taken to assist public health officials in their prevention of COVID-19 (the coronavirus). Please know, this is an ongoing situation. We ask that you refer to austinisd.org/coronavirus for daily updates and the most current information.

Families are encouraged to visit AISD Learning at-Home for instructional activities to use with their students. These activities are designed to keep up the learning, but will not be used for grades. 

For information on meal distribution, please visit www.austinisd.org/coronavirus/meals.

For specific information regarding your student and family, please contact your campus principal.

Please remember, the best way to lessen the effects of COVID-19 in our community: 

Reduce our social interactions by 90 percent.
Practice social distancing: maintain distance of 6 feet (approximately 2 meters) from others when possible.
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when sick.
Cover your mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow when coughing or sneezing.
Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces.",Austin,AISD - non News

Just like most of us in Austin, we are stuck at home outside of fielding a few on call dental emergencies. We've been trying to think of how we can help out the community during this time as we have donated most of our PPE (gloves, masks, etc) to Local EDs. 

I've seen in a few places people are unsure what to do about dental emergencies/issues. If you have a dentist, many of us are on call for emergencies right now so please contact your dentist! If you don't have a dentist or yours is closed please feel free to contact me or my group!  We have a virtual consult platform that we have been testing out that we can utilize. There's no charge, I just want to offer our help in any way we can. We will try to answer any dental emergencies or questions as soon as possible. IF it is a true emergency then we can arrange a time to see you in our office on South Lamar. Mostly we just want to help our fellow Austinites in this time of need.

Shortly after moving in I discovered that there's a smoker in the building and it travels into my unit. It makes me feel sick, irritates my eyes and throat, gives me a bad headache and I have trouble sleeping at it's worst. The smell is starting to get onto my things. I've purchased 2 air purifiers, activated charcoal, febreeze air fresheners and a number of other things in attempt to mitigate it. However it's a daily struggle to keep the smell out. Often I'm forced to run the A/C unit often as it seems to help get the smell out of my space. 

I've already complained to the leasing office as well as the corporate office for the property management company. Unfortunately the apartment complex isn't giving me any options besides paying more to move to a smaller unit or ending the lease without penalty. I was looking for the last few weeks, however it's difficult to find a place on such short notice while trying to maintain a budget while also trying not to miss work. With this lockdown, Im having to work from home and deal with this constantly. This situation is becoming increasingly unbearable. 

I'm not sure if any apartments are leasing right now or if any movers are moving. Does anyone know?

I wanted to give y'all some insight on what's going on in the auto industry and give y'all some tips and information.

I work in service at a local Chevrolet dealership here. I'm a former technician and former service advisor and have been in the industry for about 10 years now.

Some of the information I have is specific to what we're doing, but I imagine other dealerships are doing the same.

**First,** as far as what we're doing:

We've rearranged our waiting area to give lots of space between seats.

We have stopped offering food and coffee and closed off our kids play area.

We are disinfecting wherever we can, especially on commonly used entrances.

We have also placed cones and barriers to keep people farther back from our cashiers and parts department employees.

We are also using steering wheel and seat covers and have also ordered a few gallons of a disinfectant product for automotive use that is fast acting and does not damage interiors, including leather seats.

We have also started offering a concierge service to pick up and deliver vehicles for regular maintenance. We are still developing this process, but it looks like it's something that will be here to stay even after things cool down and we're back to a more normal way of life.

**Second,** as far taking care of your own vehicle:

If you are not driving your vehicle, I recommend starting it up and letting it idle for about 20-30 minutes every couple of weeks. If your battery is a bit old, you might need to do this every week or so. This will keep your battery healthy, let your engine get up to operating temperature and ensure that your engine gets oil to all the right places.

I saw a reddit post regarding using fuel stabilizer and honestly, I don't think we're at a point where you really need to take that into consideration. If you fill up about once every 4 to 6 weeks, you'll be fine.

I would normally recommend that you drive around the block for a bit when you do go to warm up your vehicle, but that's a bit inadvisable with the stay in shelter order. What I do recommend is that you move your vehicle out of your driveway or parking spot and flip it front to back. This will give your transmission a bit to do to make sure it stays lubricated and will keep your tires from sitting in one spot for too long and going out of round.

**If you do need to service your vehicle**, here are a few things to keep in mind

**With oil changes** -Most modern vehicles now have a reminder for when to change your oil. Even in these times, I recommend keeping up on that since oil is the life blood of your engine and is the easiest thing that can cause damage if neglected. With that in mind, on GM vehicles (Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet, Buick), they have an oil life percentage that marks when you are due. The general rule of thumb is to come in and get your oil changed when it gets below 20%, but with the current situation, I recommend pushing it to below 5%. Your engine will be fine, and studies have shown you can even push it a bit past 0% (though I don't recommend going that far because you're entering questionable territory).

If your vehicle currently has a check engine light that stays on, is not flashing, and the car shows no other symptoms, I recommend you continue to drive the vehicle as is until things calm down a bit. You may feel a slight loss of power and see slightly worse fuel economy, but the vehicle should still be drive-able and you won't be doing any harm. However, if other symptoms are present, call your preferred shop and see what they say regarding getting your vehicle serviced.

I'm not sure I can speak for other dealerships, but we are not looking at minor concerns. This includes things like reprogramming radios, addressing trim issues, wind noises, and things in general that will not keep a vehicle from getting you from A to B.

What we are looking to work on is drive-ability issues and safety concerns. This means vehicles that the engine is cutting out while driving, brakes, flashing check engine lights (if you have this, bring it into a shop immediately), jerking or stuttering while driving, coolant and oil leaks, etc. 

If you're not sure if you fall under any of those categories, you can always call your preferred service department and ask.

With the temperature going up, it won't be long until we consider inoperative A/C a safety issue, and you would be able to bring your vehicle in immediately and without appointment.

Right now, business is very very slow. Although that's not great for business, I'm glad to see this as it's good for the community and the employees here. I can also tell you that our dealership has an abundance of loaner vehicles at the moment. We normally reserve those for customers that purchased here or are under factory warranty, but we may be lightening those rules a bit in the near future.

I hope that's helpful. Feel free to ask any questions, and wash your hands and stay home if you can!",Austin,Regarding auto repairs and services

Dear Del Valle ISD Families,

We know the past few days have not been easy for our families and that there is still uncertainty ahead of us. Our top priority remains maintaining good health and safety for our students, families, and staff. 

As you know, Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Sarah Eckardt issued a “shelter in place” through April 13 in addition to their previous ban on gatherings of over 10 people until May 1st.  Yesterday, Dr. Mark Escott, interim health authority for Austin and Travis County, called for all schools to remain closed for the remainder of the school year. After careful consideration of this information and discussion with area superintendents, Del Valle ISD has determined that it is in the best interest of our community to remain closed through May 1st. 

Please know this decision was thoroughly deliberated and a difficult one to make. We know the extended time away from school may create challenges for our families. However, the new information provided by our local health officials makes this extended time away from school necessary to help contain the spread of the virus in our community. We also want to commit to our families that we will make proactive decisions in order to create some level of predictability in these unpredictable times.

While our buildings are closed, learning will continue. During spring break and throughout this week, we have worked diligently to distribute technology, prepare our teachers for a new online learning environment, and continue our meal service. We distributed about 2,500 Chromebooks and over 20,000 meals to our families, and will continue to support our community.

A separate communication will follow shortly detailing next steps in this endeavor, as together, we continue on this journey.  

Sincerely,

Annette Tielle, Ed.D.

Dear Round Rock ISD community,

In the best interest of the health and safety of our students and staff, Round Rock ISD will be extending school and office closures until April 13. This date aligns with both Travis and Williamson counties’ stay home, stay safe orders, and allows our entire community to do our part in keeping each other as healthy as possible.

While this extension could mean students and staff will be back in our schools and facilities on April 13, we should prepare as a community for the strong possibility of school closures extending further, potentially through the end of the school year. Throughout Spring Break and during this school closure, District and campus leadership have been working together to prepare for that possibility and ensure that all students will continue to receive a robust and engaging educational experience. Much of the work has been and is focused on finalizing our transition to an at-home learning platform and training educators prior to April 5, while developing a strategy to ensure device and internet access for our students who may not have these resources readily available.

We know that each of our students has different needs, and our work remains dedicated to ensuring these individual needs are met. In addition to the instructional platform, we are also preparing to fulfill the Individual Education Plans of our thousands of students with special needs as required by federal law. Our special education team is working day and night to determine ways we can transition to providing  at-home support for these students.

Beyond instructional and academics, we know our students and families rely on us for so much more. To help provide the nutritional support our students need as campus and office closures continue, our Food Services Department will continue to provide meals for students. We are also in the process of expanding to weekend student meal service. Details on the weekend expansion will be shared with our community soon.

As we navigate and move forward through this uncharted territory, I want to thank the Round Rock ISD Board of Trustees, our students, staff, parents, and community for their support and patience. We will remain committed to ensuring the safety and health of our entire community during this global pandemic and are grateful for our partnership as we work collectively to do what is best for students and staff.

I will continue to write to you as more information is available to keep you, as members of our Round Rock ISD community, informed and mindful of what may be in our future. Updates will also be shared with our community through email, text and phone calls on this developing situation. Please visit our Coronavirus webpage with current information about our District’s response and plans related to COVID-19. We will also provide information on our Facebook and Twitter pages.

Thank you for working alongside us to keep our community, state and nation as healthy and safe as possible.

Respectfully,

The wealthy, organized, and esteemed Gay Community did not have a neighborhood and coveted the aesthetically beautiful East Austin for its location and the way it slopes down to the river/Town Lake/LadyBird lake.
The tactics of this silent war of aggression included; deliberately fielding Black and Brown-faced politicians whose tax and spend deliberately policies destroyed Black and Hispanic property ownership, police manslaughter, prosecutors handing out overly harsh sentences, marketing their neighborhoods, and of course using wealth in a concerted manner to buy out the locals. 
This was consented to by the Bush &amp; Obama administrations. The economist Richard Florida's 2002 ""Rise of the Creative Class"" gave priority to Techies, gays, and hipsters.  The elitist, Pres. G.W. Bush, was familiar with Austin's geography.  It was seen as a waste for this valuable land to be inhabited by the Blacks and Hispanic communities.  An East Side Gay Community was and is seen as cultural and economic progress. 
Masculine, Black and Hispanic  gangmembers were an impediment to this plan.  It should come as no surprise that there was a rise in the police shootings of young blackmen and a resulting 2005 U.S. DOJ investigation of APD shootings of them. They had to do the dirty work before the body cameras and police camera system was fully erected (High Activity Location Observatory.)
The homofilia of the media and local, white liberals paved the way for consent. An ascendant gay/hipster East Austin is the cause of the destruction of East Austin's Historic Black and Hispanic communities. However, the homofile media of hipsters and gays only celebrates what EastCider's website calls ""The New Texas."" There is No concern or Shame about the destruction of Austin's Historic Black and Hispanic communities, our city's social fabric, The Real ATX.
Austin's city leaders (misleaders) only care about marketing Austin to a national gay and hipster community (at the expense of locals.) Binary Black and Hispanic lives are destroyed for the benefit of pink ones.",Austin,The Ethnic Cleansing of East Austin

Please join the Facebook group [Margs For Life TX](https://www.facebook.com/groups/margsforlifetx/?fref=mentions) if you want to support local restaurants, restaurant workers &amp; restaurant suppliers.

A huge hindrance to maximizing revenues for restaurants right now is that they can't legally make cocktails ""to-go.""

Daiquiris and wine-a-ritas are not cocktails or spirits. These are possible because of BG Permits (Beer and Wine Permit). In a BG permit, you can sell beer and wine to go. They don’t even have to sell food with it.

What we want to accomplish here is for MB (Mixed Beverage) Permit holders aka bars and restaurants to get the same treatment only with the service of food.

Keep in mind that this is not some novel idea. It’s been tried before...and failed. But, never has the governor ever put out a press release giving restaurants the right to do something during a statewide (worldwide) state of emergency and shut down the economy at the same time. It’s a perfect storm of sh!t for restaurants. But, every trade group and every manufacturer has said, in some capacity — We need hundreds of thousands of voters that want this. This can’t be a meeting of suits with the governor. It needs to be a meeting of millions of Texans with the governor, hat in hand saying “Help me. Help Texas. Help us survive.” And, this is what politicians lose elections over — VOTERS. And, now is the time for this groundswell support to actually make a difference. Half a million voters makes a hell of a difference. Today, I heard a bleeding heart liberal say that if Abbott did this, she would vote Republican. This hits home to a lot of people, because it’s all about just keeping your home right now. So, that’s the plan, and it starts with this Facebook Group. Help me get it to 500K members so we can push this through. [#margsforlifetx](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/margsforlifetx?hc_location=ufi)",Austin,Margs for Life TX

It looks like a federal stimulus package will be passed soon, part of which is the direct cash payments to many Americans. As someone fortunate enough to have kept my job through all this, my financial situation is pretty much the same as it was pre-pandemic. I do, however, fall within the income threshold to receive federal cash.

I'd feel horrible spending my free federal money when I know for certain many, many people in Austin could use it more. So my question is: **what are some local charities doing good work to help people during this crisis?**

It can be anything from providing lunches to school kids, hospitals, food banks, GoFundMe's for children of sick parents or hospital workers, etc.

I know for certain I can't be the only one in this financial situation, and in a great position to do something good. I mean it isn't every day you get a free ~$1000 and get to spend it on helping people in your community, no strings attached!

If anyone needs any kind of technical help, advice, consulting, hands-on implementation - anything - I'm here to help 100% free of charge.

There is no problem too big or small. Whether you need to move your offline business into an online format, or even if you're just having internet issues.

Here are some examples of things I can help with:

- Websites: New websites or website updates (Wordpress), hosting, speed, design, responsiveness, etc. 

- Transferring physical to online: Meetings, classes, trainings, events, whatever you've got - let's tackle the challenge

- General tech &amp; internet issues. Let me know where you're stuck and I'll help you out.

- Advertising: Google Ads (PPC in general) &amp; SEO. I can help you with strategy and give you a to-do list.

- Moving forward: I'm not a seer, but I have been through the wringer a time or two, and I've got plenty of experience in getting out of a bind. We can do some brainstorming at the very least to help you keep your biz moving forward and maintain/plan for income.

I've got experience with a lot, not limited to: local businesses who need to sell online, dropshipping, email marketing, affiliate marketing, service-based businesses, B2B marketing, and more.

Some specific examples of things I could help with regarding websites:

- Creating a place to explain things to clients/people in one location
- Collect emails from clients / prospects / anyone else, and being able to reach out to bulk contacts
- Sell online &amp; accept payments digitally
- Give people a place to schedule/book with you digitally (Easy to link up to Zoom for 1:1 calls, conferences, group classes, etc)

There's probably more that I could help out with that I haven't though to list, so **don't hesitate to reach out**, even if you've got a need that I haven't specifically covered above. 

I'm here to help as many people as I can manage. I've got the free time now. Just PM me and we'll take it from there.

7578,7578,lvbni,1585315362,fpwuc8,Ask Austin,"I work in a grocery store - an Austin-born grocery store where people who are from Austin will have shopped all their lives and feel very at home, and where people who've arrived here from elsewhere will visit like a tourist attraction. A place where, oh, I don't know, you might find yourself spending your *whole paycheck*.  


I'd like to share with you a little bit about how that experience is for me.   
To be honest, it's pretty rough even on a good day and when there isn't a wildly virulent and terrifyingly lethal pandemic wiping out humanity.   
We do the work of 2 or 3 people, we work for a soulless corporation that is seemingly taking over all commerce on Earth, thus all is for profit, none is for people.  Because of that, it's not a particularly good humane place to work, and my store, anyway, has a really toxic culture that you'd probably be shocked at.   


Our turnover is high. I recently witnessed someone who'd worked part time for only a month (and really, really needed the money) throw their hat down in the middle of their shift, proclaim ""fuck this shit."" and walk out.  People leave to take their lunch breaks, and sometimes they just never come back and no one ever hears from them again. We had a very experienced and professional manager who was new to the company (but not to the business) walk out in the middle of the rush on the day before Thanksgiving.  


All this to say, yes, we are smiling. If you ask us if it's fun to work there, we'll tell you it's great - but that's the only way we can respond without getting fired, and who wants to complain about their job to random guests at the supermarket, anyway? But it's not great. And many of us are stuck because for various reasons, it's the best-paying job we are able to get.  
Take me: I'm the mother of 3 children, one is special-needs. I was a stay at home mother for years and years. I home schooled my kids. When I got divorced, I was unprepared and my ex-husband did me very, very dirty. I have no family. I wound up homeless with my kids.   
I have a high school education, and so I wound up working here. I'm trying desperately to get ahead and get some education and get something better, but it's long. It's slow. It's hard.  
Or, at least I was, before the world was ending.   


Now, I'm so grateful to have my shitty grocery job because it means my kids won't starve.  
But I'd also like to not kill my entire family by bringing home Covid while hospitals are full.  
I'd like very much not to have my children end up among the bodies being thrown in a pile, nor for them to have me disappear from their lives without a chance to say goodbye or so much as a funeral, which is how it's going now all over the world.  
We are under-insured, like so many, so even if we survived, it would ruin us financially.  


So.

I know you're bored. We all are. But if you're bored, take up a new hobby. Write in a journal. Do yoga.  Paint. Play  video games. Binge watch TV shows. Work out. Learn a language. Meditate.     
Please just stay home to do it.  
But, hey, we all gotta eat, so if you REALLY need food - like REALLY, REALLY NEED IT...  


1. ORDER OUT WHEN YOU CAN  
Please patronize local restaurants. They are much better equipped to keep their employees safe and aren't crippled by corporate mandates that prioritize ""customer experience"" over the health, safety, and lives of their employees and customers. And they need your business and Jeff Bezos really, really doesn't. Local breweries are delivering, too. Shop small right now, people. Please.   

2. IF YOU REALLY MUST GO TO THE GROCERY STORE, ABIDE BY THE RULES  
There will be signs posted everywhere and security guards and rules. Just fucking follow them.  

3. STAY THE HELL BACK.  
Even if no one else is. See those lines on the floor? Those are cool and everything but they were not measured. Sometimes they mark five feet. Sometimes they mark four. Does it look like your dad could lay down in it without his head or feet clearing the lines? Cool, it's probably close to 6 feet. Now stay a little farther back than that.  If it doesn't, picture your dad laying on the ground and stay farther back than that, no matter where the line is. If you have a question, stand six feet back when you ask it. If someone is stocking shelves where you want to go, just WAIT. It will take forever. People will be annoyed. WHO CARES?  SET AN EXAMPLE.  You have the power right now TO SAVE LIVES by literally doing nothing. PLEASE DO IT.  


Please realize, I am handling thousands of filthy items that have been handled by tens and hundreds of people across the globe before they got to me me. I am placing them on filthy shelves. I can't maintain social distancing from my coworkers, of whom there are hundreds.  I have hundreds of people in my face, every day - breathing right on me, coughing, sneezing... Hell, we even have this one crazy lady that walks around spitting into a cup like it's a sport. (SPITTING. WHY?)  We are cleaning up random strangers' vomit and shit, and the spittle-covered food refuse y'all leave around the store when you steal food by eating it there and stashing the trash.   


In short, get your shit together, Austin. Stay home. And if you can't stay home, stay back.

The Cottage Food Law lets people sell certain foods from their home, directly to people in Texas. You can sell your food online, and deliver it to people.

It's not uncommon for people to sell homemade food in facebook groups and other places online (/r/austinclassifieds ?). If I wanted to try and do this, I'd also be very careful about food safety, and probably include some information (and photos) about the precautions that are being taken.

As of September 1, 2019 you may sell the following homemade food items:

- Any food, excluding meat, that does not require time or temperature control to prevent spoilage
- Baked goods that do not require refrigeration, such as cakes, cookies, breads, and pastries
- Candy
- Coated and uncoated nuts
- Unroasted nut butters
- Fruit butters
- Canned jams and jellies
- Fruit pies
- Dehydrated fruits and vegetables including dried beans
- Popcorn and popcorn snacks
- Cereal, including granola
- Dry mixes
- Vinegar
- Mustard
- Roasted coffee or dry tea
- Dried herbs or herb mixes
- Whole (uncut) frozen fruits or vegetables
- Canned acidified plant-based foods with a pH of 4.6 or less
- Fermented vegetables with a pH of 4.6 or less

\- Limiting the number of people in the store by having an employee waive people in.

\- A staffed sanitizing station at the front door, with the gel and wipes.

\- Newly installed plexiglass in front of the pharmacy, with the employees wiping down the CC machine in between every customer.

\- Marked spaces to distance people waiting in line.

\- Every other self checkout station shut down so there is a space in between people.

\- $2 raise for all employees

7708,7708,fieldmedics,1585380089,fqfi10,Nan,"So I went to the Austin VA clinic to get a much needed medication from the Pharmacy. I have COPD from asthma and use a rescue inhaler during this allergy time of the year. I also could not wait for meds to be mailed because I was completely out.   
Now, I am a retired medic who has been in Fire/EMS for a number of years \[mostly rural\]. So when I get to the front of the clinic there are two station tables outside with people in PPE \[personal protection equipment; if you didn't know\] Now, I completely understand what is going on and it doesn't bother me. SO the questions begin.  

1. Have you recently traveled outside of the United States, possibly to a nation currently under Covid-19 infection?   No I have not. I have much better things to do here at home like lurk on reddit everyday. 
2. Do you know or have been in contact with anyone that has been diagnosed covid-19?  Uh, nope not to my knowledge. 
3. Have you had any runny nose or shortness of breath?    Yes, I have a runny nose right now and I am short of breath which is why I am here to visit the pharmacy. 

It was at this answer the person asking the question gets on the radio and I can hear them requesting a golf cart to the front of the clinic. They then tell me to walk towards another little staging area a wee bit further away from the front entrance to the facility. I am haded a mask and shooed off. 

I get to the covered area where I begin a nice game of 100 questions. No I know that they are doing their job and following protocol so I do my best to keep the running narrative in my head in MY HEAD and not letting it regurgitate from my mouth accidentally. 

So the golf cart arrives to the front, with a geared up individual driver motions for me, \[the golf care is one of those stretch carts that seat 6-8 people\] then tells me to sit at the very back where they usually put ones golf clubs.   Oh boy this is going to be fun I say. 

I am driven around to the back of the VA clinic. \[now, our clinic does not have a triage/er center manned but does have the facilities to run one.  This is also where patients are loaded into ambulances in case of emergencies\]  

So I know where I am going now. I start making my way to the doors and can see a police officer and two fully geared up nurses just inside.  Of course in my head I am thinking that all of this because of me having a bad allergy day and in need of a rescue inhaler.  OKAY.  

Just as I get to the door and it magically opens up, I hunch over just a tad bit, start dragging one leg behind me and arms flailing limply at my side I start groaning ""Brains!  More Brains!"" loong groooaaaaaan.   

I took a moment to take in all the looks of everyone who witnessed my dramatics and revelled in the moment that ""I"" probably just made these tired and overworked folks in this places day, and it was exceptionally gratifying to hear one of the nurses laugh so hard she chortled/snorted!   

tl/dr;   Old-fart and joker goes to the local clinic for meds and gets temporarily quarantined due to covid-19 only to reprise his dream job of being on the Walking Dead to the joy of the hard working staff present.",Austin,Just a funny tale from the Austin VA clinic

7710,7710,Theeunsunghero,1585386475,fqgntw,Nan,"An state agency wide memo went out today at my place of employment preparing us for the things to come. The memo stated that state leaders have asked all Texas government agencies at the state and local level to find ways to reduce cost. 

Now this is normally nothing unusual as we have seen past governor's set the same tone. However this memo makes note that this is specifically due to the nature of the epidemic and that the reduction of cost saving implementation will be severe. Or course these government bad news letters are always written in a much more civil and light hearted way. At least some tend to believe so. 

This might be a slow process and will possibly start with the freeze of hiring and pay incentives. We have been asked to take note that although they will make every effort to avoid it, agencies will ultimately be furloughing employees. Agencies will have to start drawing lines on what they deam as essential for the continuation of that specific agencies core function.

From my understanding members of upper management from all government agencies held meetings earlier this week to discuss what actions their specific agency will need to take. 

What does this mean for the general public? Considering that most agencies function with minimum staff to begin with, the reduction of public servants may ultimately mean longer wait times to recieve assistance and in more extreme cases no assistance as it's possible whole departments get fazed out. 

The wheels of the government already move slow enough. If you or someone else works for an government agency then you no doubt already understand the amount of red tape and obstacles that stand in the way of efficiency. Despite how upper management has always phrased it, politics is always involved with the lack of innovation. It is all to common to hear the phrase ""That's how we've done it since the 80's and it worked then so it should still work now"". Not to add additional somber during this epedemic but we need to consider that the decay of public programs is a possibility.

You don't have to look far in this sub to find comments from redditors asking what is the city is going to do or what is the state going to do, anytime they have an issue with something. Normally these comments are targeted towards the governor, mayor and city council. To shed light to some of you those people are not the ones doing the dirty work that you are asking. It's all the little people under them. 

So consider this the next time you are asking why isn't more being done by our state or our city. When you don't have the personnel to assist the great State of Texas then ultimately you will have to roll up your own sleeves and be prepared to get dirty doing the work yourself. This may not be a bad thing as some of you may already feel that the public is too dependent on the government. However for those of you that commonly ask what the government going to do to help you, the answer may not be an easy one. 

Just so you understand. This is happening all across our country. Covid-19 is going to have far reaching implications. It's not just the virus we need to be concerned with but the landscape of both the private and public sector are going to take a much larger hit then what we originally thought. 

Try to enjoy the comforts you have grown accustomed to living in our great country. We tend to take them for granted. When this is all over, however long that may be, we may all have a greater appreciation them.",Austin,Texas State and Local government agencies asked to tighten their belts.

So I’m struggling here. I live with an ER nurse in a small apartment. I am so proud of her for battling on the frontlines of this pandemic. That said, every day in my apartment is another day “exposed”. We’re doing our best and I’m sanitizing everything before each use. I fortunately have my own bathroom. However, this is going to go on... indefinitely. And I will be exposed every day until our lease ends or I get sick.

Thus far Austin doesn’t have healthcare housing setup. Is anyone else living with a healthcare worker? I don’t know what to do.

Help is available for anyone who might have a difficulty affording food along with rent, medical expenses, etc.

**Finding distributions**

* **Start online -** If you have internet, check the Central Texas Food Bank's [Find Food Now](https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/food-assistance/get-food-now) search tool. You can search by location. Bear in mind that times and locations are changing rapidly, so call the CTFB or pantry to confirm the distribution information.
* **Confirm by phone -** If you don't have internet or want to confirm a Find Food Now listing, [call the food bank](https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/get-help/help-food-stamps) at 512 (or 855 toll free) 684-2550. Assistance with referrals to food is available in English and Spanish during business hours. If you can, confirm again right before you go to a distribution, as changes are happening quickly.
* **Call 211** \- 211 is also getting updates from the Central Texas Food Bank and should have information that's almost as up-to-date. As a bonus, 211 can help locate resources besides food assistance.
* **Call the City of Austin** \- [Austin Public Health neighborhood centers](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/neighborhood-centers) are offering home delivery of non-perishable groceries on basis of emergency. Delivery is available only by appointment anywhere in Travis County. Call 512-972-5133 to be referred to nearby services or, if APH determines that there isn't another way for you to get food, to set up a delivery to your home within 1-3 business days. You can call Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

**Recommendations for visiting food distributions during COVID-19**

* **If driving, clear some space in your vehicle -** Many pantries have switched to a drive-through model in which clients stay in their vehicles. Before going, clear some space in your trunk or back seat so that volunteers can load food directly into your vehicle with no contact. Be ready to pop the trunk if you're able to.
* **If going on foot or on bike, bring a way to carry a 30-lb box of food safely** \- Almost all pantries that usually let you choose some items and decline others have switched to pre-boxing or pre-bagging food to minimize contact.
* **Know your rights -** Any pantry that partners with the food bank has to follow USDA intake procedures. Staff/volunteers will be required to get your name, address, the number of people in your household, and some basic qualifying information (receipt of federal benefits like SNAP or household income) -- and that is ALL. You NEVER need to show ID of any kind, provide proof of income or address, or share your status as documented/undocumented. During COVID-19, you also do not need to sign anything.
* **If you want to pick up food for someone else who won't be there with you, check ahead with the pantry** \- Any pantry that distributes USDA food has to have an intake form for the person who isn't coming and that person's signed permission for you to pick up for them. If you just show up without any documentation filled out ahead of time, you likely won't be able to get food for the other person.

I am 29 year old white male, single, immigrant, no debt, moved to Austin couple years ago. I am working in a tech field, although I am making only about ~40k per year. 

Besides things like exercising, maintaining healthy weight and reading, I am trying to save up some money by buying stocks, REITs, but no more than $100-200 per month. I am also saving up additional funds to pay for Masters degree in IT field, through online programs (it’s cheaper and fits my busy schedule better, plus keep in mind that since I am foreigner I can’t take any loans so I can basically only pay cash for my education). 

The only way I was able to keep up with my plan is by moving to a studio in a cheap and unpopular area of Austin. Well, as soon as I moved, I started to see why it’s only ~700 per month: domestic violence, burglary, theft, trash laying all over the place. If you are wondering about the area - it’s not far from East Rundberg lane. 

Overall it’s a great lesson for me, and an opportunity to become more cautious about my choices, especially when it comes to choosing a place of living.   

My question is... Is it worth to put yourself in a risk? Am I exaggerating my fears and concerns? I still have 10 month of lease contract and that doesn’t inspire me, although all I can do about it is just accept and learn from it or look for tenant replacement but then lose money and postpone my career growth and possible opportunities?

7835,7835,Austinhelpchild,1585460238,fr0q7e,Nan,"Basically, I am in a very frustrating situation. My boss is forcing me to work even though I, and the other employees are definitely not essential. We are all very frustrated but there doesn't seem to be anything we can do. Because people are still calling he is sending us out.

The first problem is that our work has slowed down to the point that there is only about two days worth of work for everybody. However, there is no consistency as to what day you may be required to work or even what hours. Might be required to work 8 hours one day and one hour 2 other days. This means that we are on call every single day.

The biggest problem, is that I have two small children in full-time daycare. But my paychecks are for about 2 days of work or less. I obviously cannot afford this.

Im afraid to quit because The job is actually decent paying and im afraid if I quit i wont find another job. 

So I guess I'm wondering if there is any childcare for ""essential"" workers that is discounted or free.

**fair warning, I'm basically just ranting below so no need to read if you have any info on my real question regarding childcare**

On a side note I'm so frustrated and scared having to go work I'm just crying all the time. I think mostly from frustration.  I just want to spit in my bosses face. Sorry for the aggression, I'm just so worn out and frustrated. 

Plus the customers have been horrible! I've been doing this job for 8 years and these are the worst customers I've ever seen. It just feels like this whole thing is bringing out the worst in people. It's spiraling me down and I'm not coping well. 

We literally had a customer tell us she had a Covid exposure and when we told her we couldn't do her stupid SUPER 100% not essential or critical job because of her exposure ( BUT WE COULD DO IT 7 DAYS LATER AFTER THE QUARANTINE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON WAS OVER )she freaked out!! Started yelling then went online and wrote a bad review.

Not to mention my boss only caring about making a buck.

Ok I'm just going to add the sadness cherry on top because I'm in my own head about how bummed out I am, but my beautiful sweet old dog died last week. He was the sweetest and most loyal person or animal I've ever known and I miss him deeply during this time

* The commonly proposed ""solution"" to this, having businesses come to multiple homes to provide their services, is **just as dangerous** during this pandemic, risking the same rapid spread of COVID-19.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

So I'm living in Austin with this person for almost half a year. Since the outbreak, we have been taking the social distancing and shelter in place seriously.

I really don't know what to do in this situation. I was telling him well if he goes there, just stay like 14 days and dont bring the virus home, half jokingly, but regarding my seriousness the previous days when we discuss the virus issue, I think he knows I disapprove of him going. However, he replies ""Well, the disease is not everywhere."" 

Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I'm getting angry. Shouldnt we go on dates like that with people we dont know the history of contact during a pandemic?

I recently was furloughed from a full-time position with a games company and am searching for part-time/seasonal work just to have some income coming in, to keep busy, and because I honestly miss working customer service jobs.

However.  It's been quite a while since I submitted applications like this and I wanted to check on the protocol.

I know for some positions/industries it's weird as hell (and almost rude) to call and follow up with an application, but for the food service jobs I've had it's pretty much expected to walk-in or call, even if the application was originally online.

I'm not sure what the standard is for a grocery store as I've never worked at one before.  Should I call and follow up if I haven't heard back within a week or so?  Or would that be considered rude/annoying?  

If you've been hired by applying online to a grocer, what did that process look like?

Again.  I know this question is silly.  But hey, I know there are a lot of people looking for part-time/seasonal work right now in jobs/industries they've got absolutely no experience working in so who knows, maybe it'll be helpful to someone else too!

I can't even imagine the extra workload those men and women are dealing with now. Most businesses in the area have private trash pickup but with most businesses closed the burden of trash is being shifted from private vendors to public utilities. Even in a world with take out, we're taking the to-go containers home and trashing them there when finished with them. 

It sounds like this weekend people took advantage of the nice weather to do landscaping which drove volumes up even higher. I know I don't really see too many compost bins in my hood but yesterday I saw a lot more than usual, most full of yard trimmings. 

Anyway no need to apologize. Say what you want about any imperfectly ran and managed city but trash collection seems to be one of those things that is ran very, very well.",Austin,Shout out to Austin's Trash and Recycling Crews

Central Health Tax District is the tax that Travis property owners pay about  $150/year, on average, to support indigent health care.  It's also a slush fund for a bunch of new stuff not used to support Travis County indigent health care (contrary to it's intended purpose). 

The tax dollars collected and the programs are being denied to the people to whom  it was supposed to benefit by making renewals of  benefits take  months instead of the usual 7-10 days.  In the past, recipients could  fill out an online form for renewal benefits, or see a benefits specialist in person within 7-10 days. to get coverage.

Now the renewal process can only be done by US mail.  The forms for  renewal MUST be sent out US mail, and only upon request.  Previously  they were sent out automatically before expiration of the benefit year.  The forms are now no  longer available online, either. And they will no longer email or fax them to  clients.  Recipients must wait the 7-10 business days to even receive  the forms (and only at their request).  Then fill them out, and send them  back in, and wait another 15-20 more days for them to be received,  processed, and approved.   Any incorrect or missing or questionable information will  then delay the process another 25-30 days. 

Meanwhile, thousands of recipients are now left without healthcare  benefits and urgently needed prescription benefits and must be paid in  full with cash on hand, which many people won't have right now.  Thousands of doctor appointments, emergency clinic visits, and  pre-approved medically necessary procedures are being cancelled or  forfeited due to this. 

But all this time, the Central Health Tax District is FULLY FUNDED and  the process otherwise healthy people sick and the  local Covid-19 situation even worse.  The process is purposely being  obfuscated so that recipients CAN""T use their benefits and will only  perpetuate the spread of Coronavirus at the expense and detriment of the  Travis county taxpayers. 

Most other State, Federal, County and City services have made exceptions and even extended benefits and services - from  rent, to evictions, foreclosures, utility payments, trash pickup, unemployment, etc.  Yet our Central Health Tax District has made it even harder to get the  benefits that have already been funded in advance and it remains unaffected by the  economy - also making the local economy,and the health of Travis County residents, even  worse.

On the military side of things, we have a pretty good playbook in terms of how to be supportive when someone is deployed - personal letters go further than you think, fresh socks never go out of style, and small creature comforts are both a treat and a psychological connection to civilized life/the civilized world.

In a similar vein, it'd be great if we could figure out what things we can do for or what things we can provide to our frontline COVID-19 workers that will resonate and be impactful.  I'm sure we all are trying to do what we can for those in our immediate circles, but it'd also be nice to identify some things we can do for those beyond those circles.

There've been a lot of stories about people donating PPE, and for many that's a no brainer if you happen to have any PPE.  Beyond that, I've seen people sending meals, cookies, and other treats which are nice gestures.  Also, it's acknowledged that the thing that can be done to help first and foremost is to stay home.

In terms of direct connections, assisting with household production (grocery shopping, chores, meal prep, walking the dog, etc) may be a bigger help than most realize in light of crazy work hours for many, provided it's done cautiously with regard to contamination.  But, what else can we do?  What's something small but meaningful and purposeful that anyone can do for anyone?

I filed for unemployment 2 weeks ago and have already received my first payment and such so everything is fine on that front. 

My main questions are:

1. Do we have any idea when we will be getting that $600 a week additional pay? I assume it will take a little bit, and thankfully I had an emergency savings to get me through bills for a month or two, but I’m just trying to get an idea.

2. Do I need to file anything differently to get the additional money? Like is there a separate form or site I have to go to different than the regular state unemployment?

3. When it says $600 a week, does that mean we can call to get a weekly payment, or we will just get $1200 added to the normal bi-weekly payments? (Meaning if I got paid, say, $300 every two weeks, I would get $1500 every two weeks?)

I just went and looked and she was in the back corner pecking around and covering something up with rocks, and only 3 eggs were visible. Right after that she went and sat on the 3 remaining eggs. 

So I am not sure what happened. I wonder if she was eating or burying the egg, or maybe it hatched and she put it in the corner. That doesn’t seem likely though.

For those who are fortunate to still be employed right now: 

One provision in the CARES act that I haven't seen much discussion about is a new $300 above the line deduction for charitable contributions in 2020. You can take this deduction and still claim the standard deduction, i.e. no need to itemize. 

I did a little bit of research on where to donate and my plan is to give to the Central Texas Food Bank. It looks like they are also doubling donations right now:

Half the items in my list were replaced/substituted, which is fine, I get it, this is a pandemic, except...every single replacement was with something 2-3x as expensive, and a lot of the substitutions were never run by me.

So just pay close attention to that.

The employee delivering, while very nice, did NOT social distance at all. She went right up to the window, even leaned in, and 0 protective gear (the PPE thing is fine, I get that we have a shortage, but still).

The cilantro I got was half rotten, the greens I got expire in 2 days, the bell peppers are moldy, and the steak has a fat tendon running through it.

Look, I understand we have shortages and employees are stressed. But come on, I expect to not have rotting/molding produce, at a minimum, especially when I'm paying a premium per item.

I would shop myself, but I'm at-risk and really don't want to gamble any more than I have to.

Maybe this was just a one-off, but it's not a great first experience, and I'd avoid Curbside unless absolutely necessary.

So far 44 of them have it and it is spreading. My wife has to work within a block or two of the area because UT business operations have not shut down for essential parts of the university. So now my family has additional cause for worry because of some brain dead kids.

Additionally, Adler has just ""URGED"" them to self-quarantine. This after the initial 28 already has jumped to 44 cases. What I want to know is, why have we not put all of them in a gymnasium somewhere until they ALL test clear? Why are we ""urging"" a group of people that can't see past their need to party, get wasted, and laid to do something? We have clear evidence that none of them have a fucking clue about social distancing.

It's also not like they didn't know that things were going bad. They went at a time when we knew shit had hit the fan. Other students who were also scheduled at the same time CANCELED. Sadly, those students might be infected by these wastes of oxygen who are not on lock-down.

Yes, I sound pissed. I am. I am trying not to wish bad outcomes on them and struggling mightily to keep from doing it. What does it take to get across to people that this isn't a joke? People dying like flies worldwide doesn't seem to be doing it.

I wish I could say it was just them being dumb, but as I have been forced to go out and try to keep my family fed, I see the same behavior all over the place. When I go to the store, I see people who just don't seem to care. Parent's that brought all their kids (I know that may be the only option they had) to the store and let them run around touching fruit/vegetables, people that don't understand 6 feet doesn't mean walk within almost hugging distance of me, and more. I almost wanted to ram my cart into one older guy who walked past me three times in the dead center of the aisle as I was trying to push myself into the shelves.

A week later I had the worst “flu” of my life. My symptoms mirrored most of those cited for Covid-19. It started out feeling like a pretty bad, standard flu.

I felt better by day 10 or so, only to get knocked back down on my ass another week. I’m very healthy and typically bounce back. This was just....different.

It sounded like I had rice crispy cereal in my lungs every breath I took until the end of January. Like risidual phlegm, but deeper, because I wasn’t coughing anything up!

That's the point. Do your part. Don't do the exact opposite of that.

* wear a mask when you go outside
* cross the street if you are approaching someone on the sidewalk
* don't zoom close by  to people whilst riding on your bike
* if you don't have a mask wear a bandanna or even a t-shirt wrapped around your face
* Don't gather in groups of any size
* Don't go inside the grocery store. Order Curbside (FREE) or have it delivered
* Do YOUR PART
* if you neighbor is in the backyard and they are to close because the lots are small or whatever, then simply wait until they go in, i.e wait your turn.
* If you see a group of people, like a family of 4 taking a walk, stop. LITERALLY STOP walking/riding and let them pass with a clear WIDE berth.
* Don't leave the house for McDonalds. Cook at home. Get a grip.
* Don't leave the house to wander around home depot. Order online or deal without.
* Outside your house = Contaminated. Period, treat it as such: Strip, Wash, decontaminate, sterilize upon re-entry, especially if you had close contact or were around people (like the grocery/pharm)

There is no reason to be close to anyone else. And about a million reasons to be far away from anyone else.

We are all in this together. Please follow the lead of the cautious. It will save lives, possibly someone you know. Will you know that your actions didn't kill my father, or you neighbor Will, or your boss, or you aunt, or that person you say hi to at work? No, you won't ever know who you saved by fighting the spread of this virus. But hear this: You WILL save someone's life by doing your absolute best to lock down and make the necessary HUGE adjustments to your life.

I’m not one to really like asking people for help, but I need it right now. I am on the hunt for n95 respirators for my gf. She’s a psych nurse and routinely helps patients that are psychotic or having other mental problems. The place she works at is okay, but they have her in a surgical mask and have restricted access to n95s. She has no real option besides getting in front of and talking to these patients, because of what they are going through.

To be entirely honest, I told her that if the company she works for can’t protect her to stop going to work. She is a better person than me and won’t do it because she has a ton of love for her patients.

So what I’m looking for is someone in the area who has seen some n95s somewhere, or has some. I promise they will be used responsibly by someone who has made a living out of helping people who often can’t help themselves.

I’m not asking for a handout and I insist on paying, I just need help finding some.

Message me or comment.

8716,8716,johngregson,1586056272,fv6v5l,Nan,"Hello,

I worked at Dogtopia for a little over a year.
Let me just start off by saying that it was hell.
I stayed so long due to my love for animals, and due to the way I saw other employees treat the dogs. I wanted to make sure it didn’t happen as often as I felt it did.

Pros? - So many people assume its great because it’s a franchise and because the buildings are very nice, therefore so many customers come in.

Cons?-
-NO RESTROOM- they have to go inside, therefore it gets all over the floors. Pick it up quickly
You say? Not so easy when more than one dog is using the restroom at the same time and when dogs are trying to eat each other’s feces/vomit. Then, with the peeing! Do we get a new mop or change the water every time a dog pees/marks a spot? No... the mop head is not changed and neither is the water.. so basically we create a nice layer of urine for your dog to slide around on with other dogs!!!
Not to mention- imagine being in a room with a bunch of dogs- it’s great if you’re a friendly dog who’s social and not timid, -but this isn’t the case many times and dogs experience high levels of anxiety.. especially with the fowl smells, loud noises, new faces, and all of the crates surrounding the room causing claustrophobia. Especially being crated for long amounts of times- which happens to MANY dogs, on MANY days.
FAVORITISM- Most of my coworkers pick favorites with the dogs so badly. If you spend a little bit of time viewing the webcams this is VERY easy to witness. Some dogs get to go out and about the whole time, some- a small amount of time, and others are crated if they’re difficult to discipline/handle.
DISRESPECTFUL PEOPLE AS EMPLOYEES- many of the people I worked with during the duration of my time at Dogtopia treated the dogs very poorly. Yelling, calling them names, shoving them...that or ignoring their existence. The people at Dogtopia (at least the ones I worked at, I worked at two different locations) do not have enough patience and
Kindness within themselves to handle dogs.. especially hyper, unpredictable, stubborn dogs. They expect them to all be easy to care for.. (not realistic at all.)
PRIORITIES ARE NOT STRAIGHT-
We’d have team meetings every day before my shifts (probably the only pro of the way things are ran) and they’d talk about how much money we had made currently, and to work hard to get more people to come, to get more money to win against competing Dogtopias. Everyone would talk about money the whole time and the prizes we would win. Nothing was ever about how the dogs are/dog related. Just about money/winning.
Did they ever want to talk about dog behavior, concerns, or just dogs in general? NO.
I spent so much time trying to make it work and to push for improvements but I took all I could take. I tried to be the kindest I could be to all of the dogs that came in, because I knew I worked with a bunch of impatient, disrespectful people. I tried to keep going. This was the closest animal related job near my house and I tried my hardest, gritting my teeth and biting my tongue.. but here goes. Here it is.
I would NEVER recommend Dogtopia to anyone... not even if it were someone I disliked... because dogs are amazing blessings and The Dogtopia look is a bunch of bullshit. These people are taking advantage of dog lovers.",Austin,"DOGTOPIA IS HELL ON EARTH FOR DOGS, don’t take your dog if you love your dog"

My SO and I have been planning on moving to Austin for awhile now. All of our plans (flights, Airbnb, etc) are scheduled for later this month. We were, of course, hoping to find a house while we visited, as our lease ends at the end of May.

I've seen mixed messages about real estate being essential, and many agents moving to virtual tours, but we would prefer to see the house in person (all of the ones we have saved are new/never lived in). 

As of right now, we are unsure of our plans. We know for a fact that we don't want to fly. We are willing to take the long trip to drive, minimizing contact with people along the way, and (hopefully?) be able to see a few houses. Would there be any law enforcement to prohibit us from doing this? Is moving essential travel?

We would be coming from a city that is not a hotspot of the virus. We have been quarantining (and healthy) since March 14th, only going out for essentials. 

If anyone has any advice or information regarding this please let me know.

So, that Friday before I got sick I had a cough and remember saying to my boss “oh might be getting sick” laughing it off with him because I NEVER get sick. Im a 30 year old man, very healthy for the most part. The next day I wake  up with a splitting headache and zero energy. My cough had worsened. I started taking cough drops, dayquill, tylonel for the headache, and Rubbing Vick’s vaporub on my chest. Then I started steaming out my bathroom with my shower because I know steam helps with coughs. 

I eventually developed a cough that I couldn’t cough up(dry cough) I believe the steam from the shower and Vick’s vaporub helped a bit, because I was able to breathe better and it seemed to relieve some mucus temporarily. On Sunday my condition got a bit worse, Monday I actually felt a tiny bit better. 


Monday eve early Tuesday morning, I woke up in the middle of the night with flu like symptoms I had a worse dry cough, and developed cold sweats on top of the fucking headache. I felt like shit. 


Next morn, I woke up and went into ARC and asked my doctor to take a look at me and described my symptoms. She tested me for the flu which I came back negative for. She told me It sounds like I had FULL ON PNEUMONIA. She Did not give me a pneumonia test because she could hear it in my lungs. She proceeded to give me antibiotics, an inhaler, Codine syrup, pro methazine. I was like “Da fuck? Pneumonia?”  

I hadn’t felt that terrible since I had the flu back in 2007. I started taking the medicine she gave me but didn’t feel any better until that Saturday. Sunday My fever had gone away but I still had a noticeable headache. Within the time I was actually sick, I noticed that anytime I would feel a bit better I would get up and feel worse with in a hour. 


Around this time is when the covid shit really started hitting the new stands in a major way, and in america people were talking about it way more.  

Ten days later, 2 weeks before anyone started quarantine)my wife comes home with a bad headache and a fever and proceeds to have the same exact symptoms as me and ended up with the same diagnostic, except everytime she stood up her heart rate would jump to 160 and she’d almost faint. When she went to the doctor after trying to ride it out for four days she damn near collapsed because she couldn’t breather and they put her on oxygen. All at ARC. They said she was radiating heat. They test her for flue, it came back negative. She recovered as well after About 12 days. 

We still do not know if we actually had this shit because there were no tests even manufactured in America at the time. I’m willing to bet on it. 

MY THEORY IS that COVID-19 spread around the globe before we even caught it and millions  are infected right now and are asymptotic. The first actual case was recorded December 20th and people were flying all over the fucking planet until March. 

Our government has senators who held a secret meeting about this shit and sold off their stock the week before the market crashed. Our leaders knew about this but wanted to put profit over people. Donald trump didn’t even believe this shit until a month ago. 


WE HAVE BEEN PLAYED and lied too and this could have been prevented.  

Be careful people, if you get sick stay in bed. It fucks with you real hard if you move around. Try Vick’s vaporub too. Shit works wonders.

It’s not that complicated. It’s a swab and liquid viral transport media or liquid aimes media. There is a good chance another industry other than medical uses it. Food science or environmental testing are what comes to mind first. 

The swabs most widely available before this are made by Copan in Italy. If you work for an industry that does any kind of testing for contamination please take a second to think if you have seen a liquid media used for the collection of that.

8922,8922,Shahnawazalpha,1586264989,fwk8dz,Ask Austin,"Hello fellow Austinites,

I'm an internal medicine doctor here in Austin and closely following the Covid-19 outbreak along with a large community of local doctors. We have a very active private facebook group that is regularly attended by senior members of the Austin Public Health department who give us updates on all aspects of our local preparedness. 

One issue that some of us are tying to push APH to do is to test more aggressively. We've only done a few thousand tests since this whole affair started, and there are many of us who believe this well below where we need to be. 

In response to this, APH recently shared with us that the ""no-show"" rate for drive-by testing is well under 50%. So people will sign up, and then simply not show up. I found this very surprising because its been my gestalt that people in the city shared the same frustration with a lack of testing that many of us doctors do. 

To that end, I would really like to hear back from the community about how easy or difficult it has been for you or people you know to obtain testing. I simply cannot believe there isn't a demand for it, and as long as local leaders believe that is the case, they're just not going to escalate testing capacity to where we need to be. Or, maybe I'm wrong and APH is correct, and the demand simply isn't there. Please share your feedback here. If certain themes begin to emerge, I promise you, I will make sure APH and local government leaders hear about it.",Austin,Doctor here. Have you found it easy to obtain Covid-19 testing?

Ive seen the people on the corner of this place gambling and rolling dice, panhandling, and using the bathroom on the side of the store. Cops occasionally will hang out around here to “deter” crime, i think. Has the normal stigma of any 7/11 with shady characters outside all hours of the night. Mediocre everything. Expensive prices. 

But it also have live rats crawling around inside on shelves, on top of food, and on the “hot food” section. If you go into this store, and go left towards the donut/coffee station, you’ll see them. Under the shelves there will be rats and LOTS of rat droppings. 

Told the cashier about the 2 rats I saw when i was in there, for 5 mins. He said “Welcome to the hood”. I saw an opened twinkie package on the shelf which had clearly been opened by the rats. Didnt think the cashier was gonna throw it out and had a feeling he’d still sell it. I left empty-handed.

What gets me about the rats is they were running across the store’s open floor, during the day, with me being barely even 5 feet away. It didnt feel like they were scared of me at all, cause they are used to people, right? Didnt see any rat traps or anything. Just wanted yall to be careful.

Ya'll might already know about these but I still want to share.

-We have red marks on the ground near the register lines to indicate where YOU SHOULD stand in line while you wait to be served. It's to improve social distancing. 

-We added sneeze guards around the ENTIRE register for a reason so you don't get close to the cashier.  Theres a small gap where you can slide your money through and also a gap where the payment card terminal is located. PLEASE STAY BEHIND THE GLASS AND DONT REACH FOR ITEMS AND DONT MOVE AROUND THE GLASS TO HAND US THE MONEY OR GRAB THE RECEIPT. If you want to bag your own itmes please wait till the cashier is DONE scanning the items. 

-Theres limits on items for a reason, if you grab more than the limit YOU CAN NOT pay for it separately. Understand that if your shopping for someone else they have to come down.

-Please keep your kids at home and avoid bringing large groups.

-If your store has a line with one entrance and one exit. DONT TRY to skip the line and make an excuse that you have to go to the pharmacy or grab something real quick. Just stop. Wait like everyone else.

-Understand that cashiers go through a hard time and are at high risk everyday they work due to being the ones that have endless interactions so please be patience and respectful.

-NO coupons are being accepted at the moment. Partner VPP cards are okay though.

-We're all receiving mask and gloves to wear for our safety.

-Our hours are 8-8 so our night stockers can re-organize and properly stock the store.

-Please read notes on products that have limits before checking out, if there isn't a note about the item let us know so we can put one out.

-Depending on your store you might have hand sanitizer available at the exit for everyones use.

-PLEASE AND I SAY PLEASE PICK UP YOUR TRASH from the carts and avoid leaving items like cups and food in the carts. HUGE NO NO especially since people are constantly touching them. 

PLEASE REMEMBER EVERY STORE IS DIFFERENT AND MAY HAVE DIFFERENT RULES BUT OVERALL PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL AND UNDERSTAND WHEN WE TELL YOU SOMETHING OR STAND SOMEWHERE IS BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO BE SAFE.

As the number of cases and deaths continues to rise across Austin-Travis County, and **updated models from the lab of Lauren Ancel-Meyers at the University of Texas at Austin indicate a likely surge in infections, the health authority has put a plan in place to set up Alternative Care Sites (ACS) to handle high demands on the system.**
 
The Surge Plan is designed to address additional patient care needs should COVID-19 infections result in an overcapacity of the hospital system.
 
“We hope that this surge plan is not necessary, but we are preparing for the worst,” said Dr. Mark Escott Interim Austin-Travis County Health Authority. “We must continue to stay home and practice physical distancing. The future of our healthcare system is up to our daily individual behavior, and it is going to take all of us to fight this virus.”

Under the Surge Plan, once **traditional hospitals** have run out of bed spaces, patients would be transferred to **Type II Alternative Care** Sites and receive a range of hospital-level care in buildings that were previously purposed for patient care such as former clinics or medical facilities. If Type II ACS exceeds capacity, patients would be taken to **Type I ACS** facilities, which are similar to combat surgical hospitals or large wards. **Officials are in the process of identifying specific sites for both types of ACS facilities in Austin-Travis County that will meet the community’s needs.**

The current hospital bed count for Austin-Travis County is approximately 4,300 on an average day. However, this number will continuously change depending on additional capacity coming online.** Hospitals are currently operating at about 50 percent capacity.**
 
**Isolation Facilities and Protective Lodging Facilities (ProLodges) have also been established.** Isolation Facilities are locations that are being used to house patients who do not need medical care but do not have anywhere to safely be isolated from the public (e.g. are unable to adequately isolate from a family member’s home). **ProLodges** are protective lodging for vulnerable communities.
 
**To ensure those on the frontlines of the COVID-19 outbreak are properly informed, Austin Public Health (APH) has been providing regular updates to more than 4,000 physicians through the Travis County Medical Society (TCMS).** There are also daily conference calls with the hospital networks, where providers detail current cases, system status and review current measures being planned and taken. Additionally, doctors have access to a dedicated phone line to reach APH directly.

**A dedicated section for health care providers on the City COVID-19 website has been updated to include surge plans for the area, information about the Austin-Travis County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and the different task forces to support medical and social service community needs.**
 
Health care providers can also access guidance on COVID-19 testing and personal protective equipment. APH, the City of Austin and Travis County -- as a whole -- are prepared to maintain emergency operations for many months to ensure our community remains safe and educated during this unprecedented time.

I don’t care if you vote Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Green Party, or write in Willie Nelson. You are all apart of this big conglomerate that we call home.

While the world outside or community is on fire, I’d like y’all to remember that the flag still waves in front of the Capitol, the UT tower still stands, the moon towers still shine at night, and no matter what you’re still a Texan.

564,564,kozmaniac22,1586533672,fyiafb,COVID-19,"**Why this post?**

The CDC recently recommended that everyone wear cloth facemasks. This will help to slow the spread, protect those who are vulnerable, and save medical-grade masks for health care facilities. There are many websites and organizations funneling masks to healthcare facilities (as they should!), but we also need to get masks into the hands of the general public. Etsy is backed up! After my first post, I received numerous messages from members of the community who are in need for various reasons. Hopefully, this post can match mask makers to individuals who need masks. Together, we can get everyone in Austin a mask!

Many in the Austin community are also looking for ways to help mask makers get what they need. Hopefully, this post will serve as a guide. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What kind of mask should I wear\\make?**

There are many patterns available. Not all offer the same level of protection. Several studies show that different fabrics filter for viruses at different levels. Having a mask with multiple layers helps. Any mask is better than no mask, of course. But, if you or someone in your house is vulnerable, make sure you know what level of protection you are getting from your mask. Does your mask: 

* Have multiple layers? 
* Have a pocket for a filter? 
* Cover your nose? 
* Have a “nose wire” to fit against your nose and force air through the cloth? 
* Use effective fabric? 

*Note:* Some masks are not necessarily meant to be worn for protection by themselves. Some are meant to cover medical-grade masks to extend their lives. All patterns are useful! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Filter Layer?**

\\bigfootshairyhole suggested using a piece of a reusable shopping bag as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I want to make masks! Where can I get a pattern?**

I’m using the pocket pattern at the following link: [https://www.craftpassion.com/face-mask-sewing-pattern/](https://www.craftpassion.com/face-mask-sewing-pattern/)

There is also a pleated pattern at [www.makemaskaustin.org](https://www.makemaskaustin.org) 

I will add more links as people submit them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I need a mask! Where can I get a mask in Austin?**

The following users indicated in my first post that they are making cloth masks and are available for advice. Some may be willing to help you get your hands on a mask. I will add people to this list and delete them as necessary. If you want to be added to the list, send me a DM or comment below.

**I want to help but I can’t sew!**

Mask makers are very much in need of the items below. Many stores are selling out quickly. If you have some to donate, contact a mask maker! Some mask makers are also accepting small donations to cover the cost of materials. 

* Fabric. Cotton or flannel. 
* Ties. Elastic, ribbon, or cloth strips work well. 
* Bias tape. This is super useful. 
* Wire. Pipe cleaners, copper wire, Christmas ornament hooks, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I would rather send masks directly to health care facilities, long term care facilities, or shelters!**

Awesome! The following organizations are in need of masks:

I’m starting with dentists, then will probably post later for PCP and optometrist recommendations.

I’d love to get some recommendations from the community. We have dental coverage, so pricing likely won’t be an issue. I’d prefer a dentist who has a gentle touch (I’m terrified of doctors/dentists generally), who won’t be pushy, harsh, or judgmental. I also would prefer a dentist whose policy is to do minimal procedures; in other words a dentist who doesn’t try to push or pressure-sell unnecessary procedures, especially cosmetic ones like veneers simply because our insurance would pay for it. 

If you have a dentist or know of a dentist that fits the bill, i would love to hear about it! I’m planning to research all recommendations to ensure they are in our dental network, and then book a cleaning once all this mess is behind us. I appreciate any input!

This is Monica with the Austin History Center \[[http://library.austintexas.gov/ahc/about-us](http://library.austintexas.gov/ahc/about-us)\], the historic archives for the City of Austin and a division of Austin Public Library. We work to preserve the story of Austin, and obviously this is a historic moment for the city and the world. We're trying to be proactive in collecting various items so we can document how Austin dealt with COVID-19. 

As a bit of a Reddit lurker myself (my favorites are r/legaladvice and r/dadswhodidnotwantpets) I've been on this sub pretty regularly these past few weeks. Some of you may have already gotten direct messages from me, asking about donating a specific image. But it's not just photographs we're interested in. The AHC is looking for anything - writings, artwork, video, etc- that will help tell the story of this city and its people during the pandemic. We're also interested in how small businesses have been affected, though we want to acknowledge that some aspects of this time are still too painful to talk about. 

So...do you have something to share?   

We now have a link on our website for the public to quickly and easily donate materials pertaining to the COVID-19 Pandemic, specifically in the Austin/Travis County area:

[https://library.austintexas.gov/covid-19-files](https://library.austintexas.gov/covid-19-files)

612,612,RichardAboutTown,1586563709,fysb5n,Nan,"I noticed a man with a camera standing on the sidewalk at the Hancock CommUnity Care COVID-19 testing site as I was waiting in line. He was diligently taking pictures of every car in line. When I confronted him later he claimed to be a journalist, but his behavior was more akin to someone diligently building a database of license plate numbers of people concerned about their COVID status. When he focused his lens on my car, I made sure I had ""the bird"" prominently displayed and he put down his camera and walked away. 

However, once I pulled around to the second part of the screening/testing, he got out of his nearby car and walked right up to the edge of the parking lot and focused once again on my car. It seemed to me he didn't want to let anyone get past him without being photographed. He was very careful to stay in public rights-of-way so that no one could complain about him trespassing. Staff serving the line were clearly annoyed but were sure there was nothing they could do.

I don't believe he is a journalist. If he is, he needs re-training on journalistic ethics. The Austin American-Statesman already has a story on such testing and had just a couple of pictures that were respectful of the privacy of both patient and healthcare provider, so I doubt he was working for them. Surely television media wouldn't have a single still photographer assigned to the story. 

This is sinister. Someone (hopefully just this lone wolf, but who knows?) is looking to publish a list of potential COVID-19 victims and I don't believe there is any legitimate reason to do so. Worst case, it's an effort to put people in danger, to enable vigilantism against people whose only crime is catching a dread disease. At best it's an ill-advised invasion of people's privacy.

This thread will serve as an update thread to help folks know what stocks in grocery stores look like as well as what specials/offers restaurants are offering. It'll also be used to help delivery/Where can I find....? sort of questions. 

If you are trying to find what restaurants are open, there are several threads, such as this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/fwr2ha/a_list_of_local_restaurants_with_online_ordering/that can help find one.

After that Grande came by my house and installed the new fiber line from the pole to my house while at the same time removing the cable line.  They also insalled a new modem/router which rendered the one we bought effectively obsolete (at the time at least).  Moving to the present and switching to Spectrum this week they had to spend 4 hours with 2 staff members to add back the coax line to my house.  My question is should Grande have just left the cable line and run the fiber line parallel to it across the rear of my yard?  Seems like a lot of unnecessary work unless Grande was intentionally trying to make it hard on the competition.",Austin,Cable to Google Fiber question.......

Thursday I added a low-grade fever, and my eyes started burning and hurting. Thursday night I coughed up a lung. I am supposed to get my Remicade Infusion on Monday (that's my immune-suppressing medication) so I got sent to the ER to get a COVID test.  

I went to the Drive Through at the freestanding ER on Lamar. They were very kind, but it was a bizarre experience. They tested me for Flu &amp; Strep (negative) but they wouldn't test me for COVID because I wasn't sick enough - my fever wasn't high, my O2 sats were fine. They told me ""We don't need to test you because we know that you have it."" Wait... what?  

So I got diagnosed with COVID without getting tested? I am a presumed positive and not to leave my home for two weeks. But - it might just be a regular cold.... or a sinus infection... so confusing. I need to know when/if I can get my Remicade so I called my doctor back and they suggested contacting Baylor Scott &amp; White. I downloaded their app did the screening (that app is awesome) got a note back from a doctor within the hour and she sent in two prescriptions for me and set me up to do the COVID test today in Round Rock.  

So the moral to the story is NO - we do not have enough tests in Austin. They said they would test me if they could - I fit the criteria, but they just only had a few left and I wasn't sick enough to qualify. Stick with ARC or Baylor Scott &amp; White if you need a test.",Austin,My COVID testing story

Medical professionals, first responders, HEB employees, and many other people are having to spend many hours a day wearing masks that loop over the ears. Wearing masks like this can cause pain, chafing, and even bleeding from the pressure on the ears. The solution is ear savers! Here's what they look like and how they're used.  My friend and I used our printers to make 50 of these and we dropped them by the police station. They went very quickly and they are asking if we can make more, which we are. But ideally, they would like to have one for each officer, which I believe is around 2000 or more. If you have a printer and would like to help out, please make some of these and take them to you local police station. They need to be either dark blue or black for the police. If you have other colors, you could print them and take them to doctor's offices, hospitals, grocery stores - anywhere people are wearing the masks that loop over the ears, there's a need for these! There are many designs for these - this is the one I'm printing: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4249113](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4249113) It prints easily using PLA. I can print 9 of them in 3.5 hours on my Prusa Mk3. If you have a printer, please consider helping out! Don't assume everyone else is taking care of it - that's what I did and then when I printed out a few, I found there's a huge need for these everywhere.   Here's a chance to help those on the front lines. Thanks for your help!

Here's some information for anyone who wants to get involved (by sewing, 3d printing, assembling face shields, or driving materials around to people who need them).

[Masks for Docs](https://masksfordocs.com/) is a global effort to get PPE (personal protection equipment) into the hands of health care workers as quickly as possible. Texans will drive the effort for Texas. To learn more about the Austin effort, please [read this orientation doc](https://masksfordocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TX/pages/33751041/General+Orientation+Volunteers+-+Austin+Chapter).

The national Masks for Docs organization relies on local groups to organize makers (3D Printers and Sewers) and contributors to meet the PPE needs of their community. To get started, volunteers should visit the [Masks for Docs website](https://masksfordocs.com/) and fill out the [volunteer form](https://designtocombatcovid19.typeform.com/to/XcwHkr). Once you fill out the form, be sure to join the Slack and join the #zlocal-us-tx-atx channel.

All help is welcome; your time and skills are invaluable and can help save lives! 

If you are in need of PPE because you are a frontline worker, please submit your request through our website [here](https://designtocombatcovid19.typeform.com/to/FZkS4e).

Again, I’m not advocating for a timeline, but I think we all understand it will eventually happen and will be before a vaccine is developed.

I’m also going to assume masks will become mandatory in many cases, as will density measures. It should also be said that hospitalization rates should be closely monitored as this rollback happens to see what affect it has on the healthcare system.

-Parks: Trails, disc golf courses, fishing spots, boat launches, etc. Austin is a super active city so these things alone could help stave off the collective cabin fever everyone is having. 

-Other public/private outdoor activities: Golf courses, driving ranges, shooting ranges, outdoor group exercise, kayak/paddleboard rentals, dog parks.

-Bars/Restaurants: Would have to impose new limited capacities via fire marshals. Maybe a 200 seat establishment becomes a 50 seat establishment. Possibly some exemptions for outdoor seating. Maybe even rooftop bars could get leniency. I could see farmers markets making a comeback, just with more spread out layouts.

-Misc businesses: Clothing, hobby shops, etc. Would likely need to limit capacity as well, possibly based on sq ft. For example, the Round Rock outlets or Domain (both outdoor) could open but restrict people in each individual store.

724,724,AutoModerator,1586667997,fzqjxo,Nan,"With the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, folks are rushing to get food and supplies. 

**It's imperative to not overly crowd as that's how COVID-19 spreads. This isn't a hurricane - infrastructure still exists and trucks are delivering as fast as they can. Hoarding will not only hurt your neighbor, it's unnecessary. Buy what you need, not everything you want.**

This thread will serve as an update thread to help folks know what stocks in grocery stores look like as well as what specials/offers restaurants are offering. It'll also be used to help delivery/Where can I find....? sort of questions. 

If you are trying to find what restaurants are open, there are several threads, such as this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/fwr2ha/a_list_of_local_restaurants_with_online_ordering/that can help find one. 

We can't guarantee the accuracy of these comment but will remove any harmful comments as we see fit.

We'll post a new thread daily.

Your comment format should be something like: 

&gt; \*\*HEB @ Foo Bar ranch \*\*
&gt;
&gt; Went there this morning @ 9:30AM - had most things in stock but out of toliet paper. Was fairly crowded. 

Feel free to post any pictures of stores or aisles as well. ""Going to HEB"" memes are also welcomed but we recommend posting those to /r/GoingToHEB.

Otherwise, /r/AustinGroceryFinds is a subreddit that may be another good resource in finding items.

So I've been thinking, if you'd like, I can help out by picking up face masks and delivering it to people that are in need, to help alleviate some of the pressure for yall.

I posted this thread yesterday around Spectrum increasing their prices for their internet here:

Spectrum Raising Price Post --&gt; 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/fzcuou/spectrum_internet_increased_internet_package_price/

Sounds like multiple people are experiencing this issue. Looking around I saw as a ""new"" Spectrum customer you get a better rate than even the $70 I am paying currently. 

Question:
Is it possible to cancel my Spectrum internet under my name, and then sign up again under my wife's name (same household)? I own my modem and there is nothing that needs their interaction needed in person. So is canceling to get introductory offer an option?

If anyone has done this before, if you could please share your experience, it would be greatly appreciated. TIA.",Austin,Spectrum Internet - New Customer Rate for Wife's Name

I tried Google and didn't super trust the reviews I found so I thought I'd just give you guys a shot. 
I'm not sick or anything, I just need to find a doc that I get along with and can form a rapport with. Going to ARC, despite how many times you see a doctor it seems like you're still a stranger. 
""Hi, I'm doctor so-and-so, nice to meet you"" 
'Hi doctor so-and-so, you performed a 45 minute long physical exam on me and touched my balls last week.'
That is almost a verbatim conversation I had last year.
Anyway, Google doesn't come up with much when you search ""cool doctors in Austin Texas"" so any of your recommendations would be helpful.

**It's imperative to not overly crowd as that's how COVID-19 spreads. This isn't a hurricane - infrastructure still exists and trucks are delivering as fast as they can. Hoarding will not only hurt your neighbor, it's unnecessary. Buy what you need, not everything you want.**

This thread will serve as an update thread to help folks know what stocks in grocery stores look like as well as what specials/offers restaurants are offering. It'll also be used to help delivery/Where can I find....? sort of questions. 

If you are trying to find what restaurants are open, there are several threads, such as this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/fwr2ha/a_list_of_local_restaurants_with_online_ordering/that can help find one. 

We can't guarantee the accuracy of these comment but will remove any harmful comments as we see fit.

We'll post a new thread daily.

Your comment format should be something like: 

&gt; \*\*HEB @ Foo Bar ranch \*\*
&gt;
&gt; Went there this morning @ 9:30AM - had most things in stock but out of toliet paper. Was fairly crowded. 

Feel free to post any pictures of stores or aisles as well. ""Going to HEB"" memes are also welcomed but we recommend posting those to /r/GoingToHEB.

Otherwise, /r/AustinGroceryFinds is a subreddit that may be another good resource in finding items.

A key addition to the order extensions is the requirement that individuals over the age of ten wear fabric face coverings when conducting essential work or activities in public.**

A face covering does not substitute for the need to maintain physical distancing. 

Essential businesses will be provided signage and additional support to enforce the face covering requirement over the coming days. While violation of this Order is a criminal offense, **enforcement of this Order is substantially reliant on self-regulation and a community commitment to public health and safety** under the novel threat of COVID-19.

**Requirements have also been clarified for religious organizations and houses of worship.** Houses of worship are encouraged to continue to hold services remotely to the extent possible. There should not be more than 10 individuals conducting those services inside a place of worship and they should maintain physical distancing requirements.""

953,953,crabsterfish,1586818998,g0ts0l,Nan,"I'm not quite sure what to do, and could use some advice. I work at a very small business with only a handful of employees. Personally, I don't believe we're an essential business - but my employer believes we can be counted as one (sometimes news stations and media require our services). As of today, he wants employees to come in and rotate shifts (2 managers in the office at all times, but Employee A works Monday, Employee B works Tuesday, etc). Doing... I don't even know what. Counting inventory, which would take maybe a solid day - but that's about it. Personally, I think it's kind of a knee-jerk reaction to ""if we're paying people, they need to be doing something!"". He's texted me that ""we just need to start functioning again"" but, employees coming in is not going to magically bring business in. I've been very lucky and grateful because since the March stay-at-home order, we haven't gone in to work (we can't work remotely), and they've given everyone a normal paycheck (but they can't guarantee that through the end of this month). There's some paranoia that they'll cut down our paychecks to the hours actually spent at the office since they want to start logging that again. I don't THINK they would do that, because I believe that would impact our ability to apply for benefits, but who really knows at this point. 

He wants us to supply our own masks, encouraging us to wear bandanas if we don't own a mask. They don't want us within 6 feet of each other, practicing safe distance and cleaning, and wearing gloves. 

I texted my boss that while I appreciate they want us to be safe, I don't understand how this will help business to go back to usual. Even with us there on rotation, it's not like it's going to bring in revenue, and - even if small - it only increases the risk of infection. He hasn't responded, and I think he might be frustrated or offended by me bringing it up. 

So, am I being paranoid and annoying? Alternatively, if I'm going in to work a couple of days a week, do I need an exemption letter? I've been volunteering at an essential place, and we have exemption letters, but I haven't seen anything about needing that for Travis County.

EDIT: I appreciate the responses! After more time to think about it, I realize that I've just been frustrated and also gave little context. They haven't communicated about this for weeks. Literally 0 communication from managers. For the first couple of weeks, I kept calling to get updates and relay them to the team. I was trying to get weekly emails or calls or some way to keep us all connected. Then I just heard nothing. I only knew they were alive because I'd be looped in on some random client email. So when they told us on Monday to start coming in on Tuesday, it didn't make sense. They have put no effort into communication or letting us know what's happening and then suddenly it was ""business as (almost) usual). When I mentioned to my employer that this won't actually bring in business, he just stopped responding and refused to even engage in a conversation. So what it really boils down to is that I'm just frustrated with the way they're handling it - less about the ""you expect to get paid without working??"".",Austin,My employer wants employees to come in on rotation

However they are now also profiteering on N95 masks. I hope they had good intentions but I've already reached out the company (no response), and now filed a complaint with the Attorney General, but since the page is still up I figured it's worth trying to publicly shame them as well.

Here's their page selling N95 masks for $59 for a 10 pack: [https://arialattner.com/products/n95-face-mask-cdc-recommended-for-coronavirus5](https://arialattner.com/products/n95-face-mask-cdc-recommended-for-coronavirus5)

Here's a few choice excerpts from a recent Texas Tribune article:

&gt;Demand for protective equipment like masks has soared since the outbreak began, exacerbated by the disruption of overseas supply chains and a flood of purchases from panicked civilians. The U.S. surgeon general has told the public to save the N95s for health care professionals who need them — “Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!” he tweeted in February — but demand has pushed prices for the masks to $10, $12 or even $15.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under the state’s price-gouging laws, it is illegal to charge “exorbitant or excessive” prices for necessities during a disaster, and Attorney General [Ken Paxton](https://www.texastribune.org/directory/ken-paxton/) has said he won’t tolerate people and businesses using the pandemic to profit.  
&gt;  
&gt;“No one is exempt from price gouging laws in Texas, and those who violate the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act will be met with the full force of the law,” the attorney general’s office [tweeted](https://twitter.com/TXAG/status/1241457850683207680?s=20).  
&gt;  
&gt;Consumers and small businesses can sue under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act if they believe they’ve been the victims of price gouging. They can recover up to three times their damages and attorneys’ fees. Consumers, small businesses and large corporations like the oil company Hatfield was trying to sell masks to can also complain to the attorney general, who has broad powers to sanction profiteers.  
&gt;  
&gt;The statute doesn’t define what level a markup has to reach in order for it to be considered “exorbitant or excessive.”  
&gt;  
&gt;But a price of over $6 a mask struck Professor Emeritus Richard Alderman, director of the University of Houston’s Consumer Law Center, as high given that the masks, according to numerous online offerings and published reports, could be obtained for a dollar or less before the outbreak began.

Edits:

u/FoodForTheTruth points out these are likely the even cheaper KN95 masks that until recently weren't legal to import into the USA.

and another good point from u/dances_with_corgis: the worlds largest manufacturer of N95 masks, 3M, has doubled production but **NOT** raised prices.

&gt;3M says it hasn’t raised respirator prices and can’t control what happens after it sells its products to distributors. Roman wrote to U.S. Attorney General William Barr on March 24 to offer 3M’s help in rooting out medical device counterfeiting and price gouging.

I'm on the Power 50 Internet Service plan (with Home Networking Service, Internet 50 Mbps, and SecureIT Antivirus) and was getting charged $44.99 a month until this month I was charged $59.99.

I called and asked what the increase is for, and they said ""just like gas and other utilities"" we raise our prices every couple of years, which seems like too much.

It'a actually a $17/month increase...which during this time, seems a bit absurd. Is anyone else seeing this increase on their bill?

UPDATE: I called their phone support twice and got no real explanation on the increase other than 'that's normal' and was offered no help. I then asked the same question about my bill increase via their CHAT support, and they were much more helpful at offering me a new 12 month, promotional price of $57 for my total bill (including the service, highspeed internet charge, and taxes), which is only a few cents increase of my total bill than what it was at. Happy to keep my service with Grande as they've been great for the past 3 years. Pays off to be persistent! ",Austin,Grande Internet bill increase by $15/month

1040,1040,austintexasgov,1586892460,g1c36k,Nan,"""Austin, Texas — **Austin Public Health (APH) has launched a telephone hotline to assist Austin-Travis County restaurants with questions related to COVID-19. The hotline, Helping Austin Restaurants Today (HART), can be reached at 512-978-HART (4278).**

“We know that our Austin restaurant community is working hard and doing a good job in keeping their employees, customers and food safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we also know that it’s challenging for them to keep abreast of frequently changing federal, state and local COVID-19 regulations, guidelines and scientific findings,” said Don Hastings, Assistant Director of the APH Environmental Health Services Division (EHSD). **“We’re hoping this direct line connecting restaurants to our environmental health professionals will help.”**

Proactive action to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among food establishments began on March 13 with the adoption of Emergency Rules requiring additional public health disease mitigation and signage requirements, which included making hand sanitizer available to customers, disinfecting surfaces every hour and excluding employees with a fever.

Since then, food establishments have closed indoor and outdoor dining areas to the public and are limited to delivery or take-out only. **Austin Transportation Department has installed temporary food pick-up zones in support of local restaurants that transitioned to take-out and delivery only service. Restaurants can request an evaluation for a temporary food pick-up zone by filling out the [online contact form](https://www.smartmobilityatx.com/).**

APH also works closely with the Texas and Austin Restaurant Associations to share information and concerns, especially in times of emergency like the current COVID-19 pandemic and previously with the 2018 Boil Water Alert.

**The HART hotline will be staffed 7:45 a.m.- 4:45 p.m., Monday through Friday. Restaurants calling outside those hours have the option of leaving a voicemail message or forwarding their question via email to EHSD.Service@AustinTexas.gov. For more information and updates, visit www.AustinTexas.gov/COVID19.**""",Austin,"""COVID-19 Information Hotline for Restaurants Launched for Austin-Travis County"" - Press Release"

As of the eviction notice they paid it in full yesterday - and this seems to have blown over.  The final landlord should/could not legally have served a notice to vacate either way (thanks Reddit for helping me w/ that).

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm living in a short term (four month) lease, which looked standard and normal, signed with a local company.  I knew it was a pretty relaxed sign up process but I didn't think much of it.

Today, an eviction notice showed up for my landlord who works for the company.   When I confronted him I asked if we were subletters and he said yes, but that the management company knew about us.

I'm a bit confused as to how a notice to vacate is being served - as I understood those were not allowed in the city due to the covid crisis.  Additionally, I'm wondering if anyone knows resources in this situation (legal advice reddit wasn't too responsive).

If I need to move I can although I'd rather not in this crisis (I don't have a car so this would involve hiring movers).  Additionally, I'm wondering what happened to the money I paid for rent in April, and whether any eviction could affect me (as in my credit).  My name was not on the notice and I'm not even sure the real landlords know who I am.",Austin,"Unknowingly subletting - turns out my ""management company"" didn't pay rent and got an eviction notice.

If anyone knows someone who'd be willing to let me photograph their kids working within range of one of these buses please let me know. Obviously I'll wear a mask and gloves.

It'll also be used to help delivery/Where can I find....? sort of questions. Note that this ""Where can I find..."" is for pretty much anything not illegal. 

If you are trying to find what restaurants are open, there are several threads, such as this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/fwr2ha/a_list_of_local_restaurants_with_online_ordering/that can help find one. 

We can't guarantee the accuracy of these comment but will remove any harmful comments as we see fit.

My lease ends in August and I’m not renewing  so my landlord is trying to find someone new to rent the apartment. I have already sent my landlord’s realtor high quality photos and a walkthrough video of my apartment. He is now asking to schedule an in-person viewing with a potential renter. 

I looked at the CISA Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce and it does list “Residential and commercial real estate services” as essential infrastructure. Does anyone know if this includes physical viewings of rental properties, specifically if I am still living in the apartment? 

Thank you!",Austin,Am I required to let a realtor show my apartment to potential future renters?

Created in partnership with NTT DATA, the application will also enable Austin Public Health to assess testing demand and identify those who pose a higher risk of serious symptoms.

Prior to the Public Testing Enrollment Form, testing in Austin-Travis County has been arranged via physicians, meaning people must met with their primary care provider or telehealth and before being referred to a testing site. **With the new form a healthcare provider will no longer be needed to refer someone for a test.**

“As we gather more data through more testing, we will be provided a more complete picture of the impact of COVID-19 in Austin-Travis County.” - Dr. Mark Escott, Austin-Travis County Interim Health Authority.

**Completion of the testing form will not guarantee referral to a testing site.** APH will continue to prioritize health care workers and first responders on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as people at higher risk for getting serious symptoms. 

**Drive-through tests will be by appointment-only and scheduled through the Austin Public Testing Enrollment Form portal. Tests at the APH testing sites will be at no cost to the individual.**

**How the Online Form and Portal Will Work:**

• Individuals must create an account and fill out the form that will be located at www.AustinTexas.gov/COVID19. 

• The form will ask several questions to determine the patient’s eligibility for a test based on set criteria. A person can fill out the form for someone who cannot do it themselves. This information is HIPPA-protected.

• If an individual is approved for a test, the portal will allow them to schedule the location, date and time for their drive-through testing appointment.

• Testing sites will include those operated by Austin Public Health and public-private partnership sites across Austin-Travis County.

• The patient will receive a confirmation via phone, email or SMS with a QR code and instructions for the testing site within the same day.

• If the patient does not meet testing criteria, they will be able to revisit the portal at any time to try again (e.g. if their symptoms change the following days).

• The portal will also allow patients to see their test results, and provides a community forum to ask questions and a knowledge base to view responses to frequently asked questions.

• The HOST Team with Austin Travis County EMS will be able to complete the testing form for individuals who may not have access to a computer.


**How the Drive-Through Testing Will Work:**

• When a patient arrives at the drive-through testing location, they must remain in their vehicle.

• Patients must show the technician the confirmation QR code along with any form of ID through their car window.

• The technician at the testing site will then advise the patient on the next steps of the test.

• The process from start to finish will take approximately 10 minutes.

• Individual test results will be sent to the individual by phone, email, or they will be able to access the online patient portal.

• Patients can expect results in 3-4 days.

• If a patient tests positive for COVID-19, they will receive an automated email message with instructions on how to mitigate additional community spread of the virus, as well as guidance on how to monitor symptoms to determine if additional medical supervision is necessary.

Those who do not have access to transportation to the site will be provided other options to receive testing from community partners.

**This enrollment form will be another critical piece to increasing testing capacity in Austin-Travis County. Once it is operational, APH will have the ability to test up to 2,000 people per week -- with the ability to expand.**

As of April 8, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) was reporting that 6,221 tests had been completed in Travis County. However, the DSHS data has 18,607 tests in which the county is either unknown or is pending assignment.

**In addition to scheduling tests and monitoring confirmed positive cases, the City of Austin will send an automatic exposure questionnaire to residents who test positive, which will help gather details on how the virus might have spread, such as travel and visits to high-traffic areas.**

**The application will also send follow-up emails or text messages to check in on each resident’s well-being, so medical care can be escalated if necessary.**""

**There will be related press conferences today in…**

I imagine lists like this will pop up in lots of subreddits, but I figure there's some stuff specific to Austin that everyone might like to know about. Feel free to add ideas in the comments and I'll update the list. I started with some kind of obvious stuff and I feel like it gets sillier as the list goes on, but I'm already kinda stir crazy and I dunno what people will find helpful, so please enjoy. 

Note: I understand not all of these activities are equally accessible. Some require money or specific materials, some require you to have outdoor space, some are not possible for people who use wheelchairs or have certain kinds of disabilities. I just tried to make a really exhaustive, broad list because I know a lot of folks are short on ideas, so please help fill in the gaps with other kinds of activities and hopefully we can get something useful going. 

# Self-Quarantine Activities (can be done at home)

* **Watch TV.** Just including to add a reminder that now is a good time to branch out and watch stuff you might not usually watch. Try documentaries, movie genres you've never really gotten into, tv series that you're not the target audience for. There are tons of movie lists you can go through right now too, either as you're being adventurous or as you're just trying to find new movies in categories you like but haven't seen yet. 
* **Do a puzzle.** You can get jigsaws at grocery chains or order em online. 
* **Music**. I'm including this here as an activity which could be playing music, listening to an entire album with a lot of focus, or learning an instrument if you have one or can get one. You could teach yourself a new skill or be really knowledgeable about a new genre of music. 
* **Write**. Could start a coronavirus blog or diary. Could alternatively start up a blog about a completely different subject that you just have interest in (food, poetry, history, music, write that screenplay you keep imagining, why not). I also want to remind folks that publications are still up and running, so if you've ever wanted to get a short story published you could find some tips online and give it an earnest try. 
* **Learn a language**. Lots of apps like Duolingo help people do this for free. You can watch movies in the language you pick and try to read in it during this time too. 
* **Read**. You could catch up on fiction, sharpen your knowledge in a non-fiction area, read lots of articles and understand current events better, or read books you just find fulfilling or helpful - poetry, how-to books on gardening or cooking, philosophy, the classics. Get into comics / webcomics. 
* **Take pictures**. This is kind of making an activity out of nothing, but there could be a lot to photograph even inside your house. Build towers out of random stuff, stage weird scenes, artfully capture the inside of your fridge, or do your makeup and get some cute selfies. At minimum it's a way to burn through some time, at best you may find yourself seeing a place you've seen every day for months in a new way. 
* **Draw**. You may or may not have materials for this, but drawing &amp; adult coloring books can be a good way to focus energy into something creative. If you've never done it, you may find you have a knack for it, and even if you're kinda bad it can be fun. Do a self portrait. Draw the same thing every week and watch yourself improve over time.
* **Meditate**. The pressure to ""do something productive"" with this time can be kind of unhelpful. One way to cope might be to try and get into a better habit of meditating. There are a ton of online resources to help with this, and it might make the COVID crisis more bearable overall. 
* **Clean &amp; organize your home**. This may be a totally worthless suggestion to some people, but with so much being out of our control I personally find it really therapeutic to focus on what I can control. Being able to throw out old things I don't need and get my house in order has helped me at least find one thing I have power over. It's a weird coping mechanism but it helps. 
* **Marie Kondo your house**. I'm just gonna let people google this, but it's a way to organize your home that's very time intensive. 
* **Do home repairs**. If you've been meaning to fix something and haven't had time, maybe you can knock it out now. 
* **Rearrange your furniture**. I'm really just trying to think of all the ways you could potentially improve your home here. But if you do this it could help your home feel like a sort of new space after being in it for so long. 
* **Take a bath**. This may not have a lot of mileage but if you're into the whole ""light a candle and drink some wine"" relaxation strategy this could be a nice way to celebrate cleaning your bathtub. You can get or make some bath salts and really jazz up the experience. 
* **Go through old notes or photos**. 
* **Cook**. This is really, really broad but I've seen tons of people doing this since the start of self-quarantining. You gotta eat, and while it's good to order out to keep businesses going it might be a good time to learn some culinary skills. Make a loaf of sourdough, get some mileage out of that Instant Pot, pickle something. If you're new to cooking, just think of some simple foods you like to eat and start with those. Alternately, now's a good time to try those really elaborate recipes that take all day. My partner and I made his Italian grandmother's tomato sauce and used it to make spaghetti and lasagna and ate for weeks. 
* **Become a better bartender**. I started infusing liquors (rosemary vodka, prickly pear tequila, etc) and that's been fun. Pick your favorite cocktail and learn how to make it. Learn the variations bartenders have done on your favorite cocktail. Master a couple different ones so when this is over you can be a cool party host.
* **Garden**. Obviously you might not be able to do this if you have neither a yard nor a balcony, but even with a bit of window space you might be able to get a little something going. It's technically illegal but if you're really broke you can go to big box stores and find little succulent clippings that have fallen off of plants and re-pot them at home in a cup with some dirt from outside. Lowe's and WalMart both have plant areas you can get stuff you need for this. Or plant a big ass vegetable or pollinator garden in your backyard. 
* **Exercise**. There's a ton of yoga videos online, as well as at-home exercise regimens for a bunch of different styles. I think there's a lot of unhelpful pressure on people to ""get into the best shape of your life"" or whatever, and I don't know about all that but trying to do just a little bit of exercise can help your mood and your mental health. Can help you sleep better too. 
* **Craft**. This is most likely to require materials you don't readily have at home, but you can find a lot of stuff at big box stores. Consider crocheting, knitting, whittling, wood working, paper mache, candle making, felting (?), bejewling your denim jacket, cross-stitching, calligraphy, I'm sure there are lists you could google on this subject. 
* **Write emails or letters**. There's probably some family members or old friends in your life who you love but haven't kept in touch with. Take the opportunity to make a list and reach out to see how folks are holding up. You could reconnect with someone you've been out of touch with, might establish a new pen pal, and it might meet a little of your social needs that aren't getting met right now.
* **Games**. Here I'm including board games, card games, tabletop games, anything like that. This category is mostly for people who live with other people, but it occurred to me that Mafia (and most drinking games) would also work on a Zoom call for whatever that's worth. I also have a friend who's starting up a D&amp;D kind of campaign on Zoom, so if you're into that now's a great time to get something together. 
* **Actually fun Zoom calls**. I've done a few of these and they're kind of hit-or-miss, but it's a good idea to aim for a reasonable number (5-7 or fewer) so everyone can talk. You can just get friends together to catch up, or you can try to get creative and have fun with it. Organize a virtual happy hour where everyone makes drinks at their house and you play a drinking game (Never Have I Ever still works virtually). Organize a discussion group for a book or movie or tv show. You can use the chat in Zoom to take ""stack"" so if someone wants to talk they just type ""stack"" and that can help order who chimes in when if you have a lot of people. 
* **Teach your dog new tricks**. 
* **Teach yourself how to dance**. I dunno if this is a good idea say in an apartment but if you really like dancing and miss it or would like to have more confidence at Barbarella's after this is over why not. If you live alone and have been solo drinking put that buzz to use, do something goofy. 
* **Make something out of something else**. So this could be playing with Legos or blocks if you have them, or you could get real weird with it and learn to carve shit out of watermelon. Maybe you have clay, maybe you could make the state capitol out of pretzels. Weird but it would make a funny social media post if nothing else. 
* **Computer or video games**. I'm sure many of yall are well ahead of the curve on this, but I know a lot of folks who are staying sane by playing Animal Crossing or Minecraft. 
* **Make a simple bird feeder**. Works best for folks with porches or balconies so you can watch them while you drink coffee. 
* **Virtual Libraries**. Libraries may be closed, but APL is offering extended access to its [virtual resources](https://library.austintexas.gov/virtual). If you have an APL account and have access to Kanopy's streaming service, you can get 5 free plays per month instead of 3. APL's CloudLibrary lets you check out things for 10 days at a time now. Hoopla also lets you check out five items a month instead of four now. 
* **Build a fort**. A time-honored tradition for kids but if you're 28 and do this only god can judge you. 
* **Do a virtual tour**. I've never done one of these but I've seen several lists of famous museums that offer them. If you've ever wondered what the inside of the Vatican looks like you can have a virtual look around the place. Some aquariums and zoos offer live webcams of animal exhibits too - since the animals aren't dealing with crowds, you're likely to see them more relaxed than ever right now. 
* **Sex / porn**. I guess just adding this in case you hadn't considered it. 


# Social Distancing Activities (including anything still permissible)

* **Hike the Greenbelt**. 
* **Order takeout from a local restaurant**. [Eater](https://austin.eater.com/) has been tracking COVID restaurant developments pretty closely. 
* **Order a cocktail kit from a local bar**. You can find a list of businesses offering this (as well as businesses offering grocery store items) [here](https://www.kvue.com/article/life/food/coronavirus-austin-restaurants-groceries-list/269-cb599dc9-a884-48f9-975c-6dda6dfecd5f?fbclid=IwAR3D-C82ChF4z584OaDHWCE0tF2Qa_5auj5NmY_foXOdWpIk1cN3U0fIqC8). 
* **Restaurant grocery stores**. If you're curious about the above mention, [here's another article](https://austin.eater.com/2020/3/31/21199249/austin-restaurants-pop-up-grocery-stores-farmers-markets-coronavirus-covid-19-impact) detailing restaurants that have turned their kitchens into groceries during the COVID crisis. 
* **Photography**. I think now that places tend to be less crowded, it could be a neat time to go capture landmarks or famous businesses without a bunch of people around them. I've been having a lot of fun taking pictures during hikes as well. 
* **Catch up on car maintenance**. 
* **Knock out your pet's annual check up**. 
* **Mutual aid**. I know groups like Austin DSA and Workers Defense Project are organizing to help people through the COVID crisis. Churches could likely use a hand from volunteers as well. Feel free to mention groups and I'll add them. 
* **Drive to check out some graffiti &amp; murals**. You can take a look at some impressive art around town from the comfort of your car. [The Chronicle](https://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2020-04-03/new-murals-in-austin-you-may-have-missed/) recently ran a piece about newer murals you may not know about. 
* **[Terra Toys](https://www.terratoys.com/)** (a local toystore with a lot of educational stuff for kids) is still open as an essential business for ""child education, development and care"". Lots of at-home activities to be found in this place, and they limit the number of people in store at a given time. They also offer curbside service. 
* **[Farmer's markets](https://texasfarmersmarket.org/texas-farmers-markets-covid-19/)** are apparently still running. They recommend you treat them like you would a grocery store, wear masks &amp; do social distancing while there.
* **Drive-In Movie Theatres**. There's one in Buda and Hutto according to u/Corib93 - zero contact with other humans as you stay in the car. Good way to soften the blow of your favorite theatre being closed for movie lovers.",Austin,A list of activities for social distancing &amp; self-quarantine

&gt; Went there this morning @ 9:30AM - had most things in stock but out of toliet paper. Was fairly crowded. 

Feel free to post any pictures of stores or aisles as well. ""Going to HEB"" memes are also welcomed but we recommend posting those to /r/GoingToHEB.

Otherwise, /r/AustinGroceryFinds is a subreddit that may be another good resource in finding items.

I keep getting one song stuck in my head that I believe was called ""Perfect Day"".

From my memory it goes:

It's not the same this time

It's different now

I can see it in your eyes

And I think of all the times 

And they're gone now 

But if I only had one wish

It would be

You and me

Hangin out

Just one more perfect day. 

It won't get out of my head. I just want to listen to it again and hopefully my brain will stop.",Austin,This is a long shot. I need help finding a pop punk band from 20 years ago.

1422,1422,InvisibleSeaTurtle,1587231177,g3rev9,Ask Austin,"I know with everything going on this is the worst time to plan a move but I will be relocating to Austin in the upcoming months and need to sign a lease asap. I’m 23 and want to live in downtown Austin to be in walking distance to shops and be apart of the more lively scene and close to Zilker. I am from a densely populated city and used to being able to walk to grocery stores, restaurants and love the ease. 

My dilemma though is that I will be working near the domain area and have heard bad things about Austin traffic. I would be commuting via the I-35 for standard business hours and don’t know how long the commute would be. 

As there is no traffic currently due to people not commuting I cannot look up the normal traffic maps to see the commute time. I’ve commuted in LA and Miami previously so I’m no stranger to traffic. Is the traffic really that bad from downtown to the domain via the I-35? Even with the traffic, is it still worth it to live in downtown as I come from the city and am used to that lifestyle? Money and rent prices don’t influence my decision. 

Tl/dr: Is dealing with the commute from downtown Austin to the domain via the 35 worth the experience of living downtown? (cost not a factor)",Austin,Downtown Austin Worth the Commute?

I've also already purchased the part, I'm basically looking for someone to do the 20 - 30 minute installation.
