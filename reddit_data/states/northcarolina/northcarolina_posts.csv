My associate and I are planning on directing a  short film in Boone this summer.

This summer, we have  plans to create our first short film, Claire. In the film, Claire has  recently gotten sober after her child has been aborted and her boyfriend  has gone missing.

It's  a very dark short film that we have been writing for some time. Seeing  as we are a young duo and are both still in college, we can't pay very  much money, but we most certainly would like to create something  memorable and great. For anyone who is remotely interested in acting, it  would certainly be a great resume opportunity. We plan to enter the  film into as many local Film Festivals as possible, so you would most  definitely be seen and appreciated by a large number of people. 

If  you have any kind of interest whatsoever and will be available in the  summer, please, don't hesitate to send either of us an email:

127,Nick_9903,1578531707,em2412,discussion,"Okay, so I am a really good swimmer (I swim year-round for a club team) but I don't like swimming in deep murky waters. I've been to the isle of palms in SC and for some reason, I guess I grew a pair because I swam out to around 7' deep water and then got my goggles and went out another 8 feet to the drop off where there was a grass bed. (The max depth I was at was somewhere between 12-14 feet. 

In other words, if there was a shark I could have easily been dead. Murky waters and not to mention the depth I was at was an area for common big sharks (tiger, sand tiger, bull, blacktip) 

But this summer I am going to Oak Island again (I swim at the beach almost every year we go and vacation up there, but I never go out past hip deep.)  and this time I am afraid because of all the recent shark attacks and honestly, I don't want to lose a limb. Because let's be honest, no matter what people say on facebook when you lose a limb from a shark attack""Omg your still beautiful or You can accomplish anything don't feel sad""  No women would ever want to sleep or have any relationship with a guy if he is missing his legs or his arm. (Plus not to mention the daily annoyances and the limited things you can do.)

\*So what I am trying to say is\*, are the beaches really that bad, because maybe I was just lucky at Isle of Palms but Oak Island really seems like a shark hot spot. (Not to mention we are staying in a beach house between the ocean crest pier and 58th street.) -that area had 2 pretty bad shark attacks back in 2015.

Also, how can I have no fear when swimming at Isle of Palms but scared shitless about Oak Island.

Any local advice about times not to swim at or places wear sharks tend to feed or gather at. (Like dropoffs or shipwrecks.) 

Anything that will help lower my fear of going will be greatly appreciated!",NorthCarolina,People of Oak Island I need your Help!

162,ArAMITAS,1578754347,en8asz,Nan,"So if you where deciding between Charlotte or Raleigh which would you choose?

I am currently trying to figure this out. I am in IT. Just graduated so looking for entry level work. Im 26.

Culture: What are differences in culture? is one more young then the other? More progressive then the other?

Outdoor  Activities: Does either have the upper hand on this? I was  considering  Charlotte over Raleigh due to it being a little closer to  the  mountains. Although I've heard Raleigh has great parks and is only  an  hour farther. I am into hiking, mtb, kayaking, and biking in general.   Does either have the upper hand in bike friendliness? fyi, the beach   doesnt matter to me and is not a deciding factor.

Cost  of Living: So I know the Research triangle is a large more spread  out  area. I have heard CoL can be better in parts when compared to   Charlotte. Although I know you can get good rent if your willing to   commute a little farther in Charlotte. I am not sure which has the upper   hand on this, but if any info can be given on this I would appreciate   it. It may be the biggest deciding factor, next to jobs

Jobs:  Im in IT. I know both cities have a lot of IT jobs available.   Charlotte more financial and banking. I've heard that Raleigh has more   to offer in variety. That is one reason I think Raleigh has the upper   hand for me.

Public Transportation: I'll have a car, but I was curious if either are better at this.

Art and Music: I am a musician on the side. Which city has a better music scene?

Im  really torn between the cities. They both have jobs and outdoor  activities. Charlotte seems to have an upper hand in outdoor activities  and  Raleigh seems to have an upper hand in Job variety.

I  know this has been asked before and may be a irritating question.  I've  heard great things about both and I'm not sure which is better for me.  I'd probably pick the one with lower CoL and more jobs. Although I'd  prefer the younger and more progressive city.

Thoughts?",NorthCarolina,Raleigh vs Charlotte. Trying to decide which would be a better fit.

184,JeffJacksonNC,1578930050,eo5pys,politics,"You remember last year when we didn't pass a state budget, right?

There were a few reasons for that, but a big one was that the majority party committed to a strategy of trying to override the Governor's veto of the budget by repeatedly scheduling the override vote and then cancelling the vote every time all the members of the minority party showed up in the chamber. The majority party wants to get around any compromising, which they can only do if they can override the Governor's veto - which, in turn, can they can only do if they hold a vote while members of the minority party are absent.

So they tried over and over again to catch us off-guard. (This isn't just my accusation: They basically [confessed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/dprn2f/watch_the_budget_vote_keeps_getting_canceled/) their tactics on the senate floor.)

After many attempts it became clear that it wasn't going to work so eventually leadership got tired and sent us all home for the holidays - without a budget.

**But they had a plan:** Wait until candidate filing closed in December, then re-approach a few members of the minority party who didn't get a primary challenge. Offer them pork and other political favors in an effort to get them to flip. Keep in mind: It only takes one Democrat in the senate to flip and the veto will be overridden and the majority will have their preferred budget without having to compromise on anything. From the majority's standpoint, they have an \*extreme\* incentive to flip one Democrat.

So we're going back into session tomorrow. Three things could happen:

1. All the Democrats show up, none flip, the majority sees they're going to lose the vote so they cancel it (again), and we all go home. This seems most likely.
2. Some Democrats don't show up OR one Democrat flips, the vote is called, the veto is overridden, and the GOP-preferred budget becomes law.
3. Seeing they don't have the votes, GOP leadership decides to engage in some form of compromise and we negotiate our way to a final budget. This would be the responsible solution, and the one I personally favor.

I'll keep you posted.",NorthCarolina,The General Assembly goes back into session tomorrow because we still haven't passed a budget. This could go three different ways. - Sen. Jeff Jackson

But because it’s legal to have up to 0.3% thc, it smells and looks _exactly_ like weed, and because the state has no way to differentiate the two, it makes it impossible to prosecute and enforce prohibition.",NorthCarolina,NCGA goes starts a session today that is trying to re-criminalize hemp and marijuana.

The renewal offer was a much better value, and when I called in I was told to do nothing other than pay my first installment to renew (already on autopay). 


Fast forward, 12/13/19 a Blue Value insurance id card is sent out with $20 specialist, $20* urgent care, $500* ER. 
Then on 12/23/19 they send out another Blue Value insurance card with $50 specialist, $50* urgent care, $600* ER.


I called in to ask about this, guessing that because I didn't enroll in a marketplace plan after starting my application they just picked one for me, and it did an override on what I was initially offered...
Instead the nice people I spoke with at healthcare.gov and BCBSNC today said that there must have been a change in the plans offered in my area or that a 10% increase in income bumped me into a different bucket that isn't eligible for the original plan and there's nothing I can do.

Upon research, I learned that NC is **cheap rent, liberal and low COL** – the total opposite from NJ where rents for a bedroom starts at $1k+ and mixed political views (not that I care much about it, but as a Latinx I don't want to land in the wrong place).

Is there anything I should know about NC before moving? Is NC on path to legalize marijuana? Apart from rent (+ normal utilities and cost of living) what should I budget for that NC knows but out-of-staters don't? Is there something you didn't know before moving to NC? 

Thanks in advance!",NorthCarolina,"Moving to Greensboro, NC from NJ"

While 795 starts it's exit numbers while concurrent with US-264, this here is in some ways similar to how Ontario 417 starts it's exit numbers at the Ontario/Quebec border.  In a way this makes it easier to remember that September 21st is the 264th day of the year, and that a musician named Leonard Cohen grew up in Montreal as a kid before I-795, or even Ontario 417, or even Autoroute 40 in Quebec was even commissioned.

Another thing I wanna point out, well, I-40 in North Carolina is 795's expected future southern terminus, while Autoroute 40 in Quebec is already 417's eastern terminus, so apparently both regions have a ""route 40"" as the current or future terminus of the highways being mentioned.

390,Nelliell,1579990406,etxjcg,Nan,"Dear Nelliell:


Thank you for taking the time to contact me about the impeachment of President Trump. I appreciate hearing from you.

As you may know, on December 18, 2019, the House took a partisan vote to impeach President Trump. Article I, Abuse of Power, was passed with a vote of 230-197, and Article II, Obstruction of Congress, passed with a 229-198 vote. In an unprecedented act, Speaker Pelosi withheld the Articles for 28 days until January 15, 2020, when the House voted to appoint Impeachment Managers and to transmit the Articles to the Senate.

On January 16, 2020, the Senate Impeachment Trial formally began with the swearing-in of Chief Justice John Roberts and the swearing-in of Senators. During the impeachment trial, the House Managers and the White House Counsel will present their respective cases by offering opening arguments and presenting evidence. Following these presentations, Senators will have the opportunity to question the House Managers and the White House Counsel. At that time, the Senate could consider whether to call additional witnesses or to request additional evidence.

I have been clear that, based on the unpersuasive evidence collected by the House, and the weakness of their case for impeachment, I do not see the need for additional witnesses. The Constitution provides that the House “shall have the sole Power of Impeachment,” and that the Senate “shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.” It is the responsibility of the House of Representatives during an impeachment inquiry to collect evidence and to make the case for impeachment. It is not the responsibility of the Senate to do the work that the House failed to do, particularly when they failed to issue subpoenas for testimony. This is especially true where the Speaker and the majority have been insistent about the strength of their case justifying the impeachment and removal of a duly-elected President.

As a U.S. Senator, I have a constitutional responsibility to participate fully in the Senate impeachment trial. I will listen to both sides, carefully consider the evidence, and join my colleagues in rendering a verdict. I will also make sure that President Trump is treated fairly and receives a presumption of innocence rather than a presumption of guilt. The President deserves this basic guarantee of due process during the most consequential of constitutional events.

Unfortunately, the majority in the House ran a blatantly partisan impeachment process, which presumed the President was guilty while denying the President and the minority basic due process rights. Despite the lack of evidence presented, the House still voted to impeach President Trump along purely partisan lines. Compared to previous inquiries, the investigation into President Trump happened seven times faster than the investigation of President Nixon, and twenty times faster than the investigation of President Clinton.

Instead of focusing on real issues like securing our border, modernizing our infrastructure, or supporting our military, certain outspoken House members and Speaker Pelosi are using all of their time and resources to once again try to cast doubt on the results of the 2016 election. It is unfortunate that their partisan games have now prevented the Senate from conducting the work of the American people.

Thank you again for taking the time to contact me. Please do not hesitate to reach out again about other important issues.

Sincerely,

**TLDR Description**: Overall I am researching the environmental impacts and interactions humans have on the natural environment, particularly with bees. However, I am specifically examining bee disease and I would like to find out more information from people of any level of experience with beekeeping to gain primary data and first-hand accounts in which I would like to acquire a detailed picture/idea of the problems they have faced and how they have seen bee disease spread.

**Here is the full explanation:**

&gt;^(This survey is intended to collect data about Hobbyist beekeepers from the South-Eastern region of the USA. I am researching the practices of hobby beekeepers and their experiences from keeping bees. To further understand how diseases could occur/ spread I sought to investigate bee disease and health on a smaller scale. I found interest within the field of hobbyist beekeeping, where I could collect data about functioning bee colonies separate from environmental factors that are not relevant to death from disease alone. Since hobbyist colonies interact within very close proximity to each other, I assume that they are active in a common environment therefore able to spread disease to each other. I wish to investigate whether differences in the level of knowledge and experience of hobbyist beekeepers have an effect on the maintenance of and health of their colonies. I then wish to use this information in extension to draw questions of how and in what ways hobby beekeeping impacts the immediate environment. Information from this study can be potentially useful for locating or identifying bee health concerns with the intention to solve their related issues..)  
^(My study will examine the health of domestically kept honeybees, in order to understand factors that are significant in determining their health. Observation of domestically kept bees will give insight to what ailments cause collapse among those bee colonies and what measures are being taken by their caretakers to maintain the health of these colonies. My research question is : Do South-Eastern USA hobbyist beekeepers from backgrounds of varying levels of knowledge and field experience, in regards to beekeeping show significant differences in the health status of their domestically kept bees? This question will be addressed through a mixed methods research design that will include a qualitative primary design of a causal-comparative analysis from survey responses and a qualitative secondary descriptive research design in the form of free-response short interview questions)

If you know anyone else who is eligible for this survey please share! I would like a variety of responses so I will be able to get a decent sample of data.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions or contact me at [sakura.bees@gmail.com](mailto:sakura.bees@gmail.com)

*^(Disclaimer: I am not a keeper myself, and these questions are for research purposes, they do not reflect any of my personal opinions regarding beekeepers, bees, or keeping communities)*",NorthCarolina,I am an AP Research student and I am currently doing research on hobbyist beekeepers from the southeastern region of the US.

I'm a Technical Writer, and my husband is a Software Engineer. We would be leaving very good jobs here, so we would want to try to find something similar in NC. 

Should we give up on Wilmington and look more toward somewhere like Raleigh? Or Asheville? Proximity to the beach is obviously not a must. We just thought it would be nice. Really, what we're looking for is a place that's good for young, outdoorsy couples. We love things like hiking, going to parks, and just generally enjoying the outdoors.

545,JeffJacksonNC,1580927313,ezdxsk,politics," My party failed to end gerrymandering when we had the chance.

We turned that weapon over to the NC GOP, which used it with surgical precision.

Now my party is campaigning to take the majority in the state legislature and it's fair to ask whether - given another chance - my party would finally end gerrymandering.

For my part, if this election gives my party the ability to end gerrymandering and we decide not to, I will resign.

Gerrymandering isn't a political question - it's an ethical one.

And it's phrased liked this:

Is it ethical to intentionally draw districts to benefit your own political party?

And there's only one ethical answer:

No, obviously no, of course not, how is this even a question.

A failure by my party to finally bury this weapon wouldn't be a political failure - it would be an ethical failure. It would be the clear abandonment of principle.

And it would be a deal-breaker for me, and, I suspect, many other Democratic legislators.

Put simpler:

You can't complain about bank robbery and then turn around and rob a bank.

I honestly believe we will quickly and decisively end gerrymandering if we flip the legislature this year.

I visited Waynesville/Asheville/Charlotte last year to put the ""feelers"" out as my employer allows me to work remote. I love Michigan, but have wanted to branch out for some time now. I fell in love with the east coast's early American history and particular North Carolina since it appears similar to Michigan in certain ways.

As much as I loved Waynesville/Lake Junaluska, I'm not quite sure mountain living is for me. Asheville is also way too eccentric and expensive for my tastes (would love to frequent there but not live). I do however love the outdoor scenery that Western NC offers, but didn't really find a lot of ""neighborhoods"" where I could see myself starting a family. It seemed a bit more isolated.

Downtown Waynesville did have a cosy, almost Hallmark feel to it. Do you guys have any sugggestions? I'd consider more eastward as well, but mountain views are a non-negotiable. :)

It’s not fun, but it’s quite easy and just takes a few minutes. Turn your car on and defrost, use whatever you’ve got that won’t scratch your paint/windows. Plastic spatulas work wonders if you’re careful.

It should go without saying that carving little windows in the snow on your windshield does not cut it. Not only is it illegal, it’s incredibly dangerous for a number of reasons.  Among them, you can’t see anything around you. Have you ever seen a 5 sq. ft. piece of ice and snow flying through the air at 60 mph on a freeway? You can literally kill someone if it goes through their windshield.

Be smart, be safe, be courteous. Yes, snow is rare and confusing to us around here, but please please please think of the safety of yourself, your kids, and others on the roads. Laziness or “I’m trying to get to work on time” is no excuse. Do the right thing.

We have a 2.5 year old daughter and a baby due to arrive in August. My husband was just told last week his company is shutting down and he will be out of a job in 60 days. However, the parent company really likes him and would like to keep him. This means a raise, a sign on bonus, and relocation. Their current opening is in Lumberton, NC. I started doing research and read it’s the most dangerous city in the state. I also have read some really positive reviews that it’s a great small town, friendly people, southern hospitality, etc. 

If the job is offered we will certainly visit - but I am too anxious to wait. What do you know about Lumberton? Will I be okay to put my kids in the public schools? Will it be safe for me to take my kids to the park, out and about during the day while my husband is at work?

I am from Indianapolis. I am not a stranger to watching my surroundings and high crime, but I also know the city like the back of my hand so I know where to avoid, where to be more cautious and where to not go alone with my daughter. So I just worry about moving with my two little babies to a “dangerous” city I know nothing about. 

If you don’t recommend Lumberton, are there any surrounding cities you think are family friendly? We are middle class, and my husband is willing to commute up to 45 minutes.

Your advice and thoughts are so appreciated!",NorthCarolina,Job offer in Lumberton. Thoughts on living there?

It would go something like this:

I would hide a container (similar to a geocache) in a public location (state park, hiking trail, etc.) that contains a minimum of $100 dollars on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. I would then create a thread on this subreddit with clues (photos, coordinates, etc) on how to find the cache. Instructions would be that when the cache is found, the prize and location is posted on the original thread. 

Here’s the catch, you have the option to pay it forward. If you contribute some of the prize money to any North Carolina based charitable cause, I will match the contribution up to 50% of that what was in the cache, with proof on the thread.

1061,housedreamin,1583276013,fd35gg,discussion,"Look. It may seem in bad taste to “politicize a crisis”, but the reality is that crisis’s SHOULD be handled with assistance of public policy! In times like this (virus outbreaks) it makes it more obvious that health care is not just about personal insurance. We don’t live in a vacuum –healthcare is tied to the public in many ways and should be a public good available to everyone. 

Make your vote matter and vote for the candidate who is supporting Medicare For All, Bernie Sanders.

No, voting for Bernie today won’t affect this current outbreak, but in the future if M4A is available it could curb the spread of future epidemics and will help people get the care they need when they need it instead of fear of missing work (and thus losing their families healthcare tied to it) or fear of astronomical bills from preventative testing, care, etc.

America’s profits from insurance and lack of affordable/comprehensive healthcare is embarrassing.

I went to the Honda classic tour to volunteer, because it was basically a cheap vacation! Somewhere along leaving flordia, and ending up in NC, I have lost my wallet. I have been stuck at a rest stop off of I-95 going on the 2nd daynow. I have a little under a quater tank of gas. I have been doing nothing but looking through craigslist gigs trying to find some work to do for someone so I can get myself back home. And also thinking about eating my shoe. I have come here to see if anyone needs some kind of work done in exchange for fuel. Car washed, house cleaned, literally anything. Or maybe even a couch to sleep on for a night while I browse craigslist gigs. I dont have any family to help me out. I do have some friends back home willing to send me the money for fuel, but you cant pick up a western union without an ID. I'm starting to get a bit worried cause I'm kinda dumb and I just wanna go home lol. My back hurts from this car, I wanna shower, and man this shoe looks good right now. If anyone anywhere in NC can help me find a gig or couple days job, it would be much appreciated. Not here looking for a handout, I'll work for it. Can provide proof to this story!

I plan to drive, does anyone know if i need an international drivers license or i can just use the one given to me by my own country? I googled and it says i don’t need a state issued drivers license but i don’t know how much i can trust the internet. I’m terrified of the police and it seems like u guys have some scary cops. so i don’t want to take any chances. 

Any suggestions on what to do? I don’t really know anybody so i don’t know where to start. I also don’t drink that much so i wont be doing much bar hopping- which i suppose limits my options. 

The stories i hear on the media of kidnapping and harassment kind of scares me. The US is portrayed quite negatively on the media i’m not sure what to trust. 
Is NC safe? As a woman, how careful should i be? other than of course the obvious: being vigilant at night and aware of my surroundings, having pepper spray with me- anything else i should take not of?

1199,JeffJacksonNC,1583937307,fgy38g,discussion,"Some people are asking what's the big deal over coronavirus in NC when there are ""only"" seven confirmed cases.

Three reasons:

1. There are almost certainly more than seven actual cases. The truth is we are under-testing due to a national shortage of test kits (more on this later).

2. Nationally, the number of infected people appears to be doubling roughly every week. That means we have exponential growth, which is difficult to conceptualize but basically means it starts off slow but then rapidly grows. It means we could go from 100 cases to 1,600,000 in roughly 14 weeks - absent successful containment.

3. We don't have a vaccine (it's at least a year away) and - since we've never been exposed to this virus before - no one has any immunity built up.

We should know relatively soon whether this will be contained. If it isn't, then the focus is going to be on slowing the rate of infection so our hospitals don't become overwhelmed. We do not want a situation like they have in northern Italy where this got completely out of hand in a matter of weeks and clogged all the hospitals.

So we're washing our hands very often and refraining from handshakes and being otherwise sensible not just to keep ourselves healthy, but also to help slow the overall rate of infection to make sure hospitals can treat everyone who needs it.

Part of my job is making sure you have reliable information as this situation develops, so when I learn new things from DHHS I will update you.

Spring 2020 High Point Market Postponed

HIGH POINT, N.C., March 12, 2020 — The High Point Market Authority has been closely monitoring the ongoing and rapidly-evolving Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation, staying in constant contact with local and state public health officials and elected officials. Heeding the public guidance offered by NC Governor Roy Cooper, and in the interest of the health and safety of our stakeholders, industry members, and local citizens, the High Point Market Authority has decided to postpone this year’s Spring Market, scheduled for April 25-29, until a later date in early June, should conditions improve. 

“The decision was difficult, as any change in date could have tremendous economic repercussions on our industry and community, as well as the countless small businesses whose livelihoods relies on High Point Market, but underscores our shared concern and well-being of the citizens in our community and our industry partners,” commented Dudley Moore, Jr., chairman of the High Point Market Authority’s board of directors and president of Otto &amp; Moore.  

High Point Market has been a staple of the North Carolina economy since 1909. Throughout its long-standing history, cancellation has only occurred once when the 1942 markets were cancelled due to World War II. 

“Our board of directors will continue to monitor the situation, and we will remain in communication with the proper medical and elected officials,” commented Tom Conley, president and CEO of the High Point Market Authority. “Our aim is to have a decision in early May as to if Market can occur, given the uncertainties of this rapidly evolving situation.” 

For the time being, online registration will be postponed, with the plan to reopen once the new plan has been put in place.",NorthCarolina,High Point Market is postponed.

I’m looking at areas in Raleigh, Charlotte, and Asheville. 

My personal interests for settling into a space in NC is that I would love for the are to have an active art/music scene. Not necessarily night life, but things like poetry slams or art walks, etc. I am both an artist and a poet and would love to be able to find a community that shares these things. 
I also love to go on hikes and enjoy outdoor activities. I love the mountains, which I know Asheville is good for, but would be okay moving to Raleigh or Charlotte if they still had really nice parks with good hikes and scenery!
The other thing, and most important, is the ratio of income vs cost of living. I work in the medical field and need a space that provides good opportunities in that area for possible positions in that field. And an area that has housing available that isn’t going to suck up my entire paycheck - hard to find in most places these days, I know, but I’m really hoping I can find something that fits into that realm of workability. 

If you have recommendations for areas outside of these three cities, please let me know as well! I do prefer to live in more quiet suburban areas rather than active cities, as I love nature and would love to find an area that was like that, but I’m not super familiar with the state itself even if I’ve always wanted to live there.

As of March 14 at 8:00 a.m., the state of North Carolina has a total of 680 public (i.e., non-commercial) coronavirus test kits.

So the big question is, “Why don’t we have more tests?”

Here’s the situation:

First, there’s a difference between “test kits” and “extraction kits.”

Extraction kits = extract RNA (genetic material) from nasal swabs.

Test kits = test RNA to see if it’s coronavirus.

We started with a national shortage of test kits. That happened because the CDC - after rejecting the WHO kits and deciding to make their own - had a manufacturing error that allowed their test kit to produce false positives. So they had to start over several weeks in.

To make matters worse, while the CDC was fixing their manufacturing error there were many other labs across the country (academic and commercial labs) that wanted to produce their own test kits. But they needed federal approval to move forward, and getting that approval took a couple weeks - a serious amount of time, given the prospect of exponential viral spread.

It appears we are now seeing the production of test kits ramp up from both the CDC and commercial labs like LabCorp (which happens to be headquartered here in North Carolina).

BUT that leads us to our second problem, and the current major bottleneck: extraction kits.

Before you can test the RNA sample from the nasal swab, you have to extract it. Doing so requires a specific chemical. The majority of this specific chemical (called a reagent) is produced by one company with production facilities in Germany and Spain.

And now that specific chemical is in very high demand. The whole world wants it.

A few weeks ago, the FDA started allowing independent labs to develop alternate chemical processes for RNA extraction. It’s unclear how much progress has been made.

So, looking now at the big picture, we basically have a two-track testing system: public testing, which involves our main state lab in NC using the re-manufactured CDC test kits (and in NC, we currently have 680 test kits) and then there’s commercial testing.

Regarding commercial testing, we really don’t know how much is happening. The commercial labs aren’t required to disclose test results unless they’re positive. In North Carolina, we have LabCorp conducting commercial tests. In Charlotte, we also have our two major hospital systems - Atrium and Novant - now saying that they are going to provide “screening.” It’s unclear whether they are simply collecting swabs and sending them to LabCorp (where they may face the same extraction kit bottleneck) or whether they’ve developed in-house capacity to actually produce their own test results.

But it’s important to note that BOTH public and commercial testing appear to be hitting a bottleneck when it comes to extraction.

As a result, we are not screening nearly enough people.

Ideally, anyone who displays flu-like symptoms would be eligible for a public test, free of charge. That’s how we would address this like South Korea and provide for wide-scale testing on the order of tens of thousands per day.

But - due to the shortage - that’s not the case. Instead, the CDC guidelines (which NC is currently following) currently state that you have to 1) display flu-like symptoms AND have had direct contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case OR, 2) you have to display flu-like symptoms AND lower respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath) AND a negative rapid flu test.

A simpler way to say that is we are currently rationing public tests because we don’t have enough capacity.

Congress is now providing more funding specifically for these issues and commercial labs are reportedly innovating rapidly, but this is essentially a race against time and increasing our testing capacity within the next ten days is absolutely critical. It’s also possible that the window of opportunity for containment - at least in some regions - is now closed and we’re going to have to rely heavily on social distancing to slow the rate of infection.

You should also know that in the process of piecing this together I had many, many conversations with state and local health officials and every single one of them was on the same page, knew exactly what the bottlenecks were, and were working the problem. These folks get it, and they’re working around the clock for us.

More updates soon.

As of March 15 at 11:00 a.m., North Carolina has 32 \*known\* cases of coronavirus.

14 in Wake, four in Mecklenburg, two in Forsyth, two in Harnett, two in Johnston, one everywhere else.

We went from seven known cases to 32 in five days.

Safe to say we have more than 32 \*actual\* cases AND that no one has any idea how many we really have.

BUT I've seen some moderate estimates that nationally we may have (very) roughly 15,000 cases - the bulk of which are in WA, CA, and NY.

So perhaps NC is... in the hundreds?

There are two issues with that prediction:

\- The level of confidence in the underlying national prediction is low. Who knows if it's close to 15,000.

\- The current level of cases isn't nearly as important as the rate of growth.

We could have 50 cases or 200 cases in NC right now and if we see the growth rate of 6 days/double (the emerging national trend), then the starting point doesn't matter much.

At that rate, it could still fill all our state's hospital beds within a matter of 8-10 weeks.

And that's assuming NC hospital beds don't have any other patients. Right now they're approximately 80% full. They're trying to reduce that number but it certainly won't get to 0%.

**So the challenge is this:**

Lower the rate of infection (through wider testing and social distancing) to lower the double rate to make sure we have beds for everyone who needs serious treatment.

That's how we save the most lives.

**UPDATE ON TESTING:**

The state lab has tested 259 people.

The main private lab, LabCorp, reportedly has capacity for 3,000 tests per day but we have no idea how many they've actually done.

But don't get lost in the numbers. **Here's what really matters:**

To qualify for a test you still need to meet criteria beyond simply displaying flu-like symptoms AND you still need a doctor's note. That limitation is what test rationing actually looks like in practice, and it's not good.

Widespread, effective testing would look like this:

Anyone with flu-like symptoms can drive up to a screening center (maybe a tent in the parking lot of a hospital or a Wal-Mart), getting a rapid flu test, and then if it comes back negative, getting a coronavirus test. That's what we need, A.S.A.P.

BUT there has been significant progress in the last two days. Full update on testing progress coming tomorrow.

I am working on creating a Slack channel to coordinate a response to COVID-19 in North Carolina. This will be a place for people in the public and private sector to pool their knowledge and resources to respond better to the coronavirus specifically in NC.

This is what it can be specifically used for:

* General brainstorming. Just a place for people to discuss potential actions to address the pandemic, whether that be policy-oriented or something else. Might could get policymakers from the local and state level to join and contribute to the conversation as well.
* Coordinating messaging and awareness campaigns to ensure maximum circulation in NC.
* Finding resources. For example, if we get to a point where there isn't enough hospital beds or enough testing sites, we can find sites that could potentially be converted.
* Research and data analysis. A place for people to come together and analyze data/develop insights. This could be professors, students, professionals, etc.
* Discussion. It would be helpful for everyone's understanding of the pandemic if there is a community of medical professionals, researchers, business owners, data analysts, government employees, and other private citizens to discuss the issue at hand.

“Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times.

“We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.”

The suggestion surprised some of the governors, who have been scrambling to contain the outbreak and are increasingly looking to the federal government for help with equipment, personnel and financial aid.

Mr. Trump used much of the call to repeat the same upbeat rhetoric he has offered in public, assuring the governors: “We’re going to get it remedied and hopefully very quickly.”

Please understand that I know this would be an incredible hardship to a lot of parents. It isn't easy for my family either, and I don't know how we would do it if not for willing in-laws to help out.

**NC coronavirus numbers as of March 16**

* 38 known cases (and 33 cases in SC)
* No confirmed community spread (but nobody thinks it doesn’t exist)
* One hospitalization
* 369 people have been tested by the state (unknown number tested by non-state labs)
* State currently has capacity for 1,300 more tests (unknown non-state capacity, but reportedly much higher)

**Here’s the latest on the coronavirus testing situation in NC**

There are two ways to get a test:

1. A doctor decides you should have one and orders it from a commercial lab like LabCorp or from a hospital (UNC/Atrium/Novant) that has in-house testing capacity. These are ""non-state"" tests.
2. Fever of at least 100.4 + negative flu result + *cough or shortness of breath* = you quality for a state lab test BUT a doctor still has to contact the county health department and get their permission AND we’re hearing about many cases where that permission is not being given due to scarce supply of state test kits.

The immediate goal is expand testing capacity to the point where **EVERYONE who has fever + negative flu test + cough** can get tested.

To see why that’s not currently happening, it helps to understand how the CDC supply chain works:

* CDC sends test kits to the state
* State distributes to counties
* Counties release on a case-by-case basis as doctors call in

**BUT**

* CDC initially prioritized shipments to states that are getting slammed by coronavirus like WA and CA and NY, with states like NC only getting a small sliver.
* Some counties are (reportedly) reluctant to release any test kits unless the patient has had direct contact with a COVID case - even if they meet the criteria of fever + negative flu test + cough. They are holding back for cases in which there has been direct contact with a COVID case out of a concern of lack of available tests and the need to prioritize. Some of this may have also been caused by confusion about the eligibility criteria, but fortunately the state COVID hotline - which had been overwhelmed - got extra capacity added today.

But there's no question that some people who need to be tested have been turned away. Fixing that is the immediate priority.

**To be clear: We need to very quickly get to a point where everyone with fever + negative flu test + cough can get tested.**

So what are we doing to expand capacity?

* Getting more test kits from the CDC
* Partnering with LabCorp and other private vendors (so we’re not as dependent on the CDC for test kits)
* Partnering with UNC Health Care, which just got federal approval to start testing today and is already setting up its first drive-thru testing center in Henderson County
* Several non-state health care providers are expanding their own testing abilities, like Novant, Atrium, Tryon Medical Partners (which just found one of our state's 38 cases), and a clinic in Asheville. (If you know of more, please let me know! Tomorrow I'll publish a comprehensive list.)

**Bottom-line:**

It's hard to get a state lab test because they are being strictly rationed but the immediate goal is to have enough testing capacity to make sure that everyone who has a fever + negative flu test + cough can get tested.

**Note, I'm pretty sure that a surge in traffic has made the file form very slow. If you're running into issues, just wait an hour or so and try again.*

If anyone else has any helpful links to share, please do. I'm worried about what the future will bring but we are all in this together.

We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now. 

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

If the first responders fall, we fall too. Doctors and nurses and ambulance crews cannot get sick, and they are not taking this threat seriously. Order tests for all first responders. Remove the sick ones from duty so they can heal and return to work when others get sick. We can't lose our front line of defense.

North Carolina should be the first state to shut down and lead by example. People still want to go out and do things but we can't anymore. Every day people keep spreading this, the worse it will become. Flatten the curve now.

In 2 weeks the silent carriers of today will need hospital beds. In 3 weeks the newly infected will need hospital beds. In 4 weeks those new infected will need hospital beds.

**New COVID Testing Problem**

There's a new problem when it comes to COVID testing.

The first shortage was the number of test kits.

The second shortage was the number of extraction kits, which are needed to extract the RNA that gets tested.

The new shortage is masks, gloves, and gowns for medical personnel (PPE - personal protective equipment).

As it turns out, this \*directly\* impacts COVID testing. You can't do a COIVD test without this protective equipment because we cannot risk our medical personnel getting sick and in North Carolina - as in other states - we're running low on the equipment they need to stay safe.

The shortage is so severe that it may result in a modification of the eligibility criteria for who qualifies for a COVID test in order to ensure that there's enough testing capacity for higher-risk populations. DHHS is currently reviewing guidance to ensure we have maximum testing coverage given our resource constraint.

**Shelter in place**

The Mecklenburg county health director has stated that it's possible that our county will soon be told to shelter in place. There was no timeline or probability offered - just a caution to our folks so that they can take that possibility seriously starting now.

Mecklenburg's public health director does have the independent legal authority to call for our county to shelter in place. The state's approval would not be necessary.

**More test kits**

Mecklenburg is now contracting directly with LabCorp because we were only getting a few test kits per day from the state (which, in turn, is only getting a small number from the CDC). We asked the state for more, they told us to try and buy some directly from LabCorp, so that's what we're doing.

**Community spread**

Still no documented community spread, although most believe it is likely occurring. Estimates on the rate of possible community spread vary wildly. We are forming policy based on the assumption it is occurring.

**Day care**

Guidance on day care and child care centers is coming from the state this week.

**NC COVID stats as of 3/18 at 10:00 a.m.**

66 known cases - up from 40 yesterday, largely because of 15 Duke students who had just returned from Europe.

Counties: Wake: 17, Durham: 12, Mecklenburg: 14, Harnett: 4, Chatham: 3, Forsyth: 2, Johnston: 2, Brunswick: 1, Cabarrus: 1, Craven: 1, Guilford: 1, Iredell: 1, Lincoln: 1, Sampson: 1, Wayne: 1, Wilson: 1, Onslow: 1, Watauga: 1

430 tests have been completed at state lab, which currently has capacity for another 1,250 tests.

At least 1,420 tests have been completed by non-state labs (hospitals and commercial labs). Total capacity there is unknown, but reported to be much higher than state capacity.",NorthCarolina,"NC COVID Update: New testing issues, possible announcements, latest COVID numbers - Sen. Jeff Jackson"

For folks who still don't think coronavirus is something to take seriously in NC, this is what **exponential growth** looks like:

3/10 - 7

3/12 - 14

3/15 - 32

3/16 - 38

3/17 - 40

3/18 - 66

3/19 - 115

That's nearly 20x in NC in nine days.

And these are just the \*known\* cases.

If community spread is occurring - **and we believe it's likely** \- then we're probably seeing the same rate of growth, only it's occurring out of view.

Mecklenburg went from 14 cases yesterday to 30 this morning - so we doubled overnight.

Hope these numbers get the attention of some of the young folks who still haven’t gotten the message.

This puts NC **on the same path** that many other struggling states are currently on - only we're a week or two back from where they are now.

That means we have to act on the assumption that we are going to be in their shoes very soon.

Hospitals are starting to cancel elective surgeries and doing their best to empty hospital beds to prepare for a surge.

Our hospital beds are typically 85% full across the state.

If we don't significantly reduce that number within the next week, that's a major problem.

We are also finding off-site locations that could be used to help keep non-COVID patients separate and to increase total bed capacity.

We all saw how China built a new hospital in ten days. What we're doing is looking to re-purpose existing large buildings that are currently empty.

Doctors and hospital workers are being prepped for this. Whatever type of doctor they are, they're being prepped to switch to this kind of work.

Our state medical board is reactivating retired physicians and nurses by waiving requirements for continuing ed and academic testing.

We're also getting a clearer picture of what this means for people who are now unemployed or not getting paid. The relief mechanisms that we're going to use are starting to become clearer. More on that soon.

Earlier this week I was pulled over for speeding in Yadkin County. I was on my way back to college at AppState to get my stuff from my dorm due to this COVID situation. I had previously left my license in my dorm at school so I didn’t have it with me. The officer was able to look me up because I had my school ID and with my social security #. I knew I couldn’t afford to get pulled over without my license so I tried to drive carefully but I guess I lost track of my speed big time since he ticketed me for speeding 83 mph in a 65. He also ticketed me for not having my license on me. I’m 19 years old with no criminal record and had never been ticketed before. Before this, I had never even been pulled over.

My questions:
-Is this a criminal offense since it was over 80mph?
-Is driving without a license with me a criminal offense or a traffic violation/infraction?
-Could I get my license suspended? And for how long?

I work in IT, so wfh is the obvious choice, however with 2 kids running around and my doctor refusing to refill my prescriptions it is about to get real difficult. I've been working from home and we haven't been out since March 13th. It seems absolutely ridiculous not to refill my ADD medication without me going to their office sitting in their petri dish of potential infections. 

I don't know what to do here. Working is going to be damn near impossible to focus and get my job done. Finding a new doctor right now would be time-consuming, difficult and they would want me to come in as a new patient anyway, defeating the entire purpose. My prescription is an amphetamine, its not like I can just buy it online or at a drug store and I have to have a prescription to get it. 

Big surprise the doctor is Novant. Here is a full description below. I'm just really pissed but don't see any course of action except to use vacation time and wait it all out. 

&gt; 3/21/2020 -- Office Demanding Healthy Patients Enter for Prescription Refills

&gt; I have been a patient at this office for over 10 years. They have zero compassion for their patients and their patients
&gt; safety. During the time of COVID-19 when we are in a state of emergency and everyone is working from home and practicing 
&gt; ""social distancing"" they are requiring me to come in the office for to get a prescription. This is absolutely ridiculous. 
&gt; They demand I expose myself, my family and everyone else to COVID-19 to get a prescription for ADD MEDICATION. I have been 
&gt; taking seeing this doctor and taking this medication for OVER 10 YEARS. With all the stress of working from home and 
&gt; everything else in these times, not only are they adding more stress onto their patients but they are also helping
&gt; to potentially spread the virus by requiring healthy people that are practicing social distancing and isolation to enter
&gt; their office. 
&gt; 
&gt; I take mediciation for ADD. I have been a patient at this office for over 10 years. They require me to come in every 
&gt; six months or so, its a total waste of time. I assume its mostly to cover some legal reasoning and has an added bonus of getting
&gt; me to pay an office visit fee. I go sit in the waiting room for 30 minutes, sit in a waiting room 15 minutes, talk to 
&gt; a PA for about 180 seconds tops, because my doctor apparently can't be seen unless you schedule over 90 days in advance, then
&gt; go spend another 5-10 minutes waiting around the billing desk. I don't see them again for 6 months.
&gt; 
&gt; Its been 6 months and we're deep into COVID-19 with a state order of no groups over 10. They DEMAND I COME INTO THE OFFICE 
&gt; TODAY TO GET A PRESCRIPTION REFILL FOR ADD. I have practiced social distancing and self isolation for 10 days now working from
&gt; home, which they've just greatly complicated by refusing to refill my prescription medications. I have a newborn child 
&gt; 2 months old and a 82 year old grandmother that I take care of, yet Novant decided their lives are less important than
&gt; my office visit. Novant does not care about me. Novant does not care about you. This has been shown time and time again.
&gt; I could go on about the improper billing and lies, but I don't even care about that. What I care about is the fact that 
&gt; they refuse to give my prescription to me during this time without me going and potentially exposing myself and others 
&gt; to COVID-19. 
&gt; 
&gt; We are under a state order to have no groups larger than 10. There will be more than 10 people in your office. We are 
&gt; supposed to go places for ESSENTIALS. It is not ESSENTIAL that you see me. If it was ESSENTIAL to see me, you'd have needed to see me 
&gt; the last 6 months that you refilled it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly their response is ""we are seeing well people from 9-12am and then cleaning and seeing sick from 12:30-2"" okay 
&gt; that does nothing to make me feel better about my safety. You don't have someone at the door turning people away. You 
&gt; cannot GUARANTEE someone with COVID-19 isn't going to be touching your doors, your front desk, etc. They could come in
&gt; at 9:30 am, you tell them its well time only and cough on me on their way out. 
&gt; 
&gt; What if they don't even know they are sick? COVID-19 has ASYPTOMATIC carriers, so how would you know if I'm being
&gt; exposed or not? How is my ADD medication worth risking the further spread of COVID-19? 
&gt; 
&gt; Don't use Novant. You'll regret it. Find someone else. Anyone else.",NorthCarolina,Doctors Office Demanding Healthy Patients Enter for Prescription Refills

**Testing update**

As of 3/21 at 2:00 p.m., we have 239 positive cases in NC - that's an increase of 102 cases from yesterday.

That's a nearly 60% increase in one day.

**BUT** we also had a 60% increase in testing yesterday, from 3242 to 5,276 tests conducted (that includes our state lab and non-state sources like hospitals and commercial labs).

That tells us three things:

1. As many suspected, more testing is leading to a higher case count - but that's not reassuring. While the higher case count may not, by itself, indicate that the actual size of the total infected population is growing at the same rate as the confirmed cases (i.e., a 60% daily increase in confirmed cases may not indicate a 60% increase in the total infected population), the sheer number of people who are being confirmed positive each day does suggest that rapid growth is nonetheless occurring. And that's what is driving concern about hospital capacity.
2. Our efforts to ramp up testing are working. We still have a shortage of extraction kits (which are needed to make the test kits work) and we have an even bigger shortage of the masks/gloves/gowns that medical workers need to do the tests, but test capacity has dramatically improved - and that's largely due to non-state sources expanding their capacity. Nearly 40% of all the testing we've done in North Carolina happened \*yesterday.\*
3. Even with this increase in testing capacity, it’s important to note that no one thinks we are going to see the kind of widespread testing they used in South Korea to help trace, isolate, and ultimately contain the spread. Because of how much time has gone by, we’re going to have to rely on a combination of testing and social distancing. That means if we don't - as individuals - heavily commit to social distancing, then we are essentially allowing our hospitals to be overwhelmed. There's no third option here. Testing won't be enough.

**There are so many other updates I'm just going to do the rest in bullet-point form:**

* Students are certainly not coming back to school on April 1st. There is a real possibility that the school year is now over. If that happens, I don't know what it would mean for summer camps. As a parent with three kids at home right now, believe me when I tell you I'm tracking this issue just as closely as any of you. I would expect an announcement relatively soon.
* At this time, there is no intent to issue a shelter in place order. It remains an option, but currently NC DHHS has not made that recommendation to the Governor and that's why it hasn't happened. That could very well change in a matter of days. It would be prudent to plan around that possibility.
* There is currently no intent to add more businesses to the closure list but there may be some guidance coming for hair/nail salons.
* It has been repeatedly emphasized to state leaders by our food industry folks that the food supply chain is good. Basically, folks who own grocery stores are telling us that there will not be a shortage and you don't need to hoard food. Just shop when you need to and try and keep your distance from folks. Act like the calm, reasonable people you normally are when you're in a grocery store.
* Many steps are being taken to surge our hospital capacity. Our hospital beds are usually 85% full. That needs to change very quickly. Hospitals have already started canceling non-elective procedures. The state hasn't issued a formal order to that effect, but may do so if needed. (By the way, an ""elective"" procedure is one that cannot wait four weeks without causing serious harm to the patient.) The state medical board is waiving certain licensure requirements to allow medical professionals to cross state lines to work here and re-activating retired doctors and nurses.
* Child care facilities are now considered an extension of our health care system. We need them to stay in operation so health care workers (and other front-line workers) can continue showing up to work. So we are mapping all child care facilities within five miles of every hospital so health care workers know they have that option. Important note: These facilities are not limited to health care and front-line workers, but those workers (and children who are homeless or in an otherwise unsafe environment) will be prioritized if a shortage arises. BUT right now we have the opposite problem. About half of our state's child care centers have voluntarily closed and of the half that are open they are only about half full because parents have pulled their kids out. So we are talking to the federal government about getting some funding to make sure these facilities can afford to stay open.
* Last week our state processed 41,000 unemployment claims - a record. (More to come from me on state and federal plans for getting money to people quickly. Many plans under discussion. I need to learn more before giving you a sense of what I think is likely.)
* We've had so many people call 911 with COVID questions that we decided to create a stand-alone number. So please call 211 with your COVID questions.
* Like the federal government, we are moving the due date for state taxes to July 15. However, right now the interest on what you may owe will still start accruing on April 15. Why? Because legally we can’t use an executive order to change the interest accrual piece. We need a new state law for that and that can’t happen without the General Assembly meeting. Which brings us to another point...
* The General Assembly isn’t scheduled to go back into session until April 28th. We could call a special session - and many of us think it would be appropriate - but there has been vocal concern among some of our members about all of us meeting together in the same room. Right now, there is no procedure for remote voting.
* We are working hard to procure masks/gloves/gowns for our health care workers. So far we have been able to fulfill the requests made by counties but we see this as a serious issue and it is a major focal point for DHHS.
* There is some discussion of bringing in some National Guard soldiers to help with warehousing and transporting supplies and equipment where it is needed. At this point, that's the extent of their involvement.

**Final thought**

When this is over, one of the things that will have changed in our society is our concept of who our heroes are. We're used to seeing doctors and nurses and teachers in that light - and they certainly deserve it. But we're also seeing that we are only as strong as our checkout clerks, our sanitation workers, our delivery drivers. Some of these people have never worked harder - or at greater personal risk - than right now. Without them, everything truly would come to a halt.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Senator Jackson,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a local physician in Durham, North Carolina. I am grateful that you have made yourself approachable to your constituents through many venues, such as Reddit. I write to you to ask you to consider starting an initiative to provide reusable fabric masks for every North Carolinian to help foster sense of unity and to improve compliance with the state guidelines during the current COVID19 crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

We as North Carolinian are all very aware of the seriousness of the virus. Italy was an earlier example, and now New York has become a possible example of what can happen to our state, to our own families and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, along with the rest of the states in our nation, North Carolina has advocated social distancing, testing, and improving resources at the local hospitals. However, deep down, I think I speak for every North Carolinian when I can't help but think that we can't start and maintain lockdown indefinitely. The virus is fundamentally a public health problem and our current approach has limitations. We must think of creative ways to prevent infection, rather than just treating the infected, which is like focusing on dumping the water out of a sinking boat, rather than repairing the hole.

&amp;#x200B;

During this public health crisis that affects everyone, our community in North Carolina is divided. We can't trust our neighbors, as we suspect that they may be breaking guidelines to congregate in big parties. The virus can be transmitted without any symptoms, so every neighbor in public is a potential threat to our own families. Furthermore, as we follow the guideline of social distancing, North Carolinians are more isolated than ever. Again, this is a public health crisis, and to solve it, we need to restore the trust and unity in the community to have a chance at beating this virus.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically, there is a big problem with the stigma that comes with wearing a mask in public. In theory, wearing a mask should be praised, as not only can it help protect the citizen wearing the mask, but it may also help asymptomatic citizen from giving the virus to others. However, in reality, those wearing the mask is looked down upon as someone who may be carrying the disease. 

&amp;#x200B;

This stigma further divides our community and has further grave consequences. Those that need to wear the masks the most are not permitted to do so. For example, in grocery stores, the workers are not allowed to wear masks. When we should praise these individuals risking their lives for our community, we are in fact contributing to situation where they can't even be given basic protection. My wife is a retail pharmacist, and she is also forbidden from wearing a mask at work. There are many reports of the sick citizens that need to wear masks, who suffer from ignorant behaviors, such as strangers spitting at them because they wear masks.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a suggestion: provide every North Carolinian a reusable fabric mask with a print ""Together NC,"" or something similar in spirit; strongly recommend everyone to wear the mask in public. If everyone wears the mask, the stigma will vanish; those that need to wear them would be able to wear them. There will be a sense of comfort; instead of having zero layer of security, every North Carolinian would be able to enjoy the fact that there will be two layers of security, between self and fellow North Carolinian. Ideally, every North Carolinian should have two masks, so that they can alternate while washing and drying the other.

&amp;#x200B;

This won't be just a solution geared toward practical health benefit. There will be a major psychological benefit. When a state official gives a speech, it may remain in our minds for few minutes, before we are distracted by the challenge that life gives us. However, if everyone wears the mask with the print ""Together NC,"" it will serve as a constant reminder that this is a joint effort by the whole community. When one sees that everyone is wearing the mask, the fear of our neighbors will dissipate, as we begin to trust that everyone is following the guidelines, that even if they are asymptomatic, there are two layers of security. Most citizens have good intentions and in need of frequent reminders to change their behaviors; the new culture of mask wearing should be a strong stimulus for this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Undoubtedly, there will be suspicions. For one, CDC guideline recommends no masks unless one is symptomatic. However, I believe that we can interpret this as need to save the professional supplies for the hospital workers. This would not apply to fabric masks for the public. Also, there will be doubts about whether wearing fabric masks will be affective at preventing infection. I think most North Carolinian would agree that following common sense, it can't be worse than not wearing any mask at all. Furthermore, there is no studies that investigate the benefit of everyone in the community wearing fabric masks. How could you even study this? In ideal situation, one should wait for studies and results before implementing solutions. However, with protecting our families against COVID19, time is of essence. We can't afford to wait a year to collect data. We need to act now.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, our current approach unfortunately is limited in preventing infection. There is mistrust in the community and likely poor compliance with current guideline. We can't start and maintain lockdown forever. If we start lockdown for a week, that would be a great opportunity to involve commercial entities to mass produce these fabric masks. We print t-shirts all the time in various sizes. We should be able to provide masks in two sizes: adult and child.

As a fellow North Carolinian, I look forward to a day when I can have a sense of pride as I look at fellow North Carolinian wearing a mask to show that everyone is committed to fight the virus together. I look forward to a day when those that need it most - the frontline workers, the sick, and the elderly - can wear the mask without stigma. I look forward to a day when we tell an out-of-state visitor that you have to wear a mask in North Carolina. That in North Carolina, each of us is committed to our fight.

There are many things that need to happen that won't happen until the General Assembly is back in session (example: expanding unemployment insurance).

But right now we're not scheduled to go back until April 28 - **over a month away.**

We can't wait that long.

At this point, **I would support a special session** to start getting economic relief to people.

I understand many of my colleagues don't relish the idea of congregating indoors together, but that's exactly what we're asking of every nurse and grocery clerk in the state.

Back in 2008 I covered Bernie Sanders in Raleigh.

I tried to reach out to both the re-election campaign and the senators Washington DC office. I left voicemails, phone message and sent e-mail. Every time someone promised to get back with me, and no one ever did. This is theft.

1563,rla5057,1584998472,fns8kc,discussion,"**TLDR:: to increase efficiency of testing, suggestion is to combine samples. Collect 2 samples from each patient, and divide the samples into groups (based on household, work place, etc). If a group is negative, declare whole sample negative. Otherwise, if a group's collective samples returns as a positive result, the whole group will be tested.  The basic assumption here is that a diluted sample, up to a certain threshold, can still be used to test the existence of COVID-19.  By doing this, we can effectively test and quarantine significantly more people using the same limited numbers of test kits we have available.**

**Background**

The lack of reliable testing for COVID-19 has been a huge hurdle to the US’s response to the pandemic. \[1\] Washington State has taking drastic actions to slow the spread of the virus, including closing all schools, bars, gyms, and restaurants. According to The Atlantic, experts now believe that massive-scale testing will be necessary to restore normal economic conditions. \[1\]

Private companies such as Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, and Roche are beginning to ramp up testing capabilities – for instance, LabCorp recently announced that it is able to run 20,000 tests per day \[2\]. However, testing remains a major bottleneck in the response for COVID-19. Grouping samples for testing can reduce the number of test kits needed to perform the same number of tests, allowing up to 5-10x the amount of people to be tested with the same number of test kits.

**Recommendations**

· Group samples for testing by household. If one member of a household has COVID-19, it is extremely likely that other members of the household have it; testing multiple members of the household is redundant.

· For samples from different households, the number of samples to group together can be optimized based on the prevalence of the virus in the population – see appendix A for further details.

Appendix B: Background and approach

**Background and Testing Procedure**

· Currently (as of March   21), one of the major concerns with COVID-19 is the lack of testing kits and   capabilities. Although efforts are being made by Roche, UW, and other testing labs, testing remains scarce.

· Here, we propose an approach to increase the efficiency of testing, without compromising quality,   by combining samples.

· We collect two samples  from each patient.

· We divide the samples  into groups. In our example, we have 1000 samples. Our goal is to minimize   the number of independent tests by combining samples.

· If a group is  negative, we declare the whole sample negative, and do not test those   individuals. Otherwise, if a group's collective samples returns as a positive   result, the whole group will be tested.

· The basic assumption  here is that a diluted sample, up to a certain threshold, can still be used  to test the existence of COVID-19.

**Mathematical Reasoning**

· For a group to be negative, every member needs to be negative. Thus, the probability of the   whole group testing as negative is equal to the probability of each element   being negative, taken to the power of the group size.

· Expressed as an  equation, this shows that the group positive rate is R, where **R =   1 - (1-Prob) \^ Group\_Size**

· We multiply **R**   by the total sample size to get the extra tests needed for all members in a  positive group. Combining that with the number of groups gives us the total  number of tests needed.

· As you can see, this  method can save a lot of tests, effectively performing more tests without   compromising the integrity of the test results. For example in WA, the rate  is 6.5%, group 5 samples together saves more than half of the tests.

· As more tests are  performed, we can optimize the sample size based on the changing  probabilities.

1584,IdLikeToBeARobot,1585066747,fo7uet,discussion,"Doctors are hoarding medications touted as possible coronavirus treatments by writing prescriptions for themselves and family members, according to pharmacy boards in states across the country.

The stockpiling has become so worrisome in Idaho, Kentucky, Ohio, Nevada, Oklahoma, **North Carolina**, and Texas that the boards in those states have issued emergency restrictions or guidelines on how the drugs can be dispensed at pharmacies. More states are expected to follow suit.

**“This is a real issue and it is not some product of a few isolated bad apples,” said Jay Campbell, executive director of the North Carolina Board of Pharmacy.**

The medications being prescribed differ slightly from state to state, but include those touted by President Trump at televised briefings as potential breakthrough treatments for the virus, which has killed more than 500 people in the United States and infected at least 43,000.

None of the drugs has been found to be effective in treating coronavirus or been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for such uses. Some of them — including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir — are commonly used to treat malaria, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, H.I.V. and other conditions.

Pharmacists around the country have been swapping stories on social media about the spike in prescriptions written by doctors for themselves or their families.

“I have multiple prescribers calling in prescriptions for Plaquenil for themselves and their family members as a precaution. Is this ethical?” one person wrote on Sunday in a Facebook group for pharmacists, referring to a brand name of hydroxychloroquine. Others weighed in — some noting similar experiences — and expressed their hesitancy to dispense such prescriptions.

“I got called a communist for telling a prescriber, who was trying to call it in for themselves, no,” someone posted on Friday in another Facebook group for pharmacists.

Carmen Catizone, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, said state boards across the country were “trying to stop the hoarding and inappropriate prescribing, but balancing what patients need.” Mr. Campbell, of the North Carolina board, said medical boards and associations had to get involved as well to curb the behavior of prescribers.

The first restrictions were imposed last week in Idaho. The board there imposed [a temporary rule](https://bop.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2020/03/FAQ-COVID_03212020.pdf) that bars pharmacies from dispensing two drugs — chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — unless the prescription includes a written diagnosis of a condition that the drugs have been proven to treat. The rule also limits prescriptions to a 14-day supply unless a patient had been previously taking the medication.

“We wanted to try to get out in front of that as early as we could,” said Nicki Chopski, executive director of the board in Idaho, where pharmacists began reporting a significant uptick in prescriptions for the medications last week. The prescriptions, she said, were being written by doctors for themselves and their family members, often in large quantities with refills.

Texas adopted[ a similar rule](https://www.pharmacy.texas.gov/files_pdf/291.30.pdf) on Friday, including another malaria drug — mefloquine — as well as azithromycin, commonly known by its brand name, Zithromax Z-Pak. The drug, which is used to treat bacterial infections, has been mentioned by Mr. Trump as another potential treatment for coronavirus when taken in conjunction with the anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine. The effectiveness of the treatment remains unproven.

Allison Benz, executive director of the Texas State Board of Pharmacy, said pharmacists were reporting an unusual increase in prescriptions for these drugs written by doctors for themselves, their family members and their office staff. As in Idaho, patients who legitimately need medications for conditions that the drugs have been proven to treat will not be restricted from getting them as a result of the new rule, Ms. Benz said.

On Sunday morning in an emergency meeting reported on by[ the Columbus Dispatch](https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200321/ohio-pharmacy-board-restricts-prescriptions-for-experimental-coronavirus-treatment-drugs?fbclid=IwAR2ORfY_RUhJKLT_ZIprVhIcQpNSIGrt_1qA2h39XKSFLiVHEuhenuRkWOc), the Ohio Board of Pharmacy barred pharmacists from dispensing the drugs to treat coronavirus unless a person had tested positive for the virus, or the request had been approved directly by the pharmacy board’s executive director.

In a statement, CVS said that pharmacists are to use their “professional judgment to determine whether a prescription is valid and appropriate to dispense,” noting that pharmacists would comply with any applicable state board regulations.

A spokeswoman from Walgreens concurred that its pharmacists will follow whatever requirements are set in the state where they practice, also noting that the company had issued guidelines for dispensing two of the drugs in highest demand — chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Walgreens will only allow a 14-day supply for new prescriptions in order to help ensure that the medications remain available for those who need them, the spokeswoman said.

Instead of instituting rules, some states are offering general guidelines for pharmacists facing the dilemma.

The Kentucky Board of Pharmacy encouraged pharmacists to “use professional judgment” in addressing whether a pharmacist should fulfill requests from physicians who are “writing prescriptions for themselves and their family members in large quantities,” according to a[ memo detailing Frequently Asked Questions](https://pharmacy.ky.gov/Documents/Kentucky%20Board%20of%20Pharmacy%20COVID-19%20FAQs.pdf) on the board’s website.

The guidance goes on to say that the pharmacists can determine if a “valid patient-prescriber relationship exists,” while also urging the pharmacists to consider if there is enough of the drugs in stock to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis who need it on a regular basis.

She also said they are not releasing the correct number of cases on the news and they have patients coming in everyday and some currently on ventilators.  Soon they won't have enough room in the hospitals to treat patients and will have to turn people away.  They've cancelled all surgeries to use the ORs for available ventilators, but it still won't be enough.  

She also said she found some people in there 40s and 50s who were previously healthy to be on ventilators and having major difficulty breathing because they took Advil.

---------------------------------

Dear Governor Cooper,

In the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, I am contacting you as a concerned North Carolinian to implore you to pass an executive order for state-wide Shelter in Place, as well as to call for a special session of the NCGA. 

As of the writing of this letter, there are over 500 cases of confirmed coronavirus cases in North Carolina. As this number continues to grow exponentially, our hospitals will soon be overwhelmed unless immediate action is taken. 

Two days ago, the The North Carolina Healthcare Association, as well as major hospitals and physicians from all across the state, [asked you to execute a shelter in place order](https://www.wral.com/coronavirus/16-states-under-stay-at-home-guidelines-nc-hospitals-ask-governor-for-shelter-in-place-order/19025710/), and I am echoing their plea. The NCHA states that current measures ""are not enough to tamp down the surge we anticipate is coming to hospitals in the near future"". ""It is imperative that we move quickly, as it will take at least two weeks after a shelter in place order is issued before we see a change in the trajectory of cases,"" ""Hospitals and physicians throughout the state believe this is the only resort left to immediately impact the growth and spread of the virus."" I am begging you to please listen to our physicians and nurses, who are on the front lines of this war, and issue a Shelter in Place order TODAY. 

I am also asking you to immediately call for a special session of the NCGA to discuss relief efforts for newly unemployed North Carolinians and others in desperate need of financial aid. 

As you are well aware, the US Senate came to an agreement last night on a $2 trillion stimulus package, including a measure that would put cash directly in the hands of the American people. While this is great news, it is not enough, and we are in a fortunate position as a state to have significant funding available to help the people of North Carolina. Now that we know the type of relief coming from the federal government, it is time for our state government to act.

We currently have $1.2 billion in our rainy day fund, $2 billion in unspent cash reserves, and $4 billion in the Unemployment Trust Fund. It is time for the NCGA to hold a session to pass vital legislation to distribute these funds to the people in need in our great state. Our unemployment system is already overwhelmed. We need legislation to further help the tens of thousands of North Carolinians who are now out of work. You have the power to call for a special session at your discretion, and I urge you to use it immediately. 

Mr. Governor, we are truly in unprecedented times. The choices you make today will have a significant impact on the very real lives of the people you govern. Thank you for your continued leadership, and please take the above action for the best interest of our great state.

Sincerely,

xxxxxx",NorthCarolina,Please contact Gov. Cooper and urge him to implement state-wide Shelter in Place and to call for a NCGA special session NOW!

**CURRENT STATS (as of 3/26 at 1:00 p.m.)**

690 cases (182 more than yesterday)

50+ hospitalizations

1 death

**NEW TESTING RULES**

When it comes to testing, our state - along with the rest of the country - has three critical shortages:

1. the test kits
2. necessary components, like extraction kits and swabs (believe it or not, the main manufacturer for the swabs is in Lombardy, Italy...), and
3. the masks/gowns/gloves necessary to perform the tests.

The good news is we've made real strides in the last ten days with private labs coming online. 90% of the testing in our state is now being done by private labs and we're doing more testing per capita than most states.

Here's the bad news. Even with this added capacity, the CDC anticipates that the demand for testing will continue to outpace supply. So the CDC has put out new guidance on criteria for testing, and NC has adopted that new criteria.

And the short version is this, direct from [DHHS](https://files.nc.gov/ncdhhs/documents/files/covid-19/COVID-19-Provider-Guidance-03-23-20-Final.pdf): ""In general, patients with mild illness (defined as fever and cough without shortness of breath or difficulty breathing) do not need testing.""

So the old qualification was: fever + negative flu test + cough OR shortness of breath.

The new qualification is: fever + negative flu test + cough AND shortness of breath (or other serious symptom).

That means if you're a middle-aged, reasonably healthy person and you develop mild, flu-like symptoms and think you may be infected, the new guidance is to call your doctor, at which point your doctor will likely tell you to assume you're infected and self-quarantine until you've been fever-free for three days (unless your condition worsens, in which case call your doctor again).

That's a major shift in combating this virus, and it dramatically increases the importance of social distancing. As DHHS says, ""We are moving to a different phase of our response efforts \[and are now focused on\] mitigation strategies"" in which a big part of the goal is ""to conserve supplies and capacity so our health care workers can care for people who need medical attention even during the peak of the outbreak.""

Let's be honest about what that means: It means we are not going to have the type of widespread testing we would ideally have because we just don't have the supplies, nor - at this point - the time. It's not good news, but it is a realistic assessment of where things stand.

If we're not going to beat this the way South Korea did (test -&gt; trace -&gt; isolate) then we have no choice but to beat this by not getting sick in the first place - or at least not all at once - which means social distancing is our only real, scalable strategy at this point. It's the only lever big enough that - if we pull it really hard - will actually flatten the curve and keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed, as we're starting to see in NYC. We're on to Plan B, and there is no Plan C. So we have to make this work.

**STAY AT HOME ORDERS**

That's why you're starting to see stay at home orders on the county and city level (Mecklenburg + Wake + Orange + Durham + Pitt + Madison + Winston-Salem + Clemmons + Beaufort), and why you're going to see more, and why we may see similar statewide action soon. In response to whether there would be a statewide shelter in place, the Governor recently said, ""We will be issuing additional restrictions soon.""

**GEARING UP - HOSPITAL BEDS**

* Hospitals are looking at sites for possible rapid expansion, if necessary.
* They are stressing telehealth as much as possible to free up space.
* They are canceling elective surgeries - some more quickly than others. Our hospitals are typically 85% full, so getting that number down really matters. Progress on that front has been mixed. We're not where we need to be yet, but that's because we have many hospitals - especially in rural areas - that are barely getting by. They are essentially waiting until the last minute to cancel procedures that help them bring in revenue and keep the doors open. However understandable that may be, we're reaching the point where we really need to make sure we have maximum bed availability, so more formal (i.e., mandatory) guidance may be coming to instruct a more rapid transition.

**GEARING UP - PPE**

The bottom-line here is we're doing everything we can to get our hands on more PPE (personal protective equipment = masks/gloves/gowns).

1. We're getting it from the federal government. We've received two shipments already, with more coming.
2. We're buying it ($66m worth of orders, but much is back-ordered due to demand).
3. We're working with North Carolina manufacturers to start making what we need.
4. We're asking citizens to donate any PPE they may have (email [BEOC@ncdps.gov](mailto:BEOC@ncdps.gov) if you've got some, or if you're near a Novant hospital you can also email [donatesupplies@NovantHealth.org](mailto:donatesupplies@NovantHealth.org)).
5. [UNC Health](https://www.unchealthcare.org/coronavirus/ways-to-help/) is accepting homemade masks made of tightly woven cotton. 

**UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE**

The economic piece of this crisis is starting to come into view, and it's incredibly serious. Over the last ten days, North Carolina has received over 150,000 unemployment claims. We're used to seeing about 3k per week.

And check out the historical comparison (and that last bar is actually 50% higher now due to new data...):

https://preview.redd.it/lhww6b1112p41.jpg?width=1257&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdc184f8e1f27ce70af5b0cdb4c909b875e0d196

That means there are three things about our state's unemployment insurance we need to fix immediately:

**1) The website/call center**

We are adding capacity quickly but I'm still getting reports (as recently as while I was writing this) that folks can't get through. This is a known problem and we're working on it. If you need to file a claim, it's [des.nc.gov](http://des.nc.gov/) or (888) 737-0259. They encourage you to apply online if possible, and the process usually takes about 20 minutes. The earliest you will receive benefits is two weeks.

**2) The size/duration of the benefits**

Most states offer up to 26 weeks of unemployment insurance. North Carolina caps it at 12 weeks - 49th in the nation.

Nationally, the average weekly benefit is $378/week. North Carolina's average payment is $277/week - 41st in the nation.

That means right now the average North Carolinian on unemployment gets just under $2,300, spread out over two months. Looking at the chart above, you can tell that's not going to be enough.

**3) Who qualifies for benefits**

In North Carolina, only 10% of unemployed people qualify for unemployment insurance - again, 49th in the nation.

That's going to have to change. For starters, we are certainly going to have to include independent contractors, the self-employed, and nonprofit workers, which we currently don't.

The good news is that the federal stimulus that looks like it's about to pass in D.C. has a major UI component that does a lot of what we need to do. But it's still up to the state legislature to do some real work to make sure we maximize our eligibility for new federal funds for those who are now out of work. Fortunately, at this point, there appears to be a strong bipartisan interest in doing that, so I'm optimistic on this front.

**NATIONAL GUARD**

They've been activated, but only to supply logistical and transportation support. I happen to be in the National Guard, and I was given a heads up that I might be called in. If I am, I'll let you know.

**NEAR-TERM GOALS**

This is all about buying time for our hospitals to gear up. Every day we stay healthy is another day we give them to prepare to take care of those of us who will become seriously ill. It's rare that our country so rapidly shifts to a single point of focus, but we're there. Flattening the curve is what we do now, it's who we are for this moment in time. We still have time to get this right in North Carolina.

Hey everyone - very new to this as I would imagine many are with the coronavirus layoffs. I’ll start with my relevant work history from the last year. 

•Jan - July 2019: working in Oklahoma throughout college (quit after graduating)
 
•July - September 2019: Moved to NC, had not found a job yet 

•October 2019 - March 2020: Working in North Carolina, was laid off last week due to Coronavirus 

Immediately filed for unemployment in NC this week but was deemed Ineligible due to not having 2 base periods of work in North Carolina (only worked  Q4 2019, Q1 2020 was not counted due to filing in March.) I’m afraid I screwed up here and wish I had just waited until April 1st to file so as to be eligible in NC with 2 base pay periods. 

So my question is, now what? Do I file for unemployment in Oklahoma since that’s where the bulk of my base pay period was, even though I wasn’t laid off? Do I wait until April and somehow re-file in North Carolina? Is that even allowed? 

Thanks for reading and any advice would be appreciated, NC unemployment phone lines are busy to the point that I can’t even get on call waiting.",NorthCarolina,Afraid I screwed up on filing for unemployment and not sure where to go from here

I work for a large supply chain shipping out all the stuff that's in high demand currently. Toilet paper, rubber gloves, masks, disinfectant wipes, etc., mostly to to supermarkets and box stores.

* TP stocks are decent. They should continue going out at reduced yet regular intervals.

* Rubber gloves are fine. We have a good supply of those. Enough to continue shipping out regularly for the next couple weeks.

* Disinfectant wipes are okay. We've reduced how many stores can order at one time but I don't see them being an immediate issue.

* Anti-bacterial soap is in good supply and has been going out regularly.

* Masks are long gone. We have none and the manufacturers are swamped. (To be clear, I'm referring to regular sanitary masks not the N95s. We don't handle those.)

\------

Senator Burr,

I met you when I was 13 on the steps of the Capitol. I was with my school, St. Michael the Archangel School from Cary, NC. It was so awesome meeting you; you were the first politician I had ever met. You probably meet many school children but just in case it helps pinpoint the meeting here are some details: It was cold, a little rainy. All us 8th graders were wearing purple hoodies. It was 2010. 

Now I am 23 and I would like to attend your next town hall or meeting with constituents. When I met you in 8th grade, I was in awe. Now, I wait in anticipation for the day you can answer this constituent on your meeting with The Tar Heel Circle on February 27. I wait in anticipation where you can explain to us your stock sales. 

You spoke to The Tar Heel Circle and said something drastically different than you were saying to the general public. You left your constituents out in the cold and I will never forgive you for that.

My mother owns a small business. She has run this business for 31 years. Now, she is having to close her doors due to the covid-19 pandemic. Had she known on February 27 the seriousness of covid-19, she could have had more time to protect her business and survive this storm. But she did not. We are not in the position to pay $500-$10,000 for the truth. Senator Burr, you are responsible for not giving your constituents enough time to prepare. You are partially responsible for the closure of my mother's business. 

I thought you looking away during the President's impeachment was deplorable, but you have amazed me by going even lower.

I pray God is real so that you may be judged and sentenced. I pray you lose sleep. I pray that, with every fancy dinner you attend, you think of my mother now without a livelihood.

As I understand it, the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance section of the just-passed CARES Act provides federal funding for 12 weeks of unemployment benefits for gig workers and independent contractors who have suffered a loss of work due to COVID-19.  However, this program is not administered federally - it is administered through the state Departments of Labor.  So before anyone in NC can get any benefits, the NC DoL must, in some way, agree to and implement the program.

What I don't know is whether this is an executive matter that the DoL and governor can just decide to do and do, or whether it requires state legislation - implying no action until after the general assembly reconvenes on April 28 (assuming no special session).

I also don't know the state-level politics of this.  Do we anticipate that this will be quickly approved, or is it likely to be held up like medicaid expansion was?

Yesterday, /u/JeffJacksonNC made [a post with information about unemployment in NC](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/fpzehi/heres_the_situation_with_unemployment_insurance/), but this was before the CARES Act had passed.

Lots of people are torn between having to go to work because they are deemed essential, while feeling that they aren’t essential.  They are torn between govt officials saying they should stay at home and avoid people—risking their health—or losing their paycheck. 


The biggest disconnect is that there’s so much difference between how different companies and fields of work are handling the current pandemic.  People see ceos rescinding their pay and bonuses to pay their frontline employees (Texas Roadhouse) but I’m aware that while you may be named something, you may just be a franchise and we don’t know how that works for an owner.  


Small businesses I’m sure are in a different boat.  They have to have money coming in to pay their employees, the owners may take a wage but they’re not making enough to pay 20 ppl to just take off for two weeks or something.  


With as stressed as everyone is, I just think a little communication and reality of the situation would help employees who feel stuck not feel so resentful towards their employers.  If an owner of a company would be like look, if we close for two weeks—there’s no money to pay you, and we wouldn’t be able to open back up because we’re going to be struggling to pay our bills as well.  We won’t be able to pay the rent for the shop you work in, the insurance on the vehicles you drive, our suppliers we get materials from, etc.


I think a lot of people would feel better just knowing that while they don’t feel essential, that their employers are staying open because if they don’t they’re done.  Then people could quit being so stressed out about feeling their employers are just being assholes—maybe they’re in the same boat as us but on a larger scale.  You may just lose a job-but they are going to lose a business.


I think it’d just be good to know so people can make the choice of whether what their job is is worth the risk of their health.  Lots of people rely on something.

Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

To everyone that says they’re not worried or they’re not going let this virus keep them from living their lives like normal.... this is the kind of hell that you have to look forward to. 

NYC is completely overwhelmed and their hospitals and 911 system can not keep up. These responders are doing everything they can but they can’t keep up. And they’re doing this all while risking their lives to save other because no one is immune to COVID-19. 

NYC didn’t listen and now their whole world is crumbling. We have the opportunity to get ahead if things and prevent this from happening to us. Being locked down and confined to our houses won’t be fun but we have to do this if we don’t want to end up like Italy, Spain or China. This virus does not care if you are bored. 

Most people recover from this with little to no issues other than the inconvenience of not feeling well but others won’t. This virus doesn’t discriminate. Being young and healthy doesn’t mean that you won’t end up in the hospital, clinging to life, with a machine breathing for you. But that can be almost guaranteed for more fragile populations. Being stuck at home sucks but we have to do this. Not just for ourselves, but for others. 

People are making something so easy into something so hard. You could literally save someone’s life just by sitting on your ass watching TV. Being stuck at home for a few weeks is inconvenient but being inconvenienced won’t kill anyone.

The most selfless thing anyone can do right now is to quite literally do nothing at all.",NorthCarolina,NC’s Stay at Home Order... we’ve only got one chance to get this right.

Notes:

* Local hunters looking for raccoons in a wooded area near Bear Creek Road and Stewart Point Road in Hubert, North Carolina stumbled upon a skull in a wooded area.
* The majority of the women's skeleton was found 40 yards (36m) away from the skull.
* She had a slight build.
* There was a possible back and/or neck problem (fusion of C2/3, slight arching in C1). Medical examiners found that the woman had a degenerative bone disease in her neck that she might not have even known about.
* She was wearing a gray or brown crew knit sweater with gold thread.
* She was wearing blue or black stretch pants/slacks.
* She had on elastic pantyhose or “long-legged” leotard.
* She was wearing a pair of synthetic white slip-on shoes with a small bow.
* Labels from Necessary Objects Limited and 1045 Paris.
* Due to the clothes on her body and the conditions of the remains, she most likely died in the fall or winter or 1989 or 1990.
* The reason police are considering it an homicide case is because of the isolated location of where the remains were found, however, a cause of death couldn’t be determined due to a lack of detectable injuries on the skeleton.
* The case was reopened in 2020 and a new reconstruction was released. 
* Further tests are in progress in order to estimate the woman's eye and hair colors.
* Genetic genealogy is also under consideration. 
* Police are currently offering a reward of up to $2,500 for valuable information.

The  police report says that he had alcohol concentration of 0.16 BAC when  he had the accident. He doesn't even have a driver's license. I only had  liability coverage on that car so I don't want to say or report  anything about it to the insurance. But someone in the neighborhood  filed a claim against my insurance, and they want coverage for the  mailbox and the utility pole. (The wooden utility pole is fine but  another white flimsy looking pole right besides it, is bent.)

After  getting on the phone call with the insurance company to address my  concerns of not wanting to be liable for this and also to make sure my  insurance premiums don't fly through the roof, they said that if I file a  stolen report against my brother he might get arrested or if I file a  report that he didn't have my permission, then the insurance might not  have to pay for it. And he might have to go to small claims court for  this.

So my question is:

How  do I handle this the best way possible? I don't want my brother to get  into some big trouble and I don't want to be liable for this big  accident where my brother basically put me into trouble. Is there any  option like that for me?

**HOW BAD WILL THIS BE IN NC?**

There’s a new estimate of how bad this is likely to get in NC and I want to share it with you - not because I’m certain it’s completely accurate, but because it’s the best effort that’s been made public and it gives us at least a sense of what we’re in for.

[Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://preview.redd.it/rwxcwfcw19q41.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eac754b219c501066119836fd7bc29e326ddde8)

This is a chart of the expected demand for ICU beds in North Carolina and it basically says that if we keep doing what we’re doing - keep schools and non-essential businesses closed and keep our stay home order in place - then we’re going to hit peak infection in late April.

The dotted line shows that we may be on course to exceed our ICU bed capacity (which is actually a little bit higher than this chart depicts - we've got about 800 currently available). But the shaded area is essentially the margin of error for the prediction, so we’ve got a wide range between not exceeding capacity and dramatically exceeding it - which would mean a spike in the mortality rate.

What does this tell us? It tells us **we still have the time and ability** to minimize the loss of life in our state.

To be blunt: We are not going to have widespread testing. There are lots of reasons for that - none of which have to do with our state and all of which have to do with the federal response - but it’s a reality. We’re still using tests and they're very important, but we're not going to test our way out of this like South Korea did. We just didn't get enough test kits fast enough.

But - despite that major setback - it’s still possible to minimize the loss of life in our state by making sure we don’t max out the ICU beds. We just have to take social distancing very seriously for the next several weeks. In this model, OUR BEHAVIOR is the biggest variable. How seriously WE take this will ultimately determine the mortality rate.

**Quick List**

* We’ve only received 17% of the PPE that we requested from the federal government. That’s not good, and it’s why we’re sourcing from everywhere we can find and working with North Carolina manufacturers to switch production to PPE if at all possible.
* The state’s unemployment insurance website and call center are still facing a nightmarish traffic jam as they get slammed with 50x the normal traffic, but we are adding servers and contracted with an additional call center to help field calls. If you’re having serious trouble, please fill out this customer contact form: [https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form](https://des.nc.gov/customer-contact-form).
* Regarding the federal unemployment benefit that just passed, it will be administered by the state. We’re still waiting on implementation guidance from the federal Department of Labor, at which point benefits will be paid in about two weeks. Independent contractors and people who are self-employed will qualify for the federal benefit - they do not currently qualify for the state benefit. I know the state website isn’t set up to receive applications from people who are contractors or self-employed and that’s part of what we need to fix. If you fall into this category, just file the application as best you can.
* Gov. Cooper’s new executive order means no one can shut off your electricity, gas, or water for at least the next 60 days.
* The U.S. Corps of Engineers is helping us scout for places that could be used as hospital expansions.
* We've launched a hotline to help critical workers connect with child care (888-600-1685).

1918,92714089,1585842354,ftolu0,politics,"While I love the information that Jackson posts here, I see a lot of misinformation in the comment sections with people comparing him to US Senators like Burr.

Jackson is a NC State Senator who represents the 37th district (Charlotte area). 

[There are 50 State Senators in the NC Senate.](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_State_Senate) 

[There are 120 State Representatives in the NC House](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives). 

The NC House and the NC Senate are the two chambers of the NC General Assembly. These **170** people are the ones who write and vote on legislation that may or may not end up on the **Governor's desk.**

At the Federal level NC has [2 US Senators and 13 US Representatives](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_congressional_delegations_from_North_Carolina). These **15** people write and vote on legislation that may or may not end up on the **President's desk.**

Now let's have a look at the **type** of legislation that these folks vote on. Please ignore **how** they vote. Focus on the content.

[NC State Senator, Jackson](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/153729/jeff-jackson)

[NC State House Representative, Hardister](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/117825/jonathan-hardister)

[US Representative, Price](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/119/david-price)

Notice that **everything** that Jackson/Hardister vote on has a direct impact on North Carolina while the stuff that Burr/Price vote on has very little impact on NC. 

I point this out because, in my opinion, we give **way** too much attention to our representatives at the Federal level. That attention turns into campaign donations which then turn into political ads where they talk about doing ""amazing"" things for North Carolina even though legislative history shows that they do very little for our state, directly.

In conclusion, pay more attention to your representatives at the state level. There are 170 of them, they are up for election **every 2 years**, and they have a direct impact on North Carolina.

Unfortunately, it has been brought to our attention that many courses around the Carolinas Section are not adhering to local &amp; state guidelines.   ***Please follow this URGENT request and do everything you can to police this through peer review.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Police on Saturday charged eight Charlotte abortion protesters with violating North Carolina’s COVID-19-related ban on mass gatherings.  
&gt;  
&gt;About 50 protesters gathered outside A Preferred Women’s Health Center on Latrobe Drive, according to police. The center has been the scene of numerous abortion protests over the years.  
&gt;  
&gt;That size crowd violates the mass gatherings provision in the state’s [stay-at-home order,](https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO121-Stay-at-Home-Order-3.pdf) police said, so officers asked everyone to leave.  
&gt;  
&gt;“After an initial request for compliance, 12 people who were in violation refused to leave” and were cited [under state law ](https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-288.20A.html)for violation of emergency prohibitions and restrictions, according to a Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department news release.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Video posted to the Facebook page of Love Life, a Charlotte-based group that opposes abortion, shows Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police cars outside the clinic Saturday.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Thursday four people affiliated with Love Life [filed a lawsuit in federal court](https://www.thomasmoresociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FILED-COMPL-Nisley-v.-Vaughan.pdf) against the Greensboro mayor and a lieutenant with the Greensboro Police Department after they were arrested March 28 for violating the stay-at-home orders of that city and Guilford County while protesting outside an abortion clinic there.  
&gt;  
&gt;The four plaintiffs contend their arrests violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and protest at the clinic, which is one of four locations of A Woman’s Choice. The others are in Charlotte, Raleigh and Jacksonville, Fla.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Love Life members also argue their activities are considered essential under an exemption to the order allowing “outdoor activity.”**

**NEW PROJECTION FOR NC**

Five days ago I posted a projection of ICU capacity in North Carolina from a national group that used an off-the-shelf model for all 50 states. At that time, it was the best projection we had.

Today we have a [new projection](https://files.nc.gov/ncdhhs/documents/files/covid-19/NC-Covid-Brief-1-4-6-20.pdf) built specifically for North Carolina by a collaboration of researchers at UNC, Duke, and RTI. They built their projection by using a composite of three different models, each with varying assumptions of variables like hospitalization rates and transmissibility.

It projects two scenarios: 1) We maintain our current posture (stay home order extends beyond April 29, schools and non-essential business remain closed), and 2) we lift those restrictions.

https://preview.redd.it/fhgra9tzo8r41.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46d986d2bec903c91a833dc95a4424560d6441e4

In short, under our current posture there is only a 20% chance that we will exceed our ICU capacity (which is a significant benchmark because people who need ICU and don’t get it have very high fatality rates). Alternatively, if we lift those restrictions at the end of April there would be a 50% chance of exceeding our ICU capacity.

Why? Because the model projects that lifting restrictions at the end of April will take us from 250,000 cases to 750,000 cases.

So we take from this good news and bad news.

Good news: We are on track to minimize the loss of life in North Carolina.

Bad news: Absent a separate set of policies that are equally effective at reducing infection rates, lifting our current restrictions in the near-term may triple the number of North Carolinians who become infected and may overwhelm our ability to provide acute care to the most serious cases, leading to a spike in the fatality rate.

So - for the moment - we take this as a sign that what we are doing is working. The sacrifices we are making as individuals are adding up to a major reduction in loss of life.

Looking beyond this moment, it’s becoming clearer that, while we didn’t get rapid, widespread testing prior to hitting peak infection, we’re still going to need it. It looks like mass testing (+ contact tracing + isolation) may become the biggest piece of a *post-peak but pre-vaccine* strategy for social and economic re-opening.

**UNC-CHARLOTTE FIELD HOSPITAL**

Atrium and Novant hospitals anticipate as many as 3,000 COVID patients \*beyond their surge capacity\* in the next 4-6 weeks.

They are asking Mecklenburg County to ""repurpose and transform the UNC Charlotte campus as a field hospital.""

The school is clearing six dorms.

**PPE**

North Carolina has received three shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile, which means we’ve received 33% of our request. We’ve been told the stockpile is nearly depleted and not to expect any more shipments.

Our emergency management teams are working to find PPE anywhere they can. They’ve put in over $100m worth of orders so far. As you may have seen reported, it’s been made more difficult by the fact that we’re competing against other states and hospital systems.

If you have PPE to donate (if in Charlotte), contact [CLTgivePPE@gmail.com](mailto:CLTgivePPE@gmail.com).

If you have PPE to sell, contact [VendorHelp.COVID19@dhhs.nc.gov](mailto:VendorHelp.COVID19@dhhs.nc.gov).

**HEALTH CARE VOLUNTEERS**

We need clinical, clinical support, and non-clinical support to volunteer with the medical response. If possible, please contact [https://terms.ncem.org/TRS/](https://terms.ncem.org/TRS/)

**UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE**

Nearly 400,000 North Carolinians have lost their jobs in the last few weeks. DES has started paying benefits to roughly 10%. They are receiving roughly 1,000 claims per hour - 100x the normal number.

Which means - as many of you have painfully experienced - the system is totally overwhelmed.

But DES has hired 350 new people, contracted with an additional call center, and is adding server capacity. Fixing this is an immediate priority.

NOTE: 30% of the calls they are receiving are from people checking on the status of their claim or asking general questions about eligibility. If possible, please use their FAQ section for this: [https://des.nc.gov/need-help/faqs/unemployment-insurance-faqs](https://des.nc.gov/need-help/faqs/unemployment-insurance-faqs)

If you are an independent contractor or are self-employed, you currently don’t qualify for state benefits BUT you may qualify for the new federal benefit BUT you will ultimately have to apply through the state BUT the online application currently isn’t designed to accommodate you BUT you should apply anyway. We are waiting on guidance from the federal Department of Labor on how to implement this program and that will let us tailor the approach for those groups but guidance from DES is to go ahead and apply now.

**CAR INSPECTIONS**

This is coming up a lot - and also happens to apply to me (I’m due).

Right now DOT doesn’t have the authority to push back inspection dates, but they are planning on asking for that authority when the legislature returns to session this month.

**“WHY ARE LIQUOR STORES STILL OPEN?”**

It’s because we have a lot of people who are chemically dependent on alcohol and if we suddenly cut off their access they would go into withdrawal and flood the emergency rooms, which we can’t have right now. That’s why every state that’s closed non-essential businesses has made an exception for liquor stores (except Pennsylvania, and they’re reconsidering).

""Each year there are roughly 250,000 emergency department visits and 850 deaths related to alcohol withdrawal,"" George F. Koob, the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, noted in a statement to Newsweek. ""Abruptly limiting access to alcohol could lead to an increase in withdrawal among people with severe alcohol use disorder and add to the burden on the healthcare system.""

**FINAL THOUGHT**

The people who are going to be sick during peak infection in the next few weeks are \*not sick yet.\*

That means we can still minimize the loss of life, but our primary weapon for that is social distancing.

When we get past peak infection and realize that we succeeded at minimizing the loss of life, it will be clear that we accomplished something remarkable and historic on behalf of our friends, neighbors, and state.

Stay smart. Stay strong.
