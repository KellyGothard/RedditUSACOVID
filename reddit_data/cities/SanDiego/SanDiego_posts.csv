I'm in the market for a new Rav4 Hybrid, preferably in black. Every dealership around me only has 1 or none of the base LE model left and are asking $4k over MSRP and unwilling to budge. A friend suggested I go to Longo Toyota up in El Monte, somehow they got **20 in stock**. That is more than all the SD dealerships combined and are only asking $2k over MSRP!!! brooooooooasdflkh

Why?!? Why do our dealerships have such small inventories? This was ""America's the best selling car in 2019"" and the only Hybrid in its class. SO WHY DO YOU ONLY HAVE 1 IN INVENTORY? I honestly think they are intentionally keeping the inventory low to justify charging $4k over MSRP, which is shaaadyyyyyy as hellll. Anyways that's why I'm making a 5 hour round trip this weekend. At least I'll be saving $2k and getting a color I actually want.

So I bought a round trip ticket out of TJ on the Volaris website.  I also bought the discounted (roundtrip?) CBX ticket ($32) through  Volaris at the same time I bought my airline ticket.  Today I received an email from CBX with a Q-coded attachment / ticket for crossing (only) from Mexico to US on my return date from Mexico.  I was expecting a round trip CBX ticket.  
Question:  What is the regular cost of a round trip CBX ticket.  $40 ??
If my ticket appears to only be for one way (north) I'm guessing something went wrong when Volaris transmitted my purchase to CBX?

We knew going into it that she has some pretty bad anxiety issues and was VERY scared of certain loud noises and not very well socialized with people.  Shes been showing a lot of improvement already but when we walk her at night when its quiet she does these little mini sprints and you can tell she just wants to take off and do some warp speed laps, bums me out that she hasn't been able to so far.  We've been to 3 dog parks, balboa included, and shell get some running in but she always stops shortly after starting because of either the people around. the dogs, or her general unease.

I'm organizing a new event meant to teach people how to play Dungeons and Dragons.

The event consists of learning the game basics, character creation, world setting, figurine painting and everything else you need to get started playing.

Not only intended to teach you how to play the game but also to help you find your own regular group to join and start your adventure with.

What is Zero Session? It's the first time you and your group meet up in order to get to know one another, understand the game setting and how your particular DM likes to run his game. Its a great way to test the waters when starting a group.

So if you've wanted to start playing Dungeons and Dragons or have wanted to find a group of your own to join then this event is catered for you!

The event is free. However please support the venue by sampling some of their amazing beer and delicious menu selections.

We also collect school supplies for our local under funded classrooms. If you are able to make a donation of new or unused school supplies we would really appreciate any and all donations.

We look forward to meeting you all and getting you started on your adventures!

Relatively new to San Diego and haven’t found a doctor here yet for my adderall prescription. I’ve had a prescription in another state for years but since moving here, haven’t been able to find a doctor that will write a prescription for adderall - as it seems to be against the personal beliefs of many doctors. I was diagnosed with ADHD forever ago and my medical records show it, yet the last two psychiatrists I’ve seen have not wanted to write a prescription I’m familiar with and want to talk to me about meditation and other holistic approaches instead. I am currently working full time while getting my masters degree at night, so I can not afford to try new approaches and have my grades suffer at the moment. I would really like to find an in state doctor to continue what my now out of state doctor recommended (and one that I know works for me).

It'll only be the two of us and we won't be in a large group with strollers and backpacks etc. However, we both can't stand large/hectic/loud crowds. We checked IsItPacked.com:

https://www.isitpacked.com/crowd-calendars/san-diego-zoo/

And it seems like February 15-16 are a ""Yup, it's packed"". However, this is still a level under the ""Forget about it"" crowded level, which holidays like New Years was marked as.

Would San Diego Zoo still be enjoyable? We're looking for an experience where we would only have to wait a few minutes at most to get to the very front of an animal exhibit, no loud crowds gathering around the animals and spooking them, no people pushing/shoving each other, no people breathing down your neck, etc. Ideally, we could just pop in to an exhibit and immediately be able to see the animals without much people standing in the way. 

From Googling it a bit, it seems like San Diego Zoo is big enough that even large crowds will be dispersed across the entire zoo. But those were a few years ago and we don't want another vacation ruined by ridiculous crowds... We were even thinking about using a day's worth of paid time off just to visit one day earlier (Feb 14) where it's a ""Ghost Town"" rating. Would this be worth it?

Also there’s all these military subcontractors R&amp;D and all sorts of other stuff here (top gun/ Miramar) locally that IF there was ever someone with the bright idea of a nuclear war -  were all toast.

I'm organizing a new event meant to teach people how to play Dungeons and Dragons.

The event consists of learning the game basics, character creation, world setting, figurine painting and everything else you need to get started playing.

Not only intended to teach you how to play the game but also to help you find your own regular group to join and start your adventure with.

What is Zero Session? It's the first time you and your group meet up in order to get to know one another, understand the game setting and how your particular DM likes to run his game. Its a great way to test the waters when starting a group.

So if you've wanted to start playing Dungeons and Dragons or have wanted to find a group of your own to join then this event is catered for you!

The event is free. However please support the venue by sampling some of their amazing beer and delicious menu selections.

We also collect school supplies for our local under funded classrooms. If you are able to make a donation of new or unused school supplies we would really appreciate any and all donations.

We look forward to meeting you all and getting you started on your adventures!

I moved to Orange County last March and have been commuting to Carlsbad daily. As you can imagine, the hour drive isn't ideal and I am looking to move closer to work.

I currently have a really strong network in OC and made some great friends, which is why I have been delaying the opportunity to move closer to work because I feel the Carlsbad area is a way more suburban, family-centered location.

I have been tossing around the idea of moving to Encinitas because I have heard decent things about living there as a mid 20s male, so I wanted to ask how the local scene was, nightlife, etc. and if this could be a good fit?

I'm open to any suggestions really! I'd honestly love to be close to San Diego and experience that city since I have never been, but I understand the commute would probably be brutal from La Jolla or anywhere in the area. Thanks in advance!",sandiego,Mid 20s male looking to move closer to Carlsbad

590,sik_dik,1578959002,eoclmk,Nan," 

Just wanted to share for any fellow Bolt-driving San Diegans who have considered taking it up to Big Bear for a ski/snowboard trip and wanted to know what to expect.

**The Quick**  
Total round trip: 290 miles (without driving around town up top)  
Avg mi/kwh: 3.5  
DCFC stops: 3 (2 up, 1 down)  
Charging cost: $27.85

**The Long**  
I left with 100% charge from my home EVSE in 92105 at 8pm on Thursday. 60kw @ $0.09kWh costs $5.60 on my EV TOU plan with SDGE. I hit no traffic on the way up. I used ABRP to plan the trip and and arrive with 50% charge, as I wasn't sure what overhead would be lost by staying in the cold temperature, which actually turned out to be unnoticeable. So, there was definitely some overkill in charging on the way up.

On the drive up, I was keeping the cruise control at 72mph, given 75 is where efficiency starts to drop significantly and I figured I'd just save a little bit extra. I also did not run the heater at all, except for long enough to defog the windshield a half dozen or so times, maybe a minute at a time.

I made my first DCFC at the Electrify America station next to Sam's Club in Murrieta. Super close to the 15/215 split. So it was a minimal diversion of driving. I arrived at 65% battery and left at 80%. It cost $6.25 and took 21 minutes of charging. I was there, however, almost 40 minutes, from fiddling with the non-functioning chargers before realizing I wasn't just making a mistake and the chargers were having issues. I called in and they rebooted the system, which also took time. Once charging, I was pulling about 35kw, and I was taking that opportunity to run the heater in the car and warm up a bit.

I continued back on the 215 and had my next ABRP scheduled DCFC at the EVGo station at Walmart in Highland, which is very close to the 330 and is the very last exit for civilization before making the climb. At that point, my efficiency was 3.2 mi/kWh. Both stalls were taken(they really should add more stalls if they can. it's the ideal charging point for going up and coming down). So, that cost me some time. I decided to just run in the store and pick up a couple things I'd already planned on getting. By the time I came out about 15 minutes later, both stalls were open. The charge took me from 51% to 81% for $10 and took just shy of 40 minutes. I was pulling about 42kw at first, but it slowed down soon and was running at about 35kw for most of it. I again took the opportunity to defrost my toes while plugged in. That stop ran me about an hour.

When I got back on the 330 to begin the climb, the predict-o-meter was showing me 164 miles @ 3.2mi/kWh. I took it easy on the drive up as there was no traffic. I doubt I broke the speed limit, and in most cases I was just driving comfortably for the turns, and not blasting the accelerator when on straight-aways. The drive up was about 37 miles, and by the end, the predict-o-meter was at 91 miles. At this point the efficiency was showing 2.8mi/kWh. There was no loss in expected range from the vehicle sitting in the cold overnight.

The next day, I made the final mile and a half drive to Snow Summit from my hotel (Black Forest Lodge) and spent the day on the mountain. I did manage toward the end of the day to pull my car into the paid parking lot(for free) and plug into a standard 110v outlet on a light pole right at the beginning of the last row of parking. For the few hours I was plugged in, I gained 6 miles, bringing it from 90 expected to 96.

The drive down seemed to cost me no battery and may even have added a few percent. The prediction range by the bottom had added a little over 30 miles(forgot to snag a picture of it for records) and the efficiency was 3.8mi/kWh. That leveled out relatively quickly to 3.5 as I continued on level ground. The predicted mileage was fluctuating a lot on the drive back due to the elevation gains and losses on the 215/15, and my expected range was pretty much going to coast me into the driveway. I toyed with the idea for awhile of thinking I'd just barely squeak in, but decided I'd better stop and just give myself a little security. So, I stopped in Escondido, for the EVGo DCFC at Von's on El Norte Pkwy and Centre City Pkwy. I just did a minimal charge there, because, as I said, I thought I might even have had enough to make it home. I charged it by 12%, running the heater, which cost me $6 and about 10 minutes, about a 15 minute diversion due to its distance from the 15 and having to hunt down the charging station.

**Takeaways**  
I could have gotten away with a single, long DCFC at Highland and skipped the Murrieta stop on the way up and charged to maybe just 60%. That would've required the last DCFC on the way down also be a longer charge, but as we all know, the lower the battery percentage when charging, the faster it charges, meaning it would've been better time management to make just the Highland stop on the way up.

I'm not a fan of driving without heat. Even though I was in layers, wearing gloves, had the steering wheel and seat heater going, my fingers and toes freezing absolutely made the trip less enjoyable, and I tried a couple of times to see what it would cost me in range. I could have gotten away with it, given the two stops on the way up, but the time it was taking to charge was a definite downer and still wouldn't be something I'd want to deal with on future trips.

I actually thought the car handled that twisty-turny highway very well, especially on the way down. I was comfortable the whole way, and I wasn't taking it easy on the turns on the way down.

For the total charge price of $27.85, and given that my ICE can do the whole trip on a single tank (\~12.5 gallons), I'd rather just pay the extra $20 to shave off the extra hour and a half I had to divert for charging and to have climate control the whole trip.

But all that said, if the Bolt is your only option for making it up from San Diego to Big Bear, it's totally doable. I just don't like to be cold and have the trip take any longer than it absolutely has to.",sandiego,Bolt EV from 92105 to Big Bear(Snow Summit) and back

If you had a chance to check out my last event where I taught how to play Dungeons and Dragons, build characters, establish backstory and even played a few turns to start getting the hang of the game!

I had a lot of fun teaching the class but if you were there you know there was a lot going on for just one DM to manage.

So to make things a little easier for myself and to give everyone a chance to experience the game on a smaller scale I came up with the idea of The Roving DM.

If you have been trying to meet a group or have a group that you need a DM for and haven't had much luck searching, or maybe you are a new player and want to join a short campaign and meet some new players and start rolling some dice then this may be for you.

How it Works: 

I post an Eventbrite link, [LIKE THIS.]https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-roving-dm-tickets-89681869887) 

Then you follow that link and reserve your FREE ticket.

You'll notice there are only 10 tickets available, that's because I want to keep the group fairly small in order to give all players the chance to roll dice and get in the game.

Still need more details? Okay.

This event is essentially a Zero Session made up of whoever reserves a ticket for that particular game. We will have an hour at the start for introductions and to character creation and then the game will start.

If you like the players you meet you can then choose to start your own group OR you can go to the next event and meet some new players.

All levels of experience welcome!

What's the catch? 

No catch, per se. However the reason i am able to offer this event for free is because our hosts don't charge a venue or table fee so please be sure to support them by sampling their awesome drinks.

Also, IF you are able to make a donation of new or unused school supplies for our local underfunded classrooms they would really appreciate it!

Well, that's it. If you have any questions or need clarification on what exactly the event is comment or drop me a DM and I'll be more than happy to answer your questions. 

Stay up!",sandiego,For fans of Dungeons and Dragons and table-top RPGs. I'd like to introduce myself as The Roving DM. Details inside!

HI, I am a student in one of the students attending in the area of the San Diego School District.

**tldr; In order to prevent traffic jams and allow students to have sports practice, I have created a petition with over 500 students.**

[https://www.change.org/p/students-san-diego-school-district-late-start-policy](https://www.change.org/p/students-san-diego-school-district-late-start-policy)

California bill states that in the beginning of year 2022-2023, there will be a schedule change, to enforce all students are out of school around 4'o clock.

John Lee Evans, the director of district A, within San Diego School District, is the sole person who is pushing for the schedule change starting ONE YEAR earlier, from 2021-2022. According to my principal, 70% of other directors are against the starting the schedule change one year early.

However, the San Diego School District has decided to enforce our own law or policy, to start the schedule change one year early despite the disagreements.

The California bill is based on a study by a number scientists who are extremely credible. Evans also holds a masters in psychology, thus showing his credibility to enforce the bill one year earlier. YES, the science is correct that it may improve our studies and test scores.

YET, getting out at four will make traffic extremely bad, as traffic begins around three currently. At four, we would have worse traffic jams. Spring sports are also affected, as sun goes down around at 5, and even with an athletic 6th period, we would struggle to get an actual practice in, with the beginning of the 3'o clock traffic.

In order to prevent traffic jams and allow students to have sports practice, I have created a petition signed by over 500 students.

Thank you so much for reading! Please support if you are interested :) sign and share thank you \^\_\^

In my provider’s electronic medical record system, pharmacy was listed as open until 9. 

When I got there at 8:15, pharmacy had already closed (new hours) and (still don’t understand how this works) apparently I couldn’t pick up the prescription at another CVS as it wasn’t put on hold or something like that. My urgent care closed at 8. I couldn’t contact any providers by phone to reroute my prescription, which is what CVS said was the only thing I could do outside of going to another urgent care (most of which closed at 8:00 PM). So by the time CVS opens today I’ll have missed the 48 hour window for tamiflu’s efficacy in reducing symptoms. 

Tamiflu’s no wonder drug and sometimes it’s disputed whether healthy people even need it when they get the flu, but a situation like this would really suck for any kind of more urgent treatment. With a wedding coming up this weekend I was willing to take the risk of the side effect profile. 

The CVS on La Jolla Village drive is no longer 24 hours. They close at 10.

I don't know if you are aware, but Black women are 3 times more likely to die in childbirth in the hospital system than any other marginalized group in this country.  It was this small statement that started me on a path that has brought me joy and contentment and given me the ability to make a visible change in the lives of birthing people in my community.

Studies have shown that people feel more confident in their pregnancies when they are offered culturally competent care. Even better outcomes are possible when that culturally competent care is provided by someone who looks like them. So, when I was thinking about going to midwifery school, I took a look around to figure out where I could do the most good.

San Diego county, where I practice, only has one Black-owned birth center. There are also only 4 Black midwives. It was imperative to finish my education and become a midwife. A very dear friend of mine, who was a seasoned midwife, said to me,""Your perspective and your approach are necessary. You NEED to finish and become a midwife."" She believed in me so much that she volunteered herself and her time and expertise to help me with caring for my children, debriefing with me about births I'd been to and holding me while I cried from exhaustion, frustration and fear.

I am a Black woman.  I am a mother of two mixed race girls.  I am a Licensed Midwife in the state of California.  I have created a GoFundMe in order to help me raise capital to open my own freestanding birth center to help not only Black women and marginalized families, but ALL families.

[gf.me/u/xam6nm](https://gf.me/u/xam6nm)

My plan for my birth center is to support families of all stripes:

*Fathers:* support groups and newborn care classes for fathers, whom I feel can get pushed aside or deprioritized during childbirth preparation. So, I'm putting together gatherings in places for fathers where they will feel less emasculated, like barber shops and classes populated only with other first time fathers.

*Young people:* sex positive and realistic instruction on sex, gender and physical relationships. Not just ""Boys to this room and Girls to this room"" and ""Put a condom on a banana""  or ""DON'T GET PREGNANT."" Also, young women need to know that they have options when it comes to their reproductive health care.  They can choose to see a midwife for their STI testing, Pap testing and pregnancy and STI prevention education.

*LGBTQIA2+ folks:* Midwives in California are well positioned to perform IUIs and ICIs at home to support family building by our LGBTQ bretheren and sisteren. If a transgender man decides to become pregnant, a midwife would be uniquely positioned to provide inclusive, sensitive prenatal care and deliver their baby safely at home or at the birth center. Trans Men usually still have their cervix and uterus, those body parts do still need care and a midwife can provide that care, in home, in that person's safe space. I am currently helping to host a panel discussion on Trans Fertility with Trystan Reese, as well as hosting a teaching event about Trans Inclusion and Inclusive Language usage in practice.

*Black women:* Giving care to Black women and women of color is a particular joy for me.  It is important that Black families and families of color have an option to have their reproductive health care concerns and needs addressed by someone that looks like them and is culturally competent, and sensitive in their treatment. I am currently working with a charitable foundation to provide midwifery care to Haitian refugee mothers and Somali immigrant mothers.  Giving them one-on-one information about birth in the United States, how things are handled in hospitals and doing it with translators that *actually speak* Haitian Creole or Somali. (It boggles the mind how hospitals here in San Diego will give these families healthcare information in Spanish instead of Haitian Creole when they are able to communicate that they don't speak Spanish.)

One of the challenges California faces is that we have more hard-to-count communities than any other state. That's where you come in!
The Census Bureau is hiring people who look and sound like those in our hard-to-count communities to ensure that no one is missed.

If you'd like to make a difference in your community, while earning some extra income, this is a great opportunity for you. The pay varies between positions, but starts at $17 an hour. Paid training, flexible schedules, and temporary roles also are available.

We came because we might end up moving to SD, as my fiancée has a strong change to match with UC San Diego Health to become an anesthesiology resident. She had her interview and we decided to stay longer to vacation and explore the city. 

We loved it! 

I rented a car and drive us basically everywhere it seemed. Gaslamp, La Jolla, University Heights, Hillcrest, PB, downtown, Encinitas. Driving in SD was simple. Traffic wasn’t as bad as I thought it might be. The drivers aren’t as aggressive as I’m used to (Philadelphia for comparison). 

The food is wonderful. We love Mexican dishes which is something that lacks by us. Had tons of good Mexican. Also, ate at some of the places I saw mentioned online and here - Snooze, The cottage, galaxy taco, Tower 23, had a drink at Born and Raised, ate at Animae and Juniper and Ivy. Bahn Thai. Stopped by modern times. Happy hour at mister As. 

The PB boardwalk was entertaining and a fun walk. La Jolla cove was super cool. Lots of beautiful coastal views. 

The Zoo was neat with how it’s built. Glad we did it but definitely would do the safari park next time if we have a chance. 

And the weather was great, despite locals saying we came during me bad weather. In comparison, while it was 60 and slightly drizzling in SD, our hometown was around 20 and getting three inches of snow. Tonight is expected to be in the teens. 

There really isn’t a “point” to this post other than to thank San Diego and this sub. This subreddit help put together the plan for the trip. The locals we came across were nice. Service was superb. And my fiancée loved her interview.

I don't intend to be outdoors very often during the trip, nor do I intend to use this coat again in the near future. So I'm looking for something relatively inexpensive.

I just looked at reviews for Burlington Coat Factory and saw some comments about how few coats they actually stock these days. Guess that's why they now call themselves just Burlington.

My second thought is Kohl's, but I haven't been inside one for over a decade so I'm not all that familiar.

Definitely buy your bridge pass in advance directly from the CBX website.  I think Aeromexico, Volaris, and VivaAerobus all offer ""deals"" but they are actually $4 more round trip than going straight to CBX.  Also, when you buy from the airline, you aren't issued the CBX pass with your ticket, you need to pick it up at special desk on the US or Mexican side, which adds yet another queue.

If traveling on a Friday, leave lots of time to get into Mexico.  Parking was full in premium and Lot 1, which added a long walk to the building.  While you can fill out a Mexican immigration card in advance, you can do it at the CBX building, but there's a line for that too.  Once on the bridge, we waited about 55 min to get through Mexican immigration due to the large number of passengers and only three immigration officers.  There was also a massive line after immigration to drop checked bags.  Even though we weren't checking bags, we were forced into the same line.  Luckily, we were flying Aeromexico, and their line was significantly shorter.  However, they were really stringent in enforcing the 10kg rule for carry-ons and insisted that we check them.  I estimate that we needed 75 min from parking to arriving at our departure gate.

Upon return to the US, the experience was smooth (minus trying to figure out where to pick up our tickets purchased through the airline).  From gate arrival to turning on our car was 35 minutes (includes a pit stop at the TIJ bathroom).

I'm not sure if the outbound experience was mixed because it was Friday before MLK Jr Day, but regardless, it wasn't smooth.  I travel a ton, and this seemed to have lots of friction.  I'll use CBX again, but happy I have a better understanding of how it works.",sandiego,PSA for those using CBX

Story 1: Guy selling a quite nice digital camera for a crazy good price, even sent me all the serial numbers so I could confirm it was not a secondhand product or anything. I was in downtown gaslamp at the time and he was all the way up in Vista. Was a long shot but asked if he would meet me halfway if I guaranteed purchase. He kindly agreed and met me in Miramar at a brewery. Didn't picture the guy who showed up to be about 80 years old, but there he was! I asked him why he was selling the camera for such a good price (thinking it was too good to be true) and he told me that he is officially losing his eyesight and could no longer use the camera, he loves photography so much all he wishes was that it went to go to a good home and to someone who would appreciate and take good care of it. I almost teared up a little. We sat and chatted for a while and showed each other some travel and landscape photography photos we have taken. He was just an all around great guy and I promise your camera will live on buddy.  


Story 2: When I was going to College I was living in Pacific Beach (what else is new) and posted a ""roommate needed"" ad. First response seems like a pretty chill guy and invite him to come see the place and get to know each other. Kind of just tosses out there that he works in music and studio recording, we mostly end up changing the topic and shooting the shit about where we grew up and school and such. Give him the green light to be roomies, all seems good. Turns out He is plays instruments for of two of the more popular tribute/cover bands here in San Diego and  professionally records hundreds of other bands around town. Almost every other day he has a gig or a concert he is recording and puts me and any of my friends on the guest list to come watch. We would get back to the house and he was so talented you could say just about any song (kind of like those dueling piano guys) and he would rock out and we would drink and invite friends over to listen and it was just all around the most fun situation ever when you are young and in college in San Diego.

I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering and got offered a job in San Diego. The starting salary is 73,500$. I've been looking around for apartments around the area shown in the screenshot. I am 22 years old, (so I will not need to purchase company insurance since I am under my mother's insurance), and have no debt. I've made a list of apartments that are potentials and the rent seems to average around 1,800-1,900$/month. I will be given a work vehicle along with a company gas card. Also, these apartments include washer/dryer in unit, utilities covered except for electricity. I have selected these potential apartments because they look well maintained, and in decent areas. I have lived my entire life in a not so decent area in my hometown and honestly am looking for a nicer area, thus the price point.

Is this do-able for me on this salary? 

Note: I am set on living alone, so I am excluding the idea of having room mates to split rent.

Any input is helpful. Thank you.",sandiego,"Moving to San Diego, Can I afford rent?"

1058,A_guy_named_Vic,1579878809,etbo6o,Nan,"Hi guys!

If you had a chance to check out my last event where I taught how to play Dungeons and Dragons, build characters, establish backstory and even played a few turns to start getting the hang of the game!

I had a lot of fun teaching the class but if you were there you know there was a lot going on for just one DM to manage.

So to make things a little easier for myself and to give everyone a chance to experience the game on a smaller scale I came up with the idea of The Roving DM.

If you have been trying to meet a group or have a group that you need a DM for and haven't had much luck searching, or maybe you are a new player and want to join a short campaign and meet some new players and start rolling some dice then this may be for you.

How it Works: 

I post an Eventbrite link, [LIKE THIS.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-roving-dm-tickets-89681869887) 

Then you follow that link and reserve your FREE ticket.

You'll notice there are only 10 tickets available, that's because I want to keep the group fairly small in order to give all players the chance to roll dice and get in the game.

Still need more details? Okay.

This event is essentially a Zero Session made up of whoever reserves a ticket for that particular game. We will have an hour at the start for introductions and to character creation and then the game will start.

If you like the players you meet you can then choose to start your own group OR you can go to the next event and meet some new players.

All levels of experience welcome!

What's the catch? 

No catch, per se. However the reason i am able to offer this event for free is because our hosts don't charge a venue or table fee so please be sure to support them by sampling their awesome drinks.

Also, IF you are able to make a donation of new or unused school supplies for our local underfunded classrooms they would really appreciate it!

Well, that's it. If you have any questions or need clarification on what exactly the event is comment or drop me a DM and I'll be more than happy to answer your questions. 

Stay up!",sandiego,5 spots left for The Roving DM! If you've wanted to play or learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons this is the event for you! This Saturday in Miramar!

1110,ccelik,1579991809,etxu82,Nan,"Hi guys,

My name is Chara and I'm a professional content creator from San Diego. I've been producing content for my clients from various industries for over 5 years now. I specialize in videography, photography, copywriting and drone cinematography. I also made a large network of talented creative professionals from around the globe in my 10 years of digital marketing experience.

Today I'm going to introduce Content Boxes and explain what it is, and also provide a document with a sample package offer for San Diego local businesses. *(limited availability)*

**Content Boxes** is a monthly content production package. I study your brands' online presence and provide tailored consultation about content marketing strategy. I also provide monthly content production on a pre-determined date each month. *The idea is to form a healthy win/win relationship between your business and me (and my creative team). We will do this by providing you worry-free, high quality, fresh content for your business each month.*

Please refer to the example package document below where I will provide $1000+ worth of professional content services for only $400/month and there are absolutely no commitments. So if you don't like what you receive the first month you have complete freedom to cancel your content boxes service (and we will work harder to hopefully one day gain you back). Otherwise, we will call you on a pre-defined date each month for your consulting session and set the schedule for the production of the month. 🎬

A few magical moments later, just like that, you will receive a bunch of professional content, prepared by creative professionals with tons of marketing experience.

*If you are a San Diego local business who can afford to risk $400 to see if our content services will work for you, please reach out to me.*

So my work has had me traveling about a bit but I finally have a moment where I'll be stationary for a few weeks.

I hope everyone is doing well and that your week is off to an awesome start!

Sorry, If your week has been less than excellent so far I truly hope things improve our that your circumstances become more bearable (pm me if you need to chat, vent, unload) 

It's Taco Tuesday!  Be sure to check out some of your favorite spots for any specials! I know Redwing has $1 shredded beef tacos as well as $1.50 fish tacos both are delicious. Oscars in Hillcrest also has taco deals and amazing surf and turf tacos. Don't forget about Lucha Libres tasty taboo deals as well. 

You can catch me at Redwings later today getting in on some tacos. I'll be the large Mexican guy eating 15 tacos.

Guys, I know the week had just started and Friday feels like a lifetime away but just keep your nose to the grind with steely determination and you'll get to that awesome weekend!

If it's already your weekend and you're at home chilling them keep doing you, drink a brew and have a puff  for those at work.

It's great to be back in San Diego for a few days and I'm looking forward to chilling with the SD crowd for a while.

Here's wishing you an awesome Tuesday and an awesome week. 

Stay up!",sandiego,It's good to be back for a while! Hello again to my home and homies!

I smoke cannabis daily to ease my anxiety, pain, nausea, stress, and other various problems. My current insurance plan's providers all start citing company policy about federal stances as soon as I mention using CBD, much less THC. Therapy, Doctors, Pain Specialists, and so forth. Over a dozen different professionals who waste my limited time with them telling me what I've heard so many times before. And then some of them (therapy) telling me we're out of time after their ten minute blurb. Not to mention the literal changes in tones of voice and expressions. Like they suddenly think I'm an addict seeking hard drugs. I absolutely don't want pills. I want solutions. A single hit works faster and better than my current meds, which I hate taking multiple times a day. Other than that, I feel like if I can be honest and open about my lifestyle without retaliation (even if only in the form of wasted time) I can get better overall care. 

My doctor genuinely seems more concerned about my consumption than the state of my body. I've had my feet x-rayed because of my painfully overlapping, visibly bent, toes and she says they look normal. I've had two different chiropractors outside of my insurance provider x-ray my back and I've seen the abnormities with my own eyes, yet she says the shape of my spine is normal. The list goes on. She's just typically dismissive, and in general I've had bad enough experiences with other professionals in the brand to not expect better results just changing doctors withing the same plan.",sandiego,Changing healthcare providers soon.

1264,FoldingCheese34,1580319418,evq3kz,Nan,"I've been living here for about 2 years. It's been great and I've had a ton of great memories. But one thing that has always stood out to me is the social scene.

1. People want friends, but don't want to put in the effort. I hear it all the time, people complaining about how hard it is to find friends and keep them. But when I see how they behave socially, it's no surprise. They all don't want to seem like they want friends. They dont initiate conversations, try to connect with people, or any of that. They don't invite people to things, then get mad when those people do something without them. They don't try to plan anything and expect others to do the work. They dont have many or any hobbies to connect with people over. They can be unreliable constantly cancelling at the last minute or just not showing up. And this isn't just towards me, but me hearing about it in the tiresome gossip.

2. People in general don't do much. Id say 90% of the people Ive met stay within a 10 mile radius of their home, only going out to things (usually the same 3 bars) in that area. SD is full of amazing stuff that you're paying for with this CoL, why stay in one area?

3. There seems to be a huge lack of women in this social scene. I'd say every women I've met has complained about lack of women friends. Now the only women theyre friends with are ones I introduced to them. Even ones who have lived here their entire lives. Most social groups I've been in are mainly dudes. I've been to meetups with 90 dudes and 8 women and that ratio isn't uncommon in that app. I've met meetup leaders who create fake hot girl profiles to get people to shoe up (this isn't unique to SD cause I've lived in other smaller cities that do the same). I've been in coed sports leagues and its about 4 women and 7 dudes. My coworkers wives all complain about the same thing. It had also created a situation where so many dudes I've met are desparate as hell to get a gf. Which I imagine scares off more women than not. And of course if I try to make friends with a guy, first thing he wants me to do is set him up with one of my friends. 

I love SD But this is one of the main reasons I've thought about moving. I know a few people who moved out if state and say its way better on other cities. Maybe it's a grass is greener type of thing, but only one way to find out.",sandiego,The social scene here is a bit strange

Call it superstition or sentiment but I like my dice to have good juju. Being able to hand pick individual dice and build my own personal set is ideal instead of buying whole sets that have dice I likely won't use.

If you're like me and like to use dice with a bit of backstory then this event might be for you.

If you are looking to trade, exchange or just get rid of some old dice and want them to go to a good home with a player who will appreciate them then this is where to meet.

I encourage everyone who attends to bring your collection and show off your favorite pieces,  hang out, socialize, share Nat20 and CritFail stories all while enjoying some cold brews and food truck fare! 

The event is FREE, just be sure to rsvp so we can tell the venue how many people they can expect.

Our goal is to get as much in as possible while scoping out potential neighborhoods to target from a distance. Right now we are focused on University Heights, Normal Heights, North/South Park, or MAYBE something up closer to the beach if we aren't feeling these neighborhoods. 

Here is my plan: 

Friday - Land in Long Beach airport at 1130am, pickup car rental and head to SD. Stop at Encinitas along the way for some light lunch (any recs?)  Check in at the hotel. Drive to La Jolla cove at sunset, head to the comedy store at La Jolla to see a show. Get a California burrito at the Taco Stand afterward. 

Saturday - Wake up early, walk/drive all of the above-mentioned neighborhoods. Coffee in North Park (any recs?) Walk around Balboa Park for awhile. Yoga class at 230pm. Sunset Cliffs/Ocean Beach for the sunset (should we do the sunset cliffs with a joint or Wonderland Bar at Ocean Beach?) Back to South Park for dinner at Buona Forchetta, night out downtown starting at Coin-Op and seeing where the night takes us. 

Sunday - Morning coffee at Bird Rock and walking around Pacific Beach before leaving at noon to head back to the airport. 

Sorry, I know these kinds of posts are annoying. Any feedback is helpful.",sandiego,"Headed to SD this weekend to scope out neighborhoods and get the ""vibe"" of the city for a potential move this summer"

I, of course, don't want to step on anyone toes here in SD (or roll on them) so I looked up the local laws for inline skating and SKATEBOARDING. I found the rules in San Diego municipal code chapter 8 Article 4 section 12. 

A summary is listed in this blog post:
http://blog.muirskate.com/2016/07/skateboarding-regulations-in-san-diego.html?m=1


My main question is for 84.12a. What does it mean by business district? I have not found a clearly defined answer anywhere. Is that all of downtown? Is that all of Sorrento Valley? Is it just the areas that are Industrial? Is it anywhere that there is a business of any kind?

I really look forward to everyone's responses. I want to do my best to not bother anyone while doing what I love.

And as my final note, I will disclaimer myself: I understand that any information I get here will only be the responder's own interpretation of the law and/or their own opinion, and that I cannot consider it proper legal advice in any way. In short, if someone here tells me an area is okay, and a cop tells me it's not, I can't tell the cop ""But (u/user) on reddit told me it was fine."" 😜",sandiego,What is considered a business district in San Diego?

Moved to California from New York and waited significantly longer than the 20 days allowed to register my vehicle and got just my smog test done. 

I did change my insurance to California because that was quite simple and it was much cheaper than my NY premium. 

Then due to certain circumstances I was unable to afford the actual registration. 

It has now been ANOTHER significant amount of time since getting that smog test done. 

Since I did change my insurance, NY eventually ended up suspending my license because of lapse of insurance(which I can prove didn’t happen)
So...

1.Does that smog test automatically alert the DMV of my testing and will I now be charged penalties for not registering quick enough?

2. Will my NY license suspension prevent me from getting CA license?

3. I’m sure it’s frowned up but can I go to one of the Registration Services places and pay for registration and put a date within the last 20 day’s to avoid penalties?? Or is it too far gone for that?

First, all of our friends live in the more urban areas rather than suburban. We live in Hillcrest and friends live in downtown/Little Italy, North Park, Normal Heights, University Heights and Mission Valley. I don't know anyone who lives in the more suburban areas.

For us, it's basically a decision of do we get a condo in a ""cool"" area like where we live now or get a SFH somewhere north like Clairemont, Clairemont Mesa, Linda Vista, etc.

Second, we don't have kids and won't have kids. I know a lot of people pay a premium to live in a good school district, and I know it's good for the long term value of the property, but we don't care. So, if there's a neighborhood that works for us that has a meh school district, fine with us.

Third, commutes. I currently work in UTC. I don't plan on staying much longer, and when I look at postings I feel like jobs tend to be north (La Jolla, UTC, Del Mar) rather than south (downtown). But, it's a big question mark. Is my perception incorrect? I'm thinking big public and private companies. My wife's job is a way more up in the air so who knows.

We make good money (approx. ~$300k), though with my soon-to-be job change our income is definitely going down, so we're looking at places that are more modest than you may expect - probably in the $600-700k range.

Thats right, we made it to the weekend! For a majority of people that means you're getting the next few days to rest up, chill, and spend time doing your thing. Enjoy it! Make the best of it and rediscover how awesome this city is.

Whether it's staying at home and taking in the day while doing nothing or staying busy and active all over the city.

If you're like me and your work week starts today then you get to enjoy the benefit of less traffic both going to and coming from work, smaller lines at the store, and in general less intensity caused by the rush of weekdays.

Guys, let's take a moment to acknowledge mental health.

If you are struggling or feel alone or just need someone to listen to you vent or simply to just listen please either reach out to myself or to a local crisis center like Up2Us (888) 724-7240 for help. There is no weakness in asking for help getting back up.

Not to get too preachy but if you know someone that may need help or attention or a bit of human interaction reach out to them it can make a huge difference. Remember,  everyone feels invisible from time to time.

Before anyone asks, No I'm not in drugs,  I'm just in love with this city and after being on the road for a few days I'm ecstatic to be back home! 

Finally, guys I know we're, at most, internet strangers; however, we're also neighbors. Hell, we've probably walked past one another at some point, been in the same bar or coffee shop at the same time, suffered traffic side by side?

1389,Nomad79,1580540349,ex2cf4,Nan,"I just moved back to San Diego (Carlsbad) from Texas. Spent some of the day looking at apartments in North County. Based off my research, studios go for about 1550, one bedrooms go for about 1850 to 1900.  Two bedrooms and up, go for over 2k+.  I did see one studio going for 1100 in Oceanside, however that was a complete dump at less than 300 square feet.  I am not sure west of the five or East County.  However based on my calculations. To qualify for a studio with 2.5 rent, a person needs an income of at least 4K a month.  So here’s my question. Why are studios and one bed rooms so expensive. I can’t imagine multiple people living in a studio or one bedroom.  Is there a secret to renting an apartment without having the 2.5 times the rent ratio? I’v been living in a hotel downtown Carlsbad cheaper than renting a studio or a one bedroom. But it’s a motel ya know. Pleas clue me in.",sandiego,How can people afford the rent out here?

We get a home inspection which shows damage to said places and even a sidedoor that leads from garage to side yard. We don’t have the estimate to repair. Otherwise house is ok. but some questions

Is this a deal breaker
How common is termite damage in sd 3.i believe sellers purposefully did not prove termite inspection bc they were aware of damage. We were able to get the report from a yr ago which suggested repair at area of question but they did secondary measures and did not repair.

Hi everyone! I am an undergraduate student at UCSD and I am currently doing a research project to learn more about how San Diego residents rank the projects MTS has planned for 2020 with some other variables to see how they may play an effect on the ranks (such as age and zip code).  My survey is similar to MTS', but instead of limiting choices to an imaginary $1000 budget, I am giving people the opportunity to rank MTS' projects without that limitation. With this survey, I hope to determine how my results compare to MTS' and hopefully use that data to influence what MTS is planning for the future of San Diego.

So in order to gather data from a wider audience than just students at UCSD, I have come to r/sandiego for help.

Essentially, I am not anxious at all. At least I think I am not. But apparently I am so chronically anxious, I cannot tell that I am anxious anymore that I am creating painful and reoccurring symptoms that don’t add up to any actual diagnosable illness. My anxiety goes so far that if I try to relax, ignore or “fight” the symptoms by doing the exact opposite of what my body wants me to do, it makes my symptoms severely worse. So essentially, there feels like there’s no winning and I’m fighting something that makes no sense and is essentially invisible to myself.

The quote I always remember is that if you can’t recognize you’re crazy, you probably are crazy. And I am so far gone that my anxiety is essentially the movie Inception. I can’t even recognize my anxiety anymore because I am so used to “normal” anxiety, such as getting hot, sweaty, racing heart and blank mind, getting nervous and whatever, to now what I call “makes no fucking sense anxiety”, which includes being completely relaxed and my ears started popping and causing vertigo, intense stomach pains that radiate to my back, and muscle spasms that are so severe I cannot unclench the muscle.

Recently, they have released a track with a vibe reminiscent of a beachy, chilled out summer day; they aim to release a matching music video in the coming months. 


Here’s the track:

As I am from California myself, I am volunteering to ask around to see if any longboarders are willing to contribute any of their GoPro recorded or similar videos of their skating adventures. All credit will be given where due for volunteers. Old and new footage alike is appreciated, we only ask that it is during a sunny day (especially during sunshine) so it matches the vibe of the song.

1762,PlatinumAero,1581271880,f1cgxt,Nan,"Hi all, great forum, been following a while. I am 30 and live on Long Island with my wife. I am originally from Upstate NY so Long Island is a culture shock as it is. We both work full time, no kids, and our student loans are paid off. I run a video and audio production company, as well as work a full-time job that is completely remote. My wife works in HR. We currently own a house here in Suffolk County NY. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not really in any rush to leave but due to the nature of my work I am weighing options on places to live long term. Her parents are here, but truthfully considering I feel like we're in a unique opportunity for our age, I'd like to be in a place with nicer weather. Plus, it's really expensive here (our property taxes are about $12k, which truthfully isn't that bad for the area). For reference, we own a 2900sq foot colonial. It's a huge house for two people. Sometimes I feel like I'd be happier in a condo, other times I love this place. San Diego is expensive, and you get a lot less land for the money, but the weather is better and the people are way nicer. But, aside from one or two friends I know, neither of us know anyone there. La Jolla was always my dream location to live...and I could realistically move there in my early 30s, which is pretty remarkable from someone who came from the suburbs of Glens Falls, NY. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just bouncing ideas off people. Obviously everyone will have their opinion. One of the big things I don't like about Long Island is that I feel like I'm a minority for being a transplant (I originally came here for work but left once my business took off). My wife is from here, which could be an issue in convincing her to leave her family...that's a typical NYC/Long Island syndrome. 

&amp;#x200B;

I completed my undergraduate degree 2 months ago in December and have been fortunate enough to begin working full time in SW Virginia where I went to school.

Moving to San Diego (really anywhere in the county), has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember. I have family in La Jolla, and my sister attended UCSD for 6 years. 

While I have begun work fulltime here in Virginia, my current work isn't exactly career related, it's close but not what I really went to school for. In the time I have been working I have been applying for jobs every other night, almost all of which are in Southern California, most of which are in San Diego. 

After 65 applications I got a bite. It is a part time internship for $14.50 at 24hours a week. The internship is 6 months, but there is a *chance*, that afterwards (budget dependent) it may be extended or a fulltime position may open. I do not know what fulltime would pay. If I worked $14.5 for 24 hours a week I would hope to supplement that with 26 hours of $12 minimum wage (if I can't find anything else better). This position is near Escondido, an hour away on paper from my family in La Jolla. My car gets 18-22mpg. I would hope to find a place in North County closer to work as soon as I can to not be a burden on my uncle and his family, but I would live there at the start. 

My second opportunity, which I am interviewing for later today, is a full time benefited position for $16/hour for 40 hours a week. It is ~20 minutes on paper from my uncle. I would still hope to possibly supplement this work with a part time minimum wage job, this one would be easier in the beginning as it is closer to my uncle, and I do not have to worry about it becoming a full time opportunity in the future as it already is one. 

This post is already longer than I hoped it to be, so I will wrap it up here. I have looked at salary calculators, I have glanced at rent in an around the area, but with seemingly so many variables I do not know how to reach a definite answer on if it's possible for me to make it on $33k-$38k. I am okay with my quality of life not increasing for another 5 years as I start my career in the area. I am okay living with roommates and only having a single room to myself like I did as an undergrad.

These decision's don't even factor in leaving my girlfriend who still has a year left in school.

Anyways thank you for reading, any and all advice is appreciated!

1) The natural pace of sports and games gives light aerobic exercise with many anaerobic bursts that is great for fitness and weight loss. 
2) I hate running for no reason.

So I hope some of you are up for joining me. We'd only need a minimum of 4 people on a regular basis to have fun but could always accommodate as many as show up. We can some competitive fun for an hour, and barely realize we're getting a workout. Using adaptations of games like old school playground games (eg. Tag, relay races, red light green light), sports (eg. ultimate, football pass and catch, touch rugby), and active versions of sedentary games (eg. hungry hungry hippos, cards, connect four).

Open to all levels of fitness but not the weirdly over-competitive. Most activities can be team-based and/or involve some element of strategy so that the most athletic people never have to hold back and those who are out of shape won't get blown out of the water. (I'm definitely in the out of shape category, with a healthy splash of old thrown in the mix)


The objective is for this to be a regular thing a few times a week in the mornings before work, but for now, I want to try a holiday to build a little interest. *Monday, Feb 17th*, President's day.

The group will meet near Morley Field- between Jacaranda dr and Joe Shloss way- east (or to the left if you're facing towards the parking lots from the road) of all of the parking and tennis courts and north of the archery range and baseball fields. We will set up either in the field next to the cement picnic area or on the grass field just south of Upas, depending on where has less traffic. I took some [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/MuIiQSI) to help get people to the right general area. Look for small cones!

For this first one, we'll meet at *10 am* or 15 minutes earlier if you'd like to stretch with the rest of the group.

If you can't make this one but would like to join the group, we'll start meeting on Monday and Wednesdays at 7:00am (15 minutes early for stretching) in the same place. If you can't make it and you'd like to be kept up to date, I have started a facebook group (that currently has no one in it) to help people keep up with goings-on.

\- How has weather been these days? Is it a rainy period?

\- Do you have any recommendation of places for hiking? Also, since the city is next to the Ocean, are there any recommendable beaches to visit?

\- Regarding shopping, is the frontier with Mexico a good place to shop? In my country, borders are generally unsafe, so I would like to know if there are any advice you would give me.

They then ask to update your credit card information over the phone. This is 100% a scam. If you call SDGE, the first thing the recording says is a warning about this scam. 
2. SDGE is going around and changing the pricing plans of some accounts without asking the customers first. I received an email today saying that my pricing plan was changed randomly. I never asked for it to be changed, nor did I go online and change it. They just went ahead and changed me to a more expensive pricing plan. Double check your emails and that your pricing plans didnt change without your knowledge. 

Just wanted to give a heads up to everyone in San Diego! Have a great weekend!

I understand inflation and rising costs and such but I recently looked up the cost of lap swimming (actual swimming for exercise, not socializing to the point of becoming a prune just to beat the summer heat) at most of the municipal pools in San Diego and I swear it'd probably just be cheaper to pay the monthly fee at 24 hour or LA fitness.

I'm on a super tight budget I'm willing to maybe spend $40 or so a month for access to a pool but honestly I'm looking for a **FREE** option. The crazy thing is that I lived in New York City for a bit and the city Parks and Rec Department actually has a program for adults to swim in the city pools for free during certain hours.... Just a side note. San Diego Native here so not disparaging the city at all.

Anyway so I went off on a tangent there a bit...

2093,Hurricanes2001,1581888003,f4xgmn,Nan,"So I’ve lived a few places, all very different. However, San Diego driving.. well.. just read.

Austin: slow, polite, overly cautious 
- people in Austin aren’t going anywhere in a real hurry, if someone’s changing lanes and you let them in you’ll get a wave. They’re not used to city driving even though it’s a city so be prepared for near head on collisions when cars are parked on both sides of the street lol

Toronto: fast, aggressive, polite
- whatever the speed limit is, drive 30% faster. When merging, don’t slow down, don’t cut people off, just make it happen. No ones ever blocking intersections and 9/10 will let you change lanes.

Miami: fast, oblivious, rule-benders
- everyones hauling it here, and every bmw or nicer is going double the rest, even the police are going 95 on the highway. Most of the time people aren’t cutting you off, they’re just oblivious to the idea of “cutting you off.” Lane splitting is illegal but all motorcycles do it, turning left on red is illegal but everyone does it, driving over the plastic cones on the express lanes is illegal but there’s traffic.



San Diego: Jesus Christ where do all the angry people go when not in their cars???
People I meet here are incredibly nice, most seem to be in a good mood. Maybe I somehow live in a bubble and am never rubbing shoulders with all of these angry people. But when I’m on the road, it’s like everyone wants to kill each other and has something to prove. 

I’ve had people purposefully drive into my lane, slam on their breaks to try to get me to rear end them, tailgate to the point where I had to pull over because I didn’t want to risk an accident. And then there’s the angry at the world ones like those who drive under the speed limit in the left lane to try to make a point, leave their high beams on after someone cuts them off to blind all of us, and road rage their way through parks like fiesta island. Hell I’ve even seen people get out of their cars to scream at each other, I’m honestly surprised I have yet to see a full blown fight. Sure this happens everywhere, but the rate of incidences in SD is insane. I’ve been here for under a year and it’s nearly a daily occurrence.

Seriously what’s the deal? The traffic here is not that bad. LA (lived there for 8 months), Toronto and even Austin have far worse traffic than here. This city is literally a playground and every single day you can drop the top and roll all the windows down. Maybe I’m crazy, maybe my experience is an anomaly, but good god someone call Tony Robbins marketing team because he’s missing out on a huge market here.",sandiego,San Diego drivers.. wow..

I am doing research for a school project where I have to compare hospitals that are in similar populous counties as the one I live in (Dallas County).

&amp;#x200B;

""Just experienced this last night in San Diego - reserved for Valentine’s Day for a party of 6 when the reservations opened in December of last year. 200 bucks to get a dome, 109 per plate. They don’t tell you once you get your reservation that you have 2 days to pay for your plates or else you lose it and most of your deposit. (ok you better be ready to drop that additional 659.94 right then and there) 859.94 up front 2 months in advance, this dinner is going to rock tho! Big name Chef promised, awesome experience with friends on lock for prime time. Show up and get told things are a little short staffed so you just have to wait for a bit to get seated in what will become your plastic prison for the evening. Nearly 900 bucks in for a big dining experience and you get the privilege of paying 8 dollars for a water - \*ok\* little gimmicky but you are already invested at this point. Want a drink while you are waiting 20 minutes after your reservation time to get seated ? Don’t worry you can have a 16 dollar excuse of a craft cocktail or a variety of beer choices that include Stella and.....no, there’s just one beer choice. It’s Stella. That’s it. One. Ok - while that seems a little off, don’t worry this food from the celebrity chef is going to rock and for that price of 143 per plate (So far, without water or a drink or a tip) you should just settle in and let the staff take care of you. You have 3 wine choices \*yawn\*, here comes another 70 bucks for a 14 dollar bottle, but you already expected that and you settle on the one Cab they have in the state filled with 3,674 wineries at last count. Things are definitely starting to feel a little weird when you are seated in your dome and are now over the 1K spent for your guests with drinks during your wait to get seated, and you find yourself sitting at a glamorous table with peeling 👏 plastic 👏 plates 👏 and cheap plastic settings and table decorations. Ok - shake that off, they must be saving money there in order to invest in the food, rejoice when some tiny pieces of bread come out with 2 tortillas included to make things international, and one tiny butter to pass around to the 6 total guests. That is gone shortly since you are an hour post your reservation at this point and finally getting food, but don’t worry, you can purchase more rolls for 6 dollars! Yippie! (Be careful here, these rolls are actually the best part of the meal. Enjoy them). Out comes your first course and it is - it is, a bean, salad? Beans and something? It low key looks like dog vomit, but since you already are over a thousand bucks, you try to ignore the fact that it actually tastes like dog vomit. At this point in time, things are starting to get suspicious. What is this amazing experience promised from all of those social media influencers? Is it - so far - absolutely terrible? Surely for this sort of skrilla, the main meal is going to be amazing ! We can overlook this other petty stuff when that awesome meal comes out and satisfies you and your loved guests, right? Well it gets to you - and it’s a little cold. In fact, it is cold. Some fishy and short rib. Both bland and dry. The easiest way to describe is a business class meal on a flight, not first class, not coach, either way one that was pre-made but wasn’t properly warmed. (PRO-TIP - REQUEST SALT AND PEPPER BEFORE BEAN VOMIT ) When we discovered our bland entree was portioned for a Bernie Sanders Voter and tasted like the cardboard that socialist now eat in Venezuela, we requested salt and pepper. This perplexed the staff, and there was a rush to find some which ultimately will arrive after you need it to season what is remaining of your cold dish. This is the point in time when the ground gets shaky, and the world in your bubble starts crashing down around you. You realize that you have just been taken advantage of and are part of an elaborate scam. You resisted your old high school friends pyramid scheme, you decided you weren’t going to join Karen’s “team selling vitamin shots”, and you laugh when someone knocks on your door to sell you insurance, and this is why you have difficulty with what just happened. Your guests look at you with a bit of pity, but also with disappointment. You silently all sit awaiting the final course, you single dessert choice which is a lone moment of happiness, not for the taste but for realization that you are about to escape the dome. This is the Fyre Festival of fine dining. It was comically horrible. You start to laugh and look around at the bubbles around you - everyone meeting each other’s gaze in agreement. Maybe there is hidden cameras and you are a part of a social experiment in a fine dining ruse made for reality TV? Will you be signing a release on the way out so your reactions can be broadcast on the food networks version of Punk’d and provided a refund? No - you will make your way past a sign stating “reserve your dome for 79.99 now, we are 75% sold out” and not want to make eye contact with your other party goers. In the end, bringing them there will have been your fault. If you reserve a dome - that will be your cross to carry when judgement comes. UBER home alone, crawl into a ball, and cry into your pillow. The dome has won.""",sandiego,Dinner With A View - (not my) review - great read!

They had a good thing going knowing just how much everyone was using and at what times so they knew exactly when to turn on[ base load power plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load) (cheap, slow) to meet the state's needs. The graph of CA's hourly energy load was a predictably smooth curve. When something unplanned happens (outage or some weird internet movement that has people using LOTS of energy only for a short time) they have a secret weapon,[ peaker plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant) (expensive, fast).

In 2013 - 2014, some people working at CAISO probably noticed that they're firing off these peaker plants all the time to meet the grid's needs. They found out that during the sunny hours of the day, there was a bunch of energy that is abruptly loaded onto the grid at sunup that ruins that sexy coke bottle shape they were going for. To get the smoothness back, they had to fire these expensive peaker plants. In 2017, CAISO reported that there was so much solar, they[ frequently had to shut down large scale solar farms](https://www.caiso.com/Documents/CurtailmentFastFacts.pdf). It's kind of poetic that by going green and installing solar on my house, I'm actually causing CA to use dirtier energy over the clean energy they were going to use.

**CAISO discovered we were generating so much energy at once that it resulted in shutting-off 20 - 30% of grid-scale solar generation and extra costs of unplanned peaker plants to providing consistent energy to the grid.**

In 2016, CAISO basically said to the world, ""*Hey guys, this solar thing is a ticking time-bomb. If we don't do something about it now, it's eventually going to cost a whole bunch, we'll be turning off a lot of pre-purchased clean energy, and people are going to spotty power every day.*""

Everyone is spending money left and right, because it was poorly predicted. Everyone--utilities, ratepayers, energy providers, shareholders. The CPUC (glorified customer service agents for the State of California for anything utility-related) read these reports and saw the potential for ton of pissed off people knocking at their door so they had to do something. God bless them. I would NOT want to be in their shoes within the last couple of years with net neutrality, PG&amp;E, and CA Fires.

They started forcing CA utilities to implement some of the ideas[ at the bottom of this report](https://www.caiso.com/Documents/CurtailmentFastFacts.pdf) to prevent an angry mob. Things like that Time-of-Use thing on your bill. Things like that stupid High Usage Charge.

In my opinion, the CPUC/SDGE/CAISO could have influenced energy habits in a more elegant way. Instead of forcing customers onto a super complicated rate without their knowledge, they all could have done these things:

1. Deliver the bad news as a different authority. Nobody's going to respect any messages coming from a monopoly, no matter how angelic they are. A different message is sent when I know you're not making a profit. That's why I think CAISO is awesome, and now you probably do too. Why didn't CAISO or CA have an Apple Watch Ad Campaign?
2. Spend more money on educational marketing about WHY we need to use less energy from 4PM to 9PM. Right now, we think SDG&amp;E and the CPUC are best friends trying to come up with ways to trick everyone into spending more money because of the fires.
3. If you're forcing people to automatically opt in to a Time of Use rate, you have to opt *everyone* in at the same time so they don't feel targeted. The 1-year same price guarantee is a requirement if you're going to pull something like that.

They are sub par in the rates department because that's not how they make money. They only change electric rates because the CPUC forces them to. The CPUC forces them to because people like me whine to them about how unfair it is.

And to answer the question of why our rates are so high… a yearly reliability report published by the[ US Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/) shows SDG&amp;E regularly ranks pretty high in fewest outages per capita.

What this should tell us is that they don't wait for things to break before fixing it. They spend money on projects that reduce the amount of outages we experience. If you’ve lived on the East Coast like me, you’ll know it’s normal to have unplanned outages lasting several days. Ever since 2007, they saw the threat of fires and [have spent tons of money on safety and reliability](https://www.tdworld.com/wildfire/article/21121297/wildfires-of-yesterday-drive-innovation-today) for things like, a fire detection system that blows all other systems out of the water, a fire assist helicopter, tons of undergrounded lines, etc. There’s [a 2018 chart from the Union Tribune at bottom of this article](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/energy-green/sd-fi-sdge-rates-20181012-story.html) that sums up just how expensive SDG&amp;E electric rates are compared to the other CA monopolies. The other utilities are decreasing their rates, while they’re increasing it. Which also means other utilities are decreasing spending for reliability/safety, while they’re increasing spending. 

**\[TL;DR\]** 

**Why do we have high rates?** Because SDG&amp;E saw fires were a huge threat to their business. So they spent a lot of money on reinforcing the grid. Yes.They can reduce our rates, but that also comes with more outages for San Diego and a higher chance of coming home to your house on fire.

Are higher rates worth it to me? Personally, yeah… I have kids. But it’s still messed up and sneaky how they’re changing the rates for some people.

**Fatality Rate**

The most important thing to understand about the fatality rate is: (1) no one will know what it is until the virus has run its course, and (2) there are different ways of measuring the fatality rate, which leads to bias.

For example, the news reports a 2 percent fatality rate. This stat is the ""-0day"" case fatality ratio. It is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths by the total number of infected (based on numbers supplied by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)). Yesterday, for example, there were 1,775 deaths and 71,902 confirmed cases according to the CCP numbers. (1,775/71,902 = 2.47%).

However, this calculation is systematically biased because we don't know the outcome of all the live cases. It is also biased because it is based on official numbers from the CCP. The U.S. government has criticized the Chinese government's transparency:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-china-not-being-honest-says-us-as-wartime-measures-widened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-china-not-being-honest-says-us-as-wartime-measures-widened)

The Chinese government also underreported the SARS outbreak as it was happening by at least a factor of 10 (I recall 16.8x, specifically, but can't find a source for that now):

[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars)

Researchers at Imperial College London calculated the fatality rate at the epicenter in Wuhan is 18%, although this is probably higher than the real fatality rate because China is only detecting the worst cases. Here is the paper from Imperial:

[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf)

Here is the lead researcher, Dr. Neil Ferguson, discussing the research and estimating the case fatality rate in depth:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALQTdCYGISw&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALQTdCYGISw&amp;t=1s) (Part 1)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKMdX1SPiFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKMdX1SPiFk) (Part 2)

I suggest you watch Dr. Ferguson's videos in their totality. He estimates only a quarter to a third of cases are detected by western medical and border checks. He also suggests (in part 1) that only 10% of cases in China are detected and (in part 2) that only 5% of cases are detected. This would imply there are 71,902 / 0.05 = 1,438,000 infected today. This number aligns with research from February 13 showing there were 983,000 cumulative cases:

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1)

Last month, Lancet published first study on the mortality rate in initial cases (which are probably more severe than on average), finding the rate around 15%:

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext)

This week, a study found the first 757 cases in China indicated a 15.4% fatality rate:

[https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf](https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf)

*It is safe to say the fatality rate of the virus is much higher than the flu (0.1%).*

**Transmissibility**

The R0 (""R nought"") is a measure of the number of people one person will infect each generation of the virus. The flu has a R0 of 1.3, meaning each person who has the flu will infect, on average, 1.3 people. The measles has an R0 of 12 to 18. The novel coronavirus has R0 of 4.7 to 6.6 (95% confidence):

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1)

The R0 depends largely on [three factors](https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number#calculation), namely the infectious period, contact rate, and modes of transmission.

Although the incubation period is on average 6.4 days, every one in 100 people could have an incubation period of 17 days or longer:

[https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062)

People may not show symptoms during the incubation period, but can still be contagious; asymptomatic transmission was confirmed in Texas:

[https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/15th-us-coronavirus-case-reported-in-texas-asymptomatic-transmission-confirmed.html](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/15th-us-coronavirus-case-reported-in-texas-asymptomatic-transmission-confirmed.html)

The virus can be transmitted via droplets, fomites (particles on surfaces), or possibly through the air over longer distances.

The virus can survive on surfaces at room temperature up to 9 days:

[https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-just-how-long-coronaviruses-can-stick-around-on-a-surface](https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-just-how-long-coronaviruses-can-stick-around-on-a-surface)

A senior Chinese official said the virus has ""aerosol transmission,"" although Australian experts note there is no publically available evidence of this in science journals:

[https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/claims-coronavirus-can-spread-through-the-air](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/claims-coronavirus-can-spread-through-the-air)

However, China is using fleets of trucks to spray disinfectant into the air in contaminated cities, presumably to prevent aerosol transmission:

[https://youtu.be/3-RqckJAulM](https://youtu.be/3-RqckJAulM)

*The novel coronavirus has a potentially long incubation period, during which asymptomatic carriers are contagious, and can spread the disease via direct contact, fomites, and possibly through the air in some circumstances. Although the transmissibility of the novel virus is not as high as measles, which is a very contagious disease, it is much higher than the flu.*

**Scale**

For comparison, the WHO sponsored a pandemic simulation called Event 201 wherein 65 million people died within the first 18 months of an outbreak when the virus had a R0 of 2 and a fatality rate of 10%. 

[http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/)

HK experts warn the virus will infect 60-80% of the global population:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population)

Ira Longini at WHO confirmed the projection billions will be infected is accurate:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-13/coronavirus-could-infect-two-thirds-of-globe-researcher-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-13/coronavirus-could-infect-two-thirds-of-globe-researcher-says)

The WHO says coronavirus is “public enemy number one.”

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-18-months-says-who](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-18-months-says-who)

**Detection**

Dr. Ferguson (in the videos linked above) estimates western countries are detecting 25-33% of infections. 

However, the NYT reported test kits are flawed:

**Source of Virus**

Independent researcher Dr. Lyons-Weiler concluded there is a moderately strong possibility the virus was engineered by humans, in part because there is evidence of a pShuttle vector in the virus genome. (pShuttle is a technology used to splice sections of DNA into genomes and does not occur naturally.)

Dr. Lyons-Weiler believes the virus was developed for antidote purposes.

She took one step too far and began sliding down with nothing to stop her or for her to hold onto. The cliff wall on the opposite side of the stream bed is just a vertical wall of jagged rocks.

First of all, is it better to go to zoo or safari for the person in a wheelchair? I will be walking alongside. I heard someone saying sarafi is bigger so easier to go around in wheelchair.

Is it somewhat still convenient and enjoyable going to the zoo in a wheelchair?

Shall I consider other alternatives like bus or tram rather than wheelchair? What's not good with them?

&amp;#x200B;

 and recognizing the news is designed to prevent panic rather than deliver accurate information to the public, this is the critical information you need to know about the virus.

**Fatality Rate**

The most important thing to understand about the fatality rate is: (1) no one will know what it is until the virus has run its course, and (2) there are different ways of measuring the fatality rate, which leads to bias.

For example, the news reports a 2 percent fatality rate. This stat is the ""-0day"" case fatality ratio. It is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths by the total number of cases (based on numbers supplied by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)). Yesterday, for example, there were 1,775 deaths and 71,902 confirmed cases according to the CCP numbers. (1,775/71,902 = 2.47%).

However, this calculation is systematically biased because we don't know the outcome of all the live cases. It is also biased because it is based on official numbers from the CCP. The U.S. government has criticized the Chinese government's transparency:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-china-not-being-honest-says-us-as-wartime-measures-widened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-china-not-being-honest-says-us-as-wartime-measures-widened)

The Chinese government also underreported the SARS outbreak as it was happening by at least a factor of 10 (I recall 16.8x, specifically, but can't find a source for that now):

[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars)

Researchers at Imperial College London calculated the fatality rate at the epicenter in Wuhan is 18%, although this is probably higher than the real fatality rate because China is only detecting the worst cases. Here is the paper from Imperial:

[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf)

Here is the lead researcher, Dr. Neil Ferguson, discussing the research and estimating the case fatality rate in depth:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALQTdCYGISw&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALQTdCYGISw&amp;t=1s) (Part 1)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKMdX1SPiFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKMdX1SPiFk) (Part 2)

I suggest you watch Dr. Ferguson's videos in their totality. He talks about how a -10day stat is a more accurate reflection of the real fatality rate. (Total deaths divided by the total number of cases as of 10 days ago.)

Separately, he estimates only a quarter to a third of cases are detected by western medical and border checks. He also suggests (in part 1) that only 10% of cases in China are detected and (in part 2) that only 5% of cases are detected. This would imply there are 71,902 / 0.05 = 1,438,000 infected today. This number aligns with research from February 13 showing there were 983,000 cumulative cases:

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1)

Last month, Lancet published first study on the mortality rate in initial cases (which are probably more severe than on average), finding the rate around 15%:

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext)

This week, a study found the first 757 cases in China indicated a 15.4% fatality rate:

[https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf](https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf)

*It is safe to say the fatality rate of the virus is much higher than the flu (0.1%).*

**Transmissibility**

The R0 (""R nought"") is a measure of the number of people one person will infect each generation of the virus. The flu has a R0 of 1.3, meaning each person who has the flu will infect, on average, 1.3 people. The measles has an R0 of 12 to 18. The novel coronavirus has R0 of 4.7 to 6.6 (95% confidence):

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1)

The R0 depends largely on [three factors](https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number#calculation), namely the infectious period, contact rate, and modes of transmission.

Although the incubation period is on average 6.4 days, every one in 100 people could have an incubation period of 17 days or longer:

[https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062)

People may not show symptoms during the incubation period, but can still be contagious; asymptomatic transmission was confirmed in Texas:

[https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/15th-us-coronavirus-case-reported-in-texas-asymptomatic-transmission-confirmed.html](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/15th-us-coronavirus-case-reported-in-texas-asymptomatic-transmission-confirmed.html)

The virus can be transmitted via droplets, fomites (particles on surfaces), or possibly through the air over longer distances.

The virus can survive on surfaces at room temperature up to 9 days:

[https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-just-how-long-coronaviruses-can-stick-around-on-a-surface](https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-just-how-long-coronaviruses-can-stick-around-on-a-surface)

A senior Chinese official said the virus has ""aerosol transmission,"" although Australian experts note there is no publically available evidence of this in science journals:

[https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/claims-coronavirus-can-spread-through-the-air](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/claims-coronavirus-can-spread-through-the-air)

However, China is using fleets of trucks to spray disinfectant into the air in contaminated cities, presumably to prevent aerosol transmission:

[https://youtu.be/3-RqckJAulM](https://youtu.be/3-RqckJAulM)

*The novel coronavirus has a potentially long incubation period, during which asymptomatic carriers are contagious, and can spread the disease via direct contact, fomites, and possibly through the air in some circumstances. Although the transmissibility of the novel virus is not as high as measles, which is a very contagious disease, it is much higher than the flu.*

**Scale**

For comparison, the WHO sponsored a pandemic simulation called Event 201 wherein 65 million people died within the first 18 months of an outbreak when the virus had a R0 of 2 and a fatality rate of 10%. 

[http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/)

Hong Kong experts warn the virus will infect 60-80% of the global population:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population)

Ira Longini at WHO confirmed the projection billions will be infected is accurate:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-13/coronavirus-could-infect-two-thirds-of-globe-researcher-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-13/coronavirus-could-infect-two-thirds-of-globe-researcher-says)

The WHO says coronavirus is “public enemy number one.”

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-18-months-says-who](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-18-months-says-who)

*Experts warn we are on the verge of a global pandemic that will likely affect people everywhere*.

**Detection**

Dr. Ferguson (in the videos linked above) estimates western countries are detecting 25-33% of infections.

However, the NYT reported test kits are flawed:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-test-kits-cdc.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-test-kits-cdc.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage)

*You cannot assume the official numbers reflect the totality of infected persons.*

*It is possible the government has adopted a strategy of limiting the publicly available information in order to prevent panic.*

**Source of Virus**

Independent researcher Dr. Lyons-Weiler concluded there is a moderately strong possibility the virus was engineered by humans, in part because there is evidence of a pShuttle vector in the virus genome. (pShuttle is a technology used to splice sections of DNA into genomes and does not occur naturally.)

[https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/02/02/moderately-strong-confirmation-of-a-laboratory-origin-of-2019-ncov/](https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/02/02/moderately-strong-confirmation-of-a-laboratory-origin-of-2019-ncov/)

Dr. Lyons-Weiler believes the virus was developed for antidote purposes. (See also ""Clear evidence this is not a bioweapon,"" [https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/02/12/clear-evidence-it-is-not-a-bioweapon-so-whats-all-this-about-ace2-and-ncov-2019-covid-2019/](https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/02/12/clear-evidence-it-is-not-a-bioweapon-so-whats-all-this-about-ace2-and-ncov-2019-covid-2019/); See generally [https://jameslyonsweiler.com/](https://jameslyonsweiler.com/)).

Initial speculation as to whether the virus was transmitted from the Wuhan Institute of Virology is now a scientific hypothesis under investigation by researchers at the South China Institute of Technology:

San Diego County declared a public emergency on Friday ""out of an abundance of precaution.""

[https://www.kpbs.org/podcasts/kpbs-midday-edition-segments/2020/feb/17/san-diego-declares-emergency-over-coronavirus-abun/](https://www.kpbs.org/podcasts/kpbs-midday-edition-segments/2020/feb/17/san-diego-declares-emergency-over-coronavirus-abun/)

The first group of evacuees who were quarantined at the base at Miramar left quarantine yesterday.

[https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/story/2020-02-18/first-group-of-coronavirus-evacuees-prepare-to-leave-miramar](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/story/2020-02-18/first-group-of-coronavirus-evacuees-prepare-to-leave-miramar)

UC San Diego medical center provided several excuses as to how officials sent an evacuee who tested positive for the virus back into quarantine with healthy evacuees last week. 

[https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/uc-san-diego-medical-center-to-discuss-2nd-coronavirus-case-in-san-diego/2263229/](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/uc-san-diego-medical-center-to-discuss-2nd-coronavirus-case-in-san-diego/2263229/)

The evacuees responded by starting a petition demanding they all be tested. 

[https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/miramar-coronavirus-evacuees-start-petition-for-quarantine-oversight](https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/miramar-coronavirus-evacuees-start-petition-for-quarantine-oversight)

There is no public information as to whether the evacuees were in fact tested. The 14 day quarantine period was not extended after the patient with the virus was returned to quarantine. The petition further alleged the government operated the quarantine on the false assumption ""the virus won't spread until symptoms develop."" 

Recognizing there is a dearth of publicly available information about the emerging crisis, this is the critical information you need to know to understand the risk . . .

**Fatality Rate**

The most important thing to understand about the fatality rate is: (1) no one will know what it is until the virus has run its course, and (2) there are different ways of measuring the fatality rate, which leads to bias.

For example, the news reports a 2 percent fatality rate. This stat is the ""-0day"" case fatality ratio. It is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths by the total number of cases (based on numbers supplied by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)). Yesterday, for example, there were 1,775 deaths and 71,902 confirmed cases according to the CCP numbers. (1,775/71,902 = 2.47%).

However, this calculation is systematically biased because we don't know the outcome of all the live cases. It is also biased because it is based on official numbers from the CCP. The U.S. government has criticized the Chinese government's transparency:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-china-not-being-honest-says-us-as-wartime-measures-widened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/coronavirus-china-not-being-honest-says-us-as-wartime-measures-widened)

The Chinese government also underreported the SARS outbreak as it was happening by at least a factor of 10 (I recall 16.8x, specifically, but can't find a source for that now):

[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars)

Researchers at Imperial College London calculated the fatality rate at the epicenter in Wuhan is 18%, although this is probably higher than the real fatality rate because China is only detecting the worst cases. Here is the paper from Imperial:

[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf)

Here is the lead researcher, Dr. Neil Ferguson, discussing the research and estimating the case fatality rate in depth:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALQTdCYGISw&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALQTdCYGISw&amp;t=1s) (Part 1)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKMdX1SPiFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKMdX1SPiFk) (Part 2)

I suggest you watch Dr. Ferguson's videos in their totality. He talks about how a -10day stat is a more accurate reflection of the real fatality rate. (Total deaths divided by the total number of cases as of 10 days ago.)

Separately, he estimates only a quarter to a third of cases are detected by western medical and border checks. He also suggests (in part 1) that only 10% of cases in China are detected and (in part 2) that only 5% of cases are detected. This would imply there are 71,902 / 0.05 = 1,438,000 infected today. This number aligns with research from February 13 showing there were 983,000 cumulative cases:

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v1)

Last month, Lancet published first study on the mortality rate in initial cases (which are probably more severe than on average), finding the rate around 15%:

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext)

This week, a study found the first 757 cases in China indicated a 15.4% fatality rate:

[https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf](https://github.com/cmrivers/ncov/blob/master/COVID-19.pdf)

*It is safe to say the fatality rate of the virus is much higher than the flu (0.1%).*

**Transmissibility**

The R0 (""R nought"") is a measure of the number of people one person will infect each generation of the virus. The flu has a R0 of 1.3, meaning each person who has the flu will infect, on average, 1.3 people. The measles has an R0 of 12 to 18. The novel coronavirus has R0 of 4.7 to 6.6 (95% confidence):

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1)

The R0 depends largely on [three factors](https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number#calculation), namely the infectious period, contact rate, and modes of transmission.

Although the incubation period is on average 6.4 days, every one in 100 people could have an incubation period of 17 days or longer:

[https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062)

People may not show symptoms during the incubation period, but can still be contagious; asymptomatic transmission was confirmed in Texas:

[https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/15th-us-coronavirus-case-reported-in-texas-asymptomatic-transmission-confirmed.html](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/15th-us-coronavirus-case-reported-in-texas-asymptomatic-transmission-confirmed.html)

The virus can be transmitted via droplets, fomites (particles on surfaces), or possibly through the air over longer distances.

The virus can survive on surfaces at room temperature up to 9 days:

[https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-just-how-long-coronaviruses-can-stick-around-on-a-surface](https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-just-how-long-coronaviruses-can-stick-around-on-a-surface)

A senior Chinese official said the virus has ""aerosol transmission,"" although Australian experts note there is no publically available evidence of this in science journals:

[https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/claims-coronavirus-can-spread-through-the-air](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/claims-coronavirus-can-spread-through-the-air)

However, China is using fleets of trucks to spray disinfectant into the air in contaminated cities, presumably to prevent aerosol transmission:

[https://youtu.be/3-RqckJAulM](https://youtu.be/3-RqckJAulM)

*The novel coronavirus has a potentially long incubation period, during which asymptomatic carriers are contagious, and can spread the disease via direct contact, fomites, and possibly through the air in some circumstances. Although the transmissibility of the novel virus is not as high as measles, which is a very contagious disease, it is much higher than the flu.*

**Scale**

For comparison, the WHO sponsored a pandemic simulation called Event 201 wherein 65 million people died within the first 18 months of an outbreak when the virus had a R0 of 2 and a fatality rate of 10%. 

[http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/)

Hong Kong experts warn the virus will infect 60-80% of the global population:

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population)

Ira Longini at WHO confirmed the projection billions will be infected is accurate:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-13/coronavirus-could-infect-two-thirds-of-globe-researcher-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-13/coronavirus-could-infect-two-thirds-of-globe-researcher-says)

The WHO says coronavirus is “public enemy number one.”

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-18-months-says-who](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-18-months-says-who)

*Experts warn we are on the verge of a global pandemic that will likely affect people everywhere*.

**Detection**

Dr. Ferguson (in the videos linked above) estimates western countries are detecting 25-33% of infections.

However, the NYT reported test kits are flawed:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-test-kits-cdc.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-test-kits-cdc.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage)

*You cannot assume the official numbers reflect the totality of infected persons.*

**The Diamond Princess**

Brit David Abel aboard the Princess Diana confirms his friend from the ship tested negative and then positive and then negative and then positive.

*It is possible the government has adopted a strategy of limiting the publicly available information in order to prevent panic.*

**Source of Virus**

Independent researcher Dr. Lyons-Weiler concluded there is a moderately strong possibility the virus was engineered by humans, in part because there is evidence of a pShuttle vector in the virus genome. (pShuttle is a technology used to splice sections of DNA into genomes and does not occur naturally.)

[https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/02/02/moderately-strong-confirmation-of-a-laboratory-origin-of-2019-ncov/](https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/02/02/moderately-strong-confirmation-of-a-laboratory-origin-of-2019-ncov/)

Dr. Lyons-Weiler believes the virus was developed for antidote purposes. (See also ""Clear evidence this is not a bioweapon,"" [https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/02/12/clear-evidence-it-is-not-a-bioweapon-so-whats-all-this-about-ace2-and-ncov-2019-covid-2019/](https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/02/12/clear-evidence-it-is-not-a-bioweapon-so-whats-all-this-about-ace2-and-ncov-2019-covid-2019/); See generally [https://jameslyonsweiler.com/](https://jameslyonsweiler.com/)).

Initial speculation as to whether the virus was transmitted from the Wuhan Institute of Virology is now a scientific hypothesis under investigation by researchers at the South China Institute of Technology:

My 22nd birthday is on Monday (woo!) and I have been looking forward to celebrating it since this past year I proudly fought against my depression, anxiety, ptsd, and panic disorders. I want to celebrate my birthday and my life in general with those I love and those who have supported me throughout my journey to recovery. The thing is, I don’t know what to do!

I would like to go to a restaurant that isn’t so pricey since most of my friends are college students and one that isn’t so far away from La Jolla (I think downtown should be good). I also want to go to a restaurant that isn’t a major franchise, one that is “unique”. I’ve been sober for about a year now, but I’m sure my friends will want to drink so maybe a place that either serves drinks or is near a place that does.

Lastly, do you have any recommendations for fun things we as a group of about 8 can do afterwards?

Hi friends,

My 22nd birthday is on Monday (woo!) and I have been looking forward to celebrating it since this past year I proudly fought against my depression, anxiety, ptsd, and panic disorders. I want to celebrate my birthday and my life in general with those I love and those who have supported me throughout my journey to recovery. The thing is, I don’t know what to do! I moved to SD for school about four years ago, yet I haven’t really gotten out much. I want to explore the city a little bit and see what food and drinking spots it has to offer.

I would like to go to a restaurant that isn’t so pricey since most of my friends are college students and one that isn’t so far away from La Jolla (I think downtown should be good). I also want to go to a restaurant that isn’t a major franchise, one that is “unique”. I’ve been sober for about a year now, but I’m sure my friends will want to drink so maybe a place that either serves drinks or is near a place that does.

Lastly, do you have any recommendations for fun things we as a group of about 8 can do afterwards?

I would like to go on either Friday, Saturday, or Monday. 

Any and all suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you for your support!",sandiego,"My birthday is coming up soon, I don’t know how to celebrate it [repost since I posted the original so late]"

I am starting a home-based business and I would like to apply for a business license (DBA) and sellers permit ASAP. I'm located in Ramona, and just need some input from other business owners who have done this recently.

Some info:  
It's a home based business where I provide graphic service to my customer, purchase the products and have them manufactured somewhere else. So basically, I work from my small office to create graphics, buy the blank goods and have them printed somewhere else. I am not hiring any employees for my business. I want a sole-proprietorship, a DBA and sellers permit. I want this done as simply as possible. It's just me, in my office. :-)

I am scouring through the web pages and it's a little confusing, and I'm hoping someone can help. My questions...

1. What's the fastest way to do this? Go to the county clerk's office? I'm literally trying to get this done as fast as possible, as I have clients who are waiting.
2. What do I need to file for specifically? Is the DBA the same as a business license?
3. Is there anything else I am missing?

My name’s Beatrice ☀️

I am currently looking to make new friends to play D&amp;D with in San Diego :-). I’ve had trouble so far with getting solid commitments to schedules with people, and I myself as a working class gal understand that time is of a premium. 

Looking to play in the evenings, mostly, subject to change sometime in the future due to a new job. Anyone interested is encouraged to tell me their availability in detail and we can all work together to settle on a day and time every week to play. 

I'm of the Matt Colville school of DMing, so I'm not perfect but we have fun. 

You can be as new as you are to Dungeons and Dragons, and feel welcome in the group! I have experience DMing but am by no means a pro. What is much more important to me is the way we all get along as a group and I will do my best to curate a group of people who I believe will vibe well together. If you don’t know what Dungeons and Dragons is, check out “Welcome to Dungeons and Dragons[Welcome to Dungeons and Dragons](https://youtu.be/Eo_oR7YO-Bw)”’ 

Never posted anything like this before so I'm not sure if I'm forgetting anything crucial, but if my post sounds like something you're interested in, PM me and we can talk! :)

I’m a transgender woman, and many of my friends are LGBT as well. If this is a problem for you, this is not the group for you.

We are inclusive and friendly to all. Bigotry, racism, etc, aren't something we tolerate.

If you are interested in playing or figuring out more, hit me up on Discord (thousandthingsbright#3057), or text me at 707-690-8684!",sandiego,Seeking Players for San Diego Dungeons and Dragons

2350,phurealz,1582352893,f7osyc,Nan,"I'm writing to express my comments about the housing affordability issue that is plaguing California. I'm not poor nor am I rich, I'm strictly a middle-class individual that has a job that pays well enough that I should be able to afford a house in and around the city I currently live in, Los Angeles. LA is now the most unaffordable city in the nation, even more than another California city, San Francisco. This is an issue many years in the making and has more visibly manifested itself with the increasing number of homeless throughout the state. These unfortunate souls are continually increasing because their leaders have failed them. These so-called leaders have failed to make the bold decisions when needed, failed to foresee a housing crisis of their own making, and now fail their constituents like never before.
The Governor's State of the State speech gave a voice to the homeless issue like never before. Declaring it to the most urgent issue that voters most complain about. However, building a bunch of homeless shelters will not solve the problem because that's not the root cause for a majority of the homeless in this state. It's simply a lack of affordable housing. Rents reaching $1,200+ for even modest studio apartments through much of the LA while the wage barely inches up is the issue. These increasing rents are driven by a lack of new housing. Rent controls will not work, they'll modestly help. If the vacancy rate shot up because of a supply of new housing, these rents would moderate or even decrease, so I'll just say this. ""Build. Build. Build. Build. Build. Build. And then build some more."" to anyone willing to listen. Anyone complaining of gentrification. To anyone complaining about apartment builds going up in their single-family residential neighborhoods. The population increase far outpaces the increase in housing. When the population increases by 30,000 a year but the number of new units only increases by 7,000 in the same year and this happens for a decade, home affordability will inevitably become a problem. Cities are more than happy to approve new office buildings but shirk their responsibility to building housing for all those people that will work in these newly approved office buildings. This feckless leadership has my blood curdling as I never expected it to.
Maybe this is just a part of a conspiracy to have Californians migrate to other states, turning them purple and then blue. If so, great plan. When it comes to voting, I've voted mostly democrat my entire life, yet I was moderate in my views when it came to fiscal matters. While I will vote for the Democratic nominee, no matter who it is. But I'll not do so anymore when it comes to my local representatives. They simply don't deserve it anymore.",sandiego,Open Letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom

I’m originally from Houston Texas but grew up most of my life in Indiana (never really considered Indy home don’t like it much at all honestly). 

I’ve been to San Diego twice and I have to say it is my favorite city I’ve ever been too. It is just amazing in all aspects and I’m legitimately thinking about moving here for a year before I move to a permanent residence which will most likely be in Houston. I know the costs of living there is pretty crazy which is why I don’t plan on staying there longterm. Houston is the city I chose because it is my hometown, very affordable to live in, housing market is amazing (you could get a mansion here for $20 of course I’m exaggerating but it’s that good there lol) friends and family there, many jobs, and a really good economy. ( Houston has a couple In N Outs now too haha ) 

I’m a student and make 32k a year rn from just my side hustle. This doesn’t include having a job once I graduate with an actual salary. It’s just a hobby that I do while I’m in school that pays pretty okay so I most likely will be getting a job in SD for at least a year plus doing that as well. 

I don’t plan on living in La Jolla or somewhere vastly expensive to live in I just want to live comfortable while my managing my money correctly and enjoy in my opinion the best city on the west coast. (Sorry LA)",sandiego,Should I move here for a year? Is San Diego worth the cost of living?

San Diego is such a wonderful place and the litter makes me sad.

I travel to Austin, TX for work and it’s striking how tidy their city is. I can’t figure out why that is. Is it cultural, municipal?

I fight the urge to pull over and start picking up the litter but I’m seriously afraid I’ll get clocked by an inattentive driver. 

I’ve inquired and the answer is almost always something involving calling a local politician. They’re useless. 

Sometimes I aspire to create a detail of volunteers. We’d have a driver in a truck who rides the shoulder protecting us while we collect litter on the highway shoulder. 

I see community clean up programs but they focus on the low-hanging fruit like beaches and parks. Not knocking that effort but we have to broaden the scope. 

Part of me thinks it’s a waste of time and we’ll never make a dent. The alternative is what...do nothing? I also acknowledge that if a group started doing this clean up it would only be a matter of time before we lost our will and the litter built back up. Yup. I am pessimist.

If you had a chance to check out my last event where I taught how to play Dungeons and Dragons, build characters, establish backstory and even played a few turns to start getting the hang of the game!

I had a lot of fun teaching the class but if you were there you know there was a lot going on for just one DM to manage.

So to make things a little easier for myself and to give everyone a chance to experience the game on a smaller scale I came up with the idea of The Roving DM.

If you have been trying to meet a group or have a group that you need a DM for and haven't had much luck searching, or maybe you are a new player and want to join a short campaign and meet some new players and start rolling some dice then this may be for you.

How it Works: 

I post an Eventbrite link, [LIKE THIS FOR MARCH 10TH](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-roving-dm-tickets-96806441673)

or like [THIS FOR MARCH 24th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-roving-dm-tickets-96808507853)

Then you follow that link and reserve your FREE ticket.

You'll notice there are only 10 tickets available, that's because I want to keep the group fairly small in order to give all players the chance to roll dice and get in the game.

Still need more details? Okay.

This event is essentially a Zero Session made up of whoever reserves a ticket for that particular game. We will have an hour at the start for introductions and to character creation and then the game will start.

If you like the players you meet you can then choose to start your own group OR you can go to the next event and meet some new players.

All levels of experience welcome!

What's the catch? 

No catch, per se. However the reason I am able to offer this event for free is because our hosts don't charge a venue or table fee so please be sure to support them by sampling their awesome drinks.

Also, IF you are able to make a donation of new or unused school supplies for our local underfunded classrooms they would really appreciate it!

Well, that's it. If you have any questions or need clarification on what exactly the event is comment or drop me a DM and I'll be more than happy to answer your questions. 

Stay up!",sandiego,"Dungeons and Dragons fans. I'm Vic, The Roving DM! and I have a few events coming up next month!"

Does anyone else agree with separation? And if you don't as clearly this article makes out to housing separation as ""wrong"",  can you explain why? Open to other people's views but I feel like with current state of housing and cost of living in our city these things need to be reviewed or brought to light.

My (current) and seemingly unpopular opinion:

You get what you pay for and if you are going to get a subsidized lower rent that's less than half market value that should be enough? Rental properties are still a business and the fact that people feel entitled to amenities and additional items on their already low rent blows my mind. Life isn't fair and if we raise our children under the assumption that everything should be equal your raising a generation that will fail. 

 *""How does a single mom explain to her child that she is living in the same building as somebody from school but she can't utilize the pool or can't come through the front door,"" Gonzalez said. ""That's sick.""* 

It's not sick. When you travel you are on the same plane but have first class, business class, and economy, how do you explain that to you child? Well, the people up front with reclining chairs, leg space, booze and proper hot meal paid much more than the economy fare. So if you want those additional items...PAY FOR IT. You are still going to the same place, on the same plane, but don't get those things simply because it wasn't in your budget to do so and/or wasn't a necessity. You get to live in San Diego, pay nothing, and if you want a pool pay what everyone else does.

Rental properties are a corporation/developer looking to make money. They are assisting the community by providing subsidized housing, and the fact they are getting denied plans on basis of social disparity confuses me.",sandiego,"Unpopular Opinion: Affordable Housing ""Poor Doors"""

2584,RankWeis,1582776459,fa6bm8,Nan,"Anyone who has been paying attention to Fry's has seen its tremendous decline from the early 2000's but this experience has been another level.

I bought a TV from them in 2018 and it stopped working 1 year and a week later, just outside of the manufacturer's warranty, so I called Fry's to utilize my 3 year service contract that I'd purchased from them.

That was December 4th, and since then I've been playing phone tag with them - I keep calling the front desk, and ask to be transferred to service, service doesn't pick up. I call the front desk back and they promise, harder and harder each time, that they'll definitely get service to call me back.

In a less than one month span I called 18 times. Got a half dozen ""We promise service department will call you back"" - received zero call backs.

I have managed to get through to somebody a couple times, they've been unable to say anything besides ""it's out of stock but it's coming any day now!"".

I went down to the store after waiting 2.5 months and had to wait for an hour and 15 minutes for a manager who I had *just* missed on his one hour lunch break - at 2:30pm. That manager told me there was nothing they could do (no apology, just a gruff ""what do you want from us""). I had him promise me himself, that he would *personally* call me back on Monday, news or no news. 

Well if you've been following you probably could guess, but I got no call back on Monday. I went back a week later and told a different manager that I needed either a TV, my money or I would be going to small claims. Her reply - ""Sometimes it's taken up to six months, so three months really isn't all that bad"".

Well I think three months is way too long, so I went down to small claims this morning in order to settle this once and for all. 

This is the shortened version of this story but there's even more BS they've tried to pull on me, all I wanted is a damn call back, *any* line of communication, but I couldn't get it. In three months that Fry's has been supposedly working on this, I've received one call from them, from a sympathetic guy at the front desk who I relayed my situation to and he tried to get help, but could not and was extremely apologetic.

tl;dr - Fry's has zero customer service, zero inventory, and takes zero responsibility on their warranty's. Avoid if you value your sanity.",sandiego,Fry's Electronics is a black hole of customer service - and now I get to deal with them in small claims

I've got a 1987 Toyota Supra that's supposed to be my second weekend  'fun car', but I haven't taken particular care of it. I left it sitting  for over year (since December 2018), in other words. All I'm looking for is someone willing to come in and drain out the  fuel. Yes, I will show you my pink slip if you want, I'm not going  through some elaborate ruse to steal gas. As it's an '87, I don't THINK  it should have anti-siphon baffles? Or hopefully we can get around them anyway.

No, just running it through the fuel pump is not an option, the entire point is to get this crap OUT of my car so it DOESN'T get in my fuel lines when I bring her back to life. You would need to provide your own cans and whatever tools you want/need to use to siphon. The last I remember the tank was only ABOUT half-full and  I think it was less than about 3/4, and max capacity is 18.5 gallons,  so optimistically it's 10 gallons, it could be up to about 15.

It is CRITICAL we have minimum spillage, I live in an apartment complex (whole reason for this debacle) and can't get gas on the parking lot. I offer no guarantees as to whether or not the fuel is still good, but whether or not it is, you keep it or dispose of it. Fuel was only sitting for about one year now, so it's a 50/50 shot? Stick it in a mower, stick it in a car, whatever. Money on top either way.

And, if it IS good... That's somewhere north of at least 35 bucks in Premium gas.

60 bucks for the work. If we can tell at the time of siphoning it that it's bad (it's gone yellow, etc.), I'll give you ten bucks extra as the 'official' hazmat disposal site I googled up is about 20 miles away from me. Reply here if you're interested.",sandiego,"Need someone with about 15 gallons' capacity in gas cans to siphon some year-old premium gas. Might or might not still be good.

Wednesday, I woke up to my car and the car behind me victims of a hit and run.

It is definitely an older Eclipse or Galant, but we have reason to believe it's more likely that it was a Galant, and possibly a 2005 one, but I'd like to keep any options open.

My wife and I drove to Pacific Beach today to have breakfast with one of our friends for her birthday. I'm fairly certain I drove down Garnet towards the ocean, turned right on Dawes, and then turned right onto one of the suburban streets to park, parking on the right side (southern side) of the street.

Normally I'm one of those people that memorizes / writes down / takes a photo of the cross streets, but today while getting out of the car I got distracted via a call from my dad. We took a roughly southwestern zig-zag path towards Firehouse, entering the boardwalk from Garnet.

After breakfast around noon, we went back to the general vicinity in which we'd parked and started looking. After about 20 minutes of no luck, we rented Bird scooters and started sweeping the streets. After 2 hours no luck. 

We called an Uber, went home, got our other car and then came back and systematically covered the entire grid, still nothing. At this point we're fairly certain that our car was parked on Missouri Street, somewhere to the east of Dawes, but because we didn't take down the exact address we can't be certain. It could've potentially been Chancedony or Law street as well.

At this point we've filed a police report for a stolen vehicle, as we can't see how we'd have missed our car after numerous systematic sweeps.

I would love at least one recommendation for a place that makes their corn tortillas fresh on the spot because I’ve been taking about it for ages. And a selection of *amazing* salsas would also be nice. Salsas make or break the tacos.

Doesn’t have to be a sit down place, doesn’t even have to be an actual restaurant/truck (my favorite spot in the bay is a tent in the corner of a parking lot)",sandiego,What are you favorite taco spots along highway 1 anywhere from Encinitas to pacific beach?

My wife and I (ages 40 &amp; 46) are hoping for more of an adult 3 or 4 day trip in mid-late June or early-mid July.  We are kind of familiar with San Diego, I can get from the beaches on Coronado, up to Sea World, make a quick jaunt to Balboa Park and cruise the areas around Mission and Pacific Beach so I have a decent lay of the land.  We are not really familiar with downtown but would like to explore that a bit more.

We are flexible on where we stay but don't want to end up in a questionable area (I'm looking at you Holiday Inn Express off Sports Arena Blvd).  We are looking at places like the Dana on Mission Bay or the Hilton in the Gas Lamp area (is Gas Lamp a desirable area to stay?) but wouldn't mind any of the beach areas.

Any recommendations on areas to focus or avoid?  Particular hotels/resorts.  What kind of weather would we see?  Google says the average temp is a high of 77 in July but that seemed a little cool.",sandiego,Help me plan my trip to San Diego. Where to stay and when to go.

**Background**. I work for a great company and have a great boss and co-workers, all with good senses of humor. I moved to town and started work with them a year and a half ago, so nobody here has known me longer than that. This summer, either portions of the team or my whole team will be traveling to 8 different cities together to work booths at conventions, **including San Diego today and tomorrow (Tuesday) at the downtown Convention Center.**

...what I'm doing is creating an air of mystery around my backstory. The goal is that at the end of the summer, my co-workers would be baffled and fascinated by me and absolutely unable to find anything online to substantiate or explain what they've witnessed with their own eyes.

**So, here's what I'm doing**. And here's where maybe a couple of you come in? I would love for people to randomly approach me as we are around town in the evenings (I would send you the restaurant, hotel, etc. along with a photo of me for easy identification) and ask for my autograph, ask if they can take a photo with me, tell me they're a big fan of my work (with no description of what that work is, specifically), ask me to say a specific catchphrase (which we started in Nashville last week) and generally act like they're politely starstruck.

Then you'd leave, my co-workers would be like, ""What just happened? Where do they know you from? What was that about?"" and I'd just say, ""Eh, that was a long time ago, don't want to talk about it,"" or something else vague, and deflect any further questions.

I started this in the Raleigh airport, then in Nashville with the help of four amazing Redditors. At this point in the game, my team is going nuts, since they can't find anything online about me ... *because there isn't anything*!

So, basically, if you're in or around the Gaslamp District this this evening or tomorrow evening and can help me out ... man, I'd sure appreciate it. DM me and I'll send you my contact info and photo so we can arrange something. I just need maybe two people. Thanks, everybody!",sandiego,"So, I need some help with a summer-long, cross-country prank on my co-workers. Today or tomorrow."

Just wanted to say Happy Monday to you all!

Yeah I know, who can get excited about Mondays right? But all it means is that you have an entire week to improve on a bad start and dive head first into a refreshing weekend.

After spending the last three days in bed with a cold I'm ready to get back into the sunshine and start enjoying my city again. 

Here's a little something for you all, I'm giving away free 2-hour vouchers to anyone who DMs me with the phrase ""one please""

What are the vouchers for? Well, they cover 2 hours of time and labor for any task you might have around the house that you could use some help with.

Services include, garden care, tree maintenance, electrical repair, window cleaning, general maintenance and other ""around the house"" services.

Why? Because I can.

Because sometimes people just need a little bit of help; especially in the case of depression, a little bit of cleanliness can really change a person's outlook on things. 

Keep being awesome San Diegans and remember to be kind to one another. Be the change and all that.

So over the last year I have been vollecting school supplies and finally feel like I have enough to make a big delivery. 

Usually I would pick a school from a list of needy classrooms but since this was really a group effort I would like to take your thoughts on which school or classroom you would want to see receive these supplies.

I know there are some teachers here that could advise or maybe even need supplies yourself for your class.

Please post a comment with your suggestion. The school has to be San Diego based as all the supplies were donated by locals.

If you would like to donate there is still time! Send me a message and I can set up a pick up time for you.

Also, all donations receive a free 2-hour Voucher redeemable for time and labor on any residential service you might need (providing its within my wheel house)

2895,masewiththebass,1583373458,fdnx2s,Nan,"So I got home from the gym and was looking for a parking spot. Had to find a spot that was a 5 min walk from my actual place (parking sucks in the community that I’m in). Parked in guest cos it was the only one available. We have a time frame from when tenants can park in guests parking spots, which in my case, I parked maybe an hour until tenants can actually park in the spot.  On a side note, everyone abuses this rule so I’m not the only one that parks in guest during the “restricted time frame”.  
So yeah next morning on my way to work, my car was missing. Called the community manager, went straight to voice mail stating to call her assistant, called the assistant and of course went to voice mail, then I Left a message about the situation. 
So by law, towing companies are to report any car that enters their lot to SDPD. So I figured to call every towing company and impounds within my area and none had my car, interestingly western towing wasn’t listed when I did the search. 
So this was going on at 7ish in the morning. I was convinced that my car was stolen lol. So about 1pm I finally got a call from the community managers assistant, ridiculous, and he pointed me towards western towing and gave me a phone number. The assistant was not able to give me any more information but that. Called the number and a voice mail giving me confusing options on what to dial. Finally after 20 damn minutes a person picks up. No more information but the address, which was wrong! I had to call a second time to get the correct address, like cmoooooon! 
Finally at western towing,  an excuse for a establishment. Deep in Miramar and smells sketchy as hell. And inside  you can see cars and motorcycles that seem to be there for years! And of course my car. Waiting almost half an hour for this guy running the shop to help me, Went to the office which is a trailer, and once we sat down I started asking questions. Why was my car towed? Who issued it? Etc. He couldn’t give me the information, figured, and told me I have to sign BEFORE he can tell me the towing fees, WTF.  Whatever, I just wanted to get my car and get the hell out. Came out to $300 got my car and dipped. With that money, I could’ve went Disney land or eat at boronas buffet at least 12 times! So I looked at the invoice and noticed that they towed my car at 1 in the morning. Of course when no one is awake to see...
No reason from western or the community managers to why I was towed. They failed to report my car to SDPD when it entered the lot. A stupid journey just to find western towing. Something is very sketchy about this place and I really hope the people that are running this gets what’s coming. And I’m pretty sure the community managers are in this.
After I did some scouting and I noticed a car was getting towed. As the driver was heading out, a dude on a bike went to the drivers window    and “tipped” him. Eyebrows raised. I may have been a victim of predatory towing. So please be careful when parking anywhere and consider your surroundings, people! Take pictures of your car when you park or anything that can give you accountability!!! Sorry for the rant but I hope this information brings awareness or helps somebody.

I really like my current company, but they are bootstrapped (no VC) and would not match my offer. Anyway, after everything was said and done, my  CEO just emailed me and said he would ""buy"" me a house (more likely a condo) and I could pay it back as rent installments (on top of a decent pay bump, but not close to 50k).

My gut says this is a terrible idea, but I don't want something great to slip through my fingers. I have to meet with him tomorrow and we will hash out the details (ie if they are charging me interest, if they are giving me a 100K gift and I will be paying back the rest or I am on the hook for it all, how it will work if I leave in the next 2-10 years, etc).

Anyway, wondering how much your expenses are outside of the mortgage, HOA fees, property tax, etc. Is it reasonable to buy a decent place in a good area for under 700k?

I've been studying Zillow for the last two hours and it's impossible to tell. From what I do see, none of this makes sense. I will be paying property taxes+HOA fees (cuz I doubt I can get a house with a yard) that will be more than my current rent, then I'll have to pay 2x my current rent for a mortgage.

Serious question. I'm being asked to fly out to San Diego for work from Mar 16th to the 20th.

Naturally, I'm getting more and more nervous about this scheduled trip. 

It is an important meeting, but not something that couldn't be done via phone or a video call.

I've raised my concerns with work, but they don't seem to be following the virus news very closely and are more interested in continuing to do business as usual, as opposed to making some sensible adjustments for everyone's safety. 

I have to ask, What's the current word on the street?  What are your guys expectations 10 days from now?

So, as stated above, I received this $50 ticket on the first week of school, which I felt was ridiculous. I decided to appeal this ticket and used the text below to support my reasons why my ticket shouldn't have been given. The result of the appeal was that my ticket was reduced from $50 to $10, which is still a win for me. 

Feel free to use this as a template if San Diego Community College District decides to give you a ticket the first week of school:

&amp;#x200B;

**Appeal Email:**

""I want to appeal the ticket I received because it is unethical for SDCCD to issue tickets for parking on the first week of school.

1) SDCCD should not be issuing tickets that cost 200% of the cost of a parking permit. Students already attend Community College to get away from the atrocious fees other colleges require. What explanation is there for SDCCD to charge some arbitrary amount such as $50?

2) Many colleges allow students to park in student parking the first week of school without having to purchase any daily permit or semester permit.

3) I was issued my parking ticket on the second day of school. I wasn’t given financial aid and could not afford the parking permit until the third day of school. Many students aren’t able to afford their permit right away, even the ones that get financial aid a little late.

4) Last semester there was an error in the SDCCD system that prevented students from purchasing their parking permit the first week of school. Is it acceptable for the school to have an error in their system the first week but not acceptable for some leniency on the side of the student?""",sandiego,San Diego Community College Ticket Petition Approved -&gt; $50 lowered to $10

please post in the comments. 
IF there's a link that's needed, please try to not make it part of some text but the full URL string
So I can just copy and paste it.  (It'll make things easier) 
I'll try to retain these in the following week until the date of the event.

Please don't post events that are several months in advance. Try to limit it to 30 days or so - unless there's a real need for *advance notice* well in advance for ticket purchases.

3033,allanorn,1583594881,fewkgz,Nan,"From this morning's NWS forecaster discussion (bolding mine):

&gt;Scattered, light showers are expected at times for the next 24-36 hours due to a very deep marine layer and weak trough passage. **Forecast rainfall amounts are mostly less than one-quarter inch through the weekend.**    
&gt;  
&gt;The storm system for the midweek period remains on track for arrival over SoCal Mon night/Tue. Even though various model solutions have very different QPF distributions, only slight changes have been made for our forecast precip totals. The GFS model develops a low-level boundary with high PW air overrunning it into southern portions of the CWA, including the deserts. This is not indicated with the ECMWF but is to lesser degree with the CMC solution. Our QPF is a blend favoring a non-standard distribution with less desert shadowing, mainly due to AR proximity and forecast lower-level SSE flow, which should help increase totals into the Coachella Valley, lower deserts, and to some degree the I.E. **Widespread 1-2 inch amounts for lower elevations, and 3-5 inch totals for the mtns Tue-Thu still looks good**. Snow levels will be very high for the bulk of the storm, limiting any accumulation below 7500 FT.    
&gt;  
&gt;The main impact will likely be runoff and localized flooding. Many of our smaller streams will be carrying significant volumes of water, and **mainstream river flooding will be possible for the San Diego River if the full effect of this system is felt here**. Other areas of concern will be the Coachella Valley, with significant runoff into the Coachella Canal, and the Tijuana River Valley where lowland flooding will be possible among other concerns.

I've lived in San Diego for ~2 years on and off and I've had some trouble finding a barbershop that fits the following criteria. I know it's a bit specific, and I'm willing to concede that such a thing doesn't exist, but here we go:

- ~20 minutes from Clairemont (I haven't been able to find anything at all on Clairemont)
- no more than two barbers in the place, preferably just one, I'm not big at all on those shops with like 6 barbers churning out customers as fast as possible
- someone that's in tune with modern haircuts but won't make me look like a hype beast with a fade and hard lines and stuff. I love a buzzed-on-the-sides/short on top combo but something a bit subtle
- Ideally I'd like to spend like $30, $40 tops, but most of the shops that I see that fit my criteria are boutique spots that charge $45+ for cuts and when you factor in tip that's an expensive cut. If that's just the norm here I'm willing to bite the bullet but maybe I'm missing something

I was walking from McDonald's to UTC with my friend at around 4 o'clock on Sunday where it must've slipped out of my pocket at some point. It's a black velcro wallet with a blue design on it. I'd retraced my steps the best I could and asked one of the McDonald's employees (he went and asked the other ladies working if they'd seen anything as well). I don't mind if my money is missing (at the time a 20, three 5s, and seven 1s), I just really miss that wallet. My main problem is that I don't keep any identifications in there, only cash (I keep my id in my bag which I know I should've put my wallet in while I was still inside of the store but I didn't for whatever reason this time) and therefore, would likely never see it again. I'm only posting to see if possibly anyone has found it, though I know it is unlikely. I have a deep emotional attachment to that wallet (it used to be my *sister's) and while I am aware I may never see it again, I just wanted to cover all my bases. Thank you to anyone that reads this and I hope you are all doing well.

More than just a meetup, it will be a free Tijuana brewery tour! ([I did something similar 3 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/5cfk51/redditor_border_crossing_meetup_free_tijuana_tour/)). Here’s the plan:

Meeting at PedWest border (Mexican side) at 3:00 pm. **I’ll be there from 2:45 pm to 3:15 pm.** At 3:15 pm we walk to downtown with whoever made it in that 30-minute time-frame. You can reach me through Reddit if you like to catch up later or if you are a few minutes behind.

From there, we walk to downtown to the first brewery stop, Border Psycho. They got craft beers, food, tequila, and much more. Continue to Insurgente Brewery on the corner of fourth for more of the same. Followed by Norte Brewing for again, more of the same (plus beautiful [sunset views](https://i.imgur.com/Ue15xoL.jpg))… And finishing over at the new Madueño brewing for… you guessed it! More of the same!!

Over at Madueño, the Reddit meetup should be taking place for /r/Tijuana !

I posted a thank you at the beginning of the year but I wanted to send another thank you. For all the San Diegans who donated to my classroom... you have given the students joy in more ways that you can imagine. You helped me create a fun and welcoming environment and the 3rd-5th grade special education students love coming to their second room.  As a first year teacher, you helped take so much stress off of my back from worrying about how to create a classroom that was well prepared for the students. Someone also donated some snacks which we call ""brain food"" and the students loved those extra treats to help them stay focused and kept them going. I also had some people donate cleaning materials (wipes and hand sanitizer)  that is coming in handy like crazy as you all know! I still have some things I want to add to my classroom now that I know my students and am getting the swing of things at the school, I also added some more cleaning/health items. I am adding my wish list at the bottom if anyone else would like to donate to a first year teacher at a title 1 elementary school in downtown San Diego. :)

I need to take better photos, here are some of the donated books we have read aloud that the students love. [https://imgur.com/a/8zWuQR0](https://imgur.com/a/8zWuQR0). I am very proud of my students they have all improved in reading, writing and math since September!

The power lines and my apartment will likely be damaged. I have dogs and I’m becoming a bit too paranoid of receiving a phone call to race home because of a potential fire. 

My question is: Is it weird to request that the tree get removed? Or am I letting paranoia get the best of me?  I don’t believe there’s any laws that would step in on this issue. Ever since it got pointed out I’ve had that silly fear lingering from time to time and with this rain marathon coming around, the thought is back in full effect. Any input/advice/ or general “shut up you’re thinking too much” would be greatly appreciated!",sandiego,Question about neighbors palm tree.

Wife and I arrive at the park to meet some friends. Absolutely lovely day, everyone just vibing, lots of dogs playing blissfully in the grass, lots of birthday parties, hippies slack lining and playing drums, people tossing frisbees, old couples chatting while tossing the ball to their dogs, college kids having some sneaky drinks. The usual.

All the sudden everyone just kind of gradually gets quiet and stops interacting because a few uniformed officers show up at the park. Everyone starts putting their sneaky drinks away and now everyone is just staring at these two officers. Word slowly starts making its way to our group that it’s the humane society cops and that they are ticketing for dogs off leashes. The whole park went from 20+ dogs playing and everyone chatting to a complete standstill...all dogs back on leashes, everyone just talking about how expensive that ticket is, and how uncomfortable the vibe just became at the park.

Watched two people get tickets and about 3 separate groups try to talk the cops out of doing so. They stood back at the top of the hill and just perched watching for new comers. Two younger teen girls next to us kindly approached a few new couples that arrived with dogs to tell them that they are giving off leash tickets right now and the faces on those couples just looked so sad. 

About an hour passed and the HS cops left in their truck and literally it was like pressing play on a record, everyone was happy again and interacting and dogs were playing and the park went back to normal. Now I’m all for following the law and understand that the dog owners are in the wrong here, I just had to share this experience because It seriously felt like a majority of happy people were put on pause.",sandiego,Kate Sessions Park and Dogs on Leashes

3190,A_guy_named_Vic,1583861191,fghgoa,Nan,"Hi guys!

If you had a chance to check out my last event where I taught how to play Dungeons and Dragons, build characters, establish backstory and even played a few turns to start getting the hang of the game!

I had a lot of fun teaching the class but if you were there you know there was a lot going on for just one DM to manage.

So to make things a little easier for myself and to give everyone a chance to experience the game on a smaller scale I came up with the idea of The Roving DM.

If you have been trying to meet a group or have a group that you need a DM for and haven't had much luck searching, or maybe you are a new player and want to join a short campaign and meet some new players and start rolling some dice then this may be for you.

How it Works: 

I post an Eventbrite link, [LIKE THIS FOR MARCH 24th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-roving-dm-tickets-96808507853)

Or [LIKE THIS FOR THE 101 CLASS](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dungeons-and-dragons-101-tickets-96811215953)

Then you follow that link and reserve your FREE ticket.

You'll notice there are only 10 tickets available for The Roving DM event, that's because I want to keep the group fairly small in order to give all players the chance to roll dice and get in the game.

Still need more details? Okay.

This event is essentially a Zero Session made up of whoever reserves a ticket for that particular game. We will have an hour at the start for introductions and to character creation and then the game will start.

If you like the players you meet you can then choose to start your own group OR you can go to the next event and meet some new players.

All levels of experience welcome!

What's the catch? 

No catch, per se. However the reason I am able to offer this event for free is because our hosts don't charge a venue or table fee so please be sure to support them by sampling their awesome drinks.

Also, IF you are able to make a donation of new or unused school supplies for our local underfunded classrooms they would really appreciate it!

Well, that's it. If you have any questions or need clarification on what exactly the event is comment or drop me a DM and I'll be more than happy to answer your questions. 

Stay up!",sandiego,Learn to play Dungeons and Dragons! 2 FREE events this month. Links and details inside!

Ever wanted to learn how to sword fight like you’re a Witcher or need to challenge a usurper to your kingdom like in Game of Thrones?  Well now you can with San Diego Swordfighters!  

Actually, we’ll teach you to sword fight better than the King Slayer or Geralt of Rivia!  Unlike the flashy but impractical moves you see on television, [San Diego Swordfighters](https://www.sdswordfighters.com/) studies and teaches Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) using actual surviving fighting manuals written by knights, scholars and fencing masters in the Late Medieval and Renaissance period.  This isn’t a LARP or reenactment group!  We study centuries old fighting systems using modern methods and practice sword fighting as a martial art and [sporting competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zueF4Mu2uM).  We currently meet up every Saturday afternoon at 2pm outside of Morley Field Sports Complex in Balboa Park, and will be starting a week nightpractice soon.  All (16yo+) are welcome and no experience is necessary, we have plenty of swords and equipment to loan to first timers.

Check us out at [sdswordfighters.com](https://www.sdswordfighters.com/) and join our mailing list to stay up to date on schedule, class announcements and other info about sword fighting in San Diego.  In the meantime, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have here.

I’ve never been out in 21+ establishments before, and don’t have many friends older than me to show me around. My base knowledge about drinking/nightlife is basically zero.

I’m in PB, and would prefer to not go too far. 

I like the idea of having an activity associated with the drinking rather than drinking being the activity itself if that makes sense. I’m not a fan of really loud or crowded places. Clubs and raves do not appeal to me. I would prefer places with a more chill, laid back atmosphere. 

So far my list includes the Comedy Store (la jolla) and Dueling Pianos (downtown). I also like the idea of paint and sips or like boozy terrarium building workshops (I saw that on Groupon somewhere).

Typing this out, I am thinking some type of vouchers where kids can go to various listed stores can go and pick up selected items like cereal, canned food, milk, boxed food, would be ideal and safer probably instead of having to set up various places where food can be picked up.

I was super annoyed about the toilet paper situation. In fact, I heard one of my own neighbors buying toilet paper last week at the smart and final say“I don’t even need this, but thought I should stock up cause of the news reports”. Well first off, fuck that old bitch. I just went in my garage and realized my wife and I have a little extra, so if you need it, DM me and I will get you a role (we have about 8 extra roles so don’t greedy). If you got some extra TP, or anything that people are hoarding for no reason, share it! 

Once it is gone I will throw an edit on here.

3399,G8BigCongrats730,1584119172,fi2yjn,Nan,"I keep seeing memes and post about the Coronavirus that seem downplay the potential seriousness of this virus. People keep saying it’s a big media scare, a liberal hoax, that it is like the flu and not a big deal, the mortality rate isn’t very high unless your elderly or have preexisting conditions, etc, etc. I want share some of the reasons I think people really need to be taking this threat more seriously and how some of the numbers that are out there right now can look pretty scary (the same numbers that many people seem to be using to downplay the risk). 

Dr. Brian Monhan, the attending physician of Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court has said that he expects between 70 million and 150 million people in the U.S. will contract the virus (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/up-to-150-million-americans-are-expected-to-contract-the-coronavirus-congressional-doctor-says.html). With a U.S. population of 327.2 million people this means 46% of the population would contract the virus if 150 million people are infected. That’s almost 1 in 2 people in the entire country. According to the World Health Organization, the reproductive number of the Coronavirus is thought to be between 2 and 2.5 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_2) That is the number of people that 1 infected person spreads the virus to. With a reproductive number of 2 that puts this virus spread at an exponential rate. If you look at any exponential growth chart, you can see how fast the graph starts to rise (https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra1/FunctionGraphs/FNGTypeExponential.html). And we are not yet at the point on the graph where the numbers start to take off. That is why it is extremely important we get this spread rate down drastically. The World Health Organization also reports that the incubation period for the Coronavirus is anywhere between 1-14 days with 5 days being the most common (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). That is the time it takes from when someone is infected until they start showing symptoms. That means someone that starts showing symptoms today, might have been infected up to two weeks ago. Think of all the places you’ve gone and people you’ve interacted with in the past two weeks. That’s a long time for people to be out in public spreading the virus before they could be quarantined to stop spreading it. How early a person can start shedding the virus after being infected doesn’t seem to be clearly known yet. However, there are reports coming out that it could be very early in the infection (https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-could-be-most-contagious-before-symptoms-occur-study-suggests-11955118)  In comparison, the flu has an incubation period of between 1-4 days with 2 days being the average.  

Now let’s look at the impact this virus could have if we were to truly reach 150 million affected and assuming the current statistics on mortality rates and rates of intensive care needed are accurate. Please keep in mind that these scenarios are using the worse estimates that we have so far. I’m not saying I think this will definitely play out like this but I think it’s important that people understand the real life impacts this virus could actually have. I see many people still not taking this seriously and seem to be naïve to the fact that the U.S. could see a very drastic situation in the coming weeks and months.

The World Health Organization currently puts the global mortality rate at 3.4%. However, new information is constantly coming out and new reports are saying it is likely much lower than that. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimates that the actual mortality is probably closer to 1% (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/top-federal-health-official-says-coronavirus-outbreak-is-going-to-get-worse-in-the-us.html) This is still 10x more deadly than the seasonal flu with a mortality rate of .1%. If 150 million people were to become infected and the mortality rate is truly 1%, 1.5 million people would die from this virus in the U.S. That’s .46% of the population or about 1 in every 217 people.

Now if we look at what would happen if our health care system were to be overwhelmed based on the amount of people needing ICU care, the numbers get pretty scary. The U.S. has about 100,000 total ICU beds. (https://www.sccm.org/Communications/Critical-Care-Statistics) With an average of 63%-66% in use at any given time. This means there are about 37,000 ICU beds available at any given time. If we assume that the average Coronavirus ICU patient will need an average of 10 days in the ICU (this is the statistic from flu ICU patients) the U.S. health care system could theoretically take on about an additional 112,000 ICU patients per month. This is actually a very generous number considering it doesn’t take into account medical professionals falling ill and numerous other factors that likely make it much less. And if you talk to any healthcare professional, they will tell you that things already get strained when their bed counts start getting full. We already have a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals in this country. But we will use this 112,000 number for this scenario. The most common statistic being used for the estimated rate that patients need ICU care around the world is 5%. That would mean over the course of a year, 7.5 million people would need ICU care for the Coronavirus with an average monthly rate of 625,000 people. Keep in mind that this scenario is assuming an even distribution of cases over a full year and an even geographical distribution of cases throughout the health care system. This is not how it will play out as the virus will hit a peak at some point and it likely will not be evenly dispersed geographically. There will be pockets that will get hit harder than others. But for this scenario we will assume an even distribution. 
As you can see, if these numbers play out to be true the situation becomes very drastic. That’s a potential shortage of over 500,000 Coronavirus patients each month that need ICU care. Over the course of a year that is over 6 million people that could potential die because they could not receive the care they needed. If we add back in the original 1.5 million deaths from the 1% mortality rate, we are over 7 million potential deaths in the U.S due to lack of available medical care. That’s 2.1% of our population or about 1 in every 50 people. That means if this scenario were to actually play out, you would almost definitely know someone that will die from Coronavirus. 

Now obviously this scenario is assuming the worse and hopefully all the numbers that are currently being reported turn out to be much less when all is said and done. But I still see people being naïve to the fact that this is a real and serious situation that will impact everyone in this country and around the world. I think it’s important that people see what this virus could potentially do. No one should begin to panic because that is never helpful in any situation. However, everyone should know the real potential risk of this virus so everyone can start taking steps to minimize the spread. We need to stop comparing it to the flu, SARS, Ebola, or anything else. We have never seen the levels that governments around the world are going to stop the spread of this virus. Entire countries would not be shutting down if the experts didn’t think this was a significant risk to millions of people. This is likely a once a century global level pandemic.  So please, stop sharing memes and posts that minimize this threat or compare it to other viruses and start taking your own steps to minimize the spread.  Let’s all hope that there is time to get in front of this and lessen the overall impact this will have. But most importantly, if things do take a turn for the worse in this country, I really hope everyone will remain civil and can work together despite our differences.  

I’m obviously not an expert in pandemics by any means. And I’m sure there are many errors in my very rudimentary research and calculations. However, the basic math checks out based on the numbers that are being presented to the public at this time. My scenario is also on the very far end of how extreme it could get. It most likely will not play out to this worst case scenario but the risk increases the longer this virus spreads. It will all depend on how well we can control the spread and how much it actually ends up overwhelming our healthcare system. Unless you have an absolutely need, everyone should be staying home and avoiding public places as much as they can. I know some people will read this and look at it as alarmist or extreme but I think its important people understand the severity of what’s happening. These measures to prevent the spread are going to have severe impacts to our economy, and I don’t take that lightly, but at this point we may not have any other options.",sandiego,Hi fellow San Diego Redditors.

Everybody has guides on how to prevent the spread of coronavirus, which is all fine and good, but I think the most important thing to remember during these scary times is that you specifically shouldn’t give it to me. So I made a little guide for you to follow to keep me safe. Thanks. 

**Wash your hands:** Remember how cool it was last year when we didn’t have to wash our hands? That was fun. Like, going to the bathroom and then high-fiving your bestie: what a blast! Don’t even get me started on rummaging through the Sizzler salad bar with your unwashed paws. That iceberg lettuce feels really super good on the ole skin. Sadly, we must adapt to the times. Please wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, but ideally do it for five minutes just to be sure.  

**Don’t talk to me:** We now know that the coronavirus is spread through little spit particles that fly from your mouth and land on my tongue. For this reason, I ask that you abstain from talking to me, especially if it’s in a loud, threatening voice, or if it’s to critique my writing, election guide, or physical appearance. If you have a compliment for me, then that’s fine. You may talk to me.

Local hospitals are already changing their protocols on the numbers of people who can attend births (doulas, friends, family) and waiting rooms are being cleared out. Hospital resources will be stretched and potentially redirected or reduced. Homebirth is a safe, reasonable and viable option for healthy, low-risk, singleton pregnancies. I know that a homebirth can sound like a lot of money up front, but I AM WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU. I'm sure other midwives will too. We want you to have a safe birth and if you don't want to go to a hospital, we can help you have a safe homebirth.

3441,maalbi,1584137825,fi7ygc,Nan,"Dear Friends,

San Diego Zoo Global is first and foremost a family. We are a family of employees, volunteers, members, fans, and donors who make up our community. The current health concerns are creating challenges for all of us, and I wanted to reach out to all of you personally, and let you know we recognize the gravity of the evolving situation and are working to do our part to protect the health and welfare of our community and the wildlife in our care.

We recognize that visiting the San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park is much more than experiencing wildlife up close, but also represents important family time, an escape from daily lives, an opportunity to enjoy rich educational experiences, a chance to get outdoors and enjoy fresh air and exercise, and an unparalleled opportunity to share the wonder of the natural world with family and friends. 

As outdoor facilities that care for a variety of animal species, the staff at the Zoo and the Safari Park have for years been committed to maintaining the healthiest of environments for our animals and our guests, and at no time in our history has that long-standing experience and commitment proven more valuable than right now. At the San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, we offer numerous handwashing locations and regularly clean all areas to ensure the safety of staff, guests and the animals in our care. During this period of heightened concern, we are increasing these practices and providing additional opportunities for guests and staff to follow the recommended practices of regular handwashing, sanitizing and social distancing.

This situation is fluid and evolving. Our parks remain open, welcoming guests, tours and programs operating as scheduled. We are monitoring the CDC’s evolving standards, as well as city and state government advisories, and will communicate with all of you as the situation progresses. 

The safety of our guests, staff and volunteers, and the animals in our care is, and always will be, our highest priority.

Thank you for being a member of the San Diego Zoo Global family. 

 

Sincerely,

Paul Baribult",sandiego,San Diego Zoo not closing yet. Here's their message :

The coming weeks are when we must have more patience, otherwise we will tear each other apart before any pathogen does. 

During this pandemic, we cannot depend on leadership at the national level. Mayor Faulconer, the mayors of our sister cities and governor Newson must step up proactive quarantine measures. Early and sustained proactive quarantine measures will help lessen the length and severity on our local healthcare, financial and economic systems.

We decisively prepare as a community now or risk panic in half-baked measures. You or someone in your family will likely get infected, the masks and gloves you have isn’t just for outdoor use, but to protect yourselves for when you have to provide nursing care for those at home because hospital beds are full. Get bandaid tape and seal the edges of your surgical masks to your skin. Consider eyewear protection, a rain suit or a face shield from a hardware store to conserve your limited protection supplies. Every bit helps. Don’t think only certain masks help. If you are unknowingly infected, it’ll will help limit spread, it will help prevent you from touching your face. If you have extra protection, consider donating to our frontline healthcare workers. If they fall, we’re next. We must each sacrifice on our part to survive as a whole. 

This fight belongs to all of us, but what do us common folks fight with? Our greatest weapons as a species is our humanity and hope. My family immigrated to America from a country that once lived under 1,000 years of oppression. Its people never stopped rebelling and never gave up. We will get through this, the question we can guide is how much will we lose when it is over. 

Today, I heard the President of the United States say on live television, “I don’t know anything, I don’t know anything.” It doesn’t matter whatever the question was, that response is unacceptable for any leader let alone one leading a country with over 300 million people.

The gov and news outlets really didnt get the point across well. In short, if we as a community distance ourselves from others and wash our hands and watch what we touch and who we interact with and stay inside if we even feel slightly under the weather. The reason its spread so quickly around the world is because people didnt take it seriously, just look at Italy right now. And by taking it seriously I dont mean panic and start stockpiling your doomsday bunker. 

I understand it's good to stock up more than your usual grocery run, but please please be smart about it! Go at odd hours of the day, ma and pa shops rather than big box stores, and only get what you need realistically!

3583,diablorojo6337,1584247874,fiw4cd,Nan,"First and foremost, thank you to the bystanders in OB who helped me this afternoon when I fell on my motorcycle at the intersection of Sunset Cliffs and Saratoga. From the guy who moved my bike to the guy who offered me his flannel and bought me ice as I waited for further help, as well as the woman who left me her contact information, you were all so wonderful and made life better when I needed help. I’d also like to thank the emergency services personnel who helped me as well, they were friendly and professional. 

To whoever was driving the black SUV who was in such a hurry to cross Sunset Cliffs that they cut me off and then floored it up Saratoga towards Ebers after I clearly hit the ground, well, I think things have a way of eventually balancing themselves out. 

That being said, I’m grateful for the good people who saw something and did something. While many of us question in what direction the world’s headed, today I witnessed more people do good than bad, and I take that as a positive sign.

Last night I went to Albertsons for a few more things.  I feel I have enough food and medicine to last me for a month or so but just wanted to stock up on treats for myself. (Pizza rolls and coke)  Before I went in, I decided to wear my N95 face mask.  I had bought 6 of them 2 months ago when I first read about this virus.

When i walked in i had lots of people staring at me.  People laughed to their partners or some scowled at me or shook their heads disapprovingly.  One man in the check out line flat out told me I'm over reacting.

With all the warnings from the government, from our scientists, and from the events in China and Italy...   Why am I not seeing more people in masks or taking more precautions?  One lady told me she wanted to but felt ""goofy"" and didnt want people to laugh at her.  I see posts on here making fun of people preparing and those posts get a lot of upvotes.  (I'm not talking about TP hoarders).

So are we going to wait until the O SHIT it's to late for San Diego moment?  Are you waiting for our government to tell us what to do?  I know we have very little information but it feels like no one wants to look silly in a mask and that may be our downfall.

But it really freaked me out and blew my mind how packed little italy was with people in restuarants and at bars. I work at Animae over at the new bosa building by santa fe depot. My restaurant does not give a flying fuck about the 6 ft rule. They are jampacking as many people as they can into the restaurant. Even one of the managers yesterday was misinforming people that the Netherlands already has a vaccine. I told my chef that I needed to leave early he hesitated but he let me go after they realized that reservations were dropping last night. In my opinion it is embarrassing how the restaurant industry is handling the situation. The only big name restaurant I know that is actually following cdc rules is Juen et Jolie up in Carlsbad. But as a restaurant employee I hope this shit hits restaurants hard especially if the border closes. Call me crazy an asshole but unfortunately the employees that I work with actually want it to shut down. 2 coworkers cross the border and wouldnt mind the border shutting down. I know that not everyone is in the position to stay at home because a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck. But the reality is if people don't give a flying fuck no one will be able to go to a restaurant in a week or two. Also one of the sous chefs has a cough and a fever and was allowed to work like that because he wanted to and he was necessary. Restaurants are part of the problem because they don't give a fuck. I can see myself finally leaving it after this calms down by the fall(because I don't see it happening any soon). Please. If you do want to eat at your favorite restaurant order take out. We don't need people inside a building talking and talking and just spreading this shit. Rant over. Thank you.,sandiego,As a restaurant employee. (Rant)

WRITTEN BY COSTCO EMPLOYEE:

I work for Costco. We have had an exhausting week. Here are some things you should know and pass along to others.......

NO, we can't tell you when the next delivery is. We don't know. And if we did know and told you, the stuff would probably be sold out before you got there.....

NO we can't save (insert missing item here) for you, or give you a pallet for next Tuesday. We are cash and carry.

NO we don't carry hand sanitizer -- never did.

NO we don't open early for exec members (never have) -- business delivery does but they don't have any of the items you need either.

YES, it's crazy, thank the mainstream media for whipping everyone up into an unnecessary frenzy. Thank you to some of the members who get that.

YES there is a line...if you want water, get in it.

YES there is a limit (now). NO you can't exceed it.

YES, I did just have to act like a preschool teacher and tell grown adults NOT to run and mind the lines.

YES I am a font of retail information where it relates to Costco, but NO, I do not know what they are doing at any other store, nor do I care. (why on earth would I know that???)

We are out of rice, some canned goods, and several other things. Water and paper, along with bleach and wipes, are intermittent deliveries. We may have things scheduled, but we truly don't know if they will be in or not. The shelves are emptier than I have ever seen in my 16+ years there. The phones are crazy, as is the warehouse.

If you are buying this stuff to mark up on eBay and keep your other fellow humans from just having the TP and water that are necessary to live a good life, you are not good humans. If you are doing that AND being rude to our employees, I question whether you are human at all......

We would appreciate it greatly if you would NOT be rude to our incredibly hard working employees.
The situation was NOT created by them, is not their fault, and we are ALL doing our best to handle the day and help you all out with ANY purchase you make. Just. STOP.

Please pray for us Costco retail minions and check on us, frequently. We are NOT holding up well.....(sigh)

""The Hillcrest Business Association has learned that a  customer that tested positive for the coronavirus frequented several businesses in Hillcrest earlier in the week. We understand that several staff at UCSD Medical Center Hillcrest have also tested positive for the virus. Hillcrest businesses and organizations are taking all responsible steps to address this and minimize transmission in the neighborhood. 


Hillcrest businesses are coordinating efforts to sanitize their establishments; have their staff and impacted customers self quarantine; and in some cases, close their doors. The HBA encourages all guests who are vulnerable to not be in gathering places in Hillcrest. We also encourage all guests that are in contact or were in contact with anyone sick or not feeling well to stay home. We are attending to the recommendations from the CDC and from local authorities.  


The community of Hillcrest is very familiar with epidemics and has successfully confronted them in the past. Hillcrest is coming together as a community to share information and implement best practices.  


The following steps have been undertaken: 


-The Hillcrest Farmers Market, an event produced by the HBA, will be cancelled for the remainder of this month. This means that the market will be closed on Sundays March 15, 22, and 29. We will keep you informed when we have a confirmation on the market's re-opening.


-The monthly Hillcrest Classic Car Show, scheduled for Saturday, March 21, is cancelled. We will confirm when we have more information the status of April's car show.


-Taste of Hillcrest, scheduled for Saturday, April 11, is being rescheduled to Saturday, May 23. Additional information will be sent out soon.


As for other Hillcrest businesses, many are most concerned about the status of the larger gathering places like bars and nightclubs, and Hillcrest is home to many. An ongoing list of bar and nightclub closures, along with other major community events and venue, has been posted here. The list will be updated as new information is received, so check it frequently. Information that we have now includes:


-Rich's San Diego: Closed until further notice.

-Uptown Tavern: Closed until further notice.

-Mo's Universe: All 5 locations are currently open, exercising additional sanitation and safety measures.

I still wanna help out in some way, but there’s no direct donation option available. Even if I did donate, my $40 isn’t going to go very far to be distributed amongst the many vendors available on that site. So I wanna give $10 or whatever amount to four people who may be interested in placing an order (maybe more $ or people, IDK). It can go toward the $15 delivery fee (pickup is free though!), or you can add an item in your cart you’ve been curious about (lots of fancy plant-based alternatives, but they can def get pricy), or whatever you want there! Just figured encouraging others to order could benefit them more. Message me if you wanna have $10 for this!

Make a BEAN BAG out of an old SOCK.  Put dried beans in sock, sock inside of a sock a few times.  You can also use RICE, or sand or dirt - use a small sandwich bag, then put plastic bag inside the layers of socks.

Now that you have a BEAN BAG - you can make a corn hole, or bean bag toss game in the house.

Make a target - A large bowl, a cookie sheet, a small dishrag, or chalk and draw a circle or square on the ground.

Take 5 large steps - Adults take adult steps, little Kids take little kid steps   Or - Make it a drop game - drop from the balcony, the stair railing.

Score: 3 Points - in the target, 2 points outside but touching.  1 Point i it is within one human foot of the target. The smallest person must use the largest (adult) foot, the big people must use the smallest foot.  The medium sized people use their own foot

Score tracking:  Use beans in a cup, or tally marks, or small stones/rocks you find outside.

The vocals were also done by me for all Original labeled songs.  


I do not consider myself a great lyricist or vocalist, so I am 100% open to scrapping any vocals I have put down previously and replacing the with something you write. I am also interested in hearing any demos you may have.  


Additionally, here are a couple videos of my drumming if you are interested in seeing my chops:

Here's the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/ffzrlv/cross_reddit_border_meetup_free_tijuana_brewery/). The plan still stands even with all the Corona Virus fear!!! Only canceling if they in fact announce they will shut down the border or if things keep getting even weirder in this 2020. 

As of now, Tijuana is still virtually the same as always, a bit slower because of fewer tourists, but it remains the same ole crazy Tj. 

Tour starts at 3:00 pm from the PedWest Border and it will include a number of brewery stops (and tacos). I'm not sure how many people I'm expecting, so I plan to improvise. The other Reddit mods will also be with me! (DeepDiveDylan and his husband will be at the meetup spot, Polygonic will wait for us at a brewery). 

The /r/Tijuana Meetup starts at 5:00 PM over at the new Madueño in Calle Sexta!!! 

If you want to skip the tour and go straight to the meetup, do that!!

Any questions, let me know.",sandiego,Reddit Cross Border Tour + Meetup is still going on this Saturday at 3:00 pm!

 Corona virus infection does not cause a cold with a dripping nose or catarrhal cough, but a dry cough: this is the easiest thing to know.


 
The virus does not resist heat and dies if exposed to temperatures of 26-27C degrees: therefore often consume hot drinks such as tea, herbal tea and broth during the day, or simply hot water: hot liquids neutralize the virus.  Avoid drinking ice water or eating ice cubes or snow for those in the mountains (children)!


For those who can do it, expose yourself to the sun!


The virus crown is quite large (diameter about 400-500 nanometers), therefore any type of mask can stop it: in normal life, special masks are not needed.


On the other hand, the situation is different for doctors and health professionals who are exposed to heavy virus loads and have to use special equipment.


 If an infected person sneezes in front of you, three meters away they will drop the virus on the ground and prevent it from landing on you.


When the virus is found on metal surfaces, it survives for about 12 hours.  So when you touch metal surfaces such as handles, doors, appliances, supports on trams, etc., wash your hands well and disinfect them carefully.


The virus can live nested in clothes and fabrics for about 6/12 hours: normal detergents can kill it.  For clothes that cannot be washed every day, if you can expose them to the sun, the virus will die.


     How it manifests itself:

     1. The virus first installs itself in the throat, causing inflammation and a dry throat sensation: this symptom can last for 3/4 days.


     2. the virus travels through the humidity present in the airways, descends into the trachea and installs in the lung, causing pneumonia.  This step takes about 5/6 days.


    3. Pneumonia occurs with high fever and difficulty breathing, it is not accompanied by the classic cold.  But you may have the feeling of drowning.  In this case, contact your doctor immediately.


     How can you avoid it:


     1. Virus transmission occurs mostly by direct contact, touching tissues or materials on which the virus is present: washing hands frequently is essential.


     The virus only survives on your hands for about ten minutes, but in ten minutes many things can happen: rub your eyes or scratch your nose for example, and allow the virus to enter your throat ...


     So, for your own good and for the good of others, wash your hands very often and disinfect them!


     2. You can gargle with a disinfectant solution that eliminates or minimizes the amount of virus that could enter your throat: in doing so, you eliminate it before it goes down into the trachea and then into the lungs.


     3. disinfect the PC keyboard and mobile phones


     The new coronavirus NCP * may not show signs of infection for many days, * before which it cannot be known if a person is infected.  But by the time you have a fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, your lungs are usually already in 50% fibrosis and it's too late!


     Taiwanese experts suggest doing a simple check that we can do on our own every morning:


     Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds.  If you successfully complete it without coughing, without discomfort, a sense of oppression, etc., this shows that there is no fibrosis in the lungs, indicating essentially no infection.


     In such critical times, do this check every morning in a clean air environment!


Everyone should make sure that their mouth and throat are moist, never DRY.  Drink a few sips of water at least every 15 minutes.  WHY?  Even if the virus gets into your mouth ... water or other liquids will sweep it away through the esophagus and into the stomach.  Once in the belly ... Gastric acid in the stomach will kill all the virus.  If you don't drink enough water more regularly ... the virus can get into your trachea and lungs.",sandiego,Some good info re. Covid-19

I'm doing my best to socially distance and flatten the curve. One way I'm contributing is by limiting my grocery store visits and avoiding busy stores. 

The problem is, I've found it difficult to stock up and break the habit of going many times per week.

When I go to the store, they don't have what I'm looking for. If the item is there, I try not to horde and make it harder for others. 

I want to use my time in quarantine to eat extra healthy and boost my immune system, but I can't find fresh produce.

I'm curious what you guys are doing, and what your experience has been like so far.

Have you ordered grocery delivery recently? What was your experience like? Did you get what you wanted, was delivery even an option? I tried yesterday and there were ""no delivery slots available"".

Besides TP and hand sanitizer, what items have you been unable to find?

Did you need to wait in lines to check out or to get into the store? Did shopping require you to be in close contact with many people? My friend said there were around 500 people waiting to get into Costco this morning. Isn't that the opposite of social distancing?

Also, does anyone know what's happening with farmers markets or local farms? They have the produce I need! I'm uncertain, but I think farmers markets will close. Have you heard of any farms offering produce delivery or farm stands?

The stores aren't empty, and we won't starve. I just hope we will continue to have safe access to healthy foods.",sandiego,What are you guys doing to buy groceries right now? Please share your experience.

About 4 months or so ago, I put an ad here for a D&amp;D group that I wanted to DM for. The results were staggering, I think I received somewhere around 16-20 pms interested in joining, far more than I was expecting! It was to the extent where I had to put out a waitlist, and spent much of the next two days coordinating and seeing who would be a good fit. In the end, I ended up with a group of four. The first two PMs I got were for a couple and a pair of friends, so that was the ticket!   


I ended up meeting them at the local friendly gaming shop (TC's Rockets, wonderful place that I highly suggest going to when quarantine is over,) and met with the pairs. Instantly on both counts there was chemistry. They were interested in my homebrew setting, they were interested in the story put forth, and there was no struggle with rules or any sort of thing. All 5 of us were on the same page.   


The next time I had the chance, I had the whole group meet at TC's rockets. We got their characters acquainted, got the ball rolling, and hooked them into the first real session where the story begins. For the first hour, I didn't have to do anything. They roleplayed in the tavern, got to know eachother in-character, and I swooned like a little girl. Everyone clicked just as we had on individual basis, and we decided to forgo going to the shop entirely and decided to simply meet at one of the player's houses instead so that we could drink while we played-- and also a place of comfort for us all.   


The rest is history, we've had 15 sessions now, they're level 4, and I adore them all. We've had our share of intrigue RP, our chaotic battles, and ever-growing story. Last night they won yet another battle that I was certain was IMPOSSIBLE for them and I got a loud cheer at the end of it. That, my friends, is how to make a DM feel complete. I am so excited to continue this long journey with them, and this subreddit is to thank for giving the community a place to fish for new adventures.

More than three-quarters of American workers would qualify for this tax relief.

3/16 - Republican Senator Mitt Romney proposed sending all adults a one-time check for $1,000 to help their families meet financial obligations during the crisis, part of a call for “urgent action on additional coronavirus response measures aimed at providing economic relief for working Americans and families.”

Hey,

I know everyone is under stress, and I'm sorry for what you and your loved ones are going through. I know a lot of people are asking for your attention and donations; thank you *so* much for everything you are able to offer someone else in need right now. I don't know if this type of post is normally allowed and I wouldn't normally make it, but I'm doing it now because of how desperate the situation for unsheltered people in this city is at the moment.

Some hotel vouchers have been issued, but homeless service providers and individuals have been given little to no direction and we do not yet know how to access them or who to contact. **In a time when hygiene and physical distance are so critical, there are NO government buildings for them to go to (no parks and rec, no libraries) to shower and wash hands, and many other places and people that usually offer support have closed down.** That means everyone gathered together in the same places with less ability to stay clean.

With no libraries, our unsheltered community has far less access to critical public health and resource information. **For those who had a phone or internet device before, now they have no where to charge it. And those who don't have a phone and depended on the library for internet access and communication are now totally in the dark.**

There are far fewer resources out there for everything else, **hardly anywhere to get FOOD** aside from the major shelters, who are already packed and limiting service. If you are at all able, **please consider donating to an organization that helps unsheltered people TODAY.**

My agency, Think Dignity, is listed below (I would like to be able to provide hygiene essentials to my clients, if not more), or donate to the County's emergency response fund, which is helping to cover all sorts of economic costs during the crisis, including getting shelter for people outside. Thank you reddit community for always staying on top of things! and take care &lt;3

I understand that gloves is one of the things institutions are running short on, and I want to make sure that these get in to the hands of people who can use them the most, rather than hoarders. 

Since San Diego has a large amount of hospitals and research facilities, does anyone know of a place that needs them and a contact? I'm willing to donate all of these to local institutions if they need them and are able to take them.

I've seen lots of folks trying to figure out a productive way to help the community as we enter the Twilight Zone. I'm a higher education professional at one of the schools closing our residence halls. As much of a nightmare this has been for us, it's more of a nightmare for our students who will experience homelessness or food insecurity as a result of this. Everyone is trying to make as many exceptions as we can for students who cannot afford to go home or have nowhere to go, but the County ordinances are making this harder every day. It's so hard to see the nasty comments people are leaving assuming that the school only cares about money. This has been a heartbreaking week for us. Please be kind, we are doing the best we can under circumstances that change by the hour. 

If you are able, please consider calling up the Student Affairs divisions at the local schools and asking what their food pantries might need. Most of us have pantries that serve our food insecure students, These are also emptying out faster as students panic grab. These students are likely going to be here and will need food. We are doing our best to make trips to the store but we're having a hard time keeping up. This really could go a long way in helping students feel more secure.

Suggestions might include: 

1. Gift cards to places like Ralphs, Target, Amazon, etc. Places that also include cleaning supplies would be great.
2. Actually purchasing non-perishables, hygiene products like soaps, pads, tampons, shampoos, etc, and donating them.
3. Asking if students need financial support in going home. Gift cards for airlines, gas, or Visa gift cards could go a long way.  

Stay healthy friends. We can make it! Thanks for reading and considering.",sandiego,Consider buying what you can for university food pantries

 About 2 years ago I decided to join the corrections department and my first offer was in Susanville near Reno Nevada so I took it and left for a year because I was looking for a better future for me and my son. My ex never gave me a penny. I would come down here to see my son every month. I took him with me and the person that was gonna help me with my son got sick so I had to brought him back, so I tried. In August of last year I was finally able to transfer and my son started living with me. He was seeing his dad too. I recently applied for child support and he was furious and then to add to that he met my current boy grunt accident and he flipped and the truth is because he thought maybe he had a chance with me. About a month ago I went to korea to visit my brother but the main thing was he was graduating from school and nobody was gonna go see him. The covid 19 was still small there at the time only like 30 cases but I did tried to cancel my flight and nobody never helped me with that so I went. I left my son with my mother and one day he shows up there and tells her he was gonna go out with him to eat he never brought My son back. When arrive next day I went to the hospital the check myself and they did testing on me and told me I was clear no virus I still decided to do the quarantine just for safety to my son. 3 days ago I went to pick up my son and he was outside with him, he grabbed him and ran inside and wouldn’t open the door I was shocked I called the police and they showed up I told them he lives with me and he took it but they asked for custody paperwork which I don’t have we never went to court to get any custody. So they said we can talk to him but there’s nothing we can do. I went again the same day later and the sister opened the door and she was yelling at me to leave and call the cops on me . He blocked me I been trying to contact him nothing. I feel like if this was an abduction. The amount of pain I’m feeling it’s something never felt before, I can’t eat I can’t sleep I can’t focus. Court it’s closed till April. Can I call the police and try to get my so if he’s with another person is there really nothing I can do.

Healthcare workers, here, are dangerously low on PPE.
My wife is an HCP. Shes being asked to intubate patients without an N95. This is insane. 

The only reason she had a mask is because my best friend found some leftover in his garage and gave them to her. 

If you have masks, give them to a nurse, doctor, or better yet, directly to the hospital. They will take them. They need them desperately.

4158,EntheogenicTheist,1584696310,fls474,Nan,"Just wanted to post this because I see a lot of people asking if they can go outside, walk their dog, exercise..etc. during the stay at home order. The answer is \*\*yes\*\*.

The governor didn't specifically list every possible activity in crafting this order, because that's not the intent. They have limited enforcement capabilites and aren't going to citing people for technicalites. The point of the order is to keep people safe and healthy by following the spirit of social distancing.

Thus, it's obviously okay to jog down the street, or sit on a hill, or hike in the wilderness. None of those things would increase your risk of contracting Covid at all. So, they're allowed. In fact, they're recommended! To keep your immune system and mental outlook healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need more reassurance, similar shelter-in-place orders have been issued for several counties in the state. Many were issued at the same time as the governor's order, and they all include exceptions for outdoor exercise. The governor's order doesn't include these things simply because it isn't meant to be so specific.

So please, use common sense and follow the spirit of the rule. You don't need permission from the state to do every tiny little thing; just limit your time around other people to what's absolutely necessary.

Just wanted to post this so we don't see a few suicides or heart attacks tacked on to the Covid death toll. Stay safe everyone.",sandiego,You can still go outside

I'm not of the mindset that lives will be changed here but just hoping it can help just a bit

- To accommodate more people I will be lowering each card to $75 which should allow for an increase of 33% recipients

- Premise remains similar, reply here (*please don't message me as that became too difficult to keep track of*; though I also understand if you don't want to make it public) with either your situation or just say ""I'd like one"" ALONG with a preference for grubhub/doordash/ubereats (otherwise I'll send a random one) and I'll send you a code to redeem. **No actual reason is necessary** 

- It will not be first come first serve like last time, **instead I will begin disbursing tomorrow, Saturday, afternoon** to replies here. It may take a few days to complete the goal as I discovered the sites above limit gift card purchases ( generally $2k per day)

Fine-ish print:

- Accounts should be at least 1 week old to prevent any duplicates but if one wants to try hard enough to game the system I won't make an effort to stop it

- Use it for anything you'd like such as loading up on 100 McChickens (are they still $1?) if it stretches your money more, but the spirit here is to help the local community and its restaurants

- If you don't personally need it but know someone who could use it either in San Diego or out of city/state you're more than welcome as well. 

- I will absolutely not offended by anyone that wants to jump in this thread, if a post doesn't get a reply that means that person is eligible still

- The goal is not set in stone, market conditions are an influence here as well

I know that finances are a tough conversation to have as they are so personal. It's especially difficult to ask a figure of financial authority for help. I wanted to pass along to everyone in case you are in a situation in which you need to ask your landlord to help work with you during these times in which it may be difficult to pay rent on time. There seems to be a bit of a social movement to not pay rent in some areas, this is equally harmful for the economy, the landlords, and the banks. Cashflow needs to occur, even if its a reduced about.

For context, they asked for help with their rent payment and their landlord sent back small loan information for them to look into. I don't feel that a small loan is beneficial for anyone at this time and it's why I helped them with this. It is written to their situation but can be easily edited to apply to yours! Hopefully everyone gets the idea of what I'm getting at below and understands that I do not know the housing and tenant laws in your local areas so things may also need to be adjusted for that.

If you have any questions and want to talk to me directly about your personal situation so I can help draft a more tailored plan for you, I'm happy to help! PM me!

Hang in there everyone! Sending all my love to each of you! If anyone has any suggestions to improve this from an economic perspective, not a grammatical or wording one, please please say something! 

Drafted Rent Plan:

I understand the terms of our [TIME FRAME] lease and that the entire house is rented. I am not trying to dispute that in the slightest. I talked this over with some of my friends to try to propose a solution in the best interest for everyone. I want to address this with you pragmatically and look at the big picture to find a solution that works for all of us. I feel it is in our best interest to work this out directly and not rely on banks, emergency policies and procedures, and aftermath government/litigation decisions to work through this. We are in a situation where the entire economy is impacted, your business included, and therefore I feel it's reasonable for me to suggest the following:

(You can do the math and rent)
-What you want to pay for April with late fee waived, Rent minus [DISCOUNT NEEDED]
-Deferment for the payment to be paid out OVER [# of MONTHS] months with a late fee waived or [# of MONTHS] months, giving time and 3 months to find a job that can support [PERSON] and also [# of Months] months for [PERSON] to determine if [PERSON] needs to move out and y'all need to find another roomate
-So May-October rent will be [RENT + DEFERRED $/# MONTHS DEFERMENT]
-With the agreement that if you move out before [1st of MONTH after DEFERMENT PERIOD] the outstanding balance of the [DEFERRED PAYMENT] will be paid out/deducted from the security deposit, happy to sign an addendum with this in writing
-That you kindly do not increase the rent for [# of MONTHS, I suggest 12] months as it is going to take a significant portion for the economy to recover and us to recover personally from the hardships we are currently facing and the unknown additional hardships that this pandemic is going to cause.

I feel that this keeps a portion of the cash flow coming into you with only a small portion deferred and full occupancy maintained. Please let me know what you think. I'm happy to get on the phone to discuss.",sandiego,COVID-19 Rent Payment Deferral Request Draft

She was released from work early today and went to two targets, a walmart, and tried to find any other stores that may have puzzles for sale. Every store she could think of was either out of stock or closed. Most online retailers are either out of stock or will not ship for at least a week.

4248,Googleboy1938,1584744408,fm4f5t,Nan,"I work for the largest locally-owned automotive group in San Diego County.  We are currently 'on-hold' regarding official guidance as to what to do.  Repair has been classified by the state as an 'essential' service and will remain on offer.  This makes a modicum of sense given the need to maintain reliable transportation during these surreal times.  At time of writing, our group has not issued guidance regarding the 'variable ops' departments, Sales and Finance.  In several counties, Automotive Sales are explicitly listed as non-essential and are ordered to abide by the shelter orders.

As I look out the window at our lots,  our service drive, and our shipping/receiving area, I see a handful of customers waiting for their vehicles in service.  In Sales, I see only salespeople riding the clock with nothing to do.  If it were my dealership, they would be at home right now.  Instead we, the managers, are bouncing from one group conference call to another, waiting for the group executives to make up their minds.  Their search for loopholes to the sales closure is dragging on, and on.  I'm no longer worried about the lives of the salespeople because, thankfully, the rest of you fellow San Diegans are staying home and not buying cars!

We are an institution in this town.  San Diego has been really good to our group and it's parent company (also locally-owned).  I'm embarrassed, for the first time, to be associated with this group.  The executives are prioritizing a quest for profits that don't exist, over the well-being of their employees.  A 15 to 30 day closure won't break us, it won't break the company however, 15 to 30 days of pointless and unfruitful stress and exposure may just break our loyalty to the company.

I'm not looking for your sympathy.  But I would ask that you spare a thought for the 1,300 non managers who are staying at work and manning their stations while the company pretends not to know that they are ordered to close.

I can’t find enough info online to confirm that no testing on anyone was done, but this could potentially be a huge mistake. 

Testing 2,000 people might be overkill but random testing could’ve been done. We’ve already been taught that you don’t need to show symptoms to be carrying coronavirus.

4259,Fruitsiclegourmetice,1584747723,fm5beo,Nan,"Guys,

I wish this wasn't so, but our Southern California healthcare providers NEED HELP.

Doctors, Nurses &amp; Staff are starting to get sick in record numbers, they're running dangerously low on critical supplies and the Federal Government has not committed to a date when they will be able to provide the safety equipment they need including: Goggles, Coveralls, Nitrile Gloves and N95 face masks. 

It is possible that the Government &amp; manufacturers will ramp up in time, however at this time we have no guarantee and are in a race against time.

But, there are 2 tings you can do to help:

1) If you have any extra supplies or work for a company that is shut down and has stock of any of these supplies please consider donating them to one of the following*:

-Borrego Health
-La Familia 
-Mercy Healthcare
- or a nearby hospital 

2) One of the biggest shortages are the n95 masks. A regional medical director here in San Diego (Edgar Bulloch, MD) is collecting and distributing DIY masks that doctors can wear OVER their N95 masks to help them last longer (they can swap out the sewn mask between patients, which can then be washed).

Patterns and instructions are in the resource links below. 

If you have any questions, please contact me at aaronadjemian@gmail.com and I can help facilitate pick up/drop off of the masks.

Resources:
&gt;&gt; Best material to make them out of: https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-materials-make-diy-face-mask-virus/ (TLDR: dish towel, cotton blend shirt, 100% cotton shirt; also needs to be fabric that can be washed in hot water)

&gt;&gt; Tie-back straps allow more flexibility as far as sizing, but if using elastic thinner is more comfortable (1/8"" vs 1/4"").

As you may know, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, our healthcare system is expecting low supplies of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for our health care workers. 

I have family that are Health Care Providers who need this gear and are having trouble with access.

These people are our frontline in this fight and a doctor or nurse who's infected can expose every one of their patients and/or be unable to work because of sickness.

I'm tired of sitting on the sidelines watching the bad news unfold and being unable to help. It's time WE do something. 

If you have N95 masks (even the painter variety) please donate them to the Healthcare Providers in your life and your local hospital, now. 

We need to get them into the hands of the people who need them the most; the people who are caring for our most vulnerable. 

We have to keep our healthcare workers protected and on their feet. Lives will be saved. 

We are looking for unopened un-used n95 masks. Please go to- 

www.n95donation.com

Both are costlier than your standard grocery store, but I feel a lot better knowing I was able to get some necessities with minimal human contact. So in case this is helpful to anyone:

**1. Da-Le Ranch** \- EGGS!!! Meat! Some produce.

 **How to order:** [**https://www.da-le-ranch.com/so/d5N3gciTM?fbclid=IwAR3jNFDbuHInxTeBYC5yfu7NYCE3O94RT6LUsFFRdD4JnbuQsKebLiqG4l4#/main**](https://www.da-le-ranch.com/so/d5N3gciTM?fbclid=IwAR3jNFDbuHInxTeBYC5yfu7NYCE3O94RT6LUsFFRdD4JnbuQsKebLiqG4l4#/main) 

I have not been able to get eggs ANYWHERE, so these guys were a godsend. They have a small showroom in a Sorrento Valley industrial park, and are normally only open on Fridays. But right now they're open Friday-Sunday, and they have a ton of fresh stuff. I was able to get four dozen eggs (we eat a ton of eggs in our house), and some various meats (pot roast, hamburgers, bacon). They also had two other vendors there so I got a bag of produce, too. I will say they're not really practicing social distancing especially well (though there is a hand-washing station) but they're very nice and the interactions were kept brief. If you order in advance you can do curbside pickup, but you'll have to go inside to deal with any additional vendors. I ordered in advance, and the communication wasn't the best (no confirmation that they received my order) but I figure this is new for all of us, and it worked out fine anyway. The pricing is higher than grocery stores--think farmer's market prices--around $9/dozen eggs. 

**2. Michaela's Meals** \- Fully-cooked fresh healthy meals.

**How to order:**  [**https://michaelasmeals.com/**](https://michaelasmeals.com/) 

This is a local meal prep company that focuses on fully-cooked portioned meals for a variety of diets (low carb, keto, etc.). I think all are gluten-free, too. They deliver to your door 2x a week. There are subscriptions, but you can also buy stand-alone packages (i.e. 1 week of food at a time). I've been ordering from them for the past several weeks and am really impressed with the quality of the food...and you can freeze it! They recently posted on their instagram that you can get $21 off their 21 meal package with code ""STAYHEALTHY21"". It's a little pricey but I feel relieved knowing I have some easy healthy meals that I can either refrigerate or freeze, considering all the frozen food is sold out everywhere. Not to mention they deliver it with zero human interaction.

Stay safe out there friends &lt;3",sandiego,Shout out to two local businesses for food/groceries!

4424,subbatomic,1584853460,fmufp9,Nan,"Hey San Diegans, here’s a friendly (but assertive) suggestion to PLEAS consider donating any N95 masks to your local healthcare facility!! Hospitals are already running out, and if they do, doctors and nurses can’t come to work without getting sick. You can stay home to protect yourself from catching COVID-19, doctors and nurses can’t. To protect yourself, stay home and stay away from others.  

If you think you’re sick and you want to make sure you don’t spread it to others, all you need is a surgical mask. N95 masks protect you from getting the virus, surgical masks protect you from spreading it to others  

Spread the word, not the virus",sandiego,You can help your hospitals!

Merging. When you are entering a freeway, it is your job to find a space in traffic and then either speed up or slow down to enter traffic without affecting the flow of traffic.

If you are on the freeway, slow lane in particular. Your job is to maintain your speed, and leave room in front of you. Do not slow down or speed up when someone is entering the freeway, that's their job. 

I spend a lot of time in the slow lane, I drive a lifted Jeep. I maintain a speed of 65mph for the most part with 2 to 3 car lengths open in front of me. At least once a day someone entering the freeway almost hits me because they failed to adjust their speed, and/or look to see where they were going to merge into.

1-You should be wary that many of us can be carriers of COVID19 (no testing being done) and most likely will not transfer it to your food but ordering inside to take out usually involves close proximity, and we have been busier than ever meaning there’s long lines of people inside making the room unsafe. 

2-Most of us are closing off all bathrooms. Even if you are a customer you will most likely not have access to a bathroom so be prepared. 

3- Lastly, we are NOT a grocery store, we get deliveries just like everywhere else, almost daily. The amount of complaints we’ve gotten over shortages of certain items has been through the roof. That being said, do not try to use us to stock up your fridge for a whole month. I understand a large family order but my restaurant has been getting orders up to 50 meals an hour per customer and we don’t even cater.

*Dear Harbor Freight Community,*

*As we’ve been following the news over the last few days, we’ve heard  about the severe shortage of protective gear for hospitals, healthcare  workers and first responders as the impact of COVID-19 is being felt  across the country. America depends on these  heroes every day and in the days ahead we will depend on them even  more. At Harbor Freight, we want them to know that they can depend on us  too.*

            *•  Face Shields*  
            *•  5 and 7 mil Nitrile Gloves*  
 

*If you work at a hospital with a 24 hour emergency room in need of  these items, please ask the office in charge of procurement at your  hospital to click* [ *here*](https://em.harborfreight.com/pub/cc?_ri_=X0Gzc2X%3DAQpglLjHJlYQGpc73GRAzct7zezduNOezaTIBKhmbEBkPthev0oIzbXzbv4EzfbHvkkOEhVXtpKX%3DUUUYRWY&amp;_ei_=Eq2tf9zs59idfPO1Sc_9BblNfWUQzBCBRXtTOqqwfDHwkJ48ZTiAEkjrWO0p8iVxSjQaGUsuiZ2dGKOQfc-F7mm5-K2f.&amp;_di_=pk10qnhprd0al249d36pp2mti9ml2t5qcnludsd4grekt5f7p790) *so they can provide us with the information we’ll need to  determine if we can make a donation. If you’re not with a hospital, but  would like to give us the name of a hospital with a 24 hour emergency  room in your community that might need our help,  please email us at* [*hospitalhelp@harborfreight.com*](mailto:hospitalhelp@harborfreight.com)*, identify the hospital’s city and state in the subject line, and our team will follow-up.* 

*PLEASE DO NOT MAKE REQUESTS AT YOUR LOCAL STORE OR OUR CALL CENTER  AND PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT HOSPITALS—THEY’RE BUSY HELPING THEIR  PATIENTS.* 

*For hospitals we’re able to help, we’ll email them a voucher when the  supplies are available for pick up at their local Harbor Freight Tools  store.*

*Although we certainly won’t have enough of these supplies to fill  everyone’s needs, we’re going to donate everything we’ve got. We also  recognize that there are so many other critically important people  responding to this crisis and that there is need everywhere.  We’ve chosen to focus our efforts on hospitals with a 24 hour emergency  room with the hope that we can help as many people as possible right  now.*

If you are working at a restaurant, it might help to social distance this way.

- If you can, take down phone numbers and have people wait in their cars or on the street away from others, or even let them take a walk until you call them in to pick up food. This prevents too many people congregating outside.

- If your entrance has two doors, maybe make one side say for ordering (have a sign that says 6 feet minimum as a reminder on the side). And the other door for people entering and leaving for their pick up orders. And have that door with a sign that says pickup, that you will call them when the order is ready, ask them not to congregate, and display the suggestions of waiting in their car, walking, etc.

If you're like me you are likely staying home fending boredom away.

Well I'm here to share the excellence that is DnD with you all!

You may be familiar with my post or maybe you skimmed over one. Typically classes are hosted at a local bar or restaurant but with everything going on I've decided to try moving things online in order to still be able to teach people how to play! 

How does it work? 

Classes will be done over the Zoom app which allows for multiple user video conferencing. Everyone logs into one seminar which is just me talking about Dungeons and Dragons answering questions and explaining the rules.

Finally you will need to download the [Zoom App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings) in order to be able to watch the stream. 

THEN you click [THIS LINK](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dungeons-and-dragons-101-online-class-tickets-100803592258) in order to  reserve your FREE RSVP to the class and receive the link to the video stream.

I am aware there are likely easier ways to do this but those is the easiest I've managed  to find so far that is easy enough for everyone.

The class is FREE so don't worry about surprise fees or anything like that however you'll notice that there is a DONATE option in case you're feeling generous and want to help me keep these classes free and available you others.

Well, that's it everyone. Get your gear and your RSVP and we'll see you in a few days!

4562,gobriela,1584984470,fnnx6v,Nan,"Okay so I need someone else’s POV &amp; thoughts on my situation. Let me explain. The second week of February I picked up the flu. It was probably one of my first times getting sick in a while and it lasted about 2 weeks before I started feeling 100% again. Then the first weekend of March I celebrated my birthday at Knotts Berry Farm and then I got sick all over again. After trying to medicate at home I decided it was time for a doctor, turns out I have an acute respiratory issue &amp; I also had pharyngitis. The doctor recommended I work from home if possible because I needed to take it slow. But my dumbass thought I’d be okay just taking it slow for a weekend. For a few days I was feeling better (not 100% yet, but overall better.) On Thursday, I knew for a fact I was showing the same symptoms from my last doctors visits except  now I’ve picked up a fever and my throat (for a lack of better words) is on fire. By now it had become obvious I just hadn’t  fully recuperated. 

I currently work insurance (which I know is considered essential ). However there are only two people in the office. Me and my boss. I do have my license I am an agent but I like to consider myself an assistant because in reality  I’m in the front desk while my boss has an office and he closes most deals. Now, I won’t say my boss hasn’t been understanding of my sickness because he has &amp; has been flexible with me as far as going to doctors visits &amp; taking it slow. But his views on the whole situation we have going on has caused a divide between us. 

My problem is that now with the whole situation amongst us, I don’t feel comfortable leaving my house to go to work while I’m still sick. I live in Mission Valley but work all the way in Poway. On Friday my boss allowed me to take my laptop &amp; work home. All my work is done through phone or email so for the time being a presence in my job isn’t necessarily needed, plus we aren’t accepting anyone to enter the office at the moment . And to be quite honest with you, 65% of my job consists of just staring at the wall until I have stuff to do. But then last night he texts me to ask me how I’m feeling and I told him I’m slowly progressing. I thought it was the perfect opportunity to bring up the stay at home order and his plan moving forward.... 

My text exactly: Okay thank you. Now that there is a stay at home order , what is the plan of action for the office ? I do understand we are considered essential business but with the flexibility to work from home. Will that be something that you will encourage for the office ? I mean for when I’m feeling better.

His response: Not sure yet.  Taking day by day

My boss has been one of those individuals that don’t see this situation as a big deal. He genuinely has not expressed any concerns. He’s seen me go throw up in the bathroom at work, he’s seen me suffering in my desk, he’s heard my hurtful coughing. May I add he has a wife and two kids under three ?? I’m not sure if anyone else sees this like me but I’m just frustrated with my boss. He hasn’t necessarily told me to come back to work when I feel better but I know that’s his expectation which is why he’s asked me to report to him everyday on how I’m feeling. And honestly I’ve been getting even more sick as the days go by &amp; I’m not really sure what’s going on or what to do. I know my sickness isn’t related to corona but I’m definitely sicker than I’ve ever been before. My boss has a take it “day by day” mentality which is fine but during these times it is fair to have a plan and to address your plans with your ONE EMPLOYEE. I’m scared of losing my job because I’m sick and unable to come to work.

Can anyone else shed some light on my situation ? I really felt the need to vent because it just doesn’t seem fair.  Thoughts ? Advice ?",sandiego,Can someone PLEASE share their POV on my current situation ? PLEASE

I know that a lot of restaurants are hurting right now, and so I wanted to do something to help out. 

One of the best strategies I've seen employed have been restaurants using employees to help deliver directly to homes. 

This helps in multiple ways, such as allowing them the opportunity to continue to keep employees paid and better weather the storm. 

To make it easy for you to support your favorite local restaurants, I've compiled a living list of restaurants that are offering delivery services which you can find here: [https://sandiegounite.com/](https://sandiegounite.com/) 

Note that because this list is a living one, some restaurants may be missing or out of date, in which case please feel out the form in-app or send an email in to ensure that the app is functioning best as possible.

I've also thought about opening this up in other ways such as allowing people to connect with personal trainers for virtual classes, donate directly, or perform other services.

Hopefully this post can give you a break from the daily stresses and bad news revolving around COVID-19! And if this is against the rules for this sub during this time period, mods please delete it.

Back in January, I made a post thanking this subreddit because my fiancée and I had an amazing time visiting San Diego. I did a ton of research on search engines and cross referenced everything I read on Google with this subreddit to make sure our trip was planned well. The reason for visiting San Diego was because my fianceé had a residency interview with UCSD &amp; Scripps. Going into it, we didn't think we would rank SD #1 but after learning more about the programs and spending almost a week in SD, we left with SD as her #1 option. Fast forward to Match Day a few days ago...and she MATCHED into Scripps and UCSD! The program starts in June, so we have to find a place, move our stuff cross country and be settled in by then! Scary but exciting times!

For one year, she will be working at Scripps Mercy located in Hillscrest/Mission Valley areas. The next three years she will be at UCSD Jacobs Medical Center in La Jolla. 

She wants to live somewhere in between/around those hospitals. She hates traffic and doesn't want to deal with extremely long commutes, unlike me. I would take a longer commute to buy/rent a larger place. But at the end of the day, I can live and adapt to any situation, so we are looking to buy or rent somewhere near those two hospitals. 

That being said - what areas/neighborhoods do you recommend? Any areas we should avoid? We would ideally like to buy a place. Condo, town home, standalone unit/home-- no preference. 

Some other notes that might help you recommend a place/area for us:

* We are getting married in June
* I will also be looking to get a full-time job in sales or marketing
   * Currently making $65,000 to $78,000 a year, pending on commission in rural parts of Central PA
* She will be averaging around $57,000 while in residency
* Almost no debt or student loans
* Need two parkings spaces
   * Will probably transport one car with a company
   * Maybe drive cross country with the second car
* We do have a little mini poodle, if we go towards the rental route - so pet friendly if that were the case
* We are both in our mid to late 20s, so would definitely like to live somewhere with young professionals so we can make friends around our age

Looking forward to getting some opinions, as this subreddit didn't let me down on my last post!

There were way more deaths during the swine flu incident than this corona virus and nothing was shutdown, no one was on lock down. For those of us who are below 50 with no preexisting medical conditions (ie most of the population) there really is no chance of death, it's less than percent. Therefore we can either quarantine those at risk, or save the hospital space for those at risk and for those who meet the previous criteria can experience little to no symptoms, or at worst have flu like symptoms and stay at home till they recover.

Either way I'm tired of all this ""don't go outside"" or ""maintain social distancing"" all this does is show me that people don't actually know how viruses are spread. Most of it is not human to human contact, it's human to object (doorhandles and the like) to human, having people stand 6 feet apart does nothing because even a cough or a sneeze that flings bacterium and the such in the air, those things remain suspended long after the cough/sneeze, 6 feet between you and the next person will do nothing to stop that.

4637,will_lra,1585049693,fo3nbr,Nan,"This email was sent out to the SDSU biology faculty by Professor [Forest Rohwer](https://cmi.sdsu.edu/forest-rohwer/). It sounds like this week your chances of being exposed to the virus are much more likely. This would be a good time for everyone to get serious about isolating themselves! I checked with Forest and he said it was important to share this information:

 

&gt;Dear Everyone,  
   
I hope you are all doing well. I'm writing you as a virologist and immunologist who isn't an alarmist. With the knowledge that we currently have, I really want to stress that nearly total quarantining is needed in San Diego at this time. The important points are:  
   
1) There are almost assuredly a large number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 spreaders. These people don't feel sick and do not have symptoms like fever, but they can spread the virus. Because we don't have enough testing to look at allegedly healthy people, we don't know how many of these people are out there in San Diego at this moment. But we do have data from other places and models.  
   
2) The models say that this week is the inflection point on the exponential expansion curve for CoVID-19. This means that your probability of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 has been relatively low up to this point. That is going to change within the next couple of days. **There are going to be a lot of people carrying and shedding the virus sometime this week.**  
   
3) The immunological response to the virus is worrisome. First, it is an immune response that is leading to the severest symptoms of the disease (i.e., Acute Respiratory Failure Syndrome; ARFS). Second, it is not clear how to treat this immune response. This means that doctors are effectively using trauma treatment techniques because they don't have any other tools. This is bad because the only treatments are effectively oxygen and ventilators. And there aren't very many ventilators and fewer people to run them (&lt;1,000 in San Diego). Third, there are reasons to believe that the immune response may not be exceptionally protective with the milder forms of the disease. This means building herd immunity may not important. Fourth, there is something weird about the older patients. It is almost like they have previously been exposed to a SARS-like virus that is pre-disposing them to a hyper-immune response that isn't protective but makes ARFS worse. Fifth, despite the preferential mortality rates in older people, about 1% of all age groups are dying from CoVID-19. This makes it a very dangerous virus for whoever you are.  
   
Taking everything together, this is a terrible week to be around other people. Stay home and eat those cans of food that have been sitting there for years. If you must absolutely go out, use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE; gloves, hand sanitizers w/ &gt;70% isopropanol, masks).  
   
Sincerely,  
Forest

I tried calling their hotline, however, I was on a long hold and had to hang up because I had a work call (and have more calls intermittently throughout the day).

4682,Sweetragnarok,1585078603,fobixs,Nan,"This is an experience I had today at the DMV office here in SD (branch unmentioned) and a local big named bank.

Today was an actual scheduled appointment day I have with DMV that I booked since early January. Had to renew lisc as well as getting the Real ID so a new photo was needed.

Pro Tip: You need to have your birth certificate and social security with you, **they will turn you away** if you dont have these along with 2 utility bill copies.  2 of my coworkers had this problem and had to reschedule till May.

Mad pros to the DMV office, they did some madlad social distancing and the branch only allowed 5 or 6 peeps at a time inside the office for those with valid appointments.

They aggressively turned away anyone with non-essential appointments or had stuff that can be done online.  Chairs were almost 5 feet away from each other and active booths were about 2 spaces apart. A good number of the employees wore masks &amp; gloves, and even put documents in clear plastic packets when you hand them your certifications.  They really took all measures they needed to do and best of all, DMV was not crowded and I was out in 10 mins.

EXCEPT for one issue. As I was entering the door where there were 4-5 DMV employees outside screening or turning away customers. One employee loudly said that one of the DMV employees (heavily hinted) that  caught the COVID - the word he used was ""They already got something"".  

Since I was being ushered in quickly I only was able to give the guy a WTH Man look and didnt catch the rest of the conversation.

TBH I dont know how to react to that, part of me wanted to say : shouldn't this office be closed then for quarantine or at least some sort of deep cleaning?
Normally I wouldnt react in panic but my brain was running around in anxiety.

I had lysol spray in my car and some sanitizer so I literally just sprayed myself with it just to be careful. Only other issue they had as I left, was some lady bum rushing inside past the screening officers and got agitated with them that she had to wait her turn/verify if she had an appointment. Ppl are crazy (SMH)

Next was a bank run. The banks had limited hours and the one I went to only let 5 people at a time in.  There were markers on the floor how far you should stand next to each other. ALL the employees work masks and gloves.  All fine and dandy. 

Except the fact one employee got into an dispute with another co worker loudly-

Coworker 1:  Why are you here?
Coworker 2: I'ts my husband who is sick. I just have the allergies, the allergies.
Coworker 1: But werent you told to stay home / not be here ( I think thats what she said bec Co worker 2 cut her off)
Coworker 2:  ITS MY HUSBAND WHO IS SICK!

Their interaction was loud enough to made us feel uncomfy around her. Although she was at a safe distance from us. In fact one customer made an offside comment about it about ""causing panic"" which kinda shut the 2 bank workers up.

Bottom line: Its was very unprofessional of CW2 to have that conversation in front of ppl who may be already on edge or inconvenienced by the situation going on.

While I applaud for essential businesses that carry on to help patrons like me, I hope they perform the necessary tact and quarantine procedures to ensure the safety of both their staff and customers.

What are the best avenues for finding condos/houses/townhomes to rent? We've been having issues with scammy craigslist/zillow listings. We know the obvious things to look out for (no photos of the interior, too-good-to-be-true prices, etc.) but even the listings that initially seem legit and up being sketchy (landlords who aren't in the area and can't show the house, or who want an application filled out before letting people see the house). 

It's honestly been really frustrating and discouraging. Are there better ways to find housing? Good property management groups? Fortunately we have family down there that can go check out places for us, though that's iffy considering the coronavirus situation.

Hello San Diego!

I hope you are all taking measures to protect yourselves and reduce the spread of COVID-19. As the districts have closed, I thought to extend some studies about learning loss over breaks from the academic setting:

[https://www.brookings.edu/research/summer-learning-loss-what-is-it-and-what-can-we-do-about-it/](https://www.brookings.edu/research/summer-learning-loss-what-is-it-and-what-can-we-do-about-it/) [https://www.nwea.org/blog/2018/summer-learning-loss-what-we-know-what-were-learning/](https://www.nwea.org/blog/2018/summer-learning-loss-what-we-know-what-were-learning/) [https://www.oxfordlearning.com/summer-learning-loss-and-how-to-prevent-it/](https://www.oxfordlearning.com/summer-learning-loss-and-how-to-prevent-it/)

As many other countries are showing, social distancing practices are expected to last much longer than 2 weeks or even a month. In an effort to reduce a major setback for the students in my community, I am offering virtual tutoring sessions. By making use of Zoom, Skype, or similar video chat programs, I can continue your students education and reduce the educational impact. Oxford Learning suggests that ""it only takes 2-3 hours of work per week to prevent learning loss over the summer,"" and the lessons may provide some sense of normalcy for your students in this unique time.

Whether your student needs guidance through curriculum provided by their schools or a personalized learning regimen, I'm happy to work with families to find a program and pricing that is sustainable for each family.",sandiego,Coronavirus Learning Loss - Virtual Tutoring

That being said, I reiterate that it wasn't our choice to close the beaches and kick everyone out. However, it is our job to ""enforce"" the new rule and tell patrons that they need to leave. This week I have had more self entitled people get upset and even yell at me over the beach closures. I understand that it is frustrating, but your attitudes will not change the fact that the beaches are closed until further notice. My least favorite part of the job is telling people that they can't do something. I know that you wouldn't go to a grocery store and yell at the person working the register about the store not having something in stock. That is just the world that we are currently living in. Believe it or not, you are not the only person in the world being effected by Covid-19 so suck it up and change your lifestyle for the time being. Life will go back to normal one of these days.

Sorry to rant but it's getting old having people be so hostile at someone who's job it is to enforce something that is out of their control.

If you're like me you are likely staying home fending boredom away.

Well I'm here to share the excellence that is DnD with you all!

You may be familiar with my post or maybe you skimmed over one. Typically classes are hosted at a local bar or restaurant but with everything going on I've decided to try moving things online in order to still be able to teach people how to play! 

How does it work? 

Classes will be done over the Zoom app which allows for multiple user video conferencing. Everyone logs into one seminar which is just me talking about Dungeons and Dragons answering questions and explaining the rules.

Finally you will need to download the [Zoom App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings) in order to be able to watch the stream. 

THEN you click [THIS LINK](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dungeons-and-dragons-101-online-class-tickets-100803592258) in order to  reserve your FREE RSVP to the class and receive the link to the video stream.

I am aware there are likely easier ways to do this but those is the easiest I've managed  to find so far that is easy enough for everyone.

The class is FREE so don't worry about surprise fees or anything like that however you'll notice that there is a DONATE option in case you're feeling generous and want to help me keep these classes free and available you others.

Well, that's it everyone. Get your gear and your RSVP and we'll see you in a few days!

u/pikindaguy u/oodlesofnoodlepup u/jenjenguin u/MinimalistLifestyle u/redblendkp .  You are all the very best.  
  
Today is my birthday… a year ago, I was unemployed too. You will find a job and you are a uniquely valuable person.  When I was unemployed, every bit of kindness shown, raised my spirits.  I remember them all.  
  
I would like to cheer all of you up - but can only help some.  (I’m employed now; fingers-crossed, will remain working).  If you need cash, just reply “Need Cash” in the comment section.  I will randomly select 10 commenters at noon on Friday to receive $50 and then DM the winners.  Please be honest, your fellow San Diegans are really struggling.  I will disburse this via PayPal (preferred), Venmo or old-fashioned check (least preferred, I will mail it to you).  Use it towards essentials (rent, groceries, pet food), frippery (booze, weed) or to treat someone special to your own act of kindness. 

If are just browsing my thread, why not leave a comment of your favorite San Diego charity?  (To be clear, I’m just disbursing to individuals - but someone might contribute to your charity after reading this).

Fine print:
Accounts should be at least 30 days old.
If you are a randomly selected winner, I will ask the name of your employer (over DM).
I will not call your previous employer.
My payment method means you will know my real name - don’t share it, please.
We'll never meet  - any stranger you pass - could be me.
Be kind to all those strangers!

4874,seaoframen,1585253349,fpin2j,Nan,"A local attorney here. I doubt your landlord will be sending you notice of the steps you must take to be protected by the eviction ordinance passed by City Council.

Yesterday (March 25, 2020) the City Council adopted an emergency ordinance (O-2020-97) temporarily freezing evictions due to nonpayment of rent for residential and commercial tenants. I will only discuss the requirements for residential tenants only. In order to be protected, **YOU must take affirmative action immediately.**

**What the ordinance means in plain English:** Your landlord cannot take action to evict you for not timely paying rent that was due on or after March 12, 2020, if you are able to show that you were unable to pay rent related to financial impacts of COVID-19.

**Who Qualifies?** Renters who are unable to pay rent **due to financial impacts caused by COVID-19.**

The ordinance defines **""financial impact""** as a substantial decrease in household income due to business closure, loss of hours, wages, layoffs, or hospitalization related to COVID-19. A financial impact is ""**related to**"" COVID-19 if it is caused by the pandemic itself or any governmental response. Yes, this includes ordered shutdowns of non-essential businesses such as restaurants, breweries, gyms, etc.

**What is a substantial decrease in income?** The City Manager is expected to define what a substantial decrease is, however, the City Manager does not have the authority to define the substantial loss of income to exceed a 30% reduction.

**Is my Rent Forgiven?** Unfortunately, no. You will have **six months** from the date of the ordinance is effective to repay your landlord or withdrawal of Governor Newsome's executive order on rent freeze, whichever is sooner.

**How to be Protected:**

(1) Notify your landlord/property management by **written** notice (email, text, letter) **on or before** the date your rent is due that you are unable to pay because of COVID-19.

This step is extremely important. You need to take affirmative action to notify your landlord/property management by written notice **ON OR BEFORE the date** your rent is due. April rent will be due for most renters before April 3.

(2) **Within one week from sending your notice**, you need to provide documentation to your landlord/property manager that you are unable to pay rent because of COVID-19. Such documentation may include a lay off notice or other documentation supporting your loss of income. Perhaps, even your eligibility for unemployment benefits.

If you take these steps, the landlord cannot do any of the following:

* **charge or collect any late fees for rent**,
* send the statutory notice to begin the eviction process,
* file/prosecute unlawful detainer against you.

**This is not meant to be legal advice. This is a PSA! Your unique facts and circumstances may impact your eligibility to be protected by this eviction freeze ordinance. You need to consult an attorney immediately if you are unsure of what steps you need to take or whether you qualify for protection.**

I hope this helps my fellow San Diegans facing eviction because of COVID-19. Stay safe and healthy!",sandiego,PSA: If you Cannot Afford Rent Because of COVID-19 you Need to take Affirmative Steps Immediately to be Protected Under the new City Ordinance (April Rent is DUE SOON!)

4965,_LadyHero_,1585335011,fq2z9p,Nan," A random idea to help keep things POSITIVE for those of you with mothers, grandmothers, or special women in your life.

Due to quarantine, I’m guessing most of you have not been able to see your moms. Video chat or phone calls are just not the same for mothers who are worried about you, or just wanting to see you in person!

The sad truth is that this quarantine is most likely not going to end in 2 weeks. Even sadder is the thought of losing a loved one in the next few weeks as this virus works its way into San Diego.

So, here’s a thought:

Let’s celebrate Mothers Day a month early!

APRIL 10, 2020.

Send your mom some treats, or a card to let her know you are thinking of her and how much she means to you! Have your kids make cards for their grandmas...I’m thinking of sending a hydroponic LED kitchen counter garden. Gives her something to do, and some fresh, virus-free veggies in return!

TL;DR : Lets do Mothers Day in San Diego EARLY this year - - 4/10/20 - - to let those special women SMILE and know we are thinking of them during this quarantine crisis!",sandiego,"What do you say, San Diego friends? Lets celebrate MOTHERS DAY a month early this year!"

I hope everyone is doing well during this Stay-Home order! Despite the sudden and abrupt change to our day to day I have to admit that this change has been very eye opening.

If you're like me you are likely staying home fending boredom away.

Well I'm here to share the excellence that is DnD with you all!

You may be familiar with my posts or maybe you skimmed over one. Typically classes are hosted at a local bar or restaurant but with everything going on I've decided to try moving things online in order to still be able to teach people how to play! 

How does it work? 

Classes will be done over the Zoom app which allows for multiple user video conferencing. Everyone logs into one seminar which is just me talking about Dungeons and Dragons answering questions and explaining the rules.

Things you'll need:

Finally you will need to download the [Zoom App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings) in order to be able to watch the stream. 

THEN you click [THIS LINK](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dungeons-and-dragons-101-tickets-96811215953) in order to  reserve your FREE RSVP to the class and receive the link to the video stream.

I am aware there are likely easier ways to do this but those is the easiest I've managed  to find so far that is easy enough for everyone.

The class is FREE so don't worry about surprise fees or anything like that however you'll notice that there is a DONATE option in case you're feeling generous and want to help me keep these classes free and available to others.

Well, that's it everyone. Get your gear and your RSVP and we'll see you in a few days!

Until then.

**SEC. 2107. PANDEMIC EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.**

(a) Federal-State Agreements.-

(1) In general. Any State which desires to do so may enter into and participate in an agreement under this section with the Secretary of Labor (in this section referred to as the ‘Secretary’). Any State which is a party to an agreement under this section may, upon providing 30 days’ written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.

(2) Provisions of agreement. Any agreement under paragraph (1) shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who-

(A) have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law or under Federal law with respect to a benefit year (excluding any benefit year that ended before July1, 2019);

(B) have no rights to regular compensation with respect to a week under such law or any other State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal law;

(C) are not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; and

(D) are able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work.

(3) Exhaustion of benefits. For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), an individual shall be deemed to have exhausted such individual’s rights to regular compensation under a State law when-

(A) no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to such individual based on employment or wages during such individual’s base period; or

(B) such individual’s rights to such compensation have been terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed.

(4) Weekly benefit amount, etc. For purposes of any agreement under this section-

(A) the amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation which shall be payable to any individual for any week of total unemployment shall be equal to-

(i) the amount of the regular compensation (including dependents’ allowances) payable to such individual during such individual’s benefit year under the State law for a week of total unemployment; and

(ii) the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 2104;

(B) the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof (including terms and conditions relating to availability for work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work) shall apply to claims for pandemic emergency unemployment compensation and the payment thereof, except where otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this section or with the regulations or operating instructions of the Secretary promulgated to carry out this section;

(C) the maximum amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation payable to any individual for whom an pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account is established under subsection (b) shall not exceed the amount established in such account for such individual; and

(D) the allowable methods of payment under section 2104(b)(2) shall apply to payments of amounts described in subparagraph (A)(ii).

(5) Coordination rule. An agreement under this section shall apply with respect to a State only upon a determination by the Secretary that, under the State law or other applicable rules of such State, the payment of extended compensation for which an individual is otherwise eligible must be deferred until after the payment of any pandemic emergency unemployment compensation under subsection (b) for which the individual is concurrently eligible.

(6) Nonreduction rule.

(A) In general. An agreement under this section shall not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect to a State upon a determination by the Secretary that the method governing the computation of regular compensation under the State law of that State has been modified in a manner such that the number of weeks (the maximum benefit entitlement), or the average weekly benefit amount, of regular compensation which will be payable during the period of the agreement will be less than the number of weeks, or the average weekly benefit amount, of the average weekly benefit amount of regular compensation which would otherwise have been payable during such period under the State law, as in effect on January 1, 2020.

(B) Maximum benefit entitlement. In subparagraph (A), the term ‘maximum benefit entitlement’ means the amount of regular unemployment compensation payable to an individual with respect to the individual’s benefit year.

(7) Actively seeking work.

(A) In general. Subject to subparagraph (C), for purposes of paragraph (2)(D), the term ‘actively seeking work’ means, with respect to any individual, that such individual-

(i) is registered for employment services in such a manner and to such extent as prescribed by the State agency;

(ii) has engaged in an active search for employment that is appropriate in light of the employment available in the labor market, the individual’s skills and capabilities, and includes a number of employer contacts that is consistent with the standards communicated to the individual by the State;

(iii) has maintained a record of such work search, including employers contacted, method of contact, and date contacted; and

(iv) when requested, has provided such work search record to the State agency.

(B) Flexibility. Notwithstanding the requirements under subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(D), a State shall provide flexibility in meeting such requirements in case of individuals unable to search for work because of COVID-19, including because of illness, quarantine, or movement restriction.

(b) Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation Account.-

(1) In general. Any agreement under this section shall provide that the State will establish, for each eligible individual who files an application for pandemic emergency unemployment compensation, an pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account with respect to such individual’s benefit year.

(2) Amount in account. The amount established in an account under subsection (a) shall be equal to 13 times the individual’s average weekly benefit amount, which includes the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 2104, for the benefit year.

(3) Weekly benefit amount. For purposes of this subsection, an individual’s weekly benefit amount for any week is the amount of regular compensation (including dependents’ allowances) under the State law payable to such individual for such week for total unemployment plus the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 2104.

(c) Payments to States Having Agreements for the Payment of Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.-

(1) In general. There shall be paid to each State that has entered into an agreement under this section an amount equal to 100 percent of the pandemic emergency unemployment compensation paid to individuals by the State pursuant to such agreement.

(2) Treatment of reimbursable compensation. No payment shall be made to any State under this section in respect of any compensation to the extent the State is entitled to reimbursement in respect of such compensation under the provisions of any Federal law other than this section or chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code. A State shall not be entitled to any reimbursement under such chapter 85 in respect of any compensation to the extent the State is entitled to reimbursement under this section in respect of such compensation.

(3) Determination of amount. Sums payable to any State by reason of such State having an agreement under this section shall be payable, either in advance or by way of reimbursement (as may be determined by the Secretary), in such amounts as the Secretary estimates the State will be entitled to receive under this section for each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any amount by which the Secretary finds that the Secretary’s estimates for any prior calendar month were greater or less than the amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such estimates may be made on the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency of the State involved.

(1) In general. If an individual knowingly has made, or caused to be made by another, a false statement or representation of a material fact, or knowingly has failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a material fact, and as a result of such false statement or representation or of such nondisclosure such individual has received an amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation under this section to which such individual was not entitled, such individual-

Our lease has a $2900 early termination fee in it so I don’t know the chances of it being waived.

I know evictions are being put on hold, but I’m afraid of pushing that envelope and risking a huge rent bill when things are back on, or an eviction mark on our record. 

Does anyone know what options we might have in this situation? Any help or advice is appreciated!",sandiego,Luxury apartments &amp; being laid off during coronavirus

This is entirely FREE and meant to help you find and keep the motivation to exercise at home while keeping a safe distance from everyone.

I would host this every other day in the afternoon and if there is enough interest I could do a stretching session every morning as well.

To make it easy for everyone here is the info for my Zoom classroom in case you'd line to join me tomorrow afternoon while I do my regular routine!

All you need to do is download the Free Zoom App find my classroom and join in!

It seems that due to recent events that job searching has become highly difficult.

I have a high school education, a positive attitude, and generally excel at work that involves customer service. I prefer to work at a restaurant or café.

I've been applying to every grocery store and restaurant offering take-out/drive-thru as soon as an opening is posted. Additionally, I also do follow up calls after two weeks, and hand in resumes/cover-letters in person as a supplement to online applications.

My motivation is to move to Minneapolis by March of next year at the earliest.

My plan to accomplishing that goal involves investing my earnings to fund moving, develop a good credit score, and gain job experience to have some advantage when applying to secure a job in Minneapolis before I move rather than after.

Also, it seems going directly into the work-force is currently the only option for me due to schools shutting down.

I have a few questions.


Is there anything crucial missing from this plan?

Are there any flaws in my approach to finding a job?

What are the most viable positions to persuit given the current situation?

Also, are there any companies you know of that could offer a transfer to another state for it's employees?

There are many of us who are categorized as essential workers by Gov. Newsom that have to keep working through this instead of staying safe at home with our families.

Many essential workers are in a single location like a grocery store or shipping warehouse. However, there are many of us such as delivery drivers and service technicians who typically work away from our office throughout the entire day.

It has been my experience that a lot of businesses have closed their public restrooms since the shelter in place order was given. Traditionally, I and many other service providers like me have relied on public restrooms at parks, since most businesses expect you to purchase something in order to use their restrooms. Now that all the park restrooms are locked up and taped off and most business restrooms are closed to the public, where are essential service and delivery workers who are out for 8 to 12 hours at a time expected to use the restroom?",sandiego,Where Are Essential Workers Supposed To Use The Restroom?

Seems to me they know rent is gonna bottom out, and they are trying to lock in current renters before they drop their prices in May. If their online pricing is way below what we pay now, come May, June, we have a leg to stand on for lower rent, correct?

5235,Nomad79,1585605917,fs0cpn,Nan,"Throughout the country the rental market was being manipulated and overpriced.  Market rent was artificially inflated by companies like AirBnB and other vacation rental sights.  This cost regular renters everywhere almost four hundred dollars a month.  So if you where paying 1200 a month,without these vacation rental properties you would have normally been paying closer to 800 a month. Especially in San Diego where there was up to 40,000 vacation rentals at any given time.  This defiantly put a squeeze on the supply of long term housing. However given Airbnb ability to lobby Congress and city council members and giving them back door gifts in exchange for allowing people to use loopholes to turn apartments into hotels. Now that the  bottom has dropped out on these vacation rentals and these hosts are in losing money and can’t find people to pay, the rental market is being flooded with long term rentals. On top of that AirBNB and their hosts are requesting a government  bailout. The audacity. Lol I hope they lose everything.

Presumably this is to reduce the assembly of people, or maybe it is related to the overall closure of all city park lands. However, cutting this particular service seems to be very risky in light of an upcoming likely shortage of medical personal to treat serious illnesses...such as those that could arise from folks dumping their RV waste into gutters or public waterways. It isn't too long ago that we had a brush with Hepatitis A, so I was a little surprised to read that the city would make a move like this.

I'm going to copy a quote from a RV dump user that the UT interviewed:

“The city thinks it’s a good idea to close a public dump during a public health emergency when we have thousands of homeless citizens who can’t pay to dump?” Sherif said. “Does San Diego want to fight an E. coli or cholera outbreak in addition to COVID-19?”

Obviously this is what some of us already are doing or have been saying. Face masks obviously help, otherwise other countries would not require their citizens to wear one.

This news video does a good job explaining the miscommunication of not wearing masks and materials to use for your own DIY.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N6nBLvrAqzA

As the video says, leave the N95 masks for health professionals, and make your own. Can use cotton, pillow covers, bed sheets etc. Basically materials that can be hand washed with soap. May not be as effective as N95 masks, but better than nothing.

Tell your friends and family and let’s try to flatten the curve in San Diego!",sandiego,Trump said he could reconsider recommending face masks in public

5400,Flombeck,1585783694,ftb6li,Nan,"Both questions are assuming you can't get dependable home delivery of food or some of it's too expensive in this time of stay-at-home rules. So for the first question if the restaurant take is a lot closer than the grocery store should you go to the restaurant if you have the money to afford it? I know that raises the questions of the haves and have nots but one's financial abilities come into play here imo.

As for the 2nd question does this subreddit think it's ok to go to a restaurant take out that's one block away from your home? I'm assuming a whole lot of you would say yes. How about 6 blocks away? Would 1/2 mile away be ok? 1 mile way? 5 miles away? And finally 15 miles away?

One of the things I'm getting to besides the common issues of the stay-at-home rules I mentioned above is the appeal of the area where the restaurant is. Little Italy. Just the name Little Italy brings up joy. How I'd love to go there for the atmosphere and take out food. But I'd get hell from posters if I told you how far away from it I live if I planned to drive there. I'm in mid San Diego. So what about the rest of us? 

For the rest of us I think the same questions a couple of paragraph up apply to Little Italy. Or to the Gaslamp Quarter. Both have lots of take out restaurants that are on open public city streets not closed parks or malls.

5416,PearlsB4,1585793863,ftdz0y,Nan,"On Monday, March 30th, the California Latino Legislative Caucus (CLLC) sent a letter to California’s Governor Gavin Newsom URGING THREE MEASURES BE ADOPTED to provide for the financial well-being of California’s *undocumented immigrants*: 

1. Create, and fully fund a Disaster Relief Fund to provide immediate cash relief to undocumented immigrants who are unable to work due to the COVID-19 pandemic
2. Extend eligibility for California’s Earned Income Tax Credit (CA-EITC) to tax-paying undocumented immigrants. The letter says, “There is no rational basis…” to exclude taxpayers from this program… “due to their immigration status…” or “lack of a Social Security Number.” \[*CA-EITC is a refundable cash back credit for qualified low-to-moderate income taxpayers which can put hundreds or even thousands of dollars back in the pocket of eligible claimants.*\]
3. Extend Medi-Cal benefits to all low-income adult undocumented immigrants.

This letter uses the term “*undocumented residents*”, which is troublesome because “permanent resident” is someone who has been granted legal status to live in the United States (e.g., a Green Card holder). This website ([https://www.cato.org/blog/illegal-alien-one-many-correct-legal-terms-illegal-immigrant](https://www.cato.org/blog/illegal-alien-one-many-correct-legal-terms-illegal-immigrant)) has an interesting discussion of terms used as alternates for “illegal immigrant.”

In addition to CA **AB-5** author, CLLC Chairwoman, and CA 80th Assembly District Assembly Member, San Diego’s own **Lorena Gonzalez** and CA 78th Assembly District Assembly Member and San Diego Mayoral Front-Runner **Todd Gloria**, the letter was signed by:

It's Thursday and that means there is a whole lot of awesome and exciting things going on, AT HOME!

Watch some grass grow, paint dry. Paint your grass and you can do both at the same time!

There's snail racing,  pacing back and forth throughout your house, staring out into the void! Staving off existential crisis...

So many fun things that you could be doing!

I know things are probably getting boring for those of you that are doing the responsible thing and staying home, thank you.

If you are one of our essential workers I appreciate your hard work keeping our essential needs running. Sorry for all the crap you have to put up with. 

What are you doing to keep yourself entertained? 

I've stated knitting,  well, learning how to knit, I'm hoping I can learn how to make dice bags for my DnD crew.

I've also been doing a whole lot more cooking and I was reminded of how much I enjoy it. Usually I'd just get something quick at a burger joint or something but now I'm cooking my own meals again and it feels awesome!

I've been able to work on some wood projects lately as well which I normally would not have had the energy for. 

My house is spotless!

All this free time has really given me time to explore a lot of the things that I enjoy doing and with that exploration comes an inner monologue that often reveals small epiphanies that offer further insight to who I am. 

Guys, if you're able, take some time to just sit in silence for an hour. Let your mind wander and melt into the sunset, it's really cathartic.

Use this time you develop new skills,  maybe start learning a new language, I'm practicing German with duolingo and ASL by watching YouTube videos.

I want to do my part and help keep people's spirits up so I bought the pro version of Zoom and want to offer online classes and streams that you can all just drop into and say hi, hang out and talk to others who likely are also looking for social interaction. 

Some days I'll do cooking or fitness sessions, I'll host a few online D&amp;D games and beginner classes, a writing group maybe even a casual chat lounge.

Let me know what you'd like to see and I'll try to make it happen!

If your are at the edge and need someone to talk you down or just listen please don't hesitate to DM me for support.

Remember that a lot of people are probably going through the same thing and share a similar headspace and require just as much socializing.

If you feel alone, Don't! I see you and I acknowledge you! While you may be physically alone know that you are not lonely.

Know that there's some guy named Vic out here cheering you on, rooting for you and offering you my hand (metaphorically speaking, we shouldn't actually touch).

San Diego, I love you.

I know for a fact to be tested, you have to be very sick and almost need hospital care. For most of us with symptoms, they won't test.

With majority of people with symptoms staying home/not getting tested, I'm trying to get an idea how many positive case there actually are in San Diego.

Currently the number is 849 tested positive.

So I wanted to create a space for events where people could socialize and have something to do and someone to do it with without having to leave the house.

Hobbies are always more fun when you have friends around to bounce ideas off of or simply to help keep yourself focused on what you're doing and maybe find a little inspiration. 

That is why I am putting together a series of online clubs that everyone is free to join!

Here's a line-up and schedule of what I have planned so far.

Maybe there is something that you'd like to try out or maybe you can offer an idea for a club you'd like to see or even promote your own!

Mornings - [Stretch club 7-8am](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/371488913)

Monday - [Cooking club 4-6pm]( https://us04web.zoom.us/j/376351568)

Monday - [Fitness club 7-8:30pm](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/659844146)

Tuesday- [Writing club 6-8pm](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/832368205)

Wednesday - [Art club 4-6pm](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/318174512)

Thursday - [Fitness Club 7-830pm](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/935331798)

Friday - [Book Club 4-5:30pm](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/981514060)

Saturday - [D&amp;D 101 classes 3-7pm](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/247848674)

Sunday - [Garden club 4-6pm](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/938943542)

Some of these clubs may change depending on whether enough people are interested.

Have a club you'd like to see? Have a club of your own you'd like to promote? Post it here!

You'll need the Zoom App in order to follow along. The app is free to download and free to use.

These are not instructional classes however you could probably pick up some new skills or tips from other people participating or just sit back and enjoy the digital clubhouse.

In addition, all club meetings will have a waiting room and will start 15 minutes after the start time and then will be locked to prevent ""ZoomBombing"".

I hope to see you all there! 

Stay up!",sandiego,I created some online clubs for everyone to check out and socialize during this Stay-Home Order! Come hang out!

5478,Zorgi23,1585874510,fty91y,Nan,"1) California still has 59,100 pending tests, driving the completed tests per 100k people down to 78.6, compared to 356.9 for the nation. Of the top 10 states, comprising 1/2 of the population, California's test rate is by far the worst. (See new chart on Completed Tests below). Supposedly, California has by far the biggest backlog in the country. BUT, Quest Diagnostics just reported yesterday that they had a backlog of 160,000 tests. So even if all of California's backlog were at Quest, that would leave 110,000 tests from other states. One thing is clear: Quest has dropped the ball, leaving hundreds of thousands of people facing an uncertain future and making it very difficult for epidemiologists to understand what's happening. Here's a good article about the testing situation in CA:

[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve)

&amp;#x200B;

2) The rate of daily new cases for Encinitas and Carlsbad fortunately was lower than that of the rest of the U.S., and lower than the county. However, the problems in testing (#1 above) may be part of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) The situation outside of North County is growing worse, with a doubling rate of around 5.5 days for the county, state, and nation.

I can deliver to anyone in the general San Diego city area.  I live in University City area, but I'm willing to drive to anywhere in the city.

I have the ingredients to make a bunch of gluten-free coconut cookies.  In case you have allergies, for the base I will use coconut flour, sugar, molasses, coconut extract, eggs, neutral oil, baking powder, salt.  If you like your cookies with extra oomph, I have cocoa powder, sweetened shredded coconut, and/or pecans I can toss in the dough.  Otherwise, you can add other mix-in's you have at home.

Directions:  Keep dough refrigerated/frozen.  Form into desired final shape prior to baking.  Preheat oven to 350F and make sure it's to temp before baking.  Bake for 12-15 minutes depending on desired doneness.  Let cool for 10 minutes on a cooling rack or counter before eating.

PS:  I just made a mini batch of these cookies with cocoa powder, toasted coconut, and toasted pecans - I had 2 for breakfast.  Crispy on the edge and almost cakey in the middle.  It can't get chewy, due to lack of gluten, but it works when you have a cookie craving.

PPS:  100%, I promise to thoroughly wash all the equipment I use and wear gloves and a DIY mask through this process.  I will open a brand new box of ziplock bags to store the cookie dough in.  I will use a brand new trash bag to put the cookie dough bags in, so it doesn't touch my car.  I will change gloves before grabbing your cookie dough out of the bag.  I will leave it on your doorstep and not touch your door/doorbell.  Safety first.",sandiego,Can I offer you cookie dough in this trying time?

I haven't been to a store in almost a month now, but it looks like Amazon Fresh/Instacart have basically stopped working, so I'm figuring I will need to go sometime in the next week or two. Just have a few questions for those that have been lately:

1. Is the social distancing enforced anywhere? I've seen pictures with the tape lines, arrows, etc, but also hear a lot of people saying no one cares.
2. Are there any stores that are currently enforcing a low max-customer-inside count? These stores seem like they would be the safest to visit.
3. How has availability been? I don't need TP/sanitizing supplies, but what about regular staples like eggs, milk, and meat, or dry goods?
4. Any places to completely avoid? Don't have a Costco membership, so that one is already out.

Does anyone have any advice on what neighborhoods to look in when finding an apartment this summer? North Park, City Heights and Normal Heights seem nice, Colina Del Sol keeps popping up as being very cheap but it kinda looks pretty suburban, not a lot going on?

* Looking for a 1Br in the $1300-1600 range
* Neighborhood that has at least some night life/young people. We are mid 20s.
* Ideally somewhere with a sense of community, parks, art, etc.

5554,thatguypyl,1585951599,fuhl8e,Nan,"I apologize if this type of post is inappropriate here, just needed to rant.

I'm a small business owner inside of an ""indoor swap-meet"" here in SD.  For obvious reasons, I closed my business due to COVID-19.  Due to the nature of the building, some of the businesses were still able operate because they were considered ""essential"".  I noticed that some of the other businesses that were clearly non-essential(clothing, jewelery) were still open!  

I didn't want to make a big deal of the situation so I called the property managers and let them know and reminded them that it was a state mandate and these businesses should not be open.  Here's where it gets a bit controversial.  I get it, businesses need to earn money to survive and the $1200 stimulus check doesn't even cover a third of my rent but it does not mean putting others at risk!  

After about a week with no response, I decided to call the local PD and they had someone come by and issue notices.  Again, these were just notices and no one was fined.  I was present at the time because the PD had said they'd sent someone earlier that week but I wanted to make sure that this time they actually showed up.  As I was walking away, another business owner felt the need to call me a ""bitch"". I walked over to him and asked him what he had said and his response was ""I'm going to send your ass back to fucken China"".  Not that it matters but I am not Chinese nor does it change anything.  

I get that he's upset and maybe under a lot of pressure due to finances but he's not the only one.  Honestly, I don't know why I made this post now but just a reminder to everyone, we're all doing this together.  We all need to do our part and the sooner that happens, the sooner we will get back to any resemblance of a normal life.

""Heads up, mouths closed, and stay the fuck away""

THE DATA

1) The new chart, Hospitalization by Age Group, shows why COVID19 is not just a problem for old people. Yes, if you're under 60, the hospitalization rate is only 12.6%, but that's still 93 people out of the 739 cases. This chart also shows why seniors need to be especially careful, since their hospitalization rate is 39.3%

2) A bit of good news: Encinitas continues to have a better doubling rate than the county and the nation. But the doubling rate got worse for Carlsbad and the county.

3) U.S. new cases per day per 100K people is on a steady upward trend, almost double what it was 5 days ago. This reflects outbreaks in several states outside New York, most notably New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Louisiana and Florida.

4) The backlog of pending cases in California continues to be almost 60,000.

REPORT CHANGES

1) Added a new chart, Hospitalization Rate by Age Group. This is for San Diego County only, and is based on county data from April 3, 2020.

5676,bradley_magnificent,1586024036,fuyfaq,Nan,"First off thanks for all the support I received on my post, and thanks for the gold.

So A few hours after I made the post my fever started to get worse. That day it climbed to 103 and the next day it rose to 104. I knew I had to see the doctor but I was so dehydrated from a week of diarrhea that I couldn't even take myself in to the urgent care. My RN wife had to leave work to come get me.

They saw me very quickly. I tested negative for strep. I had already tested for flu earlier in the week. A chest x-ray revealed I have pneumonia. They gave me 2 liters of IV fluid along with IV antibiotics. They sent me home with a prescription for antibiotic and some codeine to help me sleep. Getting the fluids had the result of making it much easier to drink fluids once I'd returned home, thank God.

At this point I was still just taking Tylenol. The next morning I awoke from a short nap to a temperature of 104.4 at about 11am. I changed my plan to alternating between Tylenol and ibuprofen every 3 hours. By 7 pm the fever was down to 102 and I felt like I actually might live. By keeping up this routine, including getting up every 3 hours in the night, I have mostly managed to keep it under 102, though it still has not dropped below 101. 

The diarrhea has gotten worse. Even the trifecta of antibiotic, codeine and peptol does little to stem it. Even though Im able to drink fluids I'm still having a hard time eating food, to the point where the emptiness of my stomach is keeping me awake at times. Because the universe hates me I literally have not lost any weight XD.

Still haven't been tested for Corona, I didn't meet the requirements. I know this outrages some of you sitting in your fancy rocking chairs but if you felt like I feel you would just want to rest and get better.

As for where it could have come from here's the breakdown. Symptoms first appeared 13 days after my last day at work so that's a possibilty. In the time after that I went to 3 different grocery stores to try and stock up for staying home as well as 1 gas station and 1 liquor store and my bank. My wife being an asymptomatic carrier is also entirely possible.

1) The backlog of tests in California has largely been cleared up, going from almost 60,000 to 13,000 today. California's rate of 288 per 100,000 people is still less than the US average of 491, but it's a big improvement. Even better, the clearing up of these cases did not lead to a big spike in positive cases. In fact, California's doubling rate of 6.5 days was actually better than yesterday's rate of 5.6 days.

2) The situation in the US as a whole is not as good. Cumulative cases per 10k people has doubled in the last week, and new cases per day per 100K people has gone from just under 6 to over 10 in one week, indicating that we are still in the early stages of the crisis. 

3) The rate of daily new cases in San Diego County has been relatively flat for 3 or 4 days. Keep up the physical distancing, everyone!

I feel this is a Shameful post but damn it’s tough times. Drove my home (I live in my van) into Reno around 2 A.M. on Sunday. I’m on my way to my new job in New Mexico and had to come all the way up here to get my passport and do a couple things in person. I Drove from San Diego which wasn’t that bad. The only money I had was for gas. I have a 87 for club wagon and that thing CHUGS gas. Then I completely miscalculated and got stuck in bishop and waited a day for my awesome friends to help me out. I’m so Thankful for that gas to get me here. ALSO!! Just earlier today I was looking for some help again in              r/assistance and I found someone to help me out with a pizza! So I PMd the person and alas...no reply. Super bummed about it.
I’m just hungry as hell. Idk where this will go but thanks for reading. Love you all. 

TL:dr: Wiped out and flat broke after a drive from SD to Reno. $0.63  is in my account till my deposit clears on Tuesday. Looking for a little help with food or a pizza. I’ll gladly return the favor or pay it forward.",sandiego,Any hometown pizza/food saints able to help me?

You may have noticed your local grocery stores now require their workers to wear face masks to protect against Covid-19. I work at one of your local stores. 

This is good news right? Stopping the spread of virus at a central hub, good? Right, it would be helpful if the masks they provided WERE RATED FOR THIS TYPE OF FILTRATION!

(See comment) Here is the package label of the box shipped from China. I blocked out the case number as that could identify my store/myself.

As you can see on most of the workers they are literally non-form fitting, DUST masks as labeled. These do not protect you or the worker from any virus. Sure, any type of barrier may be better than none, but this is unacceptable for a place of work where you are most likely to come in contact with the virus.

It’s my opinion that Vons and Albertsons only shipped these out to save-face in the eyes of the public. Wear your own mask if you NEED to go to the grocery store for ESSENTIALS.

Thank you for hearing me rant,

The item was gifted to me by my grandmother who has just passed and, amid the COVID-19 crisis, I was not permitted to say goodbye to, nor have a service for. I am hoping to find closure by locating the lost gift.

I'm hoping due to the item's distinct appearance one of the many redditors on this sub may recognize it if they have it in their homes or have seen it somewhere in the county. I've attached a picture to this post.

I understand how much of a reach this is, but I am stricken with grief and trying to exhaust all of my outlets. I hope this post will reach many people and possibly yield success.

If you have any information, please DM me. I am offering several hundred dollars for its return.

I hope you are all safe, and wish safety and health on you and your loved ones.

5831,Zorgi23,1586196291,fw3n14,Nan,"Last night I watched the Dateline special on the situation in Bergamo, Italy, where hospitals are overwhelmed. This morning I saw several posts on social media indicating that we were winning the battle by physical distancing. So I thought it would be useful to compare San Diego County and California with two places out of control - New York and Italy - and one place under control - S. Korea.

The data line for Italy is a bit deceptive because the outbreak there started about 2 weeks before New York, SD, and CA. On March 13, the first date on this chart, SD County had 10 cases, while Italy had 17,660. In other words, the crisis in Italy was at its midpoint then, while the US was just getting started.

Every locality but S. Korea has this in common: their daily change rates start incredibly high, as much as 70% to 80%, and as the outbreak grows, the rates tend to stabilize around 10% just before the peak. At the peak, which Italy reached around April 1, the rates drop to around 4%. New York is headed toward that now.

If we look at the change rates for SD County and California, there's reason for optimism, but lots of reason to be cautious, too. SD County rates are around 12%, i.e., right where Italy was two weeks ago. Even with physical distancing, if there are a lot of undiagnosed cases, we still could be headed toward some rough times. If we don't do the physical distancing, we pretty much guarantee things here will look like Italy in 2 to 4 weeks.

Now look at S. Korea, where the government took this seriously from the start and wasted no time testing and case tracking. The case count has risen slowly, but the daily change rate has been around 1% for the past month. This is what an organized, aggressive, serious response to the pandemic can achieve.

Hello everyone!

With this Stay-Home order in place you are probably looking for ways to keep the kids busy and engaged while still developing reading and creative writing skills.

Maybe you've been wanting to learn how to play yourself but haven't had the opportunity to do so.

Well this is your chance!

This class is designed to teach you and your family how to get started in the awesome game that is D&amp;D!

I will walk you through the process of building your own characters and how to interact with the world you create.

Parents will learn how to build and create a story as well as how the mechanics of the game work so you can run your own family campaign at home!

The class will be a much slower pace than my usual class so you can keep up with your kids as I explain things in a PG setting.

Once characters are created and the rules are understood I'll walk you all through a short campaign so you can start rolling dice! 

How it works: 

I post an Eventbrite link [LIKE THIS.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dd-101-class-parents-and-kids-edition-tickets-102104970716)

Then you follow that link and reserve your FREE RSVP ticket.

Once you reserve your ticket be sure to check your email for the Zoom link. Double check your spam or trash folder as well.

5836,spigotface,1586200496,fw4xrk,Nan,"The filter material is similar to a furnace filter or a coffee filter - it’s a tightly interwoven network of fibers. For air to flow through the mask, the material needs to remain fluffy with the fibers properly spread out at the microscopic level. Getting a mask wet can stick the fibers together which can either start to clog parts of the mask or end up creating larger voids and holes (on the microscopic level) that dramatically reduce its filtering ability. Even if you let it dry and it “feels fine”, the parts that got wet aren’t as nice as they were before.

It’s sort of like washing a fleece blanket. When it’s brand new it’s super fluffy but after repeated washing cycles where it gets wet and dries off, it’s not as fluffy anymore because now a lot of the fibers are stuck together.",sandiego,"PSA for this rainy week: N95 masks are not supposed to get wet, it damages the filter material.

&gt;The 24 Hour Fitness facility at Horton Plaza, which shut its doors on March 16 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, is now permanently closed.
&gt;
&gt;Saturday, the downtown gym alerted club members of the change, citing the mall’s eventual conversion into a tech-centric office campus.
&gt;
&gt;“The Horton Plaza Sport club will now be permanently closing and will not re-open,” the company said in an email. “We apologize for sharing this news during this time of uncertainty.”
&gt;
&gt;The closure was confirmed by Los Angeles-based Stockdale Capital Partners, which purchased the mall property in 2018 and has been preparing to remake the 10-block property into a mixed-use office park. Terms of the gym’s exit were not disclosed. The company had been paying $3.25 a square foot, or around $943,000 per year, for its 24,000 square-foot space at the base of the former Nordstrom building.
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, Stockdale, which has been preparing the site for exterior demolition work set to begin later this month, said it remains on track to complete the first phase of its redevelopment project, called The Campus at Horton, in early 2022.
&gt;
&gt;Last month, Stockdale secured a $330 million construction loan from AllianceBernstein, meaning the project is not in financial jeopardy. The loan puts the phase-one project cost at more than $500 million when including the $175 million the developer spent to buy the site from Westfield.
&gt;
&gt;With 24 Hour Fitness now shuttered, Horton Plaza is down to its last retail tenant: Jimbo’s Naturally. The natural foods grocer, which is tangled in a lawsuit with the developer, remains open for business.

I have an extensive health history that means I can’t/really definitely ideally shouldn’t go to the store myself. Is there anything in the UTC/La Jolla area, any services or anything that anyone knows of, that could help me out?",sandiego,Grocery Help

So that option is off the table. I've tried getting myself one of those disposable flu masks everyone is wearing, but they seem to be sold out everywhere! My only choice is to use a shirt. I like it because its easy to protect my entire head with it, but am afraid its not nearly good enough to filter out the virus. What else can I do? Are there any places left selling approved flu masks or respirators?",sandiego,"Seeing as how respirators and flu masks are reserved only for those directly responding to the virus, will wearing a shirt as a full face mask be good enough to protect me?"
