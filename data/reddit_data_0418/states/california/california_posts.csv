Three requests for you all:

2. If you're interested in California housing and want to stay informed via Reddit, please join r/CaliforniaHousing.
3. If you're a Reddit Pro and/or a California housing expert, please comment/message on ways r/CaliforniaHousing could be better.

Also, I love being near the mountains because I spend around 50 days a year camping.

So basically I'm just wondering if there are any cool towns in close proximity to the mountains, maybe 70 - 100k people, decent downtown, and 1 bedroom apartments at less than $800 for something  not in a ghetto.

A little background on us and what we like to do. Both of us are 23, we like the outdoors and smaller cities like Boston and exploring new places. We both smoke so we’re definitely going to be hitting up some dispensaries while were there and we also like to go out and drink/dance. We also like going to the beach and going hiking and seeing cool views. We also both like art not in the traditional sense like the mona lisa but more of the street type of art. Im big on trying new foods but she also has a gluten allergy so that can be difficult depending on where we go.

Basically we like a combination of relaxing/exploring and nightlife. Based on this or if needed ask me some more questions if it would make it easier to recommend where we should look into.",California,Los Angeles or San Diego for young adults?

Hey everyone, I am currently finishing up my teaching certification student teaching at a high school in Milwaukee. I grew up in chicago and moved up to Milwaukee for schools, and am trying to figure out where I want to settle down. I've visited california a few times, once LA, once in San Diego, and loved it. However, I know it's incredibly expensive to live in the state and was wondering if its even possible to find a teaching job out there, and if a first year salary can even afford rent.

Some background info, I'm 21 Male certified for middle school and high school social studies including history, psychology, government, and economics(not as in demand as stem)

I know the state is incredibly diverse so the question can vary, but let me know about any areas where someone could live in the state as a teacher",California,"Teaching thinking about moving to california, is it possible?"

I'm proposing to my girlfriend in Yosemite . I've never been to California before and would like some advice , recommendations,  suggestions to make this work as smoothly and be  as memorable as possible , here's a basic layout of what I was planning .

Sunday = Leave/Arrive
Monday - Thursday = Yosemite 
Friday = San Francisco ( Golden Gate, Alcatraz,  etc?
Saturday = Highway 1 (views, wineries, etc?)
Sunday = Death Valley (mainly to end our trip stargazing)
Monday = leave 

(Also, not sure if I can fit in a visit to the Winchester mansion, if not , no biggie.)

We are also staying at the Yosemite Lodge during our time in Yosemite , Thursday night being the last.

I was planning on popping the question on top of half dome, and planning that day for either Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.. I also would be open to suggestions incase I can't get a permit for h.d. at all during the trip.. I'm trying the preseason lottery , as well as the daily lottery incase I dont get a preseason one.

Points of interest in Yosemite were, 
Half Dome, Glacier point , Mirror Lake , Mariposa Grove , 
Yosemite Falls, Bridalveil Falls. 

My questions are, 
Any advice when to start the half dome hike? I've read as early as possible to avoid alot of people.

I'm unsure as to  what days to plan the points of interest in Yosemite,  to maximize our time to see the most we can in Yosemite. 

After Yosemite the real question of planning begins, 
Will the golden gate and Alcatraz trip take up a full day? If not , what else would anyone recommend doing?
I know she would like to visit a botanical garden of some sort...

Highway 1, being a full day,  I thought to start that in San Fran, stop at some viewpoints and wineries throughout the day, 

Unsure where to stay at the end of our drive/venture down highway 1 to end up in death valley to stargaze?

After Yosemite, I'm open to suggestions on scheduling the rest of the trip to hit the points of interest, being unsure how long they'll take.

Thanks for anyone taking the time to read,  and offer any advice to make this trip special for us!",California,Planning a trip and proposal in California

**The Report link for posts and comments is only for reporting violation of reddit and subreddit rules.**

It is not for: 

* reporting a user who's politics or opinions you disagree with
* reporting a post with a topic or opinion disagree with
* reporting a post from a website you disagree with
* reporting a user who is engaging in whataboutism, gish gallop, logical fallacies, or other attempts to derail the discussion.
* reporting what a user does elsewhere on reddit
* expressing your bigotry (which you apparently won't express as a comment as an anonymous user) 
* trying to get a comment deleted that was made by a user you are arguing with 
* communicate with moderators (use the Message the Moderators link in the sidebar instead)

The administrators of reddit have recently said they are getting more serious about abuse of the report link and they've given subreddit moderators more tools for reporting report abuse.


Do not use inappropriate categories for reports. For example, ""Threatening, harassing, or inciting violence"" is for only serious threats that should be brought to the attention of admins and will likely get the user banned. It is *not* for reporting serious trolling (you should report that as ""Other"" and then add an explanation). 

If the reason you are reporting a post or comment is not *immediately obvious* you should include the reason in the report, or message the moderators.

If you are a mobile user that can only report the post or comment as spam and the reason is not *immediately obvious*, message the mods. [I've been told that *reddit is fun* allows you to report the reason.]

Don't use the report link for a post or comment you disagree with. **Disagreeing with someone's politics or opinions is not a valid reason for a report.** This is the most commonly abused reason, so I can't emphasize it enough.

Make sure you are familiar with the reddit's [Site Rules](https://old.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](https://old.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/), as well as the Posting Rules for r/California listed in the sidebar.

Most reports are now being ignored because the posts or comments are not violations of reddit or r/California rules. 

And remember Internet Rule #0: IGNORE THE TROLLS. Don't argue with them; they love the attention. Don't insult them; that's more likely to bring negative attention to you than them. Don't try to get in the last word. Ignore them and move on. 

----

No, reporting this post is not cute or funny. If you do report it, your report abuse will be reported to the reddit admins.

----",California,The Report link is *not* a super downvote!

574,574,Emeni09,1579877156,etbbc9,Nan,"Hi guys, 

I’ve tried searching for this, but did not find so much information (please share it if you find). 

TL;DR: we think of moving to LA in our 30's but don't really know what to expect in terms of anything. So looking for help. Salaries should be much better, but so are expenses, and a lot fo the things are unknown. I tried to put all the pros and cons down so people can get a feeling of what I think and can tell me where I’m wrong.  

Also sorry if I post in a stupid way, first time starting a post on REDDIT. 

First of all, I just want to state my opinions and feeling. I accept that different people might not share my opinion. I do not want to debate those, but I just want to say where I am standing 

So the story is like this. I am thinking of relocating from Munich, Germany to Los Angeles area with my wife (no kids). 

We both are from Eastern Europe (EU citizens) with PhDs in electronics. We both have extensively living abroad for the past 10 years. We actually met in Scandinavia and then passed through UK before landing in Munich. So relocating and living in a foreign country whose language you're struggling to understand (Looking at you Scotland) happened before. 

Right now we are both working in the industry making a decent yearly salary. Just bought an apartment (that was painful) but somehow we feel Germany isn't offering what we would expect. 

I have been on business trips to LA a few times and literally felt in love with it. I don't really know why :)) I really hate the traffic and driving and the occasional crazy people. 

But I love the sunsets, and PCH and people’s attitude, and beaches, and the laid-back attitude, and sunsets and PCH, and even the car culture. For some reason, every time I get there, even completely jet lagged I jump into the car and have to see the sunset in Venice beach (plane lands around 6PM). And I have to see Griffith observatory at least once. 

So let me try to summarize what we love about our German life, and what is really makings us consider California. 

Munich: 

Pros:

It is safe, full of parks and green spaces. It’s really close to the Alps (1.5h by car), to Austria (2h by car) and to family (12h driving or 5h flight+train). 

I get some nice work/life balance, where I get paid salary for 40h/week, and can only work up to 10h/day. Whatever time I do in overtime, I get it as free days (or paid, but it is heavily taxed). 

I have an extremely generous holiday package (PTO) with 30 days off + the overtime, and on average we get something like 5-10 more days off for bank holidays. 

I get good sick day benefits, where I get 6 weeks fully paid per year, afterwards I get like 80% or something like that. Don’t need that many, but nice to have. I do pay a lot for the health insurance, but it covers a lot (not eyes) and never tries to drop you when you’re sick. 

And as unions are powerful here, it’s really stable unless the company goes bankrupt or something. And unemployment benefits are okish, I get 1500Euros/month for the next year, which is a lot less than what I make, so being unemployed really hurts. 

The economy is stable, interest rates are quite low. Typical here is to get loans for \~40years with 10-20years fixed rate. The 20 year fixed rate now is less than 0.8%/year, with an inflation of 2% :) but this drove property prices through the roof. 

Public transport is ok, and safe and chilling in public with alcohol is allowed, such as drinking a beer in the summer in the park with friends or having hot wine at the Christmas market. 

Cons: 

I feel I am overtaxed. I pay on average around 45%. This is a lot for me. Especially as I see the lower (earning) class receiving subsidies for rent or kindergarten after paying less taxes, while those making a lot more than me receive a lot of tax breaks if they invest in the housing market.  This, combined with the low mortgage rates, ended up in the really rich driving prices up and raising rents. This means guys like me are the most hurt while the lower earning people get subsidies. In the end the uber rich get more money on which they have to pay less taxes. As we are coming from poor families we have to struggle to get even our tiny apartment. For 1 million Euros you can get in the suburbs of Munich (30 minutes to city center by train) a town house around 1300sqft (120sqm). Rents for a 1bedroom apartment (620 sqft) are in the 1000Euros+ range. And lately prices went up 10% per year. 

People are also quite cold, and will not talk to you in public unless they know you, and “uptight”, by always mentioning their title, asking to be addressed by their family name and most times are really unfriendly. Combined this with all the crazy rules: everything closing at 8PM, everything closes early on Saturday and everything is closed on Sunday, it drives you crazy. As you really have to make your schedule around those times, and you might not enjoy a sunny Saturday if Sunday is rainy. Then you can’t do laundry and stuff on those days either, or any type of noise during quiet hours. 

At the same time I do not feel I get paid that well. This was a problem as I did not know how expensive the city was, and how hard it will be afterwards to get a raise. I was assuming that after the first year, I would get a fair salary form my old boss based on work. But after working my ass off the first year, I got a thank you. 

Customer care also is bad compared to US. I think this is everywhere in central europe, but german companies really do not care about you after they sold you something. They feel entitled. Amazon is eating their market due to their amazing customer service. Except for Amazon, they rarely care about your complains and as a customer and after sales services are horrible. EG: BMW dealership told me my 4 yo car is old, so it's normal to have a lot of rattle from the suspension. 

California/LA: A lot of the ideas/impressions are also coming from YouTube videos and news/blogs I follow and/or might be just superficial as I have in total lived around 6 weeks in LA and 3 weeks in Andover, MA. 

Pros: 

I love the weather. Who doesn’t? The coastline is amazing, you get the beaches, and if you even get tired, you can always drive in-land towards the national parks our all the other crazy stuff you have there. I love the food and diversity of the food. You have that awesome climate that give you great local produce all year around. We really like healthy eating, and you guys know how to do that. Combined with all the different nationalities, you can find food from any culture in LA. 

We also love cars. We also love earth so here we have a lot of mixed feelings. But we love your car culture and recently, your electric car culture. We both are car enthusiasts, so we like nice cars, and we think we should be able to afford nicer cars (hello tesla) over there than here. 

We love the openness and diversity of people. People in US are really open, nice and friendly. I know its superficial most of the times. But it’s nice to be able to get to a bar alone and chat with someone and make some friends. Last time I was walking on the beach and staring at a guy’s car, he wasn’t really happy about my stare, but once I complimented the car rims, he was soo nice. :) 

I think in LA you get access to everything, everything you want is there. Also from its size the market attracts everything in. Combined with the American culture, you get a lot of things open all the time. While I feel bad for the guy making minimum wage, it is nice for me to have a lot more flexibility in my schedule and to be able to go and do groceries at 9 in the evening after I finish my other stuff. And for some reason, everything (electronics, cars, cloths) except for dining and housing seems much cheaper than here.   
 I also think salaries are much better, my basic research told me that a decent electronics engineer with 5+year of experience should be able to get $125k+ per year. Out of which, after taxes and insurance, he will get to keep a lot more than in Germany. This, combined with the competiveness of the US market should keep me more motivated and more satisfied of my work, as I get paid fairly for my work. This would also mean that I would have more money to invest (heard housing market is hot) and to enjoy life after a lot of years of studies. 

Cons: 

There are also cons, mostly related to safety. I have seen a lot of crazy people around. While I never had a problem with the guys in Venice beach at night, I do understand it is not always safe, especially in more shady parts of LA. Here I’m mostly worried for my wife and future kids. LA attracts a lot of people with its opportunities and promises of fame. Here I will also put guns, I know it might be taboo, don’t really want to debate it, but for me, I feel safer when I know that the chances of the other guy getting a gun on the black market are very slim. Here I might be wrong, but somehow, knowing the chances of a robber in Europe having a gun are almost zero, makes it more relaxed for everyone, even the police. Especially recently, you see a lot of crazy things on YouTube. Until internet I never knew what a home invasion is. **Are those typical?** Should I aim for a gated community? Or do criminals avoid the richer communities around the beach? 

The gun topic also makes the police look scary as they will always approach you with their hand on the gun. I always drive safe, stop for 3 Mississippi and drive the speed limit, but fines in US are crazy? Are the police understanding? Or they will fine you instantly?  

Rents are also crazy high in LA. I believe that is due to people moving there for the opportunities. My plan would be to build up credit score fast (american express is moving over my account with them from Germany, so that’s a start), save some money and then buy a fixer upper. Going out is also expensive, **do most people earn that much to afford it?** 

Another scary topic is social benefits, where I have no idea what would happen if on my way to work a guy runs me over and I end up in hospital for a few weeks/months. The impression over here is that this would bankrupt you and make you homeless, unless the guy has a good insurance and you get a good lawyer. I love to work, what would happen if I cannot support my family? 

Also the concept is that in US people are overworked. I like my 8h/day schedule, but I don’t mind to pull hard occasionally. That’s the key work, occasionally, as I really want to spend time with my wife and kids and enjoy California. And this is related to the PTO. I know I would get like 15 days, but is this negotiable? Would 30 days be absurd? For me, visiting my family, would mean something like 2 days on the road, more or less. What about sick days? What happens if I need some medical procedures in a year and they require me to take time off 2 weeks (happened before).

What about the health insurance? I heard you always have to copay. Is this true? Or is it true that they will try to drop you for technicalities or price you our based on previous medical conditions? 

What about costs of living? I really want to be better prepared if I make this step. I know mobiles and home internet is a lot more expensive, but what should I realistically expect for monthly costs? We eat out \~1/week and we like to cook in the house, going towards organic vegetarian food. 

Do you guys get maternal leave? How much? Is that paid? If too short, can that be taken also unpaid? I would love for my wife to be able to be with my kids for 2-3 months after birth. 

Right now I am still looking a lot into US, as it is still attractive. But the cons somehow are holding me back. I could get a chance to transfer within my company and bring my wife with me with a work permit, also (seems the new boss really likes me). This was offered before but at that time, I wasn't ready. 

What I am looking for help is regarding all the pros and cons I am seeing.

Am I missing something? 

Am I misinformed? 

Am I seeing things in too good or too bad of a problem?

What salary should I expect and ask for? 

My plan is to move and in 3-4 years to get my green card. Then I should be able to buy a house. I really want a cute little house to start my family. Even a fixer upper is perfect for me as I am quite handy and skilled thus a house that needs some paint and love would be perfect. This is not really possible and allowed in Germany (self-improvements) as you need a lot of certified work. Long run I would also consider real estate investment as my best alternative, as this could be something where my handy man skills could increase the value of the property.

So after this very long post, can anyone help me with advices? I don’t need an answer to everything, but I feel it’s such a huge step, and I don’t know where to start to judge the situation. We are planning a trip to US for the summer so my wife can experience it also, as she has only been on the east coast.",California,Need advice/options as I am thinking of moving to California/LA

I do not have a U.S. driver's license from another state, only a European one. I am a U.S. citizen but I have no documentation to support that I am a California resident. I looked over the CA DMV [residency documents list](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/a34dbefd-c615-4c07-a271-b135850de9d1/residency_docslist.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=) and I figured the easiest document to acquire is either a cell-phone bill or a vehicle registration. 

I have a friend who lives in L.A. who might let me use his address for my driver's license until I get set-up and get an address of my own. I was thinking I could use his address to start a cell-phone plan and use the bill as the residency document required by the DMV. If I open a pre-paid plan I could have the bill with the address on it in a short time-frame. 

The other option would be to find a beater car for like 200-300 bucks and have it registered in my name at the DMV. Could I just give them my friend's address and have them issue the registration in my name and that address? Or do they do some kind of check to see that you actually live at that address?

We chose to make a project about the difference in digitalisation between India and the United States. For example the difference between the governmental actions, Digital India with you guys, and a project to fund innovating businesses in the Netherlands. The survey is mainly to compare what we found with the reality, did the differences actually occur, or did some people write about it and everybody just assumed it as the truth.

in short, my parents are giving me their old car to me as a gift. I actually have been using it myself entirely for a year or so but now we are officially trying to change the ownership of the vehicle (car from 2012). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, i did some research on here and there as well as DMV website, it looks like i need 

1. Certificate of Title (with mileage filled out since the car is under 10 years old)
2. Statement of Facts (REG 256)
3. Smog Inspection (within 90 days of transferring) 
4. (PS. I live separately from my dad so it will be just me walking in with these documents). 

I think these are pretty much it. I tried to get hold of DMV personnel over the phone but too much barriers with Automated responses in addition a long long delay on hold...

2. Which products did you use to make it through, and what did you wish that you had?

He is informed by group members that there are enough people for the event already and his participation is not necessary.

I want to learn how to surf and dive. I enjoy the beach, oceanic conservation, wildlife, and much more that all ties down to aquatics. 

Can someone give me a recommendation on which beach/city would be the best? Below you will find what I hope to find in my long term and possibly forever home. 

- Lots of wildlife (seals, sea lions, dolphins, rays, whales, etc.)
- A lot of young people (18-30s)
- Lots of fun things to do
- Affordable to survive but not in the ghetto (yes I am aware Cali is expensive)
- City has the most beautiful beaches out of all other cities
- Safe

I want a place where I can meet many young people, beautiful beaches (kind of like a hidden beach where there is not thousands of people flooding the area(which I have seen florida is famous for), a good size city, plenty of things to do, good surfing waves, wildlife, etc. 

My only fear for cali is that I won't be able to afford for long. I am not sure how expensive it is but I have heard rumors and it freaks me out. 

Florida (good)
- I have heard the beaches are better/nicer
- easier to afford living cost
- temperature is better than Cali

Florida (bad)
- too many tourist flooding the beaches
- surfing is a hit or miss
- rare you will see wildlife (sea lions/seals/whales/etc.)

Cali (good)
- beautiful remote beaches
- beautiful surfing waves
-beautiful wildlife
- beautiful scenery
- tourist are not flooding the beaches by the thousands

Cali (Bad)
- I have heard it is expensive as hell
- I have heard it is hard to live there

I do not know much about Cali as I do have heard more about Florida. Please correct me if I am wrong about anything. If you choose a state please recommend a city as well that has a university that has Marine Biology (I am doing a bachelors 1st then Masters)",California,Beaches and marine biology

&amp;#x200B;

California's 2020 Proposition 13 is a state-wide ballot measure coming up on the March 3rd election  (NOTE: This is unrelated to the 1978 Prop 13).  The most significant parts of the ballot are not shown on the voter's guide, they are rarely mentioned in media, and even less by government sources: 

●　Increasing elementary and high school tax district's property tax limit from 1.25% to 2.00%.

●　Increasing unified school districts and community college districts's property tax limit from 2.50% to 4.00%.

Aside from approving $15 Bil in bond + $11 Bil in interest, the Prop will allow school districts to vote in higher taxes by raising the limit on property tax.  So far these local tax elections pass almost any where any time it is brought up, so if Prop 13 passes, school districts across the state will almost surely raise property tax.  When property tax increase, EVERYONE loses, whether you own your home or you rent.  The cost of owning a home will increase, and rents will increase to compensate the cost of taxes as well.  This is a terrible scenario when this state is already suffering from exorbitant housing cost.  Regardless of your political belief, this proposition will impact all of us negatively if it is passed.

nap card is getting declined in multiple grocery stores in every county I have been to so far. 
My EBT card was issued in Colorado, I am here for a job interview at the end of the week. And yes the job will be reported immediately if I am hired but I very much need my card at the moment. My card worked fine in Utah and Arizona as I travelled but is no longer being accepted.

More info:
My card is in perfect condition. I have spoken to the store managers at Walmart ect to find out why it was declined, they could give me no answers. I called the customer service line on the card. They could give me no reason why my card was being declined as it is active and has a balance. I called the office in Colorado where my card was issued. They also could not find a reason why my card was being declined and suggested I come get a new card. Not possible and I also do not believe getting a new card will help as mine is perfectly fine. I called a human resource office here in California, they suggested I should change the pin. Which I did. Still declined. I spoke with another friend who is from Colorado and also here in Cali, he is having the same issues. 

So what's going on? Is there some sort of glitch happening here? Has this happend to anyone else? Is it possible to resolve the issue? I really need to get this figured out as I need food asap...any helpful comments will be greatly appreciated!",California,My EBT card is getting declined at every grocery store here in California.

The top school I am considering is in Berkeley, and other great choices are in Sunnyvale, Santa Cruz, and San Franscico. Also, one in Santa Monica.

Some things I ideally want:

I don't foresee myself wanting to get a car....I am from NYC and I've never owned one.

Ideally I want to be close to (walking distance without crossing major highways would be excellent) to natural grocers such as Whole Foods, Trader Joes, fresh organic produce.

I want to have access to open-minded communities.

Average rent? I don't mind roommates.

How accessible to the woods / peaceful greenery is it? This gets me so excited, since I am coming from NYC and the only green areas are heavily populated by people yet still in the city.

Not sure the general vibe of each area, could people give their ideas if they've lived there? (Berkeley, San Fran, Sunnyvale, Santa Crus, Santa Monica, Los Angeles). But additionally I may supplement my full-time school savings and work a part-time job (maybe in a restaurant) and I would like to be close to a busy-ish city. But it's not a must to be near a major major city.

Also just to add to this, I was looking at a school in Los Angeles. What is the vibe there? Do I \*need\* a car? Hoping to have these areas compared with the NYC MTA subway system, I know it's not the best here but at least it takes me where I need to go, generally I don't need to look at what time it is because eventually the train comes even if I have to wait a bit longer at night.",California,"General vibes of each of these areas?

I currently live in Germany and considering moving to LA for a job as an Electrical Engineer. I have an offer on the table but have no idea what would be a good salary.  The Job is in the LAX area. 

Also, I have no idea what actual cost of living should be. Looked online but information is limited and sometimes incossistent (at least the one for Germany is quite wrong on comparison sites).

What I still lack to understand is:

\-what happens if I get fired? I do not expect this to happen, but just want to know what would the outcome be. in Germany we have unemployment insurance for 1 year minimum. 

\-what happens if I am sick for longer periods? Here I assume employer would stop paying me after the sick day allowance and then I'm on my own? or is the health insurance covering this for a period?

\-what would a good living area be, to be close to the airport, safe but also good for a young couple (early 30's)?

Anything else I should consider and do not realize it? I like LA and have been there a few times for 1-2 weeks at a time. But I am afraid I am overlooking a lot of things. this happened to me when moving within Europe, so I expect it to be even more problematic now :)

After years and year of having this vision for myself, it may possibly become reality and quite frankly, I’m getting anxious about it. 

I have the chance to potentially study/complete a 1 year residency in either the central coast (SLO) or the Bay Area, depending on which program I get into. I’m not so concerned about rent prices in SLO as they seem a bit more reasonable and the conditions of apartments/homes seem to be MUCH better. I am from New Jersey, so I am very used to seeing high rent and home values. However, NOT Bay Area high. I would say it’s comparable to NYC, but again, not exactly...

I found some apartments on Zillow in the Berkeley area for at least $2200+ for a studio or a 200 square-foot apartment and they don’t even come remotely close to being a decent apartment. They are outdated and quite obviously not in the cleanest conditions. I have friends living in NYC area who are paying that price for their own bedroom in a newly renovated complex. This is absolutely absurd. 

My genuine question is...HOW do college students in the area afford to live in off-campus housing when rent prices are off the wall insane? I cannot fathom having to take loans out to survive. Even in my undergrad years in NJ, I lived comfortably off-campus and never had to stress about money.

I lost my CA driver license on Labor Day 2019. The next day, I went to the DMV at the crack of dawn, did the Real ID paperwork at the same time, took a new picture, etc. to replace my DL. 

My birthday is in May, and this year is when my DL expires. 

I just got a notice from the DMV to renew my license, but it says I have to GO INTO the DMV and take a vision test, get a thumbprint and photo taken because my last 2 renewals were done my mail.

Ok, maybe that is technically true, but I JUST was at the DMV, took a thumbprint and new photo, etc. to get the real ID. 

Can I get them to change it to renew by mail now in light of that if I contact them or do I seriously have to go in and do all that AGAIN even though I JUST did? 

Thanks, everyone.",California,CA DMV - Driver License Renewal After Real ID

My wife and I are moving to California in May of this year. We do have a moving consultant who is dealing with the buts and bolts stuff, but we would love some general advice from locals if possible, please 😊

A brief on our situation

Wife works for a multi-national company who a based in the states so is getting a new role with her company in the Bay area. Currently runs Sales, Consulting &amp; market development for EMEIA but will dealing with commercialisation of SAAS and market penetration etc. All in all, she will be fine 😊.

Husband (Me) Has worked in general IT for 12+ years but specialises in Housing repairs and maintenance systems. Which in the UK are predominantly social housing systems which manage housing stock (assets) and the maintenance of this stock. I deal with both the technical implementation of these systems, process design and MI/BI.

Questions;

Job;

Do similar systems job roles exist to the Housing asset management described above?

Is there any suggestion as to what roles I should be looking at or people/agencies/companies to contact?

Or should I really be looking to upskill/change skills if I want to stay in IT?

Location;

We are currently considering our options for location to live (rental) We need to be within an hour, including traffic, to Milpitas. We are looking at Willow Glen, Campbell, Comms Hill, Rivermark, Saratoga and Japan town.

Any suggestions on places to live? Requirements are;

Within an hour of Milpitas

* 3+Bed
* 2+bath
* Garage
* Off street parking
* Walkable shops
* Local trails
* Sub $4500pm

We want to stay in the San Jose area for 12-18 months with a plan to move to San Diego after, depending on what happens with the job roles.

Banking

Is who we bank with important? Are there recommended local banks we should use?

In the UK we have multiple accounts with different Banks depending on what benefits we get. However, I would say the level of service is the same between them all… i.e. Online bank, Contactable between 16-24 hours, faster payments between accounts so it takes 2 hours to transfer upto 25k etc.

Taxes;

I won’t go too far into our personal finance however we own 2 soon to be 3 homes in the UK (all mortgaged) all will be Let (rented) out before we leave for the US. Providing a modest UK income.

We also have several ISA wrapped Stock and Shares accounts.

Is the above likely to affect our tax in the US?

I ask as we seem to be getting mixed advice over what is taxable income in the US and what isn’t. We do have a meeting with a tax firm in 2 weeks so hopefully they will be able to clear this up once and for all.

Thanks for spending the time reading and appreciate any answer or general advise around moving to the US/California.

Thanks

I'm not poor nor am I rich, I'm strictly a middle-class individual that has a job that pays well enough that I should be able to afford a house in and around the city I currently live in, Los Angeles. LA is now the most unaffordable city in the nation, even more than another California city, San Francisco. This is an issue many years in the making and has more visibly manifested itself with the increasing number of homeless throughout the state. These unfortunate souls are continually increasing because their leaders have failed them. These so-called leaders have failed to make the bold decisions when needed, failed to foresee a housing crisis of their own making, and now fail their constituents like never before.
The Governor's State of the State speech gave a voice to the homeless issue like never before. Declaring it to the most urgent issue that voters most complain about. However, building a bunch of homeless shelters will not solve the problem because that's not the root cause for a majority of the homeless in this state. It's simply a lack of affordable housing. Rents reaching $1,200+ for even modest studio apartments through much of the LA while the wage barely inches up is the issue. These increasing rents are driven by a lack of new housing. Rent controls will not work, they'll modestly help. If the vacancy rate shot up because of a supply of new housing, these rents would moderate or even decrease, so I'll just say this. ""Build. Build. Build. Build. Build. Build. And then build some more."" to anyone willing to listen. Anyone complaining of gentrification. To anyone complaining about apartment builds going up in their single-family residential neighborhoods. The population increase far outpaces the increase in housing. When the population increases by 30,000 a year but the number of new units only increases by 7,000 in the same year and this happens for a decade, home affordability will inevitably become a problem. Cities are more than happy to approve new office buildings but shirk their responsibility to building housing for all those people that will work in these newly approved office buildings. This feckless leadership has my blood curdling as I never expected it to.
Maybe this is just a part of a conspiracy to have Californians migrate to other states, turning them purple and then blue. If so, great plan. When it comes to voting, I've voted mostly democrat my entire life, yet I was moderate in my views when it came to fiscal matters. While I will vote for the Democratic nominee, no matter who it is. But I'll not do so anymore when it comes to my local representatives. They simply don't deserve it anymore.",California,Open Letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom

We are unable to locate the pink slip which is the certificate of title I believe so I need to use form REG 227 and tick the ""lost"" box right?

Should we get an original duplicate title first prior to transferring title ownership? Or is it okay to go straight into the transfer without requesting for a duplicate of original title. Will that bite me later on in the future if I want to sell the car?

This will be a family transfer so after receiving a duplicate title, we can go ahead and use the new title or would be okay to use the REG 227 form now instead of waiting for a duplicate of title?

Then on REG 256 do we only need to fill up sections A,B and H? What about section G?

I've read things such as on from 256 it's better to use the gift instead of family transfer as the current value has depreciated which will lower registration and other fees. Car was bought new at 21.8k before taxes 2 years agi and now current KBB is around 17k but trading in will be most likely from 14-16k. Should I stick with family transfer or use gift?

1346,1346,clipper75,1582418089,f81pyt,Nan,"One of the essential elements in casting in concrete infrastructure today is the form liner, which adds patterns to the outside surfaces of walls and bridges. In California, amidst the recent push to invest funds to improve highways and other projects, Creative Form Liners (CFL) aims to play a major role with its custom and creatively designed urethane-rubber form liners.

The California Transport Commission recently approved $244 million in new funds to be spent on 71 projects, including highways, bridges, passenger rails, and other transport options. Of the funds, $87.4 million will go towards state highway systems upgradation and maintenance, such as safety, pavement repair, preservation and rehabilitation of bridges.

CFL is committed to helping California improve its infrastructure design quality and reduce its ecological footprint by suggesting the use of a sustainable, recyclable product. The company’s reputed line of urethane-rubber form liners includes both custom and off-the-shelf patterns which carry several advantages over single-use form liners.

Keep in mind, there is no ecological way to justify using single-use form liners, such as AVS or ABS liners, which only get between 1-7 pulls and, as a result, more liners need to be purchased for the job, unnecessarily increasing the project’s construction costs. In contrast, reusable urethane-rubber form liners can get 50-100 pulls, creating a much more eco-friendly and cost-efficient product. The cost of urethane-rubber form liners pays for itself over time since it can be repurposed on future projects, eliminated their need to purchase new liners. The designs available are of top caliber since the material conserves a higher quality of detail due to its flexibility. The final outcome is a finished exterior surface that meets and exceeds expectations.

“The unmatched strength and reusability of our urethane-rubber form liners are fast-becoming an industry-standard, making these economical liners a preferred product for most contractors and their clients,” said a Steven Weitzman, CEO for Creative Form Liners.

CFL has an unparalleled 25 years of experience supplying the most environmentally conscious, economical and visually impressive custom patterns and urethane-rubber form liners across the U.S for the improvement of state highway, bridge and urban development projects. Its team of designers and craftsmen are known for their modular form liner designs that can be reorganized into countless arrangements and repurposed across multiple projects. All of these considerations make CFL a strong resource for California’s proposed redevelopment and upgradation efforts.

About

Founded in 1998, Creative Form Liners, Inc. (CFL) projects have won numerous of awards providing superior elastomeric/urethane-rubber form liners to Departments of Transportation, engineering firms, architects, landscape architects, and concrete contractors across the country for their highway, bridge, and urban-environment projects. CFL brings your decorative architectural concrete projects to life with exquisitely custom detailed designs or standard patterns such as Fracture Fin and Ashlar Stone. Work cast with our form liners can be seen in over 1/3 of states in the U.S as well as Washington, DC.

The request must arrive by Tuesday February 25, 2020.

For more info on voting by mail, see:

https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/vote-mail/

&gt; You may use the application printed on the voter information guide that is mailed to you by your county elections official prior to every election. You may also visit or write to your county elections official for an application or you may use the California Vote-By-Mail Ballot Application (PDF).

&gt; Before a presidential primary election, a No Party Preference (NPP) voter may use the California Vote-by-Mail application (PDF) to request the presidential ballot of a political party who is allowing voters to vote their party’s ballot. For more information visit our No Party Preference Information page.

&gt; After reading the instructions, type your information directly into the application, then print, sign, and date the application. Mail the completed application to your county elections office. Please do not mail it to the Secretary of State's office because this will delay receipt of your vote-by-mail ballot.

&gt; Or you can Apply in Person: Any time after 7 days before Election Day, you will need to apply in person at your county elections office to request a vote-by-mail ballot for that election.

&gt; or you ** be able to Apply by Telephone: Contact your county elections official to see if your county allows you to apply by telephone.

Note: If you are in a Voter's Choice county, every voter received a mail-in ballot, although you can still go to a Vote Center to vote. [Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Fresno, Los Angeles, Madera, Mariposa, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Sacramento, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Tuolumne]

The bus driver let's us all have some extra time to get any food or cold drinks trying to help ease the pain of going through the heat. Well of course everyone stocked up on cold drinks. We went on our way down to LA. Everyone on the bus started to have to use the restroom however that wasnt the smartest idea on my end. I went to the restroom and as I stepped into the restroom.... what was in the toilet splashed all around including onto my clothing. Not a whole a lot but it was enough that I did smell. After my self and many others complained about the restroom it was closed off and we still had about 2 hours to go.... I didnt even go yet. 

FINALLY!! I am in LA getting off the bus to get onto another bus. I got try to wash the nasty off me in the restroom with my 2 suitcases, 2 backpacks, a pillow, and a blanket. I figure out where I need to be and I wait about an hour until I can get on my second bus. 

Now I am headed from LA to Las Vegas. An older man asks to sit next to me. Of course I let him and I move my backpacks. 

He decided to sleep all the way there. Perfect tbh. I got to sleep as well and I got to enjoy the ""view"" lol.

I took some photos and was having a much better time than before. Until we then arrived in Las Vegas. I got of the bus and ran inside to run through the building to try to find somewhere to gamble a $1 bill my nephew gave me specifically to gamble with in LV. Sadly EVERYWHERE was closed. I took a step outside and started using GPS. I walked up the street a little big and around the corner and nothing was open.... so I turned around and went right back in just to wait. As I was waiting a man walks into the bus station, throws his arm in the air and yells ""I need a bus ticket... someone stole my phone, my wallet, and everything I own.... I need a bus ticket"" and he sure as hell gets his bus ticket. It was kind of funny cuz right after that he pulled out his wallet to pay for the bus ticket and then with his dennys food he sits next to me and tells me all about how it's his birthday and hes lucky he was able to get that free breakfast so he could get a bus ticket. 

Thankfully my bus driver called everyone BACK onto the bus and here we went on our way yet again.

Mostly if my family of 4 can survive on a major budget cut if we move from a low COL (North Florida) to a high one like LA for major job potential. Here is our current lifestyle we have planned for ourselves in low cost florida. Trying to follow Dave Ramsey’s budgeting


 • We would be living off of $120000

 • We would probably rent for the first year at least. Looking for a good neighborhood but school district doesn’t matter. 3/2.5 at minimum 

 • Looking at sending our kids to private school. I have looked at a few but haven’t chosen one yet but let’s say $20000 per year at minimum for tuition, books, uniform, trips fees etc. (We only have one young kid right now so the total cost of the expense would be like 5+ years away so plenty of time to save? Even if we end up with only the one kid they would not be going to school for like 2 years)

 • For medical need to check actual figures for copays/oop/deductibles but it’s low and a good plan

 • Food is a big one for us. My husband and I LOVE FOOD. As a childless couple we would spend upwards of $600 on food just at the grocery store so I can only see this increasing as our kids get older. We also prefer to learn about a city by eating out and drinking. I saw a recommendation for a restaurant here and they were charging $13!!! for a bowl of oatmeal. And since it’s Cali definitely need a weed budget and won’t be spending that much on alcohol. But I mostly shop at ALDI and Costco if that tells you anything about our spending habits.

 • Two car payments would be happening. Probably leased in the beginning as we weigh the option to permanently stay. We currently drive a Honda pilot and a Toyota Rav 4 if that helps

 • All insurance would be through USAA

 • We will be paying debt aggressively before this move so we would have little to none to account for

 • All savings accounts need to be bulked up from being drained for emergencies over the past 2 years. Currently have do have retirement, savings, and college funds.

 • Entertainment: Would prefer at least one vacay a year (like 4 day cruise price point is what we did in Florida) but would probably be happy just exploring the state for a while. Definitely will be going to that Disney just to see what’s different. But day to day I’m not above jumping on a mom blog to find free stuff for my kid to do or just going camping for a while",California,Family of 4 moving to LA/LaHabra

----

# Independent voters: aka No Party Preference (NPP) and Decline to State (DTS) 

First of all, you should [check you current voter registration status](https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov) to make sure you didn't inadvertently register with the [American Independent Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Independent_Party), a far-right party associated with segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace.

Use the following links to learn more about voting in the presidential primary as an NPP registered voter:

https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-info/how-vote-president

&gt; As a voter registered with No Party Preference, if you want to vote for U.S. President, you must request a primary election ballot with presidential candidates.

&gt; The American Independent, Democratic, and Libertarian Parties allow No Party Preference voters to participate in their Presidential Primary Elections.

https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/political-parties/no-party-preference/

If you want to vote in the primary for any other qualified political party, including the Republican, Libertarian, Green, and Peace and Freedom Parties, you need to be registered with those parties.

Quick facts about me - 28 y/o female in medical profession, recently experienced life change and seeking something new. Have lived in two major cities in the East Coast and I enjoy the ability to access public transportation and diversity of cities. Would like the ability to interact with lots of people, and also love lazy days on the beach, and hiking.

I am fairly confident that I will be able to get a job soon after landing in California – in whichever area I choose to go to. I have done some research and areas that currently attract me are San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego. Concerns about San Francisco are that the cost of living will make living there less enjoyable for me, concerns about Los Angeles are that people will be career driven and superficial, concerns about San Diego are that it’ll be too slow paced/not as diverse as I would like. Am I on-base with any of these concerns?

My husband owns a smoke shop and has a feud with his next door neighbor. That neighbor has been doing everything to get my husband out of business. First they called the property manager to say we were a playing loud music and annoying other businesses. When that didn't work, they did something far worse yesterday. They called the cops saying a homeless man is attacking our store with a gun. The police show up, said they got an anonymous tip and are reporting. When my husband said nothing is wrong, they left, walked over to our neighbor, had another conversation and then walked back saying they need to search the place.

Then that same homeless man comes knocking on our back door saying he is looking for my husband and wants an oil burner. The police answered the door asking do you want an oil burner or meth? The homeless man said he wanted meth. My husband begged them to record, they refused and he told them he has never seen that homeless man in his life and that this was a set up by the neighbor business.

They pushed my husband, forcefully searched him, put him in handcuffs and then said that there was a complaint that he was selling drugs out of the store. They shut down the store and asked him to gibe consent for the search, he said no, get a search warrant. They shut down the store for the rest of the night. They asked him to not have me (his wife) and his Lawyer come, because they wanted him to sign under duress. All the while the neighbor business are outside laughing and enjoying the show.

I show up with the lawyer, they refuse to let either of us speak to him, never read him his rights, wanted him to sign the document without consulting someone and refused to record anything. They were already searching before the search warrant came 5 hours later.

Next, my husband get transported to the hospital for heart and blood pressure problems. Eventually they gave him a ticket for having Drug Paraphanallia and let him go. They told us not to go back to the store as they will be conducting the search and to stay away. The police officer that was  gaurding him at the hospital finally admitted in confidence that he was set up by the neighbor business. Next morning I go and the store is upside down. They took the safes, the video cameras, cell phones, all money, and a bunch of stuff.

The truth is, my husband recently fell on hard emotional times and in the end has been using drugs. I didn't know the extent of it because he would only do it at work and not at home. This is hard for me to admit and now I know he needs help and has a problem. We are working on that.

The issue is, they want to pin on him that he has drugs intending to sell. He admitted to me that he had this stuff but never sold it and if they go through the phones and the cameras they will see there is nothing. The bigger issue is that he left a lot of money in the store to buy product. Now they will assume that money is used for buying and selling drugs.

I feel really scared and stuck. Until I can get to an attorney, can anyone shed some light on this? We are in California. No charges have been made yet. What do we do with the ticket. Can we fight this? Can he get lesser charges?

The dialogue about the impeachment starts near the beginning. Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.

The virus is here in California and the number of infected individuals is increasing, both from folks who'd been overseas plus we're starting to see community spread of the virus. The news is changing rapidly, but if every bit of California coronavirus news (infections, deaths, closures, rumors, etc) was posted to thus sub (often multiple times), it'd be overwhelmed.  There are already subs for in-depth California coronavirus news: /r/coronavirusCA and /r/CoronavirusCalifornia 

So this megathread is more about gathering useful info and major government announcement.

I've seen enough panicking, fear-mongering, and rumors elsewhere on reddit. There will be no tolerance in that behavior here. Please stick to credible information from reputable sources.

1884,1884,66of66,1584195642,fij260,Nan," My wife had reservations to fly Alaska Airlines from Oklahoma City to  Fairbanks on Sunday March 1, 2020.  There had been considerable news  about the Corona Virus hotspot in Seattle, so my wife was very concerned  about spending any time in Seattle.   Alaska Airlines had a mechanical  issue that delayed the flight in Oklahoma City to Seattle be at least 2  hours.  My wife repeatedly told the gate agents for Alaska Airlines that  she did not want to fly to Seattle is they could not make sure she got  her connection to Fairbanks, because she could spend the night with her  mother in OKC.  Alaska Airlines personnel assured my wife that she would  be able to make her flight to Fairbanks prior to boarding in OKC.  Of  course, at 12:30 PM on Monday morning at Sea-Tac airport, my wife was  told that she had to spend the night in a hotel in Seattle.  The hotel  room was smelly and dirty.  My wife did not make it to Fairbanks until  nearly 10 PM Monday March 2, 2020.  On Thursday last  week, my wife and I  came down with flu like symptoms that rapidly progressed to difficulty  breathing.  I was diagnoised this week at a medical clinic with  pneumonia.  I cannot get a Covid-19 test due in Alaska because of the  crazy guidelines adopted by the State of Alaska, but my wife and my  symptoms are exactly the same as Tom Hanks described on the Television  on Thursday morning.  Despite making a written complaint with Alaska  Airlines and calling and leave the customer service Vice President a  voicemail, we have heard nothing from Alaska Airlines about this  incident.   I wanted everyone out there to know that Alaska Airlines  actions have vividly demonstrated to my wife and I that Alaska Airlines  has absolutely  no concern for your health and should be strenuously  avoided as an air carrier option in these trying times, unless you want  to spend the night in Seattle and be needlessly exposed to Corona Virus.",California,ALASKA AIRLINES IS UNSAFE TO FLY DUE TO CORONA VIRUS AND THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD PASSENGERS

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

If you live in SoCal and are looking for friends, please check out [SOCAL ASIAN INTERACTIVE](https://facebook/com/socalasianinteractive) on Facebook &amp; our Discord Server! We're a social and networking group based in Southern California with members who meetup throughout regions such as Orange County, Los Angeles, San Gabriel Valley, San Fernando Valley, Inland Empire, and San Diego. We do IRL meet ups and even fun online activities (in lieu of the madness going on with COVID-19 right now)-- (attached images).

We have a strong online community on Discord where we host movie nights, game together (League of Legends, MapleStory 1, Overwatch, Apex, etc.), and have conversations on topics of popular interest (Dating &amp; Relationships, Anime, Business &amp; Finance, Fitness &amp; Health, Study Groups, and more!).  

We're only two months old and are looking for new friends to either meet up IRL or chat online with. You can find us on Facebook and Discord. If you have any questions, our Admins on the Facebook group can answer them for you. No, you don't *have* to live in SoCal or be Asian to join. :) 

Facebook Group: [https://facebook/com/socalasianinteractive](https://facebook/com/socalasianinteractive)    
Discord Server: [https://discord.gg/9mUUaJh](https://discord.gg/9mUUaJh) (must join on Facebook before given access to Discord)

2148,2148,danielthetemp,1584693313,flrlfl,Nan,"Gov. Newsom issued an order on Thursday night for residents to stay in their homes, in an effort to thwart community spread of COVID-19.

I've thoroughly read through[ his executive order](https://covid19.ca.gov/img/Executive-Order-N-33-20.pdf) and the[ California government's official Coronavirus website](https://covid19.ca.gov/), which states that ""Everyone is required to stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job. If you go out, keep at least 6 feet of distance."" Newsom references powers granted to him by the State Constitution and three particular Government Code sections: 8567, 8627, and 8665.

[Government Code Section 8665](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-8665.html) states:

*""Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter or who refuses or willfully neglects to obey any lawful order or regulation promulgated or issued as provided in this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a fine of not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by imprisonment for not to exceed six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.""*

If I am reading Gov. Newsom's executive order, an official CA government website, and Section 8665 correctly, it is currently a misdemeanor (punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both) for Californians to leave their homes ""except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job.""

Can somebody please tell me whether or not I'm interpreting this correctly, and if not, what am I missing?",California,"Did Gov. Newsom just make it a misdemeanor (punishable by a $1,000 fine or imprisonment) for residents to leave their homes if it's not for an ""essential service?"""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)

So here's an attempt to create a list of some California superlatives, as father some stats on where California fits in the US and the world. I'll also try to find some California-only stats, such as the oldest business, etc. 

----

* [the General Sherman (tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Sherman_(tree)), the largest tree in the world by volume
* [Lake Tahoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe), the largest alpine lake in North America
* Mount Whitney at 14,505 ft (4,421 m),[1] the highest point in the contiguous United States

[California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) has more people than [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations\)), it's larger than [Germany or Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area), it's the [5th largest economy in the world](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-now-has-the-worlds-5th-largest-economy/).

If you are a renter and have been in any way affected financially by the Covid-shutdown, consider withholding your rent as well. Same goes for mortgagors, and people with loans and debts.

We have strong protections and advocacy to do so in California as well as local jurisdictions. There is a Statewide Eviction Moratorium so nobody is losing their home...yet.

Eviction protections, while necessary, will likely kick the can down the road and build debt for renters and mortgagers alike that will be difficult to pay off. I believe we need rent and mortgage FORGIVENESS. The banks get bailed out. The large corporations get bailed out.

We get a matter of months to settle debt regardless of whether we lost work or not.

Think about what money you might need and whether that's better resolving housing debt or saving for food and crucial supplies. Think about whether you want to stay in your current house and how you might resolve a debt if you choose to go that route. 

Do your research, know what the available options are for you and make the best and most responsible decision for YOU and for your fellow community members.

Some people are communicating and organizing with their neighbors at apartment complexes (good idea!!).

People are beginning efforts to open (COVID-safe) lines of communication to neighbors and community members to share information and organize.

\-text, email, and social media chains

\-in-person getting information to populations that are not on the internet/non-English speaking.

\-big signage for roadways, overpasses, etc

\-petitions for rent/mortgage forgiveness

\-increase accessibility of information for what available options are for tenants (County websites and grassroots)

\-sample letters to landlords

\-other art: sidewalk chalk, posters, lawn signs, etc.

For tenants who want to organize a Rent Strike (or other organized nonpayment), the Bay Area Rent Strike website just launched today and it has many resources on how to organize: https://bayarearentstrike.org/.

People will be doing all kinds of things as the rent and mortgage ""due-date"" approaches. Some will pay in full or in part, some will work out payment plans, some will defer, some will actively seek rent forgiveness, some will strike and there are likely many variations of each.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

Best Regard,

This is important.
But can this increased hand washing lead to more serious conditions later on?

My thoughts are about CA's notorious fire seasons.  

Can extreme handwashing now by all 40 million help prepare a dried up state for what seems to be a reoccurring event? 

I truly pray for no external flames and wish that everyone's inner fire ignites to eradicate this viral demon. But - I've lived in CA for 30ish years. The past few have been hellish.

There are so many things that are happening right now that will make it harder for us to survive fire season.

1.No N95 Masks because Corona.
2. Increased stockpiles of paper goods that act as fuel for fire.
3. People are broke because Corona
4. Drought? Corona Handwashing, Corona cleaning = no water to fight fire?
5. ...I can think of so many more but.. maybe someone out there can let me know if I'm insane or if anything I'm thinking about is valid.

Thanks.

I know that at SCU the party scene is pretty good on Wednesday nights, Friday nights, and Saturdays. The classes are smaller and I would be able to get classes much easier.

See my dad was recently laid off from his job due to COVID-19. He filled for unemployment through EDD.ca.gov and everything. He got an email from them a few days ago saying that his EDD account was created, which allowed him to check his weekly benefits and everything. 

One of the requirements for getting unemployment benefits is to look for work every week. On his UI Online account it says he has to certify his benefits for 2 weeks in March (which is exactly when he was laid off). He didn't look for work for those 2 weeks because we thought he would get something in the mail from the EDD office that would say if he had to look for work or not. 

On his UI Online account under the section ""Work Search Requirements"" it says ""You must be able and available for work and look for full-time work each week."" My dad didn't do that. Again because he thought he'd get something in the mail about whether or not he had to. 

I read in various places and on a page on the EDD's website, that the work search requirement would not apply to people who have been temporary laid off and plan on returning to work for their employer (which he is). 

Again though, EDD wants him to certify his benefits and one of the questions asked is whether or not he looked for work. 

What I want to know is, when filling out the questions to certify his benefits, should he answer ""No"" to that question? Or should he lie and say he did and make up something? 

Our fear is that if he says ""No"". EDD may disqualify him and not give him anything, which is unfair to us because he was out of work due to the whole pandemic situation. We're also worried that if he answers ""Yes"" and makes something up that he's going to get in trouble. 

We're not sure what to do. We can't find anything anywhere about the work search requirement being waived. We haven't gotten any mail from EDD. I don't want my dad to get in trouble, but I also don't want my dad to not get benefits. We really need them right now. We keep getting conflicting information.

**tl;dr: My father wants to get unemployment benefits due to being laid off from work due to pandemic. The state's website is requiring him to have had applied to different jobs over the past 2 weeks, which he hasn't. Should he submit the truth and say ""No"" (and possibly not get benefits) or submit a lie and say ""Yes"" (and possibly get in trouble)?**",California,Question about Unemployment Benefits &amp; Work Search Requirements (COVID-19 Related)

I also know that the employment base of this town depends on prisons since some resources from the town got lost, for instance some mill closed down.

There's a bit in common that Lassen County, California has with Chippewa County, Michigan.  The state highway number near Susanville, 36 is also the DIGIT SUM of the ZIP code of Kincheloe, Michigan, and the DIGIT SUM of 395 (US highway) which is also near Susanville is 17, 17 a highway number in Ontario, Canada near Sault Ste. Marie, and that sometimes I refer to Sault Ste. Marie over near Michigan and Ontario as ""Susanville"".  If you look at another part of California, there's a Califronia route numbed 17 which goes near the San Jose area, and if you look at Ontario, Canada's highway 17, it goes near an island called St. Joseph (translation).  Also note that Q is the 17th letter in the alphabet, so don't get me started with the *Susie Q* subject.

I gotta say, the Kincheloe area in Michigan is known for one prison, and the area of Kincheloe (sometimes called Kinross) also had a prison fill in the gap left over of previous employment opportunities that it lost, and Kincheloe is in the same county that Sault Ste. Marie is in (Chippewa).  I also gotta say, that Sault is pronounced ""Sue"", similar to how Sue is the one-syllable form of Susan.  And in text, ""sault"", with it's other pronunciation, is also the last syllable of the word *assault*, which is a crime people go to prison for.

I know enough to describe how I acknowledge the role that Susanville has in it's prisons in California.  Anything more I should know about that area?",California,Anybody know anything about the Susanville area?

216,216,Fudgeinabottle,1586581415,fywwld,Nan," Hello, Everyone.

So for the past month now, I have these upstairs neighbors that's been turning on some sort of device. It usually starts around quiet hours 10 - 12 pm and last until 9 am in the morning.

After 3 weeks of the same constant noise that goes on for 9 hours or more straight non stop, I got sick of it and made a complaint to the property manager, so they spoken to the upstairs neighbors about the noise and they said it was a white noise machine. The problem gotten better after the property manager had told them about the noise they were creating in the middle of the night for 1 - 3 days.

Now the nightmare has started again and I am back at square one, so I made another complaint, and I just got a response from the property managers about the noise and they said the upstairs neighbor said they haven't used that device in weeks and that they do not know what I am hearing or where it is coming from. It was the same noise that I had complained about and as soon as I did the noise stop or it was manageable for me to sleep through it.

Turns out the manager is friends with the upstairs neighbor and now they are lying about the noise that is being created during the night. It is the same noise that I had complained about.

The noise sounds like someone put a cardboard box over you with a motor on top that goes on for hours non stop. I feel like I am being tortured here. I am a very patient person I really don't like to complain about things, but as you can see the noise is driving me nuts. It's like being in a room and hearing water drip over and over, eventually it will get to you. I feel like I am being tortured here.

Am I being gas lighted by the manager and the upstairs neighbor? What do I do at this point?

Please help, I seriously need some advice.",California,Upstairs Neighbors And Their Noisy Mystery Machine
