Also if you happen to live where you recommend, could you also recommend some fun things to do there? I’m looking for a 2 to 3 bedroom. It’s me and one other roommate and I’m bringing a cat if it makes a difference. 

Thank you!",newjersey,"New to Jersey, need recommendations on where to live!"

213,thegreenestguy,1578404205,elbn2k,Nan,"Long story short I went to Rutgers and lived off campus for a few years, so I'm pretty familiar with New Brunswick. I've been away for the past two years since graduating but just got a job in Edison. To be honest I'm a little weirded out by the concept of going back, like New Brunswick represents sort of a chapter of my life and I spent a lot of time there both on and off campus. I'm definitely into city life, being able to get around easily, having a nightlife, and all those things about New Brunswick. However, I feel like it would feel like a haunting or I'm a ghost if I went to the old bars or hangouts I went to when I was younger, surrounded by undergrads. It already started getting that vibe when I was a senior. I'm open to it but it's not what I dreamed I'd be doing by this age if that makes sense.

Now I'm in my mid-20's, and to be honest I've been pretty lonely since graduating and really do want a strong nightlife or at least community wherever I live. I will probably stay at this job for the next few years, so wherever I move will be where I'll start seeking to make new adult-friends. Which is why moving to the right place is important to me. I can carve out happiness wherever I am, but some places are just far flung from more popular towns. I'm living about an hour south, so a lot of my experiences the past year have been: take a 30+ minute uber ride just to go out to shore bars to see people my age mixed with retired people. Whereas in undergrad it was basically 10 minutes anywhere.

I figure Rutgers is a big school though, and there's a lot of opportunity in the New Brunswick area, so I can't be the first person ever to have done this. Have any of you gone through this sort of experience? Where did you live/move to? Do you guys have any apartment or housing recommendations? I think Highland Park and Metuchen are where I'm looking right now. Do people commute to Manhattan just to go out to bars/clubs or to do stuff in NYC over the weekend since the train is right here? I feel like that's a good opportunity but also is it weird to take a 30+ train ride to go out?",newjersey,"Moving back to Rutgers NB area a few years after graduating, any apartment/location suggestions?

* The highway is only two lanes, so if two people are matching speeds and not following the law on drive right, pass left you are never getting past them.
* The trucks lumber along in the right lane all the time, doing 55 in a 65. But the minute you try to pass, all of a sudden they can do 80.
* There's two speeds. 10 under in the right lane, 80 in the left lane. There is no medium. You're in trouble if you don't want to do either.
* 1 out of every 10 vehiciles tailgating you when you don't do 80 in the left lane is a FedEx truck, with its headlights practically in your trunk. I know you're on a deadline Mr. FedEx, but that doesn't mean you don't have to leave a safe following distance.
* There seems to be more State Troopers per mile than any other highway in the state. Which makes my point of you're either do 55 or 80 a bigger problem. I don't know what it is, but there's more of them out there than even the Turnpike, GSP, or 295.

What's a nice gym along US-1 that has good weight-training equipment including leg-press, chest-press, dips etc, so relatively less wait-time for taking turns to use the equipment in a cycle weight-training program. My schedule could be an important factor in this regard, given there's no way I could be at the gym in the mornings, and my ""preferred entry-time"" in the gym could be only between 5:30 PM and 7:00 PM.

I specifically follow this personal cycle weight-training routine in which I do not use the equipment for all the sets at once. For instance, I do Dips of 6 to 8 reps, then Dumb-bell Cleans of 10 reps, followed by Leg-press of 6 to 8 reps, and finally Bicep-curls of 6 to 10 reps, and follow this entire cycle for 5 sets. I signed up at Planet-fitness near my residence, and boy, was I in for a surprise!! By the time I head back for Leg-press or Dips, there's at least 10 people already waiting in queue before I get my turn, and my cycle-routine is entirely broken because I have waited too long for my sore-muscles to relax sufficiently.

I mistakenly  assumed everyone in the bar was from the conference, and further confused this one person with another conference attendee who was an internet friend of mine. Then to make it even WORSE I waved, told her to smile for the picture on this ridiculous disposable camera, took a picture and walked over to chat - only to be like ""omfg, you aren't my friend and I'm sorry about this!!"" So we had a laugh about it and took a selfie together - also really difficult to do on a disposable camera.   


I then LOST the disposable camera until January 2020 when I found it, didn't know what was on it, got it developed, and found these.   


If you know her - show her these pictures! I hope she gets a laugh, because it was a funny little Atlantic City moment.

To change the map so it shows the **New Jersey state senate districts**:

1. Click the basemap button (Next to the ""Menu"" button)

3. Click the house layers to turn them off

4. Click the senate ""fill"" layer and then the senate ""boundary"" layer.

It may take a few seconds for the data to appear.  It depends on how busy the GIS server is and the speed of your internet connection.

I'm currently living in the Phillipsburg area and I want to move closer to a bigger city (philly/NYC). My gf is from Queens so we want to live either in the Northeast NJ area or off of 295/95 in South/central NJ so we could commute up to NYC easily. I visited Plainfield and really liked that kind of feel but it felt a little run down. I'm okay with something that's not super pristine but I want to feel a little safer than Plainfield. So if anyone knows somewhere that has a nice downtown with a small town feel, I'd love to hear about it. I'm also looking for something less expensive than Morristown. (I really like the feel of Morristown also). So what I'm really looking for is something in between Plainfield and Morristown as far as cost of living and safety are concerned.

New Jersey recently awarded 45 applicants in its first-year pilot community solar program. The program is extremely ambitious and is awarding 40% of these to people with lower incomes, or what’s referred to as low- to moderate- income (LMI) customers. I believe this is the biggest carveout for LMI customers in any state yet, and it’s a critical piece of making sure clean energy supports environmental justice issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m proud to count myself as part of a team that helps ensure the LMI side of these community solar projects is full. Many states have had trouble with this so far, and I’m looking forward to pushing the boundary on this issue. That way as many can benefit from clean energy and possible, as they should.",newjersey,Upcoming community solar projects in Jersey help fight income disparities

Go to [https://www1.state.nj.us/TYTR\_RevTaxPortal/jsp/HealthInsuranceMandate/ExemptionMenu.jsp](https://www1.state.nj.us/TYTR_RevTaxPortal/jsp/HealthInsuranceMandate/ExemptionMenu.jsp)

&amp;#x200B;

Choose Marketplace Affordability.  It will than ask for your name, SS# etc, but until you hit the final submit it does not check anything.  Once you enter test everywhere, it will take you to the Marketplace Affordability Worksheet.

For line 1 enter 50,000 for income, line 3 enter $600 for monthly premium and line 5 enter 0 for premium tax credit .

&amp;#x200B;

You are entitled to an exemption if the premiums are greater than 8.05% of your income.  In this example, 8.05% of my income is $4,025 and my premiums are $7,200, clearly $7,200 is greater than $4,025.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the marketplace affordability worksheet is subtracting the annual premium ($7,200) from my premium tax credit ($0) resulting in the worksheet thinking that my premium is a negative $7,200.

&amp;#x200B;

Since a negative $7,200 is less than 8.05% of my income ($4,025), the worksheet rejects my exemption claim.  Yet the premiums are greater than 13% of my income, way over the 8.05% threshold.  

The NJ Treasury never even did a basic test of this worksheet.",newjersey,NJ Treasury messed up the individual mandate exemption form

Now, I found a functional zipper merge and I even kinda, sort-of enjoy the experience (I  will not disclose the location at this time).

So; am I obligated the to share the location of this intersection or not?

Yes, I realize that this is a 1st world, entitled, IATA issue; so please -- bring it on.

As an aside comment: why cannot traffic circles (AKA: roundabouts) implement a zipper mergey sort of process/algorithm?",newjersey,Zipper Merge

513,seacretthrowaway,1579108341,ep52f8,Nan," Hello NJ!  


I'm a recent transplant from the Bronx (25, moved for a job), and I really want to meet more people!!  


A little about me: College grad living in Monmouth and working in Elizabeth who would like some friends closer to home than work, but super open to anyone cool! 

I like hiking, art (I draw, paint, etc), live music (play piano and sing a little myself), lifting weights, traveling (abroad &amp; domestic), cooking, and anything to do with water! am gril. Willing to meet up/check out places anywhere in like a 25 mile radius (Asbury, Manalapan, New Brunswick, Elizabeth...). I drink socially, love checking out new places (towns, restaurants, bars, parks), and have my own car. Definitely want to meet people to just kick it with too--we don't have to go out and do any of that.

I made a couple GFs on Bumble BFF but we're also new and don't know anyone else, so it's done little to expand my social circle...and I still don't know ANY guys out here! Coworkers are not an option socially.

\#Where to go?!    
Where are good places to meet people in the ballpark of my age (21-30)? It seems the bars I've tried are mostly oldies. I found a couple with vibes I like in Red Bank, but when I've gone the young people I've seen are all couples! I don't have an SO, so it's difficult (inappropriate? awkward?) to approach couples and strike up a conversation.  


\#Any local events?    
Does anybody go to those events in the stickied thread? Are any of them worthwhile? Or do you know any others that would be? I've looked on meetup (this area is weirdly dead) and Groupon (also weirdly dead-- all the classes and tours I've found are in Philly or NYC) for more ideas, but no dice.  


\#Anyone volunteer?    
I love to volunteer and thought I might meet people that way, but I'm having trouble finding good volunteering options too! I like to do stuff like trail cleanups, habitat for humanity (doesn't seem to exist here? the nearest branch says it's for the university students only). LOVE animals but don't want to volunteer at shelters anymore (too many bites and a dislocated shoulder later...). Outdoorsy volunteering options seem slim right now. I am not religious, so church/ministry groups would not be appropriate. Any ideas? I truly miss being involved in volunteering, and I never anticipated it would be so hard to find opportunities!  
\#Grad students?    
I'm planning on resuming my master's this summer or fall. I was going to continue it online/remotely at my old NY institution, but I'm seriously thinking of switching to somewhere I can take classes IRL to meet people my age! Thoughts? Recommendations? Not even sure if I want to get my MS in the field I started it in anymore so I'm very open to trying somewhere/something else. :) (employer reimburses to an extent)

I was just terminated from my employer in New York because I did not pass a certification exam a second time. 

I currently reside in New Jersey and am unsure how to handle this situation. They also sent me a package to my personal email, however I am very cautious to sign anything because I am unsure about a few things in the document they sent me. I also don't want to risk losing my unemployment should I sign the document.

I knew I should have walked away after starting my employment there as there was no mention of this certification exam on the job description, but I thought to myself, how hard could it be? In addition to many other red flags I casually glossed over.  

So, here I am now wondering what I need to do. If and how to to file for unemployment and for which state? I am also unsure whether I should reach out to an employment attorney regarding this unfortunate event.

We've been keeping the heat at 55/58 (occasionally putting it up to 62-68 for maybe an hour or two once or twice per week) and I barely even hear it turn on when it's set that low. We've used the dryer maybe 4 times and the stove &amp; oven a few times per week, usually just for a quick dinner. We don't take long showers so I don't believe we are using an abnormal amount of hot water. We need insulation in our laundry room &amp; I believe we have a leaky window in one of the bedrooms. However, like I said above, the heat is usually set to 55-58 and I hardly ever even hear it turn on at that temperature so I don't think those two issues would be causing our heat to work that much harder. Our furnace is old, from 1988. 

We just received a bill for $177. The bill says we used 160 therms. I can't imagine what it would be if were keeping the heat at a comfortable temperature. From the research I've been doing, it seems like our bill is high for how we are using the gas so I'm curious to know what everyone else's gas bills average. 

If you've had the same issue as me (assuming something is wrong), how did you tackle the problem? I know our furnace can't be energy efficient so I'm thinking we should start by replacing it. Our air flow upstairs also isn't that great. I couldn't locate any type of air filter on our furnace either.

What is this particular soccer ball, you ask? Synthetic rubber. Why do want them? Because I'm collecting them. These are not your standard vulcanized rubber soccer balls you can find at every thrift store, yard sale, eBay, etc, nope.

What is synthetic rubber? Its either polyurethane or Polyvinyl rubber.

These balls were extremely common in the 1970's and 1980's, and used in just about ever youth and adult soccer club/league throughout Jersey. They were popular for one reason. They did not absorb water like the stitched leather soccer balls did. These soccer balls are easily confused with the heavy duty machine glued variants. Machine glued and fully molded are two different construction types, but they can look similar to the untrained eye.

If you played soccer anytime between 1970 and 1990, you properly know the exact type of soccer ball I'm trying to find. Soccer was a hot sport throughout the state back then, and so you wouldn't think finding just 1 or 2 would be that hard. Well it is. 

If you coached soccer, then you definitely know the type of ball I'm trying to hunt down.

[HERE](https://www.adoptapet.com/pet/27501092-new-york-new-york-cat) is her petfinder ad and [HERE](https://imgur.com/gallery/IRPKhB6) is an album of all her beauty. 

She’s almost 4, and is a loving, cuddly sweetheart who follows us wherever we go, flopping over strategically to try and get chin and ear pets. If you’re sitting, she will be on your lap and will trap you on the couch until you starve. If you’re not sitting she will mew plaintively until you are. All she wants in life is to be brushed and to chase the occasional string.

The reason we need a new home for her is that about 9 months ago she began to have these 10 to 15 minute episodes of redirected aggression. It’s only happened 3 times, and she’s not dangerous to an adult who will just leave her alone, but we don’t feel safe having her around young children. We’re not sure what triggers it, though there’s reason to think it’s when something is hurting her. Then she’ll hiss and swipe to get us to leave her alone, before 10 minutes later she’s 100% herself again and back to looking for attention as usual. Our vet has cleared her of any medical causes that she could find, but she takes daily amitriptyline for anxiety. Also the one eye is from kittenhood, and doesn’t affect her or require medical attention. 

There are no words to express how badly we wish she could have been part of our family for her whole life, but we are asking for your help. If you think you can provide a home for her please contact me, or if not please share her profile with everyone you know and maybe we can find her a family. If nothing else, if you have a connection to a no kill rescue facility at least we can give her up knowing she’ll be safe. 

Reddit, we really do need a miracle here. We know that any shelter that hears the word aggression in any way shape or form will either reject her outright or just immediately put her down. But we love her. She is our entire heart. Please help us save Arya.",newjersey,We need to find a new home for our cat.

I'm a 24 year old guy, graduated from college last year and spent some time at a temp job in New York. I went to college in Miami, and lived in Dallas for a bit.  I'm at home in big cities, and have never been happy outside of them. I grew up in a small town and it was 100% not for me. Right now I am living in my home town, and it's truly a awful fit. Being that it's the South, things might be different in Jersey. 

I know that not everywhere will have the opportunity and excitement of big urban areas, but I want to at least know that I will have fun shit to do on the weekends, a decent dating/social life, and won't feel like an outcast. Also, I want to be able to network and meet people in finance, tech, the sciences, and other industries. 

Are there any younger parts of town in the area or near by?

What's the postgrad, mid to late 20's dating pool like? Back here in the town I grew up in, there is a very, very minimal dating pool of 20 something college educated women (20 people tops).  There is nothing to do aside from give birth and get married at a young age... aside from hard drug addiction (welcome to the South). Most of the women I have met here want kids before 25. I don't want children, and if I do, I want them after 30. I am into more career driven women, I would like someone with the same values and life goals as me. I am worried that I won't find that in a small town.

What are the people like? I really don't get along with the people in my hometown. They are very petty, it's small (16,543  in the town, 159,923 people in the county) so everyone knows everyone... high school drama never ends. If you don't have the same lifestyle and ideas as the people here, you are a threat and and outcast. They like things a certain way and don't want it to change.

It’s a great area right near a high-school and a college in Ocean County (Toms River) but I’m having some second thoughts based on what people have told me about the landlord-tenant laws. 

Lots of people tell me the law almost always favors the tenant, if they stop paying rent they can live there for up to 6 months before being evicted? And I can’t sue for back-rent? Is this true?

Also in terms of taxes, is there anything additional I have to pay aside from basic income tax?

Can I also refuse to rent to section 8 applicants? Nothing against people that are struggling, but this is a really nice townhouse that I just finished remodeling completely (granite in the bathrooms, granite countertop, Nest thermostat, Ring doorbell, etc.) I’ve put close to $30k total putting new stainless steel appliances and remodeling every bathroom and the kitchen.

&gt;Fake guns that look too much like the real thing are now banned in New Jersey under a new law that seeks to prevent police from mistakenly shooting people carrying toy firearms.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gov. [Phil Murphy](https://topics.nj.com/tag/phil-murphy) on Tuesday signed a bill into law barring the sale of toy guns and imitation firearms that may be reasonably confused for a real weapon.  
&gt;  
&gt;The legislation comes after several years of outcry following high-profile police-involved shootings, many which killed unarmed black men. But two separate incidents in Ohio caused particular outrage after police shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice and 13-year-old Tyre King dead, after mistaking toy guns they boys had for real weapons and opening fire.  
&gt;  
&gt;**To continue selling fake guns in the Garden State, toy manufactures now must abide by the following guidelines under the new law (**[**A4260**](https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/A4500/4260_I1.PDF)**):**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The guns must be a color other than black, blue, silver or aluminum.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**They must have an orange stripe at least one inch in width. It must run the entire length of each side of the barrel and cannot be removable.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The barrel, which must be at least one inch in diameter and closed at a distance of at least one-half inch from the barrel’s front end, must be made with the same material as the gun.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Imitation firearms used in movies and films are exempt from the ban.  
&gt;  
&gt;Those caught selling toy guns that do not meet the new standards face a fine of $500 for a first offense and subsequent penalties of $1,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Democratic-sponsored bill passed the state Senate 32-6 and the state Assembly 54-19, with 4 abstentions. Both houses are controlled by Democrats.",newjersey,"""Realistic"" Toy Guns are now banned in New Jersey"

Long term Bon Jovi fan, seen them 3 times here in Dublin, Ireland but my extremely generous and crazy friend decided to spend his hard earned cash on getting us tickets to see them in New Jersey AND I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!

Visiting New Jersey has been on my bucket list for a long time so I'm really happy and getting to see one of my favourite bands live in their home state is just amazing. And my friend has never seen them live!!

Anyway, we'll be driving down from Cape Cod and would like to stay overnight after the concert (in July). It's in the Prudential Center. That way we can have the next day to explore New Jersey before driving back.

Any cheap motels / hostels around the venue? We're fairly easygoing and cheap, as long as it's relatively safe, clean and affordable it's all good. 

Personally, a good motel recommendation would be amazing cos we don't really have them in Europe and it would fit in well with my mini American roadtrip adventure! 

Any cool things or places I should check out? Nice places for a walk, anything that's typical of your state, anything related to Bon Jovi that a lifelong fan should see?

I see you guys have a lot of beaches, any of them nicer than others? 

Any advice and tips very welcome!! I'm truly excited to finally come visit!

Now, I may have concert tickets, but I still need a plane ticket so I'm gonna go rob a bank now...

I work in Hackensack, at least 4 times a month a different Optimum salesperson shows up at my office.  Every time its a nightmare trying to get rid them.  I know that salespeople tend to be somewhat aggressive but these people take it to a new level.

For example, my building is unmarked, with no obvious entrance and they ignore the doorbell sign, and just let themselves in and start walking around our offices.  As soon as I tell them I'm not interested they start rapid firing questions at me like ""Well whose your current provider, what do you pay, etc"" and refuse to take the hint and still manage to take me away from my work for at least 10 minutes and I'm forced to just heard them towards the door and lock it.

Yesterday one shows up, I'm the only person in the building at that time.  He opens the door and starts yelling ""Hello, anyone here"", and I ignored him hoping he would just go away.  This fucker walked up two flights of stairs and tracked me down and tried to give me his sales pitch.  I told him he had 15 seconds to leave or I was calling the police.  So he leaves and 15 minutes later my warehouse manager calls me saying some guy is in there demanding to speak to the IT manager (me), he apperently just started knocking on all our doors (we have multiple buildings on the property) looking for someone to peddle his crap to.

852,TheOffendingHonda,1579919636,etkva2,Nan,"I love in New Mexico, and bought an old Honda CB200 without a title. Which was kinda stupid. It's a complete bike and I rode it around for a few dozen Mike's before it crapped out on me.

Months later, I bought a frame with a clean New Jersey title with the intent of tearing down the motorcycle, restoring what I could, and rebuilding it on the new frame. 

Now, in New Mexico, for anything that has an out of state title, you need a VIN inspection from a police officer. That's a long and difficult process on my end.

What makes it even more difficult is if the engine number doesn't match the frame number. Not unheard of. Bug if the engine doesn't match the frame and doesn't match the name on the title and bill of sale, everything just got an order of magnitude more difficult.

So my basic question is this. If I live outside of New Jersey, can I transfer a New Jersey title from one name onto a New Jersey title in MY name without going across the country to make this problem easier to solve?",newjersey,"I don't live in New Jersey, but I've got a new Jersey title for a motion and need some help and/or advice."

I've been dating a Jersey girl for a few months now, I've never been there and don't really know anyone from NJ to compare notes with, so I have to take her word for granted when she says something is 'normal' in NJ. 

I don't mind the things that are supposedly part of NJ culture like ""no filter"" or brusqueness, ""schmoozing"", casual swearing etc. But if there's one thing that really gets under my skin, it's conversation etiquette. Where I come from, it's considered rude to cut people off or talk over them; to not wax lyrical but give a brief pause to see if anyone else wants a word. 

My girlfriend consistently cuts me off mid-sentence, and will start monologuing without pause. In the beginning of our relationship this often left me sat in silence for long periods while she talked *at* me. I've been trying to communicate recently that it leaves me frustrated being routinely spoken over and cut off all the time, but she just waves it off as Jersey culture. ""That's how people talk there"", she says. ""I didn't say stop talking, I just needed to say something"", or ""people from Jersey can talk and listen at the same time."" 

Is this legit? Is it common practice in New Jersey to cut people off or talk over them, to hijack a conversation? I'm amazed anyone can have a coherent conversation in NJ if the above is really true?",newjersey,Quick question on NJ culture

1127,SchalasHairDye,1580586463,exbi1p,Buncha savages,"After poking around for a little while here today, I noticed several posts from people asking things like, “Why are people still waiting in line for cash tolls instead of using EZ Pass in this day and age?”  And nearly every answer in these threads talks about conspiracy theorists who don’t use it because they “don’t want the government to track them.”  And while those people certainly do exist, that is not the case for everybody.  I wanted to offer an answer as to why I’m one of those people as of today.

I am amazed when I hear people say they have good customer service. Every single time I call them, they are rude, negligent, unhelpful, or some combination of the three. Hands down some of the worst customer service I have ever received. Consistently, every single time.

Their fees completely immoral at a 100x increase ($50 on a $0.50 toll?).

Their scanners routinely don’t pick up my transponder, and when this happens, they only allow you 12 “disputes” per year, even if you are a paying customer and it is their machinery that is malfunctioning.  This is all despite switching out transponders multiple times, trying them in various locations on the windshield, etc...

They refuse to work with people who have had some sort of life event that messed up their payment.  For example, I moved a few years ago, and I set address forwarding through my local post office, however, that post office sucked, and would routinely drop mail or RTS, even though I had forwarding set up.  So there were times when my transponder would fail, and the violation wouldn’t get forwarded.  I didn’t find out about these violations until much later, at which point EZ Pass refused to work with me on them in any way.  Sure, this is partly my fault due to not updating the address with EZ Pass directly, but as anyone who’s moved knows, there are so many different accounts and things to update that at least for me, it’s impossible to remember them all.  That’s why I relied on the post office to correctly forward my stuff, but EZ Pass doesn’t give a shit about that.

They prey on people with less money by not allowing them to sign up for auto-replenish, essentially forcing them into a situation where they forget the balance in their account and run up more tickets.

And most frustrating of all, they lie about their collections process just to extort more money from residents. They say “this violation has gone into collections, call this number to settle it.” But when you call that number, the collection agency either straight up doesn’t exist or “is not accepting payments at this time.” You then get redirected back to EZ Pass, only to find out that they actually DO still have complete control over the violations, but will still refuse to settle the debt in any way whatsoever. Total bullshit.

I have been back and forth with these guys so many times over the past 10 years, and I’ve had enough. Again last month, the scanners didn’t pick up my transponder, and even though I have an account in good standing, they will not let me apply the violations to my account, because it’s already happened 12 times in a year period. Last Summer, I got a new car, switched everything over and verified it, but still had around 6-10 incorrectly applied violations from scanners malfunctioning by October. So now, they want me to pay another $100 in administrative fees, even though so many of these “disputes” weren’t even my fault.

They can kiss my ass, and it has nothing to do with any conspiracy theories.  EZ Pass is exploitative and predatory.  Just because you’ve never had any of these problems doesn’t mean they don’t exist, and I’m sure there are many people who don’t use EZ Pass for similar reasons.  I’m done with them. Back to normal tolls it is.",newjersey,NJ EZ Pass and their predatory practices: a rational explanation as to why I’ll never use their EZ Pass system again

I've never really lived on my own for a significant period of time -- I've either lived with family or subletted places with roomates. I'm curious what I should know about apartment hunting and leasing in NJ. I'm talking about stuff like rights and expectations. For example:

1. I've heard that in NJ, last month's rent is illegal to collect. A landlord can still ask for first month's rent (ofc) and 1.5x that rent for the security deposit. Is that true?
2. I've noticed that a lot of apartments are being advertised for availability by management companies. If I get an apartment via a management company, do I have to pay a broker's fee ontop of first month's rent and a security deposit? Apologies for being such a newbie about this, I'm very new to the process.
3. How does NJ handle security deposits? I know in some states that a landlord has to provide an itemized list of purported expenses tied to withholding a deposit. Is this the case in NJ? Anything I should keep in mind to help me get my deposit back?
4. Any other peculiarities of NJ housing law I should keep in mind?",newjersey,Quirks of apartment hunting in NJ?

1303,carapoop,1581022001,ezyrlo,Nan,"About three and a half years ago my girlfriend and I bought a couch from Raymour and Flanigan (the one on 17 North in Paramus). It cost us just over $1000 and lasted about 2.5 years before one side was sagging so badly that you couldn't sit on it for more than a few minutes without starting to get back pain. We trucked through it for another year until we couldn't take it anymore. Last week we pushed it against a wall and started sitting on our dining chairs instead. It's ridiculous and we know we need to get a new couch.

***However***, we absolutely will not buy another couch from R&amp;F or any other big-box furniture store. I'm an engineer and used to work in construction, so I am handy enough that I figured I'd try to fix our couch before getting rid of it. Watched a bunch of great videos about how couches are built, how to repair common issues, etc. Finally three nights ago we flipped ours over and was surprised to see that the damage was much worse than anticipated, far beyond my capacity to fix it. The cheapo plywood frame has split in at least 4 places and three of the springs detached (actually, they ripped off the piece of wood they were anchored to). I realized then that our couch was very poorly constructed. At this point it would cost about as much to fix this piece of shit than it would to buy a new one. Further research has shown that basically any big-box couch is going to be made with this same low level of quality. 

So I'm on the hunt for a really good couch: 

- Kiln-dried hardwood frame is non-negotiable. 

- Eight-way hand-tied springs are strongly preferred but I'm willing to buy a sinuous spring couch if the frame is rock solid, as we want this to be a 15+ year couch. 

- Upholstery options are the lowest on our list, especially since we plan to keep this long enough that we'll reupholster it again down the line anyway. 

- For budget we're trying to stay under $5000 but are willing to go $1-2k higher if we have to. Just can't really justify dropping $10k+ on a Hancock and Moore, despite how fucking sexy those couches are.

We're pretty desperate as it seems very few companies make built-to-last couches anymore. Does anyone know of any good manufacturers who make sofas with these features? Likewise, has anyone found any good consignment shops that see quality vintage furniture? Is anyone just looking to offload a 25-year-old Hancock and Moore couch and needs a buyer?

The reason why I am selling it is because I was initially robbed from my original copy (including my other games) when waiting for my girlfriend to leave work.

Long story short, I reported it when lost, saw the guy from the security camera, and next day found the same guy at the plaza, police came and arrested the guy. The dumbass admitted he took it but 'forgot' to bring it back to the lost and found. Picked up my stuff from the NY Precinct the day after then.

1317,JanaeNay,1581055533,f06cc9,Nan,"In 2018 Governor Phil Murphy enacted the NJ Earned Sick Leave Law. I work at a local ER (started in March 2019) and management in my department has been known to be sneaky. I called out one day in July 2019 for a “mental health day” which I actually got my earned sick leave PTO for (we had a supervisor at the time who took over payroll for my manager). In September 2019 eventually the supervisor left so things were pretty inconsistent to say the least. I had to call in sick that month due a severe cough, fever, nausea, and being near syncope (I felt like I was going to pass out). When I made that call my boss was clearly not happy about it. She bitched at me for not being able to come in by saying, “you ask for more hours and now you’re calling out?” Like I’m sorry, I don’t plan when an illness occurs. Anyway, I went to my doctor to get medication and a note which I left in her mailbox. I also confirmed via email it was in her hands. I noticed I did not get paid for that day and my earned NJ paid sick leave has been stagnant at 32 hours since July. I have definitely worked enough hours since then for it to increase.. 

Currently I have the symptoms of suspected pneumonia and I honestly do not know what to do. My job does not offer me medical insurance and I am not eligible for Medicaid even with the little money I make as a registrar. I cannot afford to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for a self-pay doctor visit. My mom and sister are nurses going to NP school so they did a medical exam on me but cannot prescribe medication or write official notes. Should I go to work feeling like shit, risk getting everybody sick, and possibly worsen my condition for the sake of the money and making my boss happy? Or call out, get some rest, have my boss bitch at me again, and not get paid for the day? 

Most of all, should I report my manager for not giving me my paid sick leave in Sept 2019? I know someone is going to say “it’s your money you should be on top of it” but I also feel like I shouldn’t have to hound my own boss to do her job right and give me what I earned when I need it.",newjersey,Concern regarding NJ paid sick leave

Adding 5-10 minutes to my commute time wouldn't be that big of a deal.

Regardless of morality, is this actually possible? Doing something like this with trains or bus passes could cut the monthly cost down by a lot without costing me that much time.

Ever had interest in coding but never got the chance? Now's your chance. Treehouse Apprenticeship Program now has open applications for a Full Stack JavaScript program in Piscataway starting in late April.

[https://teamtreehouse.com/join/apprenticeship-newjersey](https://teamtreehouse.com/join/apprenticeship-newjersey)

You go to the above link, read the details, and if it sounds like the right fit you click ""Start Now"".

The application process is like this:

* Complete the introductory track and mini-project (about 20 hours)
* Receive an application and return said application

Wait and see if you were accepted! The program has a **paid, full-time, 4 month learning phase** onsite at the company. This is where you learn to code with a cohort and have regular check-ins with your Treehouse Mentor.

After the learning phase, you may have the opportunity to move onto the paid apprenticeship phase as a software developer(3 months). Once you finish the apprenticeship phase, there is the opportunity to apply and be considered for full time employment. Last year, this agency hired just under 30 apprentices into full-time employees between two locations.

*Not everyone who makes it through the learning phase will make it to the apprenticeship phase as this process is competitive;* however, if you have the grit and determination and think this may be the right fit, please apply!

There has also been a black or gray car harassing and threatening people in the late evening and early morning hours around here.

He then proceeds talk down to me like I'm a child , how its ""Illegal"" to walk on the road which I know is false and then he demanded my ID , address which I didn't give him.    I asked if I was allowed to go ,he did say yes but not before he gave me another condescending rant about traffic / pedestrian laws half of which were false.   Apparently hes also never seen me around town either despite the fact that I've lived here for 30 years and do some of the towns photography.    

I guess i'll have to add no more morning walks to the list of things I can't do without being harassed in this town.     He also said it was weird that I was walking at 330am.

Wondering if anyone has ever considered being a living kidney donor. I put out a previous post and the hospital process/staff says they're looking for possible donors that live in-state or even close by states- so that they can conduct the evaluation process at their own facility or one of the hospitals closely related to theirs. 

(Me and my uncle share this account to try and reach out but right now it's the daughter writing to you) So my mother is B+ with 11% kidney function. At 10% she would need to begin dialysis and would love to get the ball rolling on an absolute match. If anyone is willing, please PM me and ask any questions you have!

The wife and I are both pretty involved with our kids school. We've been very happy with the teachers we've had. Wish there were more extracurricular activities offered but we try to supplement. 

Over the past couple of years many of our friends have decamped for the burbs for the usual reasons: better schools, more affordable housing.We've made do in a small 2 bed apartment but with a boy and girl, we really could use a third bedroom. We're starting to look at small townhouses in our area, but for the same price we could (theoretically) afford an actual house in say Bergen County, areas with the highest ranked public schools.

And here's the sticking point for both us: our commutes right now are *really* good. I work a mile from our home. Wife's commute to NYC is 30 mins door to door on the PATH, no transfer. Both of us can take the kids to their after school activities (not the 3pm ones, but say the 5pm classes) and take turns helping out/attending the various school functions. If we move to say, Ridgewood or Montclair, there is no way either of us would see our kids before 6pm, unless one of us found a new job closer to home.

Neither of us have family who can help out, which is why the long commute has been the main deterrent to moving up to now.

We both work in midtown (37th/Bway &amp; 26th/Park) so the train would be multi-mode since it’d require at least 1 transfer to a train bound for NYC Penn or Path to JSQ then transfer to 33rd. If we opt for train transfer to train, do you have to switch platforms for the AM and PM commute?

Regarding the bus, it looks like NJ transit 113 would be the option. Say you’re waiting for the 6:02am express bus and it’s full, will there be another express immediately after it or would we have to wait for the 6:17am one?
How would that work in the evenings? 5:10pm express bus is full, you’d have to wait for the 5:20 express? With ALOT more people waiting for the buses in the evening hours, how competitive does it get to get a spot? A seat? 
I saw Boxcar was a bus option as well but their buses aren’t early enough as we need to be in office by 7am on Mondays and 8am for the rest of the week. 

Does anyone do a bus one way and train the other way? I had read an exceptionally dated comment from almost a decade ago that said the passes could cover either mode?

 Live Nation is reportedly suing anyone who tries to sell fake merchandise at Post Malone shows.

According to court documents obtained by [***The Blast***](https://theblast.com/c/post-malone-concert-dates-runaway-tour-merchandise-bootleggers-new-jersey-lawsuit-live-nation-seize-court), Live Nation is asking for restraining orders against any vendors attempting to sell fake merchandise outside of Post Malone’s show in Newark New Jersey, as well as his upcoming show at the Prudential Center. In the suit, the concert promoter giant is accusing vendors of selling low-quality merchandise outside of venues, pretending their merchandise has been endorsed by the pop star.

The electrician said it was an older 100amp max breaker and the unit was using far more. It needs to be replaced with one that can handle 250. I have no idea what any of that means, but we’ve been without power now for 24 hours- lost about $150 worth of groceries and missed out on work (I work from home). 

Not to mention it’s cold as hell in the apartment. I tried to save the groceries with ice but I’m pretty sure the frozen stuff is destroyed. 

Landlord is trying for the cheapest option to replace the thing- I am concerned that it was unsafe while we were in the unit. He had a new HVAC installed and the electrician today said that was likely using far more than it should have. Is that a violation? Was it unsafe for us to live there? I’ve been told it will be fixed tomorrow at the latest. 

Basically, I’m curious what anybody knows about my rights in this situation. Also what you might do in a situation like this... 

Wondering how much right a renter has in this situation to loss of property regarding withholding rent or whatever. He offered us a hotel but mostly we are concerned about missing work and loss of food. Going to communicate that much to him soon.

I fractured my radial and ulnar bones on 2/8 not work related, I went to doctors on 2/9 (urgent care confirmed fractures) and orthopedic on 2/11. I dont have health insurance currently (dumb I know) so I'm paying every thing out of pocket.

My orthopedic doctor gave me severe restrictions on work and my jobs HR department confirmed they dont have work available for said limitations (job is 99%manual labor). 

My HR manager told me to apply for temporary disability benefits since I will be out for a few weeks and that it's my best option. I've been working with this company for 6 years full time.

HR just kept telling me to apply for Temporary disability not fmla or w.e and they said it's all done online to file a claim, that theres no way to do it otherwise, I just apply and will get approved. 

I let the doctors office know I would be filing for it per my HRs advice on 2/11 and filed a claim that day.



It still seems kind of strange to me since it seems too easy of a process so I asked HR manager once again if they were sure I didnt  need paperwork from or for them or my doctors and HR said no it's all online and that whatever they need or the doctors office will need to fill out will be sent to them respectfully once I file online.

However its been almost 9 days since I filed a claim (2/11) online and I'm getting anxious and starting to overthink which means I'm worried that I messed up. If I dont get approved I'm going to be royally f***ed. 

 I haven't gotten anything in email or mail from the state (besides the prepaid debit Visa card that funds will be attached to IF I end up approved).

So, what train station should I take from NJ, I live in Toms River. I see there is an 18 minute ride to Penn Station from Newark that runs every 10 minutes, from there I can take the subway or an UBER/taxi to where I need to get to but I was hoping I could find a station closer to where i'm starting from. Even taking one train to Newark and then taking off from there would be better than driving to Newark.

This is all just kind of intimidating, I've never done this before and I usually drive into the city, but it's just so expensive between tolls and parking.

I'm a senior communication major and for my senior seminar project, I'm putting together a documentary on the rock and roll history of Asbury Park, NJ.

I would love any resources I could possibly get that is why I'm reaching out to you guys, maybe some of you are an AP historian, or you know someone who could possibly help, or maybe you just have some ideas/recommendations.

But, one thing that I would really love is media from back then, which I know there is archives and databases I can and will access for that, but I thought why not reach out to good ol' Reddit because you never know who/what you might find. So, if any of you spent some time in Asbury ""back in the day"" and have old photos that I could feature in my documentary that would be amazing. (Of course, you will be credited).

I’m looking for someplace authentic though, for adults not children, where you can truly look for stuff and not just buy a bucket of dirt in which they’ve planted rocks for kids to “find” like some roadside attractions do.

I’d really like some places where you can actually dig through legit tailings or untouched dirt and find some rocks or whatnot to keep. There’s a place in Nevada where you can go opal mining where you pay quite a bit of money to dig into the dirt banks with pickaxes and other tools and you get to keep what you find. Is there anything like that anywhere in Jersey? I’d travel to another part of the state if needed. Heck I’d love someplace to pan for gold too if there’s anywhere here that has anything more than the very rare speck of flour gold.

I’ve been in Jersey a couple of years now but I don’t get out too much, so I’m trying to find some fun weekend things to do that don’t involve too many ticks, and do involve rocks or gemstones or minerals.

1903,JKastnerPhoto,1582564891,f8ujy6,Nan,"I am devastated to hear about the fire on top of Mt Tammany. I've hiked this trail several times and photographed as much as I could each visit. From sources I saw, it looks like it started on the Red Dot Trail, which is the main and most popular trail to the overlook at the top of Tammany. Being that yesterday was a beautiful Sunday to get out, and whenever it's a nice weekend day the place gets crowded, it sounds to me like this fire was man made. 

I'd hate to speculate, but every time I go up that trail (or come down if I am up there for sunrise), I come across some of the most disrespectful people. I have been at the top of that mountain early one morning and found an illegal campsite, with littered with liquor, clothes strewn out on the rocky surface, and a freshly burnt out campfire, all blocking access to the overlook. I have seen litter all around that area, people smoking, drinking, and even cooking. Not to mention those who blast music, fly drones, and put themselves in precarious situations for selifes. Just look up Tammany on Instagram, and you will see all sorts of obnoxiousness all for the gram.

This fire was inevitable. The total disregard for nature and others up on that mountain is getting worse and worse each passing year. I think the park rangers and volunteers have done a spectacular job keeping the place tidy, but with it being off-season, it's hard to keep up on nice winter days. It's hard to stop everyone from being jackasses at any given time either.

But to those who hike or plan to hike in New Jersey (or really anywhere), please, please, please show some respect for what little we have. It's not much in this small, densely populated state. If you want to party, do it somewhere else. The rest of us come to places like this for a tiny semblance of escape into nature. This fire could have been prevented.

It is technically my second offense, but counted as a first as there had been a 10 year gap in the offenses. I attended the 12 hour IDRC program in November and was referred to a substance abuse evaluation. Unfortunately, I missed the appointment and rescheduling took quite a while. During this time a letter of non-compliance was sent to the court. I went to the court date and the judge reinstated me, I already had my new appointment set up.

I voluntarily went to an inpatient detox program in May 2019 and have been living in a sober living house since June 30 2019. I called IDRC today to confirm my appointment and I was told that the evaluator will likely require me to go to a 90 day outpatient program and that I will technically remain non-compliant and suspended until its completed. My 7 month suspension is up next week and it is difficult to fathom another 3 months of suspension due to this error. IDRC told me that there is nothing that can be done.

I intend to show up with paperwork form the detox, the house I am currently living in, and my acceptance into law school that I will be attending come summer. I am very worried that they will nevertheless mandate me to this program, and I will not get my license back. I'm looking for any experience or advice on this matter.",newjersey,IDRC

Mount Laurel is home to a small farm and nature learning center called Paws Farm.  Paws has been a landmark for learning and history in Mount Laurel for years.  The property is owned by the Township and until recently was operated by Garden State Discovery Museum.  Yesterday, Paws announced that Discovery Museum had terminated their contract.  As a result, Paws is forced to close down.  The township solicited bids from other operators in an attempt to keep the doors open but did not find a suitable deal.  Here is an article from the local newspaper describing the situation:

https://thesunpapers.com/2020/02/25/paws-discovery-farm-announces-closure-final-day/


As a Mount Laurel native who visited Paws Farm many times during my youth, it breaks my heart to think all the history that is going to be lost.  Moreover, I am deeply concerned about the well-being of the animals.  Discovery Museum is required to find them new homes but I am skeptical.

My Girlfriend of 6 years, who lives with me at my parents house where I have lived my entire life, is a teacher in the process of getting her masters degree in NY. 

She is looking for a job in NYC right now, most likely at a pre-school until she finishes her courses next year. We would really like to move into the city as it's where we spend a lot of our time, where most of our friends are, and so that she can be closer to work. 

1. What are then chances if I apply for exemption that it would be granted? I know that you can check out the meetings and have seen that over the years more and more people get granted, as it's over 90% of applicants are granted exemption now. 
2. Should I wait until she actually has a job in the city to apply? 
3. Which direction should I take? I orginally thought ""competing residencies"" but I don't think NY has any residency requirements for their teachers. 
4. I know fill out the form and send it in with all of your backup and proof and then get a court heraing, but does anyone know how long it typically takes? is the court date a month away, 6 months away?

The plan was to do the paperwork and actual transaction with the buyer at our business, as a public but safe venue. This is where the car is located. We're not a car-related business, car is only here because of mechanical issues detailed in ad and it's off-street in a parking lot. Cash/Venmo/Cash App gets paid, we fill out Bill of Sale paperwork, we sign title, and we were going to give the buyer either 24 or 48 hours to move the car. We'd make a copy of the Bill of Sale for us, and the buyer would get the original. The plates would be removed prior to sale, and insurance canceled as soon as transaction concluded. It's probably goes without saying since we have the title, the car is long since paid off and no liens exist on it.

1. Do we need to go to the MVC with the buyer or is our plan to do everything at our business sufficient?
2. Do we need any other info from the buyer, or other info we have to record from the buyer? 
3. MVC site says we have to surrender our existing plates, but we were planning to move those to a new car which would be purchased very soon after this sale (money from this sale = down payment on next car). Do they still need to be surrendered?

Notes:

* She was found at Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown, New Jersey, near State Highway 94. She was found by a gravedigger. The body was found lying on its back just over a steep bank that leads to a creek below.
* She was found days after her death and had begun to decompose.
* She had brown, shoulder length hair.
* She had her left ear pierced twice, due to decomposition it is unknown if her right ear was pierced.
* Her right hands nails were painted red.
* She had on blue eyeshadow.
* Her top two front teeth appeared slightly darker than the rest.
* She had “inverted” nipples.
* She had been wearing a shirt and skirt. The clothing the victim wore possibly originated from a store in Long Island, New York that is now closed. The shirt and skirt were manufactured in the midwestern part of the United States.
* She had a cross pendant tangled in her hair.
* She had her skirt thrown on top of her legs, no semen was found due to decomposition and it is not known if she was sexually assaulted.
* She may have seen alive at a supermarket two days before being found by a mother and child, who recognized the clothing found. She was described as having her hair in a bun with a stoic facial expression.
* No trace of drugs were found in her system. Some reports claim Princess Doe's blood contained alcohol. According to Lt. Kranz, Princess Doe's blood had actually fermented during decomposition.
* She had been severely beaten prior to her death. Her face had been bludgeoned beyond recognition. Previous examinations indicated the victim died weeks before. She is now thought to have been killed less than a week before her discovery.
* Examination indicated that the girl had attempted to fight back or defend from her attacker, as trauma to her hands and arms was observed.
* Donna Kinlaw stated that her husband Arthur Kinlaw was involved in the victim's murder. She stated that her husband had picked up young women and had them involved in a prostitution ring. She claims to have seen them together, who apparently killed the victim and threatened her if she was to turn him in. She also stated he was also responsible for the murders of other victims, some who remain unidentified. Investigators are skeptical of this confession, as many question the credibility of the Kinlaws. He was never charged. 
* Isotope analysis indicate the had spent time in various regions of the USA, including locations like Arizona (from the tooth sample) and had lived at least seven to ten months in the Midwestern or Northeastern United States (from the hair sample). For this reason, She is a suspected runaway.
* According to the moderator of the [Princess Doe website](http://www.princessdoe.org/) the prosecutor's office put here DNA into gedmatch sometime in 2018.
* Police believe Princess Doe was from the Long Island, New York area, and was estranged from her family.

Dear Members of the Campus Community:
 
Effective immediately and with an abundance of caution, Monmouth University is cancelling all classes (face-to-face, hybrid, and online) for the remainder of this week, with spring break beginning as scheduled on Saturday, March 14. We encourage students to safely return home and avoid travel during this time. Faculty members will advise on changes to course syllabi and make-up dates for midterm exams. Residential and dining services will remain open for students living on campus; all commuter students should remain at home.

On Monday, March 9, a student contacted Health Services to report flu-like symptoms and was transported to Monmouth Medical Center for further evaluation. No additional information is known about the student’s condition at this time.

We are asking faculty and staff to continue to report to work to prepare for the possibility of delivering all courses and programs virtually—at least temporarily—starting March 23.  University offices will remain open but any employee experiencing any flu-like symptoms should remain at home and not report to work. The University has enhanced its disinfecting and cleaning protocols.

Monmouth University continues to work closely with local, state, and federal health agencies, and we will update the campus community as additional information becomes available.

We want to emphasize that this action is a precaution taken to provide peace of mind to students, faculty, staff, and families. There are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 associated with the university. We will keep you updated and informed as more information becomes available.
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. Patrick F. Leahy

Are the seats labeled or numbered to help me find my chair?

2509,ItsThatGuyAgain9,1583862867,fghwzb,Nan,"For about a month I have been growing increasingly worried about coronavirus. The Governments stance that we weren’t at risk, while only testing 100 people for weeks, seemed like the mentality of an ostrich with its head in the sand. A month ago I stocked up on essentials, a few bottles of hand sanitizer, cleaning products, rice, nonperishables, medicine and vitamins, and a respirator mask (P100) so I wasn’t taking away the n95 disposables from those who need them (healthcare workers). 

I started avoiding going out to eat, going to the mall, parties and bars at college, and anywhere with a lot of people. Washing my hands after coming home, and whenever possible while out. And wiping down all door knobs, switches, remotes, cell phones, and countertops daily, and spraying Lysol on furniture and surfaces that can’t be wiped. Since last week I have voluntarily stopped going to class at college, as covid-19 testing was finally beginning and I go to a large university with many commuter and international students. The number of cases has been increasing exponentially as testing continues, so I at least feel validated that my suspicions weren’t as outlandish as I was told. Everyone ridiculed me and called me paranoid, but now the majority of colleges in Jersey have moved to online instruction, and there are talks that mine will begin this week or post spring break. For the sake of my family members who are older at have many health issues, friends who are immunosuppressed, and anyone else who is at risk I’d rather protect myself to protect them, sort of a herd mentality. 

Many of my friends seem nonchalant about coronavirus, listening to rhetoric online and the news rather than statistics that are finally becoming mainstream. Such as the flu having a mortality rate of .1% compared to estimates of 1-5% for coronavirus, and how wildly more infectious and robust Covid-19 is compared to the common cold or flu. I’m starting to see a change of opinion in many people, but I’m curious how other people from the area have been impacted, and their outlook on the situation.",newjersey,How have your habits changed since Coronavirus?

“Members of the Rutgers Community:

 
Fostering a healthy community in New Jersey is core to the mission of our University. While at this time we are not aware of any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our community, we have been closely tracking its spread across our region. We have an imperative to do what we can to slow the spread of this serious virus and protect those who are most vulnerable. This is a difficult and extraordinary situation, and I recognize that people throughout our community are concerned for their personal health and that of their families and friends.

 
To that end, and with thanks to all members of our community who have taken steps to help us prepare, I am announcing that Rutgers University is taking the actions listed below. We do not undertake any of these changes without careful consideration of the hardships and inconvenience that they may impose. Thank you for your patience and your understanding, as together we navigate this challenging situation. 

 

Classroom Instruction at Rutgers – Camden, Newark, and New Brunswick:


-Beginning Thursday, March 12, through the end of spring break on Sunday, March 22, all classes are canceled.

This includes barring us from meeting to discuss how we moved forward during the closure - nothing is allowed at all.... yet, they still expect us to attend classes for the rest of the week.

If it's bad enough to close everything and force everyone apart, why are we still attending class?

Someone started a petition to have NJIT cancel classes earlier than Spring break. Figured this might be a good place to share since, well, we are based in Newark.

She has since also tested positive. She attended classes for days before the school closing including a pep rally with thousands of students. She also had a party over the weekend. 

So those exposed students and their siblings and parents and anyone they’ve come in close contact with are potentially infected and currently are spreading the virus. 

The Health Commissioner, Judith Persichilli, has stated that she has good reason to believe that there is a community spread ongoing.

“Thirty-seven people in New Jersey are under investigation and awaiting testing from state labs, as of Wednesday afternoon (03/11/2020).

Hello guys!

I'm sure this is a recurring question but I need help on what to do.

I am a current college student (full time), resident in NJ - middlesex county area, but my school (private college school) is in NYC.

I turned 26 just this past November, and was on my parents insurance till the end of the year.

I don't have a lot of income, I work part-time now ( I was a full time in the same company before I started going back to school) roughly $380 - $400 every two weeks ( Hourly is 13.77 for 2 business days 9-5)

My basic info are:

Male - asian/pacific islander - 26 - full time student - college in nyc - residence in nj

My parents work for a state university in nj if that matters.

Is there any student health insurance program that is not expensive or that I am eligible to enter with low income and being a full time student even if I'm over 26?

My old insurance under my parents was with horizon blue cross blue shield NJ.

Any tip or advice can help!

Thank you,

confused broke college student",newjersey,"26 full time student, part time worker, no insurance"

The only defense we have against this virus is hygiene, social distancing, and our health care system. We have seen in other countries the healthcare system can’t handle this alone. 

China did not sacrifice its precious economy because of “media hype” (which is laughable btw because there is no freedom of the press over there!), and Italy and Spain have not locked their countries down over a “hoax”. 

The only way to break the chain of transmission right now is social distancing/isolation, and washing our hands. At this point, it’s everyone’s civic duty to do this. We all live in this society.

I’m a little unsure about that part considering when I worked at a hospital we wore respiratory masks (the looser-fitting ones with ear loops) in droplet precaution rooms.

The CDC website recommends masks for family members caring for sick patients. It doesn’t specify what kind of masks. It also states that the most likely form of transmission is droplets in the air within six feet of an infected person.

Here’s the thing: if you don’t know if you’re infected and thus contagious before you have symptoms, wouldn’t it be prudent for everyone to wear masks right now? I would imagine that most people are spreading this before they’re symptomatic, so wouldn’t masks on as many people as possible help right now?

I get that people need to be careful when putting their masks on and taking them off so that they don’t touch their face, etc. but at this point I’m far less worried about that than I am breathing in someone’s coughed out or sneezed out droplets.",newjersey,Face masks - time to use them if you have them

The response was to clean the areas the employee may have been. But, their policy still remains to have employees come to work. The virus was in our building, may still be in our building, and they want us to continue coming into work.

We have full capability to work from home using Microsoft Onedrive and VPN. We had a meeting on Friday to inform us the only way we are allowed to work from home is if we meet 4 categories, granted proper documentation for approval:

1. Infected
2. Exposed
3. Caring for someone who is infected
4. Caring for children sent home from school.

There is no preventative measure being offered by the agency. If these 4 categories don’t apply, the direction is to report to work.

I’m just venting my frustration.

In our holiday season the department I work in processed over 70,000 units/transactions with a crew of 9 full and part-timers, excluding management. We sanitize our counters every night as much as we can if we have supplies, we used the last can of Lysol and all we have are disinfectant wipes left.

When you place an order online to get your order from the fulfillment/warehouse to a physical store requires a lot of manpower and point of contact. Every time you order, visit a physical store or return an online item in a physical store you're risking yourself to contaminate yourself but other retail workers. Our age, health, and socio-economic ranges are all across the board, Retail is one of the biggest industries in the service sector, but what makes us all similar is we are one of the most vulnerable groups. Most of us don't have safety nets and if we do we care for love ones who are ill, young, older or at high risk.

My mother had pneumonia five years ago, although she's healthy I am worried if I am exposed to Covid-19 and she becomes infected it will not be...great.

Basically, all I'm saying is this:

If the online retailer offers free shipping to your home ship to home.

If the online retailer requires you to pay a shipping fee to ship your stuff pay it or reconsider your purchase. 

If you really need it call the store first if they have it the store could hold it for you if possible or just run and get it quickly. 

Please, do not browse, window shop, or idle. Get in and get out.

If the online retailer offers free shipping for returns do it. Online shipping is better than it was 10 or 20 years ago.

If you want to risk people and your self to return to the store from what you bought online don't do it.

If you have a customer service issue 9 times out of 10 it can be resolved over the phone with customer service. If you have a store credit card you can pay online! 

And if you already ordered something to be picked up in the store if there's a line waiting for your order come back at a later time. I appreciate it and you! 

And if you have a Bill/Credit issue stores department/big box stores no longer officer credit services in physical stores it's all by phone--to Redditors who have older parents who insist to pay their bill in store PLEASE help your parents with their bills. 

I don't mind helping people, I actually like helping people, but the elderly are at higher risk for infection and retail workers. But I along with my co-workers don't want to be infected.

I'm a Jersey City jazz pianist and I'm trying to spread a list my friend came up with that is essentially a go-to directory for musicians offering online lessons in this time. I think this is a great way to support local artists in this time and perhaps build a relationship with someone who could offer lessons after this is all said and done in person to you or a child!  And it's virus free, ha ha!  I'm not promoting my own business here, just to be clear.  Just to trying to help local artists and local families.  Sorry if it comes across tat way.  

here's the original message from the founder of this list..  Link's at bottom!

Due to the coronavirus, many musicians have lost a significant amount of work over the past week. Many are world class players that happened to get unlucky. This also means that there's a lot of musical talent that is going to waste.

And maybe you're stuck working from home, and have a little more time on your hands than you expected. Or maybe schools are closed where you are, and your kid needs something to do. Or maybe you're in college, have been sent home for the rest of the semester, and you're bored at home.

I had the thought that this could actually be an opportunity to connect these amazingly talented musicians with people who are stuck at home with nothing to do. What if these musicians could offer online lessons to people who can't go anywhere?

I have created a list of musicians who are currently offering online lessons. This list is being updated in real time. It's a fairly primitive Google doc, but it contains names, instruments, short bios with links, and contact info (you might even recognize some names on the list). If you are interested in music lessons, please give this a try and reach out to someone on the list. You would be doing the greater music community a lot of good, and you'll get to learn music from someone cool. And please pass this list on to anyone who might be interested, anywhere in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

To slow the spread of [\#COVID19](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covid19?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG), I'm ordering:  
•Closure of ALL pre-K, K-12 schools, colleges, and universities beginning 3/18  
•Closure of ALL casinos, racetracks, theaters, gyms  
•Closure of ALL non-essential retail, recreational, &amp; entertainment businesses after 8:00 PM  
•Banning gatherings of 50+  


All bars and restaurants are closed for eat-in services effective 8:00 PM tonight. After 8:00 PM, these establishments may open for takeout and delivery services ONLY, until further notice. These restrictions exist during daytime hours.  


All pre-K through grade 12 schools (public, private, and parochial) and all colleges and universities will close effective Wednesday, March 18th until it’s deemed by health officials to be safe for in-person classes to resume.  


We’ve worked closely to ensure that the overall educational and individual needs of students can be met during this closure, including appropriate home instruction and continued access to free and reduced meals.  


Starting tonight, all non-essential and non-emergency travel in New Jersey is strongly discouraged between the hours of 8:00 PM AND 5:00 AM. This will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. We want everyone to be home – and not out.  


Essential businesses which are necessary for the public’s health, safety, and welfare – like supermarkets and grocery stores, pharmacies, medical offices, and gas stations – may remain open past 8:00 PM.  


Effective 8:00 PM tonight, all movie theaters, gyms, casinos, and racetracks will close entirely until it is deemed safe for their reopening. Online gaming will continue.  


Effective tonight, all other non-essential retail, recreational, and entertainment businesses MUST CLOSE after 8:00 PM. During daytime hours, these businesses may remain open if they limit their occupancy to no more than 50 persons and adhere to social distancing guidelines.  


All gatherings of over 50 individuals are CANCELED effective 8:00 PM tonight.  


We do not take any of the steps we’ve announced today lightly. We know that these will impact residents and families, communities, and businesses. But our paramount concern is to [\#FlattenTheCurve](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/flattenthecurve?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG) – these steps will ensure we do not overload our health care system.",newjersey,NJ Coronavirus Update from the Office of Phil Murphy

I've tried to cut out most of the legal-ese. I've bolded some parts that address common questions I've seen.

1. While gatherings are **limited 50 people or fewer**, this **does not apply to normal operations of transit, offices, medical facilities, factories, construction, or retail**.
2. **All K-12 schools are closed** to students beginning 3/18. Not just public schools. All schools.
3. Higher Ed will cease in-person instruction beginning 3/18.
4. Schools may open on a temporary basis for non-educational services such as food or child care in emergency situations if approved by the Department of Health.
5. The Department of Education will work with schools to establish home instruction.
6. The Department of Agriculture will work with the DoE to ensure students eligible for free or reduced cost meals are supported.
7. Beginning at 8:00 PM on Monday 3/16, **the following establishments are closed: all types of gambling facilities (online operations may remain open), gyms and fitness centers, entertainment centers** (movies, performing arts, clubs, etc).
8. Other non-essential retail, recreational, and entertainment businesses must not operate between 8:00 PM - 5:00 AM. When they are open, occupancy is limited to 50, and social distancing behavior must be observed. **Essential businesses include grocery/food stores, pharmacies, medical supply stores, gas stations,
and healthcare facilities.**
9. **All restaurants, bars, dining establishments, and food courts may open during their normal business hours, but are limited to carry-out and delivery**. Liquor may be served only in sealed, original containers. This also applies to breweries, wineries, distilleries, and meaderies. The EO doesn't mention this, but apparently [establishments will be provided a waiver for carry-out alcohol.](https://faq.business.nj.gov/en/articles/3799035-how-do-new-rules-on-closures-and-social-distancing-affect-my-business) I'm not sure exactly what that means.

Sections 10-11 allow the state to make changes to traffic flow. Section 12 restricts any localities from passing anything that would interfere with these restrictions. 

Section 13 says every person in the state has a duty to cooperate with these rules.

Section 14 essentially states that **failure to cooperate with these rules may be considered a disorderly persons offense**. This should answer what happens if a store decides not to close.",newjersey,The text of the actual executive order answers a lot of questions that are floating around. Here are some highlights.

Upon reading and watching what Murphy said... I can't blame them.  He never said ""If you stay open, we will arrest/fine you"".  Instead it seems like it's a suggestion.  So, what is it?  Is it a suggestion?  Or is it against the law to stay open past 8?

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to the following shows will be getting a refund.

MA - Boston

MI - Westland

NH - Manchester

NJ - Atlantic City, Point Pleasant

NY - Albany, NYC, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Syracuse, White Plains

PA - Philly

QC - Montreal

RI - East Greenwich

VT - Burlington

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Poughkeepsie, Manchester NH, and Cleveland have already been rescheduled for October). Meanwhile, I will be hosting free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.).

If you wanna watch, they're free at [YouTube.com/thehofstetter](https://YouTube.com/thehofstetter) every day at 2PM and 8PM ET. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see.

I don't mean to start my day with such negativity but I am now frustrated with this issue and need to speak up.

I have noticed that many modified cars and trucks have their lights projecting well above the height of my entire car. This should be illegal if it is not but to the people driving these types of cars. Wtf do you think happens to the people in front of you? Like seriously why do you need so much light as your low beams? 

Today I had a chevy truck that had it's high beam or low beams on but god it felt like some crazy light entering my eyes at 5 in the morning. I usually ignore this but just to let them know how it feels, I went behind them turned on my high beams, what they did next was hilarious. They brake checked me and came behind me and turned their light bar on. You notice how they didn't turn their high beams on? Yeh because their fucking highs were on already. 

So if your high beams are on and some behind you trys to indicate that don't get fucking pissed just look at your dashboard. 

And for godsake just get your lights fixed if they are not leveled properly. If you don't know that you lights are bad there is a quick way to check. When you are drive behind someone just see if you headlights are projecting on both the sideview mirrors or not. If they are constantly projecting there then you need to fix your lights as they are causing the other person to go blind.

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now. 

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

As a tax positive state (we as a state pay more than we receive in federal funding) we should begin withholding a percentage of federal withholdings from NJ workers to divert back into the state to respond to this crisis.

Yes, our state government in NJ is rife with grift and leakage, but at least they responded when it became increasingly clear that the federal response wasn’t coming. Murphy was not a well liked governor prior to this event in many circles, but he has saved probably thousands of lives of New Jerseyans. 

This is beyond anyone’s political leanings at this point. This is not ‘just the flu.’ It’s not going to ‘clear up when the weather gets warm.’ Until there is a vaccine which is in an absolute best case scenario a year away, this virus will continue to be a threat.

I have a summer contract with a company in New Providence, and I'm looking at my options for a place to stay. I'm hoping someone here can help me narrow down my options. I don't need a direct reference to an apartment or sublet, I'm just looking for the best general area or neighborhood for me in the area because it's kind of difficult to assess the best areas to live in as an outsider. 

Ideally, I'd like to live somewhere where I don't need a car for things like going out to eat, buying groceries, or finding entertainment. I'm not from New England, and I hear a lot about crime in the area, so I want to stay somewhere that is relatively safe. My budget is 1,000 per month. I won't have a car, so I will need to be close to New Providence (max. 30 minutes via public transit.

Please let me know if you have any recommendations.

Thank you r/NewJersey!",newjersey,"Questions about living/working in New Providence, NJ short term."

Vernon Township Mayor’s Updated Statement on the Coronavirus

Posted: March 18, 2020

During each of my communications concerning this Coronavirus crisis that our municipality, our county, our state, our nation and the world is currently enduring, I have committed to you that I would keep you informed—it’s my way of fulfilling my responsibility to do all that I can to the residents of Vernon safe.

It is with regret that in this communication I must inform you that for the first time in Sussex County, two individuals have been confirmed to have the Coronavirus. And, one of those individuals is a Vernon Township resident.

This information came to me today at about 3:15 p.m. from the Sussex County Health Department. For understandable privacy health reasons, the information that I was given was limited. What I know is that the individual is a 53-year-old male who has been self-quarantined for the past seven days, and he remains self-quarantined. He started this self-quarantining process after he was exposed to another individual at his job (outside of the county) who had been confirmed as having the virus. The county obtained the results of his Coronavirus test from his health care provider.

Our town government does not have, nor do we seek, any contact or other information concerning this individual; all contact and/or information concerning this or any other Coronavirus case will be through the Sussex County Health Department.

At this point in time, you know all that I know. Let’s continue safe practices and to look out for each other; I will continue to keep you appropriately informed.

They are also suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic... the wildlife rehabilitation hospital at Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge cares for over 5,000 animals every year and receives NO government funding. With their nature center closing indefinitely, education and large fundraising events canceled, they’re in trouble.

The people that run this organization are incredible - I know the director and assistant director of the wildlife hospital very well. The hospital staff is primarily volunteers who are no longer able to safely staff the hospital (during “baby season”, which begins in April, the hospital operates with three, 4 hour shifts each day, 7 days a week, with at least 8 different volunteers/interns each shift).

On behalf of the current patients, all the wildlife of NJ and the volunteers that love this organization, please consider donating! Check out the work they do via their instagram page @cedarrunwildlife

To donate you can text “cedarrun” to 44321 or visit [their website](https://www.cedarrun.org/get-involved/give/donate/) 

If you are local, consider [purchasing a membership](https://www.cedarrun.org/get-involved/membership/)

If you are local and cannot donate, please consider visiting Cedar Run! There are trails to hike and an outdoor enclosure area with resident wildlife! I (and the animals) would really appreciate your help!!",newjersey,The Wildlife of New Jersey Need Our Help!

The only really notable changes were one guy shopping in rubber gloves and the coffee dispensers were turned around to be operated by the staff. Pretty sure the shelves still had bread on them.

I know they know their neighbors, so idk if they just can't trust them with their money or not.

It sucks because we have family that could take care of them, but that would require them to travel and that would be a huge risk. Fuck. Is Meals on Wheels going to keep delivering to them?

From an ER doctor in NYC. The situation will be similar in NJ soon enough. 

1) The ED (emergency department) is now separated into two areas: one for traditional emergencies and what has been dubbed, “The COVID pit.”

2) A vast majority of folks in the COVID pit aren’t sick enough for any intervention and because of that fact, they cannot test them for COVID unless they are being admitted for breathing difficulties.

3) Those “worried-well” folk jamming up the ED all have to get seen by law. So they (doctors/nurses) have to change into new clean protective-wear to talk to them. They (doctors) wind up giving them Tylenol (which costs the patient like $300) and sending them home. Now, they’ve just wasted a set of clean protective-wear. The reason we’re in such a dire shortage of protective equipment for hospital staff is because these worried people come and need to be seen.

I applaud them for staying open, and their efforts in keeping the stores as clean and sanitary as possible- in order to accommodate the thousands of daily customers trying to survive during a time like this where it's risky to be in public at all.

However- I am horrified at their treatment of their own employees.  At the very minimum- grocery stores should be FORCED to provide **masks** as well as **gloves** to their staff, particularly their cashiers.  Cashiers seem to be cast aside here and forgotten about during this pandemic, meanwhile they are absolutely the most at-risk to contract and spread the disease.  They come in contact with every single person that shops at the store, yet no one seems to be acknowledging their safety aside from perhaps supplying them with a pair of latex gloves here and there.  

Mask shortage or not- and especially given the crazy amount of money they have been raking in due to people panic buying- if grocery stores want to remain open they should be obligated to outfit their cashiers with adequate protection from this virus.  This is for their safety, their families safety, and the general public's.  

Please contact your local grocery store and demand that they supply their cashiers with masks, gloves and sanitizers.  Do it for us all.  Thank you.",newjersey,Grocery Stores

•	You can participate in conference calls in your bed with a mug of coffee balanced on your knee. Just make sure the dog, or your significant other, isn’t snoring next to you.
•	Mute before you pee. And before you flush. You really don’t know your work buddy that well. 
•	Tell your boss that you are using a docking station and a monitor for your laptop. That’s why you’re not using your camera. 
•	MS Teams has a very good mobile app. If you plug in earbuds, nobody can tell that you’re in your car. Bluetooth gives you away every time. 
•	If you must video conference, be aware of what’s behind you. Nobody wants to see your collection of empty Tito’s bottles on the kitchen counter. 
•	Video conferences are pants optional. A nice business casual shirt and a hair combing is all that’s required. 
•	Additionally, make sure there isn’t a mirror on the wall behind you. Your flabby, hairy ass reflected in the mirror will ruin the pants optional rule above. 
•	Finally, establish the “I’m on a call” signal as soon as possible. Think of the “I’ve got a visitor” rules you used in college. A hat on the doorknob, a specific lamp turned on or off, even a note taped on the door that says “Call in Progress” removes the embarrassment of your significant other coming home in the middle of your presentation and loudly declaring that the people at the supermarket are “fucking retarded assholes.”*

Please be mindful of these rules. Those of us who have been working this scam for years don’t want you lifetime cubicle dwellers to screw this up.

3767,corporat,1584990711,fnpwaj,Nan,"I was horrified to learn that both of my closest food pantries had actually *closed indefinitely* this month.

Why's that a big deal? In recent years, [suburban food assistance programs have seen the highest increases in need over the last decade](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/01/more-americans-are-going-hungry-in-the-suburbs/426786/), and mass layoffs and financial turmoil will *crush our communities* without vital food assistance programs.

You might be fearing your personal financial future, which is valid. But if these programs fold, you will have fewer local food assistance resources if you get laid off this summer. What's more, even if you aren't personally at risk of a layoff, we will enjoy higher community stability if these food programs can stay solvent through June.

That's why now is a critical time to donate, and it is in everyone's best interest if you make even a small donation (though keep in mind small credit transactions cost them a lot more in fees). See if you can cut a luxury expense and put it toward supporting your local food bank.

I was able to find Center For Food Action, which is my closest food pantry with a plan to operate through this crisis, (my understanding is that they will be doing drive thru food assistance starting Wednesday). I don't know all of the NJ pantries/food banks but if you know one that's local and still operating, link it here.

Please contribute to your nearest food bank, follow their contribution guidelines (I think all of them prefer financial contributions), and only if you are currently job secure or otherwise income secure.

I understand the importance of social distancing but ffs, we're hardly close at all to other people, and it's not even a super busy court. No need to over-restrict things. I think sometime last week or within a week ago, is when we checked that court and it was locked

Thanks for any suggestions! I think all of them in Ocean county are closed but I figured I'd see if I could find anyone that knows of one that isn't",newjersey,Looking for open tennis courts in central Ocean County

As most of us know some states, including NJ currently have essential businesses operating and a lot of people have been laid off (most temporary), due to COVID19.  

My girlfriend is one of them, she left her previous job and had just started working at her new job 2 weeks ago.  She logged ONLY 12 HOURS of labor, and then her new place of employment was told to shut down due to the virus.

She is now worried that she will be unable to claim unemployment due to her only logging 12 hours of work at her new job, and not being employed at her previous job (being in transition between jobs during this time).  She is also worried that if she is granted the unemployment benefit, she will receive little to NO compensation.

Venting more than anything. I work for a company that operates outdoors, and through the vagueness of the executive order have deemed themselves “essential”. I work on the sales end of this company. 

Because of this, we are open for business, and as a result of an employee doesn’t feel safe coming to work the official policy is “you’re free to do that, and your job will be safe but we are not going to pay you”. And because work is “available” the employee is not eligible for unemployment benefits. 

We have multiple offices in our area, and we’ve even had an employee at another office test positive, and that operation is still running full time. 

I feel like the whole thing is fucked, and I wish the government would step in and be more specific about who should close so we can shut down while all this shit is getting sorted.

The reason why I ask, is because the vaccine is still a year away. We as a country (and a state) cannot keep people at home for that long. We eventually need to come up with creative ways to go back to ""normal"". Which will be a NEW normal to keep people healthy. Here are some ideas I have:

&amp;#x200B;

* Opening up restaurants/bars to sit at again. Have a capacity limit and have tables/seating distance from each other.
* Keep schools closed, no concerts, or any extremely large gathering that takes place in a confined space (especially if it is indoors)
* Consider opening up the boardwalk by Memorial Day. Even though we are still studying this specific strain, typically viruses have a difficult time spreading in a outdoor setting, especially with humidity. The coronavirus family is known for causing the common cold. There is a reasoning why we don't see the common cold frequently in the summer, or any sort of virus spread. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is just a few ideas. I want to be as safe as possible when coming to battling this virus, but at the same time we cannot sit here in our homes for a year waiting for a vaccine to save the day.

3927,smokemonkey97,1585155155,fotoh7,Advice,"As the title mentions, please, just fucking stay inside unless you have good reason to be outside.

I live in Mercer county. I'm constantly seeing people jogging, walking dogs, with kids playing in the town center, hanging with groups in parks, and even when I went to visit a friend near the beach, the boardwalks were packed with people tanning, running, playing with dogs, even surfing and swimming.

Here's what you most likely understand:  
-I am currently healthy  
-I wash my hands  
-I don't feel sick  
-I'm not in a big group nor hanging with big groups  

But that's all you hear. The truth is it doesn't matter if you're healthy and not feeling symptoms. You can still end carrying the virus and spreading to someone like me(asthmatic), my fiancée(immunity disorder and anemic), my older parents who I still very much need around and who work for the state/local construction, or someone like my sister who's raising 4 kids all on her own and is close to being homeless.

The last thing we or any of us in this state is to get hit with a virus considered a global pandemic because you wanted to jog with your little spit spewing mouth breathers on the Asbury Park boardwalk.

Stay inside. Stay local. There's nothing to do and nowhere to go. That's not a vacation. It's about survival now. Just stay fuckiny home. It's literally the equivalent of being told ""Sit there and do nothing,"" yet so many NJ residents even failt at doing that. 


So one last time, for the people trying to live there lives again by the time the summer hits, ***stay the fuck inside.***",newjersey,"Fellow NJ residents, please stay the fuck inside."

3989,Genericbuild,1585227782,fpb4hg,WTF,"So I work at a company in south jersey called rental country. I won’t say which specific one of their locations for obvious reasons. My employer insists that they are an essential business but I don’t really see how they are. Maybe I’m missing something or maybe the list is so vague that pretty much anyone who has a store front at this point in time can decide their essential. But I really don’t see how they could be. 95% of customers who have been coming in are the ones who are out of work and supposed to be practicing stay at home self isolation and social distancing, are coming in in their own words, I’m bored I mine as well go out get my lawn mower fixed, rent a rototiller and get some yard work done.

This seems like horse shit to me, there supposed to be home not out tooling around killing time and living every day like it’s their Saturday off from work. The company I made made a half assed attempt to put up a sign for social distancing but no one listens or even reads they just walk right past the 6 foot line and right up in your face. We have barely any type of sanitizing items due to them being in such high demand and not being able to get them, it also seems like they couldn’t care less about trying either. 

And then the owner of the company made a vague statement of well if you don’t feel safe then you can voluntarily lay off and try to collect unemployment. But he will not give that information in writing nor can from the managers or owners give me any sort of straight answer it’s just misdirection. No where in the unemployment pages for the Coronavirus lay offs and closures did I see anywhere where employees can choose to stay home and collect, they can only use sick time to stay home. 

This all feels screwed up to me, this company isn’t providing any life saving medical service, nor does it offer food and water, it’s just some run of the mill little equipment rental company that also repairs lawn mowers. I wouldn’t be bothered if I had willing taken a job that provides a real essential service and was doing good for my community, but this place doesn’t feel that way at all, I just feel like I’m stuck into staying regardless of if I feel safe (and I kind of don’t because they aren’t really practicing any sort of safe sanitizing habit, nor are they even offering the employees any sort of personal protection equipment) because I’m afraid if I take this “voluntary lay off, one I don’t have a chance of getting any sort of income from it, and 2 maybe not even have a job to go back too after it’s all said in done.

Any time spent outside has been spent going to the store for emergencies. Thankfully when things hit the fan my family and I were able to grab everything we needed to last us a few weeks.

1) safety 

2) commute to Elizabeth with car at most 20 minutes, 25 minutes is a stretch 

3) commute to Manhattan with public transport less than 1 hour

4) 2 bed apartment (preferably 2 bath)

5) Having two parking spaces

6) beautiful, walkable neighborhood with some stores, not somewhere that need 10 minutes driving in a highway to get to somewhere walkable

&amp;#x200B;

I've found that: 

\- Elizabeth, Linden, Union, Hillside, Irvington are not a good place to live (saftey-wise or have mixed neighborhood which I really don't like)

\- Maplewood is good but expensive and far 

\- Rosellepark is good but I couldn't find any good apartment there 

\- Springfield is good, but the apartments there are very few apartments in the southern border which are also pretty expensive 

\- Summit is good but far 

\- Cranford has flood risk 

\- Union has mixed neighborhood 

\- Newark is not safe and parking space is limited

\- Any place norther than NewArk has parking issue and would be far from Elizabeth 

&amp;#x200B;

The best place that I've found so far is Rahway downtown which is like 15 minutes to Elizabeth and around 1 hour to Manhattan. Is there anywhere else that you guys would  recommend that I'm missing?

While there have been a few instances of group gatherings that were addressed by law enforcement, the vast majority of the community understands the importance of social distancing and are complying with the executive order.

Law enforcement in our State have worked tirelessly to build relationships with our communities, and we will not let the actions of a few determine how a city is viewed.

They act like us serving them coffee is a downside to their day and wonder why all this is even necessary. Even had an older gentleman lean close to me and laugh/cough and say enjoy coronavirus. Wawa and stores like it should be specifically for truly essential employees and essential food trips. People should be asked for their IDs or letters deeming them essential, and milkshakes and specialty drinks should not be sold. I have a young baby at home I'm trying to keep healthy and my wife and I are both essential workers (both my jobs are essential, and my wife is in healthcare). I havent seen my parents in over a month and we wont be able to see my wife's parents for a while because we actually follow guidelines to keep our parents safe who have had health issues that make them immunocompromised. And people come in and ignore all sorts of guidelines to keep distance from each other. The coffee is self serve for a reason. Dont lean over the counter and get closer to the coffee and to me. Just ask to see the cup.

Brave he went, into the night. He spoke of fear of the unknown and humbly said he with fear in his voice 

“Life guarantees us nothing but death. Make the in between worthwhile my sons.” 

A preacher of love, he wept from joy, he angered when he saw others suffer. 

The man was just a man but a man above men this man was.  
He taught his sons lessons from his failures. He spoke of redemption and forgiveness when the clock ticked close to his final hour. He spoke of a vision, a light, a complete understanding.

Showered with praise, forgiveness came. Sins he had, mistakes he may have made, but the love he gave, always outweighed. 

My last words to him were the last he heard. 

“As a father, I could ask for none better. As a mentor, I could ask for nothing more. As a man, you are unlike any other. Regret nothing when you go, as the right you’ve done outweighs the wrong. You leave behind a legacy greater than you will ever know. You’re my hero. I love you.”

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

I work for a company that manufactures $4,000 treadmills.  We have been denied the ability to work from home because the systems are too old...yet 4 people in the company have access to the VPN and are able to work from home before this happened.  They have not reduced a single employee from the site.  They have told us that since Murphy allowed manufacturing, that we are safe.  We are NOT SAFE.  I work 3 feet from 10 other people in a small office.  One works in a grocery store part time in addition to the day job.

They may not block airborne transmission, but they do cut down on droplets containing virus particles, and everyone spits a bit when they talk. Plus, it's allergy season now, and if you can block allergens, you can keep people who are silent carriers from sneezing.

This means that if everyone wore masks in public, transmission would go down by about half, if not 3/4. Everyone should be encouraged to wear a mask when out in public -- if everyone did, even if they went outside, we could lift social distancing measures earlier and avoid Italian or Chinese-style lockdowns.

Spread the word. Chalk it on the sidewalks. Write it on your windows. Repeat on other subreddits. Hashtag on social media. #masks4all. Not just for healthcare employees and first responders -- if everyone wears a mask, then we're protecting them from transmission as well!

Apparently, the retail price for 100 MB/sec internet is now $89.95!  This is completely outrageous.  The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that internet services are not a luxury but a lifeline.

I realize that there are some FCC impediments that could make price regulation by the state difficult, but I say that the state needs to do whatever it can to force the prices downward.  Basic $100 MB/sec internet should cost around $20-$25 to make it more affordable.

&gt;You may be eligible for a Paycheck Protection Program loan under the new federal legislation designed to provide small businesses quick access to capital for payroll and other overhead costs.

&gt;Here’s what you need to know about the program, which was created as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This is based on the latest information from Chase and the Small Business Administration (SBA). Other eligibility requirements may apply.
•	The Payment Protection Plan loan will be generally available to companies with 500 employees or less, individuals who operate under a sole proprietorship as well as 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organizations, 501 (c)(19) veterans organizations, and some Tribal business concerns.
•	It expands eligibility under the SBA 7a program to help businesses cover costs related to payroll (including healthcare related costs), rent, mortgage interest, interest on existing debt and utility payments.
•	You can apply for this only online. It’s not available by phone or in the branch.
•	You must have a Chase business checking account as of February 15, 2020.
•	You must confirm that your business needs financial relief because it was impacted by Coronavirus events.
•	It will require no collateral or personal guarantees.
•	Generally the loan amount will be based on 2.5 times your average monthly payroll costs.
•	You may be eligible to have all or a portion of the loan principal forgiven based on SBA rules.
•	You won’t have to make payments on the loan for at least six months.
•	The interest rate will be no more than 4% and likely no longer than 10 years. The terms may change during the application process.
We expect the SBA to provide additional details soon, and we’ll update our Chase for Business COVID-19 Program page with the latest information.
How to prepare
We encourage you to be prepared so that you have what you need when we open our website for applications. Have the following information:
•	The date you started your business
•	Detailed information in order to calculate the average monthly payroll costs for your employees for the past 12 months, as outlined by the SBA
•	Your annual revenue
•	Your business mailing address
How to earn loan forgiveness
You may be eligible to have all or a portion the loan principal forgiven if you use the funds for certain qualifying costs incurred and payments made for payroll, mortgage interest, rent and utilities during the first eight weeks following the date the loan is made. You will have to provide documentation.
In general, we are experiencing extremely high call volumes. So, we urge you to sign in to Chase Business Online or the Chase Mobile® app for your ongoing account management.

So he terminated about half of his staff. Stephan had his HR Director call these employees at home after working hours to tell them that they were terminated. She also told each of them to feel free to file unemployment. Each of these employees have children and/or sick family members. This CEO terminated these people two days before the Families First Coronavirus Response Act effective date of April 1, 2020 (or April 2, depending on which site you read). So, Stephan decided to terminate people before he had to pay them for 80 hours of sick leave and 10 weeks of Family Medical Leave and have to keep them on the health insurance. Most of these people were the health care insurance providers for their families. Issa Stephan, by the way, has been working from home for most of this crisis, and has been requiring his employees to use PTO or Vacation time for child care issues or to care for ill family members, and not allowing them to use their NJ sick leave time. 

None of what he did is illegal, but it it just awful. This man is everything that is wrong with the American businessman.

I work for a company that does inventory for car dealers. I’m one of the guys who spends their days taking pictures of cars and putting them online. Apparently since we are “essential to dealer operations” we are essential workers. I think not. This is some incredible gray area bullshit.

Am I eligible for unemployment insurance? It seems to me that i am from the chart floating around. But at the same time, theres two or three charts or tables floating around NJ.gov sites that tell me I'm eligible for TDI, not unemployment.

I checked the unemployment website FAQs and they seem like they apply to me, but there is no clear cut yes or no. My employer is not giving us any extra paid time off, just allowing us to take unpaid leave. They arent laying off or furloughing.

So I have my same job waiting at my company when the doctor says I'm ok to go back to work; however I dont have the ability to work under medical orders for the next two weeks. I feel like I would be eligible.

Is this something I should bring up with HR, or is the topic of possibly claiming unemployment when they are trying to stick us in this unpaid leave but not let go limbo a bad one to approach?

I'm heading to the doctors and just wanted to know if I have a hard few weeks (no benefits), middling few weeks (TDI) or non stressful few weeks (full unemployment benefits) coming up.

Thank you for the help. I am not showing any outward symptoms, but in the last few days I have almost 100% lost my sense of taste. I almost wanted to believe it was all in my head, but it's really felt like I've been chewing cardboard and drinking plain water for every meal now. I read this was an uncommon indicator of asymptomatic carriers and dont want to expose anyone, so if my doctor agrees I should stay home, I would like to know to what extent I'm protected.

4537,Wetdreamie,1585758069,ft2vl1,Coronavirus,i have a couple of confirmed cases in my family we are a close family  and have been feeling tired at my training course. (very physically demanding). i stoped showing up once one of the confirmed cases reached my own house and not only at my uncles. i knew something was off about my body for a couple of days. slight fever and very fatigue was most of it. i told my instructor and he gave me 2 weeks off and i won't lose credit. i'm still showing barely any symptoms while my aunt is coughing her brains out and developed a sinus infection. i'm avoiding getting close but my main question is how can i get tested to see if i maybe don't have it (anymore) to go back to class if i barely show (ed) symptoms. i also don't have insurance,newjersey,is there anyway i can get tested with barely to no symptoms for the virus?

One person working in the Woodbridge area, the other will soon be starting in Mt Holly so it makes to have a central location with the further commute being a reverse commute. We like these locations because of easy turnpike access, safety, and reputed family friendly atmospheres. 

Of course we don’t know what it’s like to actually live there any input is much appreciated.

For some background, we’ll be buying a house and budget is not a concern, both locations have plenty of suitable homes within budget for us. However, we are slightly concerned about taxes, especially future tax increases. As it stands now, both are fairly similar in terms of taxes.

Manalapan is in Mounmouth Co which seems less likely to have future tax increases as its more conservative leaning and generally wealthier. Cranbury is in Middlesex Co, which is the opposite. However, I do know a lot of the tax base in Cranbury itself comes from warehouses so it’s a bit complex.

My situation is unique enough that I'm just not sure what to do and could use a little advice. 

I have 2 jobs- one full time job and a part time bartending job on nights and weekends. My regular job is paying us to WFH, but my 2nd job has been shuttered for now. 

Should I or would I be eligible for unemployment in this scenario? My rationale for this is, I wouldn't have a second job if I wasn't in need of the money, and I've paid into unemployment with my taxes. Although my regular income is still there for the time being (fingers crossed it stays that way), the lack of extra funds coming in from my 2nd job is already hitting me. 

I just don't really know what to do. Is it a good idea to just apply and see what happens or not waste my time? Has anyone else in the industry with a full time job applied and received anything yet?

4577,practicalaccountant4,1585776080,ft8xup,Nan,"Hi all,

One of my roommates (we’ll refer to her as X), left out of state at the beginning of March without telling anyone. I have two roommates currently, so myself and the other roommate (roommate Y) paid our portion of the rent, however, my landlord never received X’s part of the rent. X CCed us in an email with the landlord saying she would pay her part of the rent by Monday. Monday rolls around, she still hasn’t paid and texted us that she plans to move out in May. So I don’t think she’s going to pay for March or April and screw us all over.

Yesterday, Y tells me she has decided to move because of COVID and has said right now she plans to leave on May 1st. I saw her packing up her room, and I think she’s probably going to just sneak out sometime this week and is lying to me.

This is extremely stressful because I’m currently furloughed and on unemployment. I cannot cover the rent for both of my roommates for the month of April and X’s part of the rent for the month of March.

We are all on the lease together. I expect that consequences will arise for all of us after this blows over, but in the mean time I can’t be homeless. I read that Governor Murphy put a temporary restriction on evicting tenants. Does that mean I can’t be evicted for the next 60 days for not paying rent? Would the existing nonpayment for partial rent in March impact that?

2) I order stuff online. A lot of non fresh stuff is easy to get. Amazon and all the big places will sell you that stuff and ship it ground.

3) Delivery from the local supermarket. It takes like a week to ten days, so I plan accordingly. This is safer for me, safer for the employees since less people will be wandering about.

4) Ive cut back on how much I eat. I sfarted back up on multivitamins. The majority of what I drink is water. I eat enough not to be hungry, not enough to be super full

In fact, if I ran a grocery store, Id switch all operations to pickup and delivery. That way employees wouldn't be exposed to strangers. That way the general population aren't infecting everyone. Don't have internet? We'd create premade packages of staples you can pick up.

I received a job offer in northern NJ a few days ago and im starting to search for apartments. Im strongly considering Newark given its proximity to where I'd work, ease of access to NYC, and the fact that it seems to offer a big city feel and something of a nightlife.

Ive only just started researching and feel like the best thing to do would be to ask a local. I know exactly 0 people in the Newark area, so reddit is the next best thing.

From the little Ive read so far, everything generally seems either very expensive or very ghetto. Is there no reasonable middle ground? 

My housing/neighborhood considerations, in order, are:

1) Affordability- Ideally Id be paying 800 or less (with roommates, of course). Anything over 1000 would be uncomfortable and 1200 is probably my limit.

2) Convenient location- Somewhere where parking isnt a massive pain in the ass. Also, anything walking distance to Penn station is outside my price range, so the location would have to be walking distance from a bus route that goes directly to Penn station.

3) General neighborhood safety- As long as it isnt overtly dangerous, I wouldnt mind living somewhere a bit sketchy.

As far as amenities/general ""niceness"" of the apartment, as long as it has the basics i.e. my own sink and toilet (I wouldnt really mind sharing a shower), theyre not important.

Has anyone got any pointers for any locations/neighborhoods which fit the above? From what Ive read within the past day, south ironbound and possibly central district might fit. 
Any rental websites you would recommend? Am I way off base in price range even with roommates and outside the north ironbound/downtown area?

Also, **if anyone happens to live somewhere which mostly fits my criteria and is looking for a roommate**, please hit me up (Id likely be moving-in some time in June).

I'm not sure if anyone else has any experience with something like this be it themselves or someone they know but my Fiance is a Private Daycare teacher in NJ. They were closed as of April 1st, per the Governor's guidance, but the owner of the school applied to host the kids of Employees deemed Essential.

My Fiance and many of her co-workers were told that if they did not want go into work after the school was approved to host the kids of essential workers that they could collect unemployment until this crisis passes. This was told to her on Tuesday, and as such she was home on Wednesday (april 1st) and proceeded to claim unemployment. 

Today, (Thursday, April 2nd) she was informed by the owner that the employees had to come back in as they were approved and will be receiving an influx of kids from essential workers. 

My question is, does my fiance have to go back in to work and potentially be exposed? She does have asthma but is otherwise in good health. What would happen to her unemployment claim as well? It sounds to me that the owner didn't think they would be approved to host emergency kids, told her staff that they can collect unemployment or stay and then was blindsided by no one wanting to continue to work during all this. 

I apologize if anything was not clear above, I can clarify more if needed. I wanted to keep some anonymity for the school and my fiance.

I am leaning no, because at least when I go food shopping I can take my own precautionary measures. Wear a homemade mask, take my shoes and coat off outside, leave the groceries in the garage for as long as possible, jump right in the shower, etc. With takeout, there is much more uncertainty, but also probably less risk to order food once, than to go to the grocery store once, right?

Dear Trader Joe’s​, 

In light of the recent information regarding COVID-19 at store #615, I am  writing this letter to state my frustrations with the company and how it has  absolutely failed to handle this matter in a moral and effective manner. As a  preface to my grievances, you should know that I am not the only one who  shares this opinion, and that my frustrations are strictly with the company and  not the management team at the store.  

Let us start by understanding the severity of the situation. The global  pandemic known as COVID-19 or the Coronavirus, has been an  unprecedented and deadly phenomenon that has hit the world like an arrow--  quickly, silently, and without warning. None of us knew this would happen  when we signed up to work at Trader Joe’s, and obviously the company could  not have predicted this either.  

That being said, when this started, I felt as though we were all in this together.  However, as events have unfolded, there have been a number of  inconsistencies in the company's actions, and a lack of clear communication to  crew members has caused me to suspect that our friendly neighborhood  Trader Joe’s doesn’t actually have our best interest at heart. A certain amount  of confusion is expected at a time like this but only to a point, and that point  has long since past for me.  An article from ​Buzzfeed​ released on 4/1 details several of the company's  blunders, both public and internal, but allow me to give you some personal  accounts of this. The first thing that raised an eyebrow was the bonus they  gave out to the employees. Why would I be upset about a bonus? Well I’m not.  Something is always better than nothing, but the frustration comes in when we  examine the ‘why’ of the situation. This bonus was the company's answer to  employees clamoring for hazard pay.  

The bonus was two dollars extra an hour for a period of almost one month.  After tax, the bonus amounts to very little even if you work five days a week. I  can’t understand how the company could think that a gesture that small would  be sufficient for anyone. The pandemic, and the fallout it creates, is ongoing.  We are still putting ourselves in harm's way as essential employees, both  management and crew alike. Almost one month of a two dollar raise does not  begin to quell the anxiety and stress we’re all feeling on a day to day basis,  especially when it is presented as a substitute for something that might  actually help people. 

The next example is smaller but illustrates the poor communication we are  constantly subjected to. The company offered to buy the employees lunch up  to $5.00 as a way of extending gratitude, I'm sure, but also because at this  time we are not doing ‘tastings,’ a regular practice at Trader Joe’s stores.  Again, a nice gesture, but it was short lived. I was told the first day by one  manager that this would be ongoing. The next I was told by management that  they were unsure if it was ongoing but they would honor the lunches until they  found out. Hours later I was told that it would not be honored. 

Several of us did not bring lunch as we were expecting to get lunch at work. I  watched some people benefit from this gesture and others be told with a  $5.00 receipt in their hand that they would have to pay. Again, a small  grievance, but this level of inconsistency causes unnecessary stress for  employees. Something as simple as getting a straight answer becomes a hunt  for the manager who has the newest and most accurate information during  what should be 30 minutes of break time.  

Another thing the company did was offer voluntary leave for a two week  period. This allows us to take an unpaid leave of absence without losing our  benefits. Again, we see that they’re trying to appease the needs of the  employees, but this too falls short of being sufficient. For many of us, the  decision to continue to go to work at this time and put ourselves at risk is  largely financial. Because of this, taking a two week unpaid leave is not a  helpful option, and again, the pandemic is ongoing. When your two weeks  expires and this is still going on, you’ll find yourself right back where you  started.  

The biggest and most egregious blow to my morale was felt on 3/31 when it  was made known to the employees that there was a confirmed case of  COVID-19 at our store. This information by itself is startling to say the least, but  the information that followed was even more shocking. We were told that we  would not be closing temporarily, even though there was precedent to do so.  Management explained that according to CDC guidelines, and based on the  fact that the crewmember hadn’t been in the store in seven days, the store did  not have to close.  

In addition to not closing. This information was shared in small groups with  only the employees still working in the building. I'm sure there are still  employees that do not know, and others who found out through hearsay. This  seems especially strange as we all received a blanket notification through our  scheduling app, stating that in the event of someone testing positive that the  company would notify ALL crew members, and that they would let us know  what steps they would be taking to ensure the store is safe for crew and  customers.  

They had the ability to notify us all with the same information, basically at the  same time and they haven't done that. With the information they now have I  can safely say that the company has taken no steps to ensure our safety or  that of the public. They haven’t quarantined the crew members who were  working with the one who is COVID-19 positive. They haven’t shut down to do  a deep clean. Logically speaking, if someone infected is in a population and  the infected person is removed, we have no way of knowing who else of that  population might be infected and not showing signs.  

The only logical thing to do is shut down for a two week period of time with  pay for that store’s employees. All of the cleaning and the social distancing in  the world amounts to exactly nothing if someone else is infected and still  working. Now we are expected to work in a tainted environment, with  employees who might be infected, and customers who are for sure at risk. We  are also not informing the public of our situation; meaning we are needlessly  endangering them. The customers can’t make an informed decision to shop in  our store if they are never informed.  

I’m sure many of them wouldn't be shopping in our store if they knew what we  all do and that is one of the worst feelings. I feel like an accomplice in  deceiving the public for a dollar-- a dollar I apparently don't get very much of  even though I'm at risk every day I am there, and stressed about going in  everyday I’m not. Can you see my frustration? 

I do not think I am being unreasonable. I understand we are all facing a difficult  time. I do not expect Trader Joe’s to wave a magic wand and pay all of us until  this is over, however, their attempts at taking care of employees are an  unsatisfying, piecemeal approach that has left me feeling used and  undervalued. At best, the company’s efforts to keep people safe have been  minimal, and at worst they’re downright negligent, bordering on dangerous. 

I hope you don’t take this letter not as a slap, or a jab, or an attempt to put up  a wall between corporate and crew. I hope you take this for what it is-- a letter  from a concerned and tired crew member that is struggling. Struggling with a  decision to stay at work and face the risk and anxiety that comes with it, or to  stay home and worry about making ends meet. This is the choice we’ve been  given at our store. Closing the store in this situation is the logical thing to do  and it is unquestionably the right thing to do, and if that’s too much to ask then  I was wrong about Trader Joe’s and I will seek employment elsewhere.  

To all the management at Trader Joe’s, try not to take this personally. While I  doubt the company’s inaction, I would never doubt the spirit of friendship,  camaraderie, and unity that we have all worked towards cultivating as a store.  I'm sure others feel the same about their store, and I hope when this is all over  we can come out on the other side stronger as stores, as a company, and as  individuals. It starts with doing the right thing. Thank you. 

  Sincerely,  

Crew Member

4751,WeeklyBottle,1585933502,fuc4px,Nan,"Well, I did. My wife was furloughed from her work and they told her to file for Unemployment.  So we did in that a week after her last day. The claim was showing as pending for a few days, and then yesterday, it showed claim status Filed.  Weekly Benefit Rate: $0 Remaining Balance: $0 Next Payable Week: 03/21/2020 Last Week Paid: Last Paid Amount:  - $0 

So, I started to wonder why, and started digging around the site (as wife had originally filed), and saw that it states that in order to be eligible, you need to make at least $200 a week for 20 weeks in the Base Year Period or earned at least $10k.  So my wife started work in Sept, so she barely missed the 20 week threshold by a couple of weeks. and she did not earn 10k in 2019.  So I figured she didn't qualify,   but continued to read.  I found the [Alternate Base year](https://myunemployment.nj.gov/labor/myunemployment/before/about/who/alternatebaseyears.shtml) calculation link (below) and started to dig in deeper into her pay stubs.  But the Alternate guidance on both ABY1 and ABY2 are only listing period until Dec 2019, and nothing for this year.  I am wondering, if I look at ABY2 and just substitute 2020 for 2019, she would qualify for benefits.  ABY2 states - If the claim date is March 2019 then it states ""your claim is based on employment in Alternate Base Year #2 from: April 1, 2018 to date of claim - Which would mean March 2019 to date of claim, which would give her approximately 28 weeks of making over 200.  

So my questions are -

1. Does anyone have any experience with this? 
2. If I substitute 2020 date for the ABY2 calculation, would she qualify, whenever they determine that updated dates for Q1 2020 filers? 
3. Does the Unemployment office automatically review ABY benefits?  If yes, how long does it take to get an update? If not, does she have to file an Appeal to have that reviewed?
4. Even if her benefit rate is $0, would she still get the $600 ""additional benefit""?

Any info would be greatly appreciated, and thanks for your input, I appreciate it.

4905,Austinpb1,1586107457,fvhgzh,Advice,"Hi all, My gf is trying to figure out how filing for unemployment works. This week her boss for one of her jobs told her to file for unemployment because she is being temporarily laid off. So she went to the [Division of Unemployment Insurance](https://myunemployment.nj.gov/) site and clicked ""New users register here"" and filled out the form on Tuesday (3/31). The next day (4/1) she got an email telling her to file a Claim ant form, which she filled out. She received an email saying her claim is being reviewed and could take up to 14 days and to continue to claim weekly benefits.

First issue: when she goes to the ""If You Already Filed a Claim"" drop down and clicks ""Certify for Weekly Benefits"" and fills out her info, it takes her to a yellow page with black and red text and she acknowledges the statement. On the next page she clicks ""To Claim Weekly Unemployment Benefits Click Here"". After she types her social it says:

&gt;There is no record of a claim under this social security number. If you wish to file a NJ claim click here.

Is this happening because she only filed five days ago? If this page is the same through next week how will she be able to claim her weekly benefits if the page doesn't recognize the social? Her dashboard does say her claim is pending.

2nd issue: She also is an independent contractor and hadn't filed for unemployment for that on 3/31. We think she is able to file for unemployment for this because her coworkers have/will file. We cannot figure out how to add this job to the claim. We tried calling but they aren't taking calls due to volume. We also tried creating a new claim but can't because the social is being used by the claim she filed

Does anyone know what she should do? We both haven't had to file for unemployment before so we have no idea what we are doing. Thank you to anyone who can help us out!

4909,ledjefflin,1586112079,fvit7c,Nan,"Hello, I was laid off a couple weeks ago by my employer. Because of the massive disruption to our industry (aerospace), they cut probably about 50 office workers. Production is still going on as usual, from my understanding. So, the business is open, with a lot of the office workers WFH and production working distanced, and then me and the other 50 or so office personnel who were laid off, are obviously no longer employed by the company, at least for now.
   
When I applied for unemployment last week, it seemed like none of the unemployment scenarios applied to me. The FAQ and options only seem to cover people whose business closed or who couldn’t work bc they are sick with covid-19 etc. Obviously, my business isn’t closed. I was laid off, and it was a direct result of covid-19. 
    
Has anyone else had this problem? It was weird applying because I had to basically give technically wrong info and then, in the open ended spaces where I could, clarify my situation.
Also, I just got my first letter from the DOL and it says I’m required to search for work. Huh? I couldn’t even be a busboy right now if I wanted, nowhere is open. And I thought they were getting rid of that requirement in light of the pandemic? 
     
It’s possible my employer could call me back, but who knows when that would be. Part of the reason they did lay offs, instead of furloughs, I imagine, is because they don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up. Who knows when this will end? The whole industry is going down the tubes. 

TLDR;  I and a bunch of other workers were laid off but my employer is still open for business. NJDOL doesn’t have an option for selecting this as my situation. They also say I need to be looking for work but there is no work, I thought everyone was exempt from that for now.",newjersey,Advice: Laid off but employer still open for business—help with unemployment
4910,sun_spinner,1586112341,fviw18,Nan,"
Hi everyone! I applied for Unemployment on Saturday, March 28th. Very shortly after I submitted my claim I realized I had made a mistake and could not go back to edit it as my claim was being processed. Immediately I had sent an email, stating that I had selected that I am still employed by my employer, and on the question asking reason for separation I had again selected that I’m still employed. Honestly, I was confused because I wasn’t actually fired from my job - we just temporarily closed due to Covid. I’m not working, nor am I getting paid by my employer. So, pretty big mistake on my part. I should’ve selected no, I’m not employed, and that my business closed due to Covid - but alas, I’m an idiot. It’s been over a week since I sent my email and I still haven’t received a response. I‘ve also tried reaching them by phone several times and still haven’t gotten through to anyone. Since it’s now time to claim my weekly benefits, I don’t want to claim any money knowing that my application has errors (it was processed Sunday the 29th and went through). I’m located in Middlesex, so the number I’ve been using to try and reach them has been 7327612020. Can someone confirm that this is the number I should be calling about this? Am I truly just screwed since I messed up the application? Will they even be able to fix this, or should I file a new claim since I haven’t collected any benefits yet? Any help would be very much appreciated, thanks :)

There is an indemnification clause which should give you pause before signing.  While holding harmless the realtor for any infections, etc. and promising not to sue,  (which is fine, we get it), we have to indemnify them against any lawsuits (even ones brought by people who signed the document and decided to sue anyway).   

What does that mean?  In the case that the other party decides to sue anyway over contracting Covid 19 - you,  the other party to the showing, not the realtor - are economically responsible for defending the suit, even if it is just the cost of attending and arranging a dismissal hearing.  The realtor picks the lawyer, manages the defense, and **YOU pay the bill.**

This issue is not specific to any one real estate agent or company.  We are being told that everyone needs to sign this.   I trust my realtor.  But I cannot extend that trust to anybody who makes an appointment to see my home.

I’m working from home, and it’s getting cramped in an apartment with another roommate who works from home. So for the past few weeks I’ve been hitting up a blood donation center. 

Whole blood can be donated once every 8 weeks. Platelets can be donated weekly and plasma twice per week. Obviously subject to change depending on what you donate.

The center I go to let me know that about 2/3 of blood donations happen at religious congregations, work drives and high schools.

Platelets are used primarily for chemo patients. They’re still getting chemo and need it. Platelets also have a shelf life of 5 days. You can donate platelets weekly. There’s a drastic need. You can get out of our place for a few hours and do something good.

They will NOT test your blood for COVID-19 and they’re only allowing donors to actually go inside. If you’ve also had contact with someone positive, you cannot donate.

But in the end, people need your blood, plasma and platelets. Google blood donation centers near you and schedule an appointment.",newjersey,Hey! Are you healthy and feeling cabin fever in social distancing? Donate blood at a blood center!

5036,katgirrrl,1586231233,fwdfvz,Nan,"So I'm wondering if anyone else is in this scenario. I experienced a severe URI requiring hospitalization last month, but was never tested for covid. I was not allowed to return to my job because I was sick (obviously) and also because I am immunocompromised, it was recommended I self quarantine by my doctors anyway. My workplace is also not allowing high risk individuals to come in and temporarily furloughed many staff members or recommended those affected in my case apply for temp disability, which I did. The NJ Disability website now has this alert when I went to check the status of my claim:

&gt; Attention Customers Applying for Benefits Due to Coronavirus/COVID-19:
×
We want to help guide you towards the maximum benefit amount available to you. Most workers eligible for Temporary Disability or Family Leave Insurance due to Coronavirus/COVID-19 related issues are eligible for New Jersey Unemployment Insurance—which dramatically increased the benefit amount and length of coverage through the Federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Here is an informational chart showing the programs you may be eligible for and where you can apply for them. Review the chart to see which program suits your needs best. 

[Here](https://www.nj.gov/labor/assets/PDFs/COVID-19%20SCENARIOS.pdf) is the flowchart. 

I fall under item 9: **Worker is advised by healthcare provider or public health authority
to quarantine**. So, I went ahead and applied for unemployment as well. I am just not really sure how it works or if I filled it out correctly. Options for COVID 19 were available in the dropdown menu, which I selected, but the original form itself was kind of set up stupid because if you click that you've applied for temp disability, it immediately boots you. So I had to click ""no"" to proceed and then write in the limited space they give you that I am out for a COVID-19 related health issue.
