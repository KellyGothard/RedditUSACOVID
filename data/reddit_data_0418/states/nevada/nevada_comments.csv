Honestly, as a homeowner with a really nice house paid off, I'm looking forward to leaving Vegas in about 5-8 years and going to someplace with less people, better political ideology and less traffic.

Vegas has AMAZING food and entertainment. But if that's not something you're really into then relax we have a solution to ANY vice you might have and that's pretty dangerous so if you have a drug, alcohol, sex, gambling, etc addiction DO NOT MOVE Here.

84,84,drot525,"It's a combination of bad engineering, bad construction practices, bad construction management. I'm a union pipefitter that only got on that job because the non-union ""pipefitters"" from Utah and elsewhere were fucking awful, and the contractor, Brahma got work taken away from them. 

We took pictures of pipe fit up for weld that were atrocious. Poor fits means more maintenance later, or failed xrays that require rework. For example, they were using nuts for bridge tacks (pieces of metal meant to hold the pipe in place while the root weld is made.) Those are required to be the same metal as the pipe, so you don't use just any bit of metal you have laying around. You order some plate of the same type and cut it up and use that. 

What was frustrating was that was a job 250 miles from Reno and Vegas manned by people mostly from out of state if not the US (for the engineering at least). And it was one of the highest paying jobs for pipefitters in North America. So at the bottom of the Great Recession, in a state hit the hardest by it, we had Nevada pipefitters working thousands of miles from home, whilst incompetent assholes were coming to Nevada to make 4k or so a week. Millions of dollars a month if not a week were leaving Nevada from a job meant to employ Nevadans. Even if you're anti-union, this is a prime reason why you should at least on some level support unions. Had we had more support we could have kept more of that money in Nevada, improving our economy, saving families and marriages and lowering the social cost of family and lives being destroyed by the GR.

It's deeply personal to me; I've rode shot gun to my traveling partner's divorce, watching him trying to save his marriage by phone. I've had coworkers who died or committed suicide because they couldn't find work nearby and couldn't leave to go to Oregon or NY or wherever else the work was. I got about 10 weeks out there. I think the most time out of the Nevadans I know that worked out there, they got about six months, out of a years long job. I always have a well of anger about this job and this issue.

A plant like that, it requires economies of scale to make it truly cheap. I think they got beat by other tech, PV primarily, but a one-off solution is always going to be pricey. It's when you build a dozen that it gets really worth while. Which is why US nuclear sucks; all our plants are pretty much custom designs. In the 50s and again in the 70s, they should have had one design contest, built them all the same, all the same size, if you need more power, add another unit.",1578353160,fdf4kh5

Reno has been one of the faster growing cities of the past decade and real estate values will be more resilient and have more promise but as far as cities go, it’ll feel more like a town to you. Still, it has a lot of big box stores and an active entertainment scene so it’s not like you’ll be out in the boonies like most of Nevada. Carson is better than it used to be but is pretty podunk compared to Reno (despite being the capital of the state), it’s a good place to live if Reno is too expensive. Avoid Clark county, you’d be better served moving to California unless you really want to avoid a state income tax. 

Reno is kind of the best NV has to offer because it’s got the functional practicality of a city while still being much more chill and you’re a mere half hour away from Lake Tahoe and even closer to some other lakes and rivers. SF is a mere 3.5-4hr drive away if you ever miss dense city life and need a reminder of why you left. Or if you just miss access to Michelin Star dining.

Having lived here almost my whole life, I love this state.  But if you get outside of the 2 main population centers it can be very isolated; Nevada is not like a lot of states back East where it is a few miles to the next town.

We might not be what you consider a “big city” coming from NYC, but Reno has definitely grown in the past decade and is continuing to do so in almost every aspect. I like living here because there’s an insane amount of variety in the geography, weather, and things to do. Summers are real hot and winters are real cold, although winter has been coming later in the year. The Sierra Nevada mountain range and Lake Tahoe are 30 mins away, great for both winter sports and beautiful summer hikes/beach days. Washoe Valley is in between here and Carson—if you’re looking for more rural, spaced-out living, that’s a super great option as it’s smack in between two more developed areas but doesn’t feel like it is. It’s also absolutely gorgeous, it has smaller lakes and huge fields that make for great scenery. 
If you want nightlife, a music scene, or just something fun to do for a day, downtown and midtown Reno have been really stepping up their game to provide something for everyone!

Vegas and Reno are definitely Nevada’s hubs—I’m not as familiar with southern Nevada, but I’ve heard Clark County can be iffy sometimes. Either way, NV has so much to offer and I wish you the best of luck building a life here!!",1578794129,fdzrjtg

152,152,drot525,"If you want all the stars, none of the people, this cool mountain that kind of juts up outta nowhere in it's own little mountain range, a perfect cave tour, and little Ely is right there if you want to run into town for a dinner or hit a bar. 

I've been in Oregon Caves on the Southern OR border, and Lehman Caves are right up there with that tour.

If I was doing that trip, I'd go up to GBNP, on the way (you'll be N on US 93 (because the road might be closed for the race, more later.) I'd stop in Panaca, go out the north side of that and hit the spring about a mile outside of town, do a little nostalgia swim with the lily pads. (Gramps used to live there). Stop in and eat lunch in Cathedral Gorge state park, stretch the legs and explore those cool little slots in the rock/mud/mesa. Drive through Pioche, maybe get a Coors in a bar, gawk at that old mining shit around town.

I'd hit the national park for a couple of days. We fished it back when it was a state park (they still stocked fish, they don't now that it's an NP) and SLAYED on brooks and browns. Then I'd hit Ely up. The car race is the same weekend as EDC (I checked) so you can check out some of the race cars will be pulling in all week long, so you'll see some classic muscle and race cars. They close NV Hwy 318 (which is the easier way to get to Ely, but 93 is doable, just one of the grades/hills is steeper, which in an RV or with a trailer can be a bit of a drag) for the race. Maybe camp at Cave Lake just south and outside of Ely, you can fish there, they stock it. It's tiny lake but I've always loved it. 

After Ely, I might head west on US 50 (loneliest road in America) cruise over to Austin, which is a neat little place too. I dunno why it's not yet a downhill mtn bike spot given it's basically in the hills itself. 

Go south on NV hwy 376, there's Kingston Canyon on the west side just south of Austin. There's some small lakes and casual camping there. I'd stop and look at old Round Mountain, which is on the east side further south. And not to be confused with new Round Mountain. The mine, an open pit mine, got so big they moved the whole town to the other side of the road. So it's a modern day ghost town, there might still be people living in some of those houses. And you can, at least in 2014 or so, get close enough to look down in to. It's crazy big. 

And then for sure, I'd hit Manhattan NV, and hope that little crooked bar is open. We had an absolute blast drinking in there when the miners got off and started filling it up. I think it probably holds 30 people. I bought a round for the house and it only cost me like 40 bucks. lol. It's high in the mtns, cool, and trees. You can probably camp there too. Just ask if you're not sure, it's mostly public land in Nevada, so unless it's posted, it's probably allowed. I always operate as if it's allowed and if it's not, well then someone better be nearby to tell me so otherwise I'm just going to do/go pretty much what/where I want.

Cruise back through Tonopah, which probably the only thing worth a picture of there is that scary ass Clown Motel sign, and head back to Vegas. Not a lot between T-pah and Vegas IMO worth seeing. I've driven through Silver Peak because US 95 I've done a 1000x at least and got bored; there's nothing out there. A bunch of lithium mine leech ponds or some shit. Don't bother.

Reno/Tahoe area could be a reasonable day trip.,1580232033,ffu0swg
278,278,MiryahDawn,"Dude...I wouldnt. 
I havent lived in Hawthorn since I was 5 so it could be different, but I wouldn't ever risk it. A lot of my family's heart ache and skeleton's in the closet started when we lived in Hawthorne ( 3 generations lived there). Just from what I remember there is rampant drug use and sexual abuse in that town. 

Even if the lifestyle has improved, it's such a small town there is nothing to do. We frequently would visit during the summer to fix up a house we owned there when I was a teen, and I spent most of that time lapping the small town becasue there was no one to hang out with and no where to go unless you have some type of recreational vehicle.  You are also hours away from the nearest decent hospital. Armed forces day weekend is a fun time to be there, but honestly that's the only time I'd recommend Hawthorne.

Edit: foodwise you have an over priced grocery store, the casino, McDonald's, a pizza place, and I think I remember a Chinese place that I never saw open. 

They have a park with a pool which was always fun as a kid, but both I and my uncle were stung by a scorpion when we were there. 

They have a huge horse stable area, that was always fun to visit as a kid though, and I remember a class field trip where we got to ride one of the horses. 

Theres also some pretty cool places to go hiking and rock hounding in the surrounding area. Walker lake isnt Tahoe, but its decent and always welcome with how hot it gets there. 

There is also the indian store in Schurz where you can buy fireworks which was always fun.",1580232103,ffu0wzs

282,282,SilverSierra601,"I would use your opportunity to buy a home. A nice house with decent renovations could gain a lot of value as you live in it. Just slightly more productive than paying rent to a landlord, I suppose. The issue is, Hawthorne is not exactly growing at the rate that other Northern Nevada cities are. So, do expect to double your profits or anything.

Recreation will depend on what you're into exactly. It is a great area for outdoor activities, with several lakes and reservoirs around, as wells as some rivers and fish-bearing creeks. ATVing is very popular in the surrounding desert and there are good seasonal opportunities for upland game and deer hunting. If you're not used to the Nevada desert do not expect a lush wilderness. The desert is an aquired appreciation; however, Westward, into the Sierra Nevada ranges will find you in beautiful conifer forests with Yosemite and Mammoth (great skiing) not too far away.

 Considering you're moving with a new family the nightlife might not interest you, but it is notable for such a small town, I'd say. On the positive, there is a considerable amount of young people living in Hawthorne and it is a tight-knit community in which to grow up. As such, I would expect several options in terms of daycare and pre-K education. The town is quiet enough that people of all ages could feasibly bicycle across it safely.  

In all, Hawthorne is a small - somewhat isolated - town. It is what you are willing to make it. Just be sure to have realistic expectations and you will not be disappointed.",1580233508,ffu370v

I have a hard time believing that the cost of that program would be well and truly funded given the attacks the right makes on ""welfare queens"" and other ""entitlements"" while they, in their continual bad faith, completely ignore the welfare being doled out right now to ~~farmers~~ Big Ag food growing corporations. Which mind you has gone up by billions as Trump's trade war has decimated the soy farmers ability to sell to China. That soy export business in the post-Trade War period is never going to come back. Once Brazil and other countries generate the capacity to meet China's demand, US farmers are going to have the devil's own time regaining that market share there. And all that went on the US credit card, so it's Americans and their kids, grandkids, and greatgrandkids that will be paying for this redistribution of wealth upwards from the regular class of Americans to the rich classes of Americans. And again in the bad faith department; deficits and debt only matter when the GOP is not in control.   

Back to voting though, it's a bad faith argument being made because it completely ignores the actual scope of the ""problem."" It's basically an (expensive) solution looking for a problem to solve. Vote fraud, of illegal or someone casting multiple votes is actually a pretty rare problem. It's a bad faith argument because it pretends to be about ""election security"" meanwhile actual election security especially the e-voting fiasco that is electronic balloting and maintaining the right of all people to vote is curtailed in pursuit of these tiny numbers. Ya'll would rather purge tens of thousands of citizens and their right to vote to catch tens of fraudulent voters/votes. Ya'll engage in redistricting/gerrymandering to maintain a power base that you've no right to.

1) Are you an anti-capitalist? Because without the growth of populations and markets, capitalism fails. Check out the struggles of Japan when their population growth flat lined. They basically lost a decade and a half or more because of it. They call the 90s the ""Lost Decade."" So what's your plan to fix that little problem?

2) Aside from that, pretending it's not a factor or you know a way around that major conundrum, are you a free spending fascist? You don't have to force the illegals to do shit. When the economy tanked in '08, they left. Immigration was net zero. The real ""solution"" is just arrest the people who hire them. Only a fucking idiot would try to round up millions of illegals, many trying to hide, so it's expensive af when you could just arrest a couple hundred thousand at most of the people who hire illegals. Problem solves itself. Ike did it in the 50s. Of course every farmer in America just gets further and further fucked, but fuck them too huh?

But the reality is, it's not that big a problem. It's not a problem at all. It's a challenge. We need more people. More workers. More consumers. If all the people in the world with some get up and go want to come here; let 'em. Sucks for the countries who are letting the brain and motivation drain happen, but /shrug. It's how we'd stay on top of the economic pile. I'd damn near take any person who walked here from Guatemala over most born here Americans; lazy, stupid, entitled, born on third thinking they hit triple. And we get better food out of it. Man America without Mexican, Italian, Asian food, is a shit show culinary wise. We should have a legit guest worker program that works.

That said, it’s still $100-200k cheaper than any house you can buy across the state line to the West in addition to much lower maintenance costs / taxes plus mortgage rates are ridiculously cheap right now... I’ve seen rates below 3% for excellent credit which is kind of insane, basically free money given the yield on certain other investments. 

The good news is that if you close, you’ll likely see your own home value rise pretty quickly and we’re *very* unlikely to see values soften significantly even if/when we do see another recession because the housing loan market has changed substantially since the 2008 crisis.

Early voters who supported a non-viable candidate will then be allocated to their top viable choice (if any).

The older gentleman who was also doing check in next to her could barely operate the iPad. The elderly woman who was first in line was still searching for her name by the time I was checking out. 

My friends were about 10 people back and the said the woman was checking in 3 people for every 1 the man did. (They we’re taking disabled people to the front of the line)

I think the app is going to cause a lot of issues like this. An older volunteer who is not comfortable with technology rushing to finish things on the app are going to make mistakes.

Well, tweets are a horrible place to get information, and there are people out there stoking fires right now for political purposes. [Candidate, Uncommitted, Uncommitted] will definitely be counted for all three rounds, unless your candidate of choice does not make the 15% threshold, in which case you will indeed have thrown away your vote.

Everything about how the Bernie campaign has run their social media stuff has been about as divisive and full of misinformation as possible, to the point where it seems like the popular viewpoint among his supporters at this point is that they'd rather not vote at all or vote for Trump if he doesn't win.

In short, there's a lot not to like about Bernie supporters right now. Certainly a lot more than there was before they all decided that Iowa meant that they had a God-given right to ensure that Bernie would get the nomination by any means necessary.

I'm sure none of this applies to you and you're just a progressive who wants healthcare and an end to corporate rule... but you might have also noticed these posts:

Just go to your precinct caucus and record the voting result at each of four stages for each candidate THEN DROP THE RESULTS HERE IN A DESIGNATED THREAD HERE AT R/NEVADA. 

Stage 1 - physical caucus goer totals only

Stage 2 - 1st alignment totals 

(Physical Caucus goers + early voter FIRST CHOICE)

Stage 3 - Realignment totals 

(After physical caucus goers realign to determine which candidates are viable)

Stage 4 - Final vote totals

(After early voting BACKUP CHOICES are allocated)

It's fucking EASY to do. 

I'll be grabbing all of the results from the precincts at my caucus site near UNLV. Just give a piece a paper with a row for each candidate and a column for each stage to someone at each precinct and have them write down the result, take a picture and have them send it to you.

Reposting most of the thread below, with some edits for brevity. 
&gt; It works like Iowa but with some crucial differences. Voters assemble at precinct caucuses and pick their candidate. This is the initial count. If their candidate doesn’t meet the viability threshhold (usually 15%) they can realign to viable candidate. This is the final count.

&gt; The final count determines how many county-level delegates each candidate gets. This total — and not the popular vote — will be used by the media to determine who “won” the Nevada caucus. Like the SDEs in Iowa.

&gt; Like in Iowa the county-level delegates are weighted towards rural areas. In the most sparsely populated counties, 5 voters earn 1 delegate. In Las Vegas, 50 voters earn 1 delegate. Kind of like in the electoral college, it’s possible for someone to get fewer votes but win.

&gt; The county-level delegates vote for state convention delegates who vote for the national convention pledged delegates who pick the nominee in Milwaukee. There’s another 15% threshhold statewide and by Congressional district that candidates must meet to be eligible for these.

&gt; NV has early voting for the first time. 75,000 people cast an early ballot. To put that in context, 84,000 caucused in 2016 total.

&gt; Each ballot has a first choice and two ranked second choices for realignment. The Nevada Democratic Party has until Saturday morning to count all 75,000 ballots and transmit the results to over 2000 precinct caucus locations. If they fail at this there is no caucus.

&gt; [T]hen every single precinct chair has to correctly use these early ballots to tabulate the initial count and realignment. And campaigns can challenge rejected early votes.

&gt; The other thing is there are satellite caucuses called strip caucuses. It’s good in the abstract: strip workers with shifts on Saturday morning can go caucus and get paid. But it’s also shady as hell. If you want to go to a strip caucus you have to ask your manager or union rep. A lot of the workers aren’t even aware they have this option.",1582401677,figncku

I’m 19 and was born, raised, and currently reside in Vegas. This is a no brainer, but make sure your Air Conditioning is always in good shape in both your house and your car. Constantly wax/seal your car’s paint with uv protective wax or better yet, buy a cover for your vehicle, as the summer sun just EATS through car paint. If you have pets, don’t leave them out too long in the summer and keep them hydrated. In Vegas, there is no “roll down windows to cool down” in the summer, AC is a must. Keep an eye on traffic details and announcements as Vegas and Southern Nevada in general suffer from constant accidents and road closures. While it may be hot, the weather is very bipolar. During the fall and spring, it’ll be freezing in the early morning, cool weather before noon, and then hot af later in the day, so always carry a sweater/hoodie just in case. It rarely rains, but when it does, it can causes flooding and such, always make sure your tires are in good condition and slow down. Coyotes can be a problem at times. Housing is fairly cheap here compared to other places, and there are MANY jobs here in the casino/hotel industry.",1583133732,fj9648w

1150,1150,infinite_minute,"In theory the bill protects an applicant from being refused solely on the result of a failed thc test. In practice the employer does not have to inform you of the reason they decline to hire you so it doesn't do much. The only time I would expect it to help you is if you were applying to a state job. Even then it is as dependent upon the personality/whims of a hiring manager more than anything else. This bill has not been tested in court so the power is still very much in the hands of the hiring company.

As you probably know: drug testing works by looking for the presence of thc metabolites in your urine (or hair blood etc). A person who regularly used cannabis for 1 year should expect to pass those metabolites in urine for somewhere around 2 months, +/- a few weeks. Blood test has shorter window of detection, hair much longer.

Whether or not the company will ""care"" about thc is entirely subjective and up to them. I have found that most in my area still do.",1583866347,fk4rtjk

So while influenza killed more people so far, that won't be the case if we take too long to react to it. Considering it's 20x deadlier while being much more contagious, you can see why we want to limit it.

Think of exponential growth like this. You have a lilypad that sprouts one lilypad every day. Today, you have one. Tomorrow, it's 2. The next day it's 4. Then 8.

If it covers the whole lake on day 60, do you know what day the lake was half-covered? On day 59.

And do you know what day the lake would be filled at 1%? Day 54. That means from day 1 through day 54, the lake only filled up to 1% of lilypads. Then it took 6 days to fill it completely.

That's just to give you an example of what exponential growth looks like. So just because everyone around you isn't sick yet doesn't mean it won't happen considering how highly contagious this is.

We had bird flu, swine flu, ebola and more. But none caused a pandemic like this. This is something that we should obviously take much more seriously even if you don't personally know anyone that's sick or died or lost a family member from this.

I'm fact, it was the Republican president that said to listen to your local government for orders since he didn't want to have the burden of doing this himself. So listening to Sisolak is listening to Trump. The person who declared this a national emergency.

Meaning waiters, bartenders, chefs, security, custodians, and any other day to day position. Simply due to the casinos and how low our population is relative to the large casinos. 

The point I'm trying to make is that Nevada is a unique state during all of this quarantine. We have thousands of people just in Reno alone who survive on tips or working with their hands. The bill's that have to be paid from these tips is going to be tough to gauge since a lot of owners do not report tips to the IRS. Meaning that to the state, those people might not have made over a specific amount to be eligible for more assistance. They were just making 8 bucks an hour to the state instead of their normal living wage. 

Just saw some people packing up their uhaul and moving from their apartment. I hope it has nothing to do with lost wages or lost tips. We need a freeze on all rent payments. We also need a freeze on mortgage payments so landlords do not get screwed.",1584634079,fkxrm6f

However they think that since they're closed to the public, they meet the ""legal definition"" of closed, and that therefore they're fine forcing us to continue coming in. So basically its still open to employees but closed to the public.

There are usually 8+ of us in there at a time (fairly big place), and it sounds like they have no plans for the social distancing thing (and the way the law worded it, only 'essential businesses' have to practice it). Thing is, I don't know if the current setup really satisfies the legal definition of 'closed'.",1584952729,fl9f1bn

A few years ago I took part in a program that essentially put kids ranging from 17 to 22 that were either recommended by significant figures that were in the US Armed Forces or had connections with. I was recommended by an ambassador to an overseas country I was living in at the time.

The experiment was to see how well kids that harboured some degree of knowledge of military and modern weaponry could function in a high tempo bootcamp experience. Essentially seeing if it was possible to train youth as quickly as possible if ever the US government needed them to. Some of us joked around and called it operation red dawn.

My CO thought it was ridiculous, calling it a spawn of paranoia, but it was an interesting study nonetheless.

The program started with around 300, and after 3 days dropped to 120, then 60, then 30. I was part of the final thirty. I won't say much more than that, but I stuck around for the long run and I am proud to say that I've come to look at the people I trained with like brothers and sisters.

The things we trained in, well, our drill sergeant from hell could sum it up better: ""You impubescent fucks are about to get 20 weeks of training down in 5."" I'm paraphrasing it was years ago.

But what we got was wild. As in I'm confident they hadn't shipped this shit out to regular bootcamps or whatever. Like we were guinea pigs on top of being guinea pigs. We used simulated ammunition, essentially paintball bullets most of the time, save for the range and killhouses. 

One of the worst experiences I've ever had in my life, and by worst I mean traumatising, for a recently senior kid who already had a lot of issues. It was a hyper realistic simulated warzone that took place, at a massive set, in the middle of the desert. It was designed to mimic two scenarios, a Taliban incursion, where we essentially play defense and manage medical, or skirmishes.

The problem was that the guys behind this hyper realistic set were really fucking good at their job. I've seen grown men vomit at the sight of the shit they put on display. It was the way of breaking the barrier of reality so soldiers are not only physically, but mentally prepared for warfare.

I grow anxious typing this.

As in living, Las Vegas is huge and driving across town (which you hardly have to do since there is so much that can be near you) can be 20-30 mins or 40-45 if you have to drive far with traffic. Reno on the other hand is very small and many prefer that. driving somewhere can be 10-15 mins 20 tops.

With the weather, Vegas summers are a killer 100+ degrees most of the time and mild winters. Reno has the typical perfect weather like 80-90 summers and gets cold with snow in the winter occasionally but it melts fast. 

Housing can be an issue. Vegas is fairly reasonable if you have a decent paying job and you can get a nice house in a good side of town for not too much. Reno, as far as I know, has many growing industries such as Tesla that have some factories out there and it is drawing more people to the area and it can be fairly expensive to find a place to even rent.

1760,1760,DC1346,"I used to be Republican but when Trump ran for office I bailed and became an independent. I just couldn't bring myself to vote for him because of all of his bankruptcies and the fact that he screwed over several contractors by withholding payment in a blatant effort to ""renegotiate"" terms even though they had a signed contract. Since he had an army of lawyers at his beck and call, his attorneys filed appeals and stalled for so long that some of these guys went out of business. 

It really rankled me to realize that the GOP was rallying behind a liar and a thief. When the Stormy Daniels pay off came to light, I thought for sure that the evangelicals would drop him. I can't understand why they remain among his most devoted supporters.

Last April I registered as a Democrat but consider myself more of a blue dog Democrat who leans right (or at least moderate) instead of left. 

Under the Trump administration the disparity between the haves and the have nots have become much more graphic. This on-going pandemic has really driven this home.

Not only have tens of thousands of hourly wage earners in Nevada been laid off but despite Governor Sisolak's executive order to suspend evictions, landlords continue to evict their tenants. 

We are setting ourselves up for a perfect storm. This pandemic has been accompanied by widespread unemployment, homelessness, and hunger. Food banks across this country are being overwhelmed, some with as much as a 600% increase in demand at a time when donations are down. 

While the Federal stimulus package was well intended, the IRS won't deposit checks until April 15 ... and they'll only do this if a taxpayer has previously filed an on-line payment. Anyone who HASN'T will eventually get a check in June, July, or August. 

There are a lot of people out there who need help NOW!

Our social services are also being overwhelmed. I read in the Las Vegas Review Journal that unemployment compensation is still being processed for the 96,000 or so applications that came in at the end of March. As more and more applications come in, the state office is falling further and further behind with processing these applications.

The poor (through no fault of their own) are being screwed over and while help will be forthcoming, these people need help NOW not in 3-4 weeks for state assistance or 3-4 months for Federal stimulus checks.",1586153633,fmkfy8x

By the time I got up this morning, the death toll had climbed to over 14,000. As I write this, the current US mortality count is 14,556. It will most likely rise to over 15,000 by tomorrow morning. 

A colleague from work emailed me to say that she's going stir crazy. As she was driving down the road, she saw a crowd at the local Dollar General store. No one was maintaining their social distance. She said a group of 10 or more kids were running around the store's parking lot while the adults clustered in groups on the sidewalk to talk. 

Our ability to come out of this crisis will be if people stay home and maintain their social distancing. 

Despite warning by Federal, state, and county medical officials, some people are throwing parties. College kids on Spring Break partied on Florida's beaches. Check out this [CNN report](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/04/tech/location-tracking-florida-coronavirus/index.html) on cell phone data to see how Spring Breakers were tracked as they left Florida to go home. 

In a separate article, I read how 70 UT Austin students chartered a plane so they could enjoy Spring Break in Florida. 40 of these kids later got sick. I can't even imagine how many other people they infected before they were identified and quarantined for treatment.

190,190,lewdite,"Aside from tax (which varies depending on how the land is zoned) you have maintenance and insurance. You have to get physically reappraised every 5 years at your own expense. It seems pretty clear that OP would end up paying vastly more in taxes and fees than the initial cost of buying the land (not including closing costs) and for what? To own a shitty piece of barren land in the middle of nowhere where you get 0 tax benefit for owning that land? At least if you build a house you have a deprecating asset and more available tax benefits but then of course you have much more significant sunk costs and bureaucracy to deal with in getting things permitted and built to code as well as dealing with public utilities and such. But even if you build nothing you have to state a purpose for the land which affects what you can and can’t do out there assuming you don’t get it appraised and discover the entire parcel is polluted and it’s not even safe to camp out there in a tent (which could very well be determined to be “residential” use of the land which potentially creates more problems). One cannot simply buy barren land and ignore the government while living off the grid.... buying property, even barren, unwanted land, is an inherently bureaucratic process to which your identity is attached. You have to pay for some kind of liability insurance or else if someone gets hurt on your land, regardless of whether you wanted them there or not, you’re on the hook for all expenses. Someone is found dead out there and you’re on the hook for removal costs plus now you’re a murder suspect. All this liability for the sake of a place to camp? 

Seems to me OP would be better off camping at a National or state park or somewhere out on public land rather than buying some piece of shit parcel in eureka county for thousands of dollars and then paying many thousands more just to maintain ownership. If you’re looking for a fun purchase you can do better. If you’re looking for an investment you can do better. If you just want to own some land you can do better (mortgage rates are as low as they can be right now... buy a fucking house which is tax advantaged, more practical and a better investment all around). Personally I’d rather throw that money into an S&amp;P index fund as we sit 20% off the highs or into ATT stock which pays a whopping 7% annual dividend right now (which is probably secure but who knows in these crazy times). 

You’re basically burning money owning undeveloped land. That’s why the vast majority of people who buy undeveloped land develop it. That’s where all the benefit lies... assuming you can cover the costs of the project to begin with.",1586540615,fn0esxy

I tried calling the first day we closed non-essential businesses and had the same experience as you, queue was full by 9:01.

Your best bet is going to be trying to file online. You may be able to lookup the jobs it lists for you and see if it's a different name for someone that owns the company you worked at. On mine there was just three letter abbreviations for a company that owned my workplace that I'd never heard of before.

If you have issues actually accessing the online application, I've heard that using the system late at night or early in the morning when less people are using it is the best bet. If that still doesn't work, they have a technical help email listed on their website as well.

Rural Nevada has lots of old wells and abandoned mines. What would happen if someone decided to explore an abandoned mine and it partially caved in and they were hurt? What if someone were hiking across some land and fell through the rotted planks covering an old well?

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/20/coronavirus-trump-chinese-virus/

&gt; While Trump only recently started using the phrase “Chinese Virus” in his public statements, it isn’t the first time such language has appeared in the national conversation surrounding the pandemic. In the early days of the outbreak, the terms “Chinese coronavirus” and “Wuhan coronavirus” showed up in media reports, including a Post story from January. Around the same time, Asians worldwide, especially Chinese people, were experiencing heightened tensions in their communities and instances of xenophobic or racist behavior. On Feb. 1, a man in Los Angeles angrily ranted about how Chinese people are “disgusting,” directing his comments at a Thai American woman. A day later, across the country in New York, an Asian woman wearing a face mask was assaulted by a man who called her a “diseased b----.”

Long story short, once racist assaults started happening, the legitimate media sources took care to change their language. The alt right nationalists continued to use racist language. 

And what did Donald Trump do? He did this.

Having said this, here are some suggestions.

**Food banks**: Google food banks in your area. Food banks have assembled care packages of food supplies. What you get will depend upon what they have in stock. I used to work as a food bank volunteer and when we were fully stocked, our patrons got a mixture of meat or poultry, dairy products, fresh produce, and a variety of canned food along with dried pasta, beans, or rice. 

**Food delivery:** Sign up with Doordash and or Grubhub. Food delivery companies are hiring. People order food on line and drivers get their orders and deliver them. All gratuities go to the driver.

**Amazon:** If you live near an Amazon fulfillment center, they're hiring. Amazon announced a couple of weeks ago that they're hiring 100,000 full and part time workers to help meet demands. 

**Instacart**: Related to food delivery, instacart workers go to local grocery stores to buy food supplies for their customers. As with the food delivery apps, they get wages and gratuities. 

**Church:** If you belong to a Church, you could also call your Church to ask for help Some Church groups are helping members. Others are helping anyone in need. 

The good news, what little there is of it, is that NV unemployment checks (once you are able to file your paperwork and have it processed) will come to $600 per week. The normal rate as I understand it was $200/week but the Federal stimulus included increases for unemployment payments. 

If you filed your taxes on-line and if the IRS has your bank account information for prior electronic deposits for tax refunds, they will be depositing up to $1200 per tax payer starting April 15th. An additional $500 will be issued per dependent child. 

If the IRS doesn't have your banking information, they will physically mail checks ... but by their own admission, this won't happen quickly.",1586618475,fn3dhm6

237,237,DC1346,"Governor Sisolak should be commended for his dedication to the health and safety of the citizens of this state. I'm a teacher with the Clark County School District. Although Superintendent Jarra suspended our sports program and banned all pep rallies, assemblies, field trips, and extracurricular activities in an effort to reduce exposure to Covid-19, it was the superintendent's intention to keep the 5th largest public school district in this country open. Governor Sisolak overrode these plans by issuing an executive order to close all K-12 schools in the state starting Monday, March 16th. He subsequently closed all non-essential businesses starting March 17th.

Under his initiative, the governor also launched an [on-line dashboard](https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/) to show how Nevada is battling this pandemic. The dashboard includes the number of confirmed cases, fatalities, percentage of ICU beds in use, percentage of ventilators in use etc. 

I was afraid that he would give in to big business and to keep the state's economy running as long as possible much as Governor  Ronald Dion DeSantis did in Florida. Not only is Florida now experiencing an outbreak of Covid-19 but Spring Breakers who crowded onto Florida's beaches have now returned home to spread this infection. 

As a result of Florida's ""ostrich head in the sand"" approach to this unfolding pandemic, there are currently 7,968 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Florida along with 419 deaths. In contrast, Nevada currently has 7,968 cases and 112 deaths. 

While it could be argued that Florida has a much higher state population than Nevada (21.48 million compared to 3.08 million), I believe that Governor Sisolak's quick response reduced our exposure to this virus.

Go to https://grocery.walmart.com/

If you don't have an account, you may create one. Payment is made up front through a credit card. You may order on-line and then choose a pickup date. I ordered my groceries on Tuesday night and the earliest available pickup time was Friday. Choose a day and a time. Walmart give you an hour to pick up your supplies. I chose 11 AM to 12 PM.

In the Walmart parking lot. follow the orange signs around to the side of the building. You'll see 8 parking spots that are marked by orange signs. Pull into a spot and look at the nearest sign. The sign will have a phone number that you call. Call the number, tell them that you're there, and tell them what parking spot you're in.

I arrived at 11 AM and an associate loaded my car at 11:15 AM. I didn't have to get out of the car. I didn't have to sign anything. The associate was wearing gloves and a mask.

358,358,lewdite,"The governor has been clear that the bottleneck preventing them from providing solid guidance is the fact that we have woefully insufficient testing capability. We don’t have a good idea of how many people are actually sick or how many were sick and have recovered so in the absence of that data it’s impossible to say one way or another whether the situation is improving or not. Obviously it would be counterproductive to lift the lockdown before the infection rate has decreased to a safe level... not just because of the infection risk but because *people aren’t going to go back to business as usual if there is a public perception that the risk of infection still exists.* That’s the real problem— you can open up the economy but you can’t force consumers to leave their houses. I have a hard time imagining that anyone is going to want to come to Vegas for any reason until a vaccine is widely available and the same is true for restaurants and the entertainment industry elsewhere in the country.  

This is going to take much longer than 3 weeks, that’s why the Fed came in hard and fast with liquidity the way it did. It’s why congress moved quickly to pass relief legislation. Major companies are writing the entire year off and smaller companies who can’t wait a full year are either trying to make it work with forbearance and relief loans or closing the business all together with the hope to reopen when this mess is behind us (which IMO is the smarter approach right now, I’m afraid Trump has turned this into a PR issue in an effort to boost equity markets and the situation is much worse than the IHME models suggests portending a much longer and deeper recession than many people expect). This is why unemployment now covers people who were self-employed. 

So you’re half right. It’s not that there isn’t a *plan* to get things rolling again, the problem is that the plan hinges on a lot of unknown factors so it’s impossible to provide a solid timeline... the only way to make this situation worse would be to suggest a timeline that can’t be realized which would undermine the credibility of the local government and further hamper any effort to get the state economy restarted. I understand very well the frustration of being so uncertain about the future, it’s killing me financially too... but the reality is that the situation it beyond our control now so all we can do remain flexible and hope to live and fight another day. That day will come when the virus no longer poses a health threat and you can have faith that interest rates will remain low enough to facility a recovery for those of us still drawing breath.",1587147902,fnpm3gr

360,360,2wheeloffroad,"It's good to have a positive attitude, but that does not pay the rent of employees.  
My response to the state saying there is not enough testing is two fold.  One it sounds like an excuse.  We don't need test for them to share what criteria they will use to open up the state.  Again, don't expect a date, but I have heard very little about how they will decide and no info that I can find on a plan as to what will open first and rules so I can prepare.
As to testing, I would ask the state why NV is so far behind the curve on testing?  It has been over a month and they still can't seem to get testing going.  Check out this web site:
https://www.politico.com/interactives/2020/coronavirus-testing-by-state-chart-of-new-cases/
NV has 28,000.  Hardly any.  Yet New Mexico has more test than NV at 33,000.  Tennessee has 85,000.  Louisiana has 126,000.  Why do those states have such good testing systems, yet NV can not?  I am not picking the larger states such as Florida with 219,000 or NY with 550,000.  NV just seems to lag behind, and then blame testing, yet testing is not what I am asking for, just the criteria, if they were to ever get testing right.  It would be nice to ramp up testing.  I know someone who was exposed (worked with all day long) to a positive test person and they were denied a test because the state said they don't have enough.",1587148754,fnpns7z

I think a million people are going to die and that we won’t have a vaccine until 2022 at the earliest. I think this is going to be more of a depression than a recession. 

With respect to testing, NV is actually ranked 18th in terms of tests per population so as insufficient as our testing is it’s better than an overwhelming majority of the country. That’s the problem. I’m sure you know that freedom of movement is guaranteed by the constitution so it’s not like states can set up virus checkpoints and deny entry to people who test positive. The lack of a federally coordinated response is part of why local governments are reluctant to provide more clarity. This is an unprecedented event on every level and the top priority is to save lives which will benefit the economy and thus small business in the intermediate and long term even if it gets ugly in the short term.

How do you not get that the business closures, social distancing, and stay at home orders are the reason the death count is much lower than predicted?

Are you just ignoring that this a virus that spreads when people are near eaanother? Do you think the outcome would have been the same regardless?

People were already not traveling, businesses were closing, well before the government shut it down. The government ""opening the economy"" will do almost nothing. Do you think suddenly Vegas will be full of hundreds of thousands of tourists?
