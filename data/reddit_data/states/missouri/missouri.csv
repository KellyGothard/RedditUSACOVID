2,kcexactly,"Why are you hating on them so much?  This isn't delaying anything.  They aren't asking for others to lose their license.  They are asking for their license to be approved as well.  They should of just approved them all as long as nothing was fraudulent.  Who cares if there are 500 facilities?  Let the free market sort it out.

Would you rather have a small supply chain and high prices?  Or, this BS like we see in Perryville with 4 licenses approved for one property?

What we will get instead is less choices for consumers, higher prices, and a greater chance for corruption.

Take concealed weapons permits in California for example.  California is a MAY issue state.  Meaning, the county sheriff decides if you warrant the need for a permit.  What happens in some locations is the only people who get permits are those who donate to the sheriff's election campaign, their friends, or other municipal employees.  Everyone else waits in a never ending.

Surely if they issue licenses to everyone who applied it could hurt some businesses.  But, that is what it is meant to do.  If you produce the best and are competitive eventually others will shut down and move on to other ventures.",1577773642,fcmfsol

4,kcexactly,"Yes, I read it.  It is kind of hard to file a motion to fight a process if you know idea how the process will play out.  And, if you truly are upset about the rich people then you should be really freaking upset because the ""richers"" were the ones getting approved for multiple licenses across the state while others lost thousands in the absurd process.

And no, it isn't delaying anything.  Just because you file a motion asking for a restraining order against the state doesn't mean it happens.  It is business as usual until the judge makes a decision in the case.  Which I highly doubt the judge will tell the state to not issue any license unless they see something troubling about the process.  The judge could simply force the state to issue more licenses or to grant the plaintiff a license.  It doesn't mean anything is on hold.",1577775375,fcmhez5

And if you are looking for liberal minded people, Springfield is not the place for you.  Again, Columbia is probably the most liberal place in all of Missouri.

Also, if you are looking for a career in the medical field, keep in mind that MU has a Medical School and MSU does not.

112,DollyPartonsFarts,"Springfield, MO is not the place you are looking for.   If you're definitely staying in Missouri, I would suggest Columbia or St Louis.  

Springfield is not a bike friendly town.  When you're in Springfield next, notice their public relations campaign based on letting people cross the street.  They have rebranded pedestrian crossing signs with big hearts around them: Because they have a very high rate of pedestrians being hit and killed by cars.  If you ride your bike legally on streets in Springfield, get ready to be heckled by motorists and possibly have drinks thrown at you.  Springfield is the only place I have ever been ""Coal Rolled"" while riding my bike.  

Springfield has a lot of great food.  However, the food scene is not really bike-able.  I went for about a year biking through the MSU area/North &amp; Central areas of the city. I'd happily bike half an hour to a place to eat, get there and realize they have no place to lock up a bike outside at all and have to turn around and ride home.  

I read in a comment that you're looking into being an accountant, correct? It seemed like you're saying that you want to look for accountant work in your college town?  I cannot say enough that your first move post-graduation needs to be out of Missouri if you want to have a career that builds wealth.  The cost of living is great in Missouri, but the wages across the board are much lower than outside of Missouri.  The wise move, and as a future accountant you should be able to verify this, is to grow your career in a larger market.  Move back to Missouri at some point when you have a stronger position to leverage wages, but you will be forever lowering your earnings if you decide to start your career in Missouri. 

Springfield is really enticing because it's so cheap.  But just like things on Clearance at the grocery store: There is a reason it is so cheap.",1577981114,fcuhjr8

UCM in Warrensburg is cost friendly and graduates a ton of successful people from their Business School.  The town is small, if that's your thing, and easy to get around in for the most part.  I will admit it is my Alma Mater, but my degree is not in Business or Accounting.  I do know some very successful folks who attended.

I think Truman is a good school although I have heard it can be pricey.  I have a friend whose kids went there, both were Political Science majors thought as I guess this is where many of our future politicians come from.  His is my only knowledge of the school, but it has a good reputation for rigor in it's coursework.

I had a young man who worked for me that was a SEMO in Cape Girardeau grad in Physics.  He was a very talented and well educated guy but represents the sum of my experience with that school.  Based on a sample size of one, I'd say they did an excellent job.

That the Missouri Legislature wanted to get involved when a few football players took a knee during the anthem by kicking them off the team?

I'm not here to belittle Columbia or Mizzou, but surely you are aware of the problems of the recent past there.

 The problem here is that unless whoever you sold the cars to tagged the cars in their name, they are still going to show in your name &amp; the state will show you are responsible for them.

Car 2 - We gave to a charity in March of 2019, and actually come to think of it, I don't think we ever registered it in Colorado. It died shortly after we moved, and we bought a replacement without getting rid of it. So that car I can legitimately understand being charged the property tax.

150,hersugarpill,"I'm from Kansas City, but I went to college in Springfield. The best way I can think to describe Springfield is it's like the most Northern tip of the Bible Belt. A church on every corner, very little racial diversity, not LGBTQ friendly, and very conservative. You will definitely see people flying the confederate flag, and plenty of MAGA Trump enthusiasts. 

However, being on a college campus is a completely different experience. College campuses are like little insulated pockets, and tend to be much more liberal. I'm liberal and was always able to find like-minded people on campus. I would guess most college campuses in Missouri, outside of Kansas City or St. Louis, are the same. 

Springfield is not a bike-friendly town. I never rode my bike outside of campuses because 1. Springfield is kind of a sprawling mess and it would take you forever to bike across and 2. because Springfield drivers are awful, and I was afraid of being hit by a car. Also, the weather in Springfield is TERRIBLE, it changes very quickly and pretty much constantly from day to day, so it would be impossible to bike year-round (unless you like riding through ice storms and monsoons!). 

There are some decent restaurants, but nothing very authentic, unfortunately. Most the ethnic places I tried were heavily bastardized American versions of whatever cuisine they served. I remember most of the good restaurants are downtown. I spent many nights there getting dinner with friends before going to the bars. They also do a First Friday type thing downtown that's fun. FYI, if you ask someone from Springfield, they will tell you they have some of best Chinese food in the country. I'm not sure where this myth came from, but it is a straight up lie, lol. Most of the Chinese places I tried there were downright garbage. 

I chose to come back to KC after graduation because of the job market, and because I didn't want to live in Springfield outside a college campus. The job market isn't terrible, but it's not great. You also have to keep in mind you'll be competing with a ton of recent grads for jobs, and Springfield is small enough that makes a difference. I found that people from smaller towns usually stayed in Springfield, and those that were from larger cities tended to leave. 

That said, I did enjoy my college experience there. Coming from KC, Springfield wasn't an intimidating place to be on my own for the first time, so it was a good place to test myself without parental training wheels. I had a ton of fun bumming around town with my friends being young and dumb. I would choose based on which school is going to be best for you, not the town it happens to be in. College is tough, and expensive, so focus on going wherever is going to get you the best education for the best price.

The impeachment was a sham. No matter how sure you are Trump is guilty of...something still unnamed...the Democrats ran a sham investigation and impeachment. They violated every precedent. They refused him counsel or a defense. They refused to name a crime. They didn’t have any evidence. It was the first partisan impeachment.

With Johnson, they had a clear crime and he obviously violated the law, the facts weren’t in dispute. With Nixon, he destroyed evidence, obstruction of justice was a lock, they had the indisputable evidence. With Clinton they had video, first-person witnesses, and DNA evidence. For all of these, they named actual crimes.

With Trump they didn’t name a crime, they have no witnesses, and they have no physical evidence of a crime.

If this impeachment stands as legitimate, you will now be able to impeach a monkey for wearing a hat. It should NOT be allowed to stand as precedent or impeachments will just become another political tool and not the solemn bipartisan responsibility it has always been.

Remember when the Democrats ignored precedent and changed the voting rules to push Obama’s Supreme Court nominees through?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal

Here you go buddy.  Read the transcript for yourself.  Or, you know, PAY ATTENTION to the hours of impeachment hearings where one side of our government is clearly laying out multiple witnesses saying exactly this over and over again.

Or hell, just skip straight to the testimony from the guy who donated a million dollars to buy a position in Trump's cabinet clearly saying this stuff.  Sondland is the biggest Trumper you'll ever find gave more money than you could give in a hundred lifetimes to Trump and even he came right out and said we were withholding aid based on Ukraine releasing a public statement about investigating the Bidens specifically.

I can't help you if you can't be bothered to take in the information you are literally being force fed on a daily basis during these impeachment hearings.  If you can't be bothered to watch them, you don't get to have an opinion on this shit that anyone takes seriously.

Would be like me trying to tell you my opinion on the recent election scandal in the Congo.  I don't know shit about it so anything I say would be meaningless.  If you don't know any of the evidence (Even if you disagree with it!) that the Democrats have clearly laid out against Trump then this discussion is pointless because you don't know enough about the situation to have an informed opinion.

Or you're biased to the point that you will never have a rational opinion on the subject and willfully ignore that evidence.  Either way, you're right that it's probably best to end things here.",1578023379,fcwe7jn

I watched the hearings in the house.  The white house refused to play along from day one and any defense of the president was a thinly veiled misdirection.  

The testimony that came forward indicated one of two things.  1 that the president was selling his influence and was trying to hide it or cover it up or 2 the president is a miserable leader who is overwhelmed by his station.  Either of those possibilities should be disqualifying and grounds for removal.  

However he's really good at one critical political skill.  That skill is messaging to a political base of voters.  That skill is so valuable that his party that they are willing to look the other way and in fact have begun to emulate his style.",1578023620,fcwejxb

218,RamzFanz,"&gt; Democrats did not ""violate every precedent,"" they followed the rules put in place by republicans in 2015. If the republicans thought these rules were wrong, why did they create them?

When will this leftist myth die? The House Democrats, in a partisan vote, passed the impeachment rules in Oct, 2019.

These rules gave them all of the power and denied Trump any semblance of a defense. 

&gt; They didn't ""refuse him counsel or defense"", they invited him to testify and defend himself, which he voluntarily chose NOT to do.

Testifying in a rigged investigation is not a defense. In the RULES THEY PASSED they denied him counsel with the right to call and question material witnesses. They ONLY invited counsel to the judicial impeachment hearing where, in the RULES THEY PASSED, for the first time ever, refused to allow material witnesses.

&gt; They didn't ""refuse to name a crime"", whether you like it or not, Obstruction of Congress is a crime that carries a punishment of one to twelve months in prison.

Obstruction of Congress is NOT a crime. Please feel free to link the statute.

&gt; They impeachment hearings were absolutely full of damning witness testimony, including people trump himself appointed. Was Ambassador Sondland lying?

Inferences and assumptions are not damning testimony. It’s meaningless. They wouldn’t have even been called in an actual trial.

&gt; This also certainly was not the first partisan impeachment. Bill Clinton was impeached for lying to congress. Trump has lied literally over 15,000 since being in office. Do you support impeaching trump based on any one of these lies? ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/16/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/ )

I guess you don’t know what partisan means. Democrats crossed over to vote for impeaching Clinton.

Clinton was not impeached for lying to Congress, he was impeached for lying to a grand jury, which is an actual crime, perjury, and they named it. They proved it with undeniable evidence.

According to them, he’s not impeached no matter how much you want it to be so, until they submit the articles to the senate as required.

The president was forbidden a defense, so I don’t think you have any idea what it would have been. 

The testimony that “came forward” was assumption and inference. It would be laughed out of a courtroom and will be destroyed in a Senate trial, should one happen and should they question witnesses.

226,RamzFanz,"From Noah Feldman originally, the Democrats’ expert witness, although other experts have also agreed.

Their point is that it’s a process that is laid out and must be completed in a reasonable amount of time. The reason for the implied time limit is the Senate has the sole power to try impeachments and the House doesn’t have any power to delay it. Trump also has a right to a defense he is being denied.

I know the Democrats and media keep saying the House can do as it pleases in impeachments, that “sole power” means whatever they say it does, but that’s never been challenged in the courts. This could/should be the case where it’s challenged.",1578033081,fcwpxny

We find it extremely audacious that your frontrunner literally joked and bragged about withholding financial aid in exchange for firing the prosecution at CFR 2018. The very thing you're trying to impeach the president for, specifically in that he communicated to Ukraine that they could reopen the case. And they have indeed reopened it.

It seems insane to me that democrats would operate at the behest of a corrupt foreign oil company, but here we are.

The new documents do not in any way show a crime.  You may infer and assume things, but no crime is even discussed.

Are we now investigating Mitch McConnell and all the others who signed the letter telling Biden to fire him?  Were the other world leaders in the UN calling for him to be fired in on it too?

Note also that he fired a prosecutor not actually investigating Burisma and they replaced him with one who did actually investigate and start charging people.

If this is truly somehow your argument, that it's okay for the president to break the law because one of our old vice presidents was also corrupt, well then not only is it a shit argument but you're also factually incorrect.

But if we pretend you aren't factually incorrect and what you're saying is true, well then you also must be okay with opening a thourough investigation of high level GOP members who wrote and pressured Biden publicly to get the prosecutor fired.

However note that even in that scenario (the one where everything you say happened went down exactly like you say it did for corrupt reasons) it doesn't clear Trump even slightly. Just means we should be giving him a cell next to Biden and the GOP members working with him on this other crime.

The White House blocked testimony, and documents, which again are now coming out and are quite damning, thus they obstructed. Much easier to whine about lack of evidence, when you are literally withholding most of the evidence. Additionally, all of these witnesses, in closed door depositions AND public testimony did not infer anything. They gave testimony about what happened. ALL of them clearly point to this coming from him and Rudy. Finally, it was only a circus because that was LITERALLY THE GOP'S STRATEGY. They wanted to delegitimize the whole thing by making it look like a fucking spectacle.

The other difference is that it wasn't a tampering with foreign government in order to aid an individual, it was because we required certain benchmarks to show they were getting rid of corruption. Trump's tampering was explicitly to help Trump and ONLY to help Trump.

That path for this particular issue would be a real challenge since there are so many telecom companies with registered lobbyists and associations who would fight to kill the bill.

The second path is through a ballot initiative, which requires navigating a complex technical path through the Secretary of State, then collecting nearly 200k signatures across many counties in the state through either volunteer collectors or paid signatures gatherers,  and then campaigning to get it voted in during an election. This process typically costs somewhere between $1-20 million, but it's often the best way to get a law with public support but corporate opposition on the books.

There is also the option of going to the Kansas side. Places like Olathe, Mission, or Overland Park are all nice. Can be on the higher end of income depending on where you go but that also ties to having good schools and other nice things.

What you really need to think about is

* where will you be working and how much of a commute are you okay with having
* what do you like to do for fun
* do you want to live in a house, apartment, or condo

Honestly, most of KC is pretty good. That's why the details matter. For example, Belton is what I would consider the absolute maximum distance away and still be part of the metro area.

Plus it brings a sense of excitement and some of that tax money goes to fund other cool new improvements around town.

After 5+ years they become a huge drain on the community though. The newness has worn off and most casual gamblers had been there and done that enough times they are bored with it. Nearly all the customers left are people with serious gambling problems which make the environment spiral downward and become a depressing one that turns off almost any remaining casual gamblers. Thus there tends to be a lot of layoffs by the casinos to reduce their workforce to the size of their remaining customer base.

As for the problem gamblers they don't usually eat through their savings overnight; but over several years they get into credit card debt, empty their homes of equity, clean out their retirement accounts, and borrow everything possible from family &amp; friends.

I understand the point that not requiring a license does not put stipulations on law abiding citizens but that isn't really the point of gun control laws.

Gun control laws don't exist because anyone thinks everyone is going to follow all of the laws all of the time. The laws exist so that we can do something about it when someone presents themselves as a threat before it becomes violent. 

For example, conceal and carry laws, no one ever believed that no one carried a concealed weapon when a permit was required to have one. The law was there so that we could do something about it when a concealed weapon was found in an otherwise problematic situation. The concealed weapon would have been a confounding factor with other charges. Now, there simply isn't anything that could be done if someone is committing other crimes.

How about the favorite law that gun supporters like to make fun of, gun free zones. Gun supporters think they're pretty cleaver when they point out that criminals don't care about gun-free zones. Yes, that is true criminals don't care about some laws. What the gun-free zone laws do is allow authorities to take action if someone is carrying in one of these sites BEFORE it becomes violent. Without gun-free zones, authorities could not do anything about a school shooter until they start actually brandishing their weapon. With current laws, we can take action and stop the individual before anyone gets hurt.",1578583924,fdne8cm

745,RoydEris,"&gt;The fact that other countries have suicides has nothing to do with my post.

What you really mean is that you're going to claim anything that pokes holes in your claim has nothing to do with your post.

Obviously, Japan indicates that even if you could wave a wand and make most of the civilian firearms in this country vanish, *people would still kill themselves*. 

&gt;I didn't even make a policy suggestion. I just pointed out that it is something that should be studied. 

Oh, please. You're a gun control advocate.

&gt;There is a lot that we don't know about the relationship and that is why you do studies.

Go study why people decide to kill themselves and how to prevent that.

&gt;https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/essays/firearm-availability-suicide.html

Do you even read your own sources?

&gt;States, regions, and countries with higher rates of household gun ownership have higher rates of gun suicide.

That's like saying that people with stairs in their home have a higher rate of stair related injuries. Correlation is not cause. 

&gt;Cummings et al. (1997b) used a case-control approach in which they linked health insurance records with firearm licenses in Washington state from 1980 to 1992. 

Ooooh, what a wide ranging in depth study that is!

&gt;Whether the mere availability of a gun increases the risk of suicide is a complex question to disentangle from observational data because some of the association between gun accessibility and suicide is likely attributable to the fact that those who wish to kill themselves may go out of their way to procure a gun or otherwise ensure that a gun is accessible.

Somebody that wants to kill themselves may go out of their way to acquire a firearm if firearms were less accessible? This is trail blazing stuff!

&gt;These studies were generally based on psychological autopsies, in which ascertainment about the presence of firearms was provided by proxy respondents for the decedent after his or her death and compared with the presence of firearms as reported by comparison or control cases who were matched to the decedent in various ways but who typically had not died. 

Psychological autopsies? Seriously? Seems this whole thing goes off the rails if the proxy respondents for the decedent don't know about a firearm that was in the home that wasn't used.

&gt;With individual-level studies, any observed differences in gun access between groups can be interpreted in at least two ways: The differences could suggest that gun access increases the risk of suicide, or they could suggest that people who are suicidal may obtain guns at a higher rate because they are considering killing themselves with guns.

Since you only specified distance from STL and length of the hike, here are some spots I'd recommend:

Hawn State Park - the trail system is over 15 miles on multiple loop trails with connectors. Very popular location, about 75 minutes south of STL.

Ozark Trail - longest trail system in MO. Includes some of the most difficult and rugged hiking in the state, and some of the best. I usually recommend the Taum Sauk section, approx. 15 miles, or the Courtois section (forgot the length). Distance from STL varies based on which section you hike.

Cuivre River State Park - the only place I recommend north of I-70 within day-trip distance from STL. Shares an environment more similar to southern MO than the surrounding countryside. Several trails in the park, not sure total length if you did them all (I'd guess 15-20 miles total in the park). About 60 minutes north of STL, right outside Troy, MO.

Meramec State Park / Conservation Area - 90 minutes west of STL. Several trails in these two areas. I'll specify the Wilderness Trail, which comes in at a very easy 10 miles. Like, the easiest 10 miler you'll ever hike.

The last one I'll bring up is the various parks and areas in the westernmost part of STL county, incl. Greensfelder, Rockwoods Reservation, and the trail that connects them. I'm forgetting it's name, but it's definitely on AT. I think the whole system is close to 15 miles, but not positive.

Think about what you're saying here.  Less than 100 people in a nation of more than 300 million cast statistically insignificant votes that had zero effect on the system and you want to spend billions of dollars to fix a problem that hasn't actually caused a single negative effect yet?

The charges and punishments for impersonating someone to cast a vote in a federal election are already staggering.  People who would do this are already risking a ridiculous amount, ruining their entire lives forever, to do something that will have no effect on anything.

1024,Teeklin,"&gt;So you're saying that I ought to be able to walk up to Walmart and buy a grenade launcher without any hassle? Or that felons ought to have an uninfringed right to purchase firearms?

Personally I think no one should have the ability to buy a firearm without being 25, requiring weeks of training lessons, requiring a home inspection to make sure there's a secure location to store them, and renewing the training and licensing yearly.

But, you know, that's just because I think our state should treat guns at least as seriously as they treat a flower.

What I'm saying, however, is that this is not the case right now and zero photo ID is required to buy a gun.

Now I may disagree with that just like many people might disagree that we should remove barriers to voting, but that's the case right now for firearms and voting and it doesn't make much sense to change one and not the other.

If you're going to require ID to vote then require it to buy a firearm as well and provide it for free to every citizen in the nation in the comfort of their own homes.  I got no problem with voter ID laws as long as the ID is free and  doesn't require anyone to travel to obtain it.

The second it costs something, be it money or time, to obtain then it is infringing upon my right to cast my vote.

&gt;You're explanation is garbage, we regulate everything. And you still have to register to vote. Isn't that regulation?

No.  You think data tracking is regulation?

Also, voter registration should be automatic for all US citizens and it's a fucking crime that it isn't already this way.  Thanks GOP.

Liberals want everyone who lives here to have an equal say.  Liberals don't want anyone silenced or prevented from voting by bullshit like voter ID laws which are PROVEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM TURNING OUT TO THE POLLS.

If Republicans really care so much about in person voter fraud and want photo ID cool, then put the funding in place to provide it to every citizen so that there's no barrier to them voting.

But they don't care about that.  They care about keeping those they consider to be the ""wrong people"" from voting and don't give two shits if that means an eligible voter is turned away.

Of course just a coincidence that those who are disenfranchised are Democrats I'm sure.  Totally no relation there, right?

I don't think any reasonable person from either side would see a problem with this in theory, it's in execution that the issue comes.

More voting machines, hard copies of the ballot (preferably with a hash value at the top you could plug in online to verify the votes you cast were registered correctly), automatic regisration, all good stuff.

But then we throw ID in there, not a bad idea at face value, but how do we get this ID?

Do I have to pay for it?  What if I'm already under budget and can't even afford to eat properly or get my medication, do I lose my right to vote because I can't afford it?

What if I'm disabled?  I can't even make it to most of my doctors appointments because I don't feel well and the nearest DMV is 30 minutes away but I have to drive and stand in line and get this ID or I lose my right to cast a ballot?

What about absentee ballots and early voting?  Do we think those are not secure because there's no photo ID and will we eliminate or require ID for those?

I mean if I have a problem with this system and can't get my ID and cast a ballot what is my recourse?  I can't vote, I have no representation, I'm being controlled against my will.  What if future governments add further and further barriers to voting like this and I already can't vote, how do I put in someone who will vote against and prevent those restrictions from becoming law?

At that point you have a subset of people who feel like they are being controlled against their will and that they have no say in things and then they all go throw a bunch of tea into the bay and we're back where we started.

So yeah, your idea is great but it means we also have to put in place FIRST (not after and hope shit works out) a national ID system for all citizens.  Something that allows them to apply for and get a photo ID free of charge through the mail (not even everyone has a computer or phone) which will likely include sending someone to their home to take the picture and verify documents.

That's an expensive program.  Super expensive.  I'm not against it in theory, but when talking about spending billions of dollars like that you gotta ask what we're trying to combat here, what problem we're trying to solve, and if it's important enough to justify that cost.  If we couldn't solve other, more important problems with that money.

For example, securing our voting machines I think is a far more important use of our dollars than photo ID.  Making sure they're all air gapped with paper ballot backups and doing regular audits for example, expensive as fuck but worth the money because it's a real risk that can cause real damage.

But photo ID voting laws?  That's spending billions of dollars to fix a problem that essentially isn't a problem.  Doesn't exist.  In 2012 South Carolina investigated 206 cases of dead people voting in the state.  All 206 of them turned out to be clerical errors and not a single in person voter fraud case among the bunch.  And if all 206 had voted in the smallest county for the same candidate it wouldn't have swayed even a single local election in either direction.  

Essentially there was zero fraud but even if 100% of the cases were fraud it would have had a 0% impact on anything and caused zero damage.

That just doesn't sound like a problem worth our money to address at the moment.  Considering how risky it is for someone to even do that, go up there and claim to be someone else and vote for that person.  It's a crazy thing to do with very little benefit and huge, huge downsides and that's likely why it simply doesn't happen very often and when it does it makes no difference.",1579113174,fehbjux

Quite possibly less. 

Look at state gambling machine implementation for example. We got one in nearly every bar, casino, gas station, convenience store, etc, and it already performs all the tasks this voting machine would be required to do.  We're very clearly capable of implementing such a system, and it would be well within the budget of even state or local governments. An example of the infrastructure already exists, and is quite very secure. And this system is well tested against groups you pointed out were at risk of being disenfranchised. No other metric of people buy lottery more than the poor.

It is just a heck of a lot easier to do with ID and not go through the various alternative identification and screen processes involved. I did not have an ID for over 10 years because of the stupid California abstract of birth debacle\*, and I did all of these except buy a gun or drive during that time.  

    
That's the difference with voter ID, is that it removes the ability to be screened through alternative identification methods when you do not have a photo ID.  

&amp;#x200B;

\*If you are wondering what the abstract of birth debacle was, for a period in the 1970s, California stopped issuing birth certificates and instead issued abstracts of birth. The long form certificates were kept on file with the counties and only the abstracts were filed with the state.. The abstracts were acceptable to get ID only in the state of California, other states would not accept them. If you were born in California and not a California resident, you had to request a copy of your long form certificate from the county you were born in.

Except that some time in the 80s, California stepped in and blocked counties from issuing birth certificates and required people to go to the state. But the state only had the abstract of birth on file if you were born during that period in the 70s. I moved out of state in 1991 without a driver's license and without knowing that I had walked into that catch-22 because I had a passport that I used for ID. I did not know that I wouldn't be able to renew it because it was issued before I was 16.  
The state of California finally relented some time in the early 2000s (I think it was 2003?) and allowed people to go back to their county offices of vital records so they could get long-form copies. Since I never re-established residency in California, the whole time from when my passport expired until California changed rules, I was without a government issued photo id. (I'll add that I also spent hundreds of dollars in research fees with the state of california and the county I was born in trying to get a birth certificate issued.)",1579132547,fei8cpx

1073,EpycWyn,"That is a good question, so let me play out an extreme example and give a very thorough explanation that you probably did not want. Let's say the following happened:

""Hello Missourians, I am the Leader of the Missouri Ku Klux Klan, AMA!""  
That would be one of the worst case scenarios in terms of ethics of the person doing the AMA. However, the point of an AMA is primarily researching and understanding an important person, for the sake of knowledge and knowing how to handle said person. In this instance, I think everyone would have some morbid curiosity how such a person arrives at such an extreme lifestyle. Likewise, many would read the AMA in order to figure out the mindset of such a person and persuade others away from that lifestyle.

If that person broke the law or was not terribly important, the AMA would likely not happen. I know that it is a controversial stance to tolerate an AMA with someone perceived as unethical, such as that one for instance, but I believe that is the best way to preserve free thought and speech while still maintaining standards and being useful to readers. VICE news for instance has interviewed its fair share of terrorists and fascists after all despite being a progressive-leaning business, but that does not mean they endorse those things.

As a counter-balance so as not to glorify said offensive leanings, commenters will have their free speech preserved as much as I can manage within Reddit Terms of Service. This means you can somewhat heckle the AMA person, though only somewhat as the Terms of Service restrict things like harassment and I have to keep in mind what our fellow mods and users can collectively tolerate rudeness-wise so as to not trigger a digital civil war (I've seen my fair share that destroyed online communities).

Personally I find any leaning that isn't my own offensive, so I guess my short answer is ""Everything u/EpycWyn dislikes is an offensive political leaning."" But, I've found that it is quite intolerant, foolish and boring to censor offensive things, unless absolutely necessary to a community's freedom and existence. Since I want AMAs to happen and don't want to censor everyone, I just censor no one (within the confines of AMA rules and Reddit ToS).

I know that was a rather long answer that went farther than what your question entailed, but I felt it was important for people to understand the full context and spirit of an AMA as an important form of news and free speech, and in turn understand why we allow the Offensive Missourians.",1579154269,fej2aux

I'm going to wait to see what people respond because I expect there will be a few important potential AMAs. It might send a bad message if our first ever AMA is a KKK member so we'd at least do that second. Order which AMAs go first will be influenced by importance and timing of when the person asked; every Major Missourian will be done eventually if they qualify and can do so.

I'm not sure what rank a 'Grand Wizard' is, but if it's the highest rank possible meaning he's THE leader of the Missouri KKK, I would be interested in that AMA. Just make sure he knows how to make an account and reply, and understands the risks of publicizing himself as a KKK member.

1206,Caffeine_Cowpies,"That's not true. There is due process. 

Let's take [Red Flag law in Colorado](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb18-1436). In that case, the extreme risk protection order (ERPO) is similar to a Temporary Protection Order (TPO). First, a police officer or a family or household member can petition the court to remove firearms of the respondent at an ex parte hearing. The petitioner(s) must prove, by a **preponderance of the evidence**, that the person ""poses a significant risk to self or others by having a firearm in his or her custody or control or by possessing, purchasing, or receiving a firearm."" 

Now, here's where people get the ""NO DUE PROCESS!"" argument. Like a TPO, the respondent is not required to be present or given notice of said hearing. But, as most rational observer would note, this is common in very sensitive, emergency situations. As any victim of domestic abuse can tell you, giving notice to your violent abuser that you intend to take action to prevent them from seeing you, it's going to result in serious injury or death. In fact, nearly [1/3 of all murdered DV victims](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/domestic-violence-murders/), the police knew that person was a threat to that victim. So time is of the essence to protect the victim's right to life, which FUN FACT, the right to LIFE is protected by the Constitution as well. That fact seems to be lost on the opponents of Red Flag laws. 

Then, after the temporary ERPO is issued, the court must scheduled another hearing within 7 days, where the respondent must be there and the petitioner must prove **by clear and convincing evidence** that the ERPO should be extended under the same ""significant risk"" test. That's a higher standard than preponderance of the evidence (which means more likely than not). If that is granted, then it's 182 days (\~6 months). But, at any time, the respondent can file a motion to terminate the ERPO. And then the **petitioner** has the burden of proof to prove why the ERPO should not be terminated. 

In Colorado's law, it is always the burden of the petitioner to prove why the respondent shouldn't have a gun. The respondent does not have to prove or show anything to keep their guns. In fact, in the first day the law went into effect, it was used for [a guy who beat his wife and threatened suicide in front of the police](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/01/08/colorado-just-used-its-gun-seizure-law-first-time-one-day-after-it-took-effect/).

Yeah, that's bullshit. Suggest you consult the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. 

&gt;As any victim of domestic abuse can tell you, giving notice to your violent abuser that you intend to take action to prevent them from seeing you, it's going to result in serious injury or death.

A restraining order generally doesn't involve the seizure of private property.

&gt;In fact, nearly 1/3 of all murdered DV victims, the police knew that person was a threat to that victim. 

Sorry, the police don't actually have a duty to protect. See Warren v. District of Columbia.

&gt;So time is of the essence to protect the victim's right to life, which FUN FACT, the right to LIFE is protected by the Constitution as well.

What part of the Constitution would that be, exactly?

&gt;In fact, in the first day the law went into effect, it was used for a guy who beat his wife and threatened suicide in front of the police. 

Pretty sure beating your wife is a crime, subject to arrest and jail time, where you're not allowed to have firearms. Threatening suicide sounds like a trip to a mental health facility and possible involuntary commitment, which would involve becoming a prohibited person. Even if it only results in voluntary commitment, you still don't get to have guns while confined and under evaluation.

&gt;That's a good thing for society, unless you want dangerous people to have guns.

&gt;A person filing an extreme risk protection order against a respondent can, at the time they file their petition, ask for a ""temporary"" order to go into effect before the hearing can be held. The temporary order can be requested without giving notice to the respondent.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;If a temporary order is approved, the law enforcement agency overseeing the jurisdiction where the respondent resides must notify the respondent that they need to surrender their weapons and attend a hearing scheduled within 14 days

So you can be deprived of your firearms and have to attend a hearing. Where you maybe get them back. Maybe. Unless another order is issued.

A temporary order can be issued at an ex parte hearing and the victim is deprived of their firearms for up to 14 days until a hearing. The first the victim hears of it is ""give us your guns"" from the police. Then the victim has to to to a hearing. How do you think it's going to go if the victim does not go to the hearing? The victim has to go to that hearing and disprove whatever bullshit has been told to the judge to get their firearms back.

Then why not just go for a mental health commitment, which has exactly the same criteria?

National Socialism (German: Nationalsozialismus), more commonly known as Nazism (), is the ideology and practices associated with the Nazi Party—officially the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP)—in Nazi Germany, and of other far-right groups with similar ideas and aims.

Nazism is a form of fascism and showed that ideology's disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system, but also incorporated fervent antisemitism, anti-communism, scientific racism, and eugenics into its creed. Its extreme nationalism came from Pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist völkisch movement prominent in the German nationalism of the time, and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in World War I, from which came the party's ""cult of violence"" which was ""at the heart of the movement.""Nazism subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race. It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (Volksgemeinschaft).

1398,AppleBoiReddit,"But it is though, and not enough research has been done on that dangerous 42% myth. People never consider that the suicide statistic is for a person’s whole life, including before they transitioned.

When people say that transgender people are more likely to commit suicide, they sometimes say that it is proof that transgender people are mentally ill. They never consider that there are outside influences causing unnecessary stress for transgender teenagers to come out.

https://time.com/3651037/enums/

Leelah Alcorn’s death is a reason why teenagers need to be able to transition. Instead of having her transition, her parents chose to enroll her in conversion therapy. When that didn’t work, they homeschooled her. This directly led her to killing herself. That is a fact. You can’t beat around that and say that you care for transgender people.

Transgenders attempt suicide for multiple reasons. Bullying, not being able to transition, unsupportive parents. It isn’t just that they are mentally ill. That is a hoax perpetuated by people who want to make transgenders the new boogeymen/women in Christian America.",1579536063,ff38b34

&gt;Chris Moreland, spokesman for the state  Office of Administration, said Missouri officials did not know how many  of the 111,528 addresses in question existed in 2010 but weren’t  counted.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It  is not known what percentage of these updated addresses were newly  created addresses or whether they were addresses uncounted in the  previous census,” he said in an email.  
&gt;  
&gt;As  a percentage of total housing units, the 111,528 state-submitted  addresses made up 4% of the state’s total estimated housing stock of 2.8  million units — the ninth-highest percentage of previously uncounted  units among U.S. states and territories, according to the Office of  Administration.

1505,BluAnimal,"&gt;Court records show that Swift had two weapons charges in 2016 and 2017. The 2016 charge was for for unlawful use of a weapon and marijuana possession, according to court records. Swift was charged in 2017 with unlawful concealed carry, which could have revoked his probation on the previous charge and increased his chances of going to prison, Mike Mansur, Jackson County Prosecutor spokesman told CNN.

&gt;However, the second charge came as Missouri legislators approved measures that permitted concealed weapons being carried without a permit.
""I can't say that he would have been imprisoned but I can say that the change in the law assured that he would be free because that charge went away,"" Mansur said.
As a result of this change, the second charge against Swift was dropped by the county prosecutor.
The change in the law ""assured that we couldn't do anything further building off that earlier charge,"" Mansur said.
Additional efforts by the prosecutor's office to confine Swift also failed. Officials tried to have his bond revoked, but Mansur said the court denied the request.

The trend is what matters, not a single year on a graph.

Crime in STL isn't even at its peak compared to past years. Also, STL has some of the most violent gangs in the US. Constitutional carry laws would have literally zero impact on their activities.

Constitutional carry allows all law abiding citizens to protect themselves. Criminals don't care about licensing, as most firearm crimes are carried out with illegally obtained firearms anyways, and most gang members are not going through the permit process.

Criminals will never care about the hurdles you put in front of them as it pertains to carrying a firearm. Honestly, I'd ask you to really think about the logic of that alone- how many criminals have been arrested that actually went through with getting a CCW...

But I do not ignore the high rate of gun violence in America and I am interested what the cause is. When you look at other developed countries the simple formula of more guns = safer country does not seem to hold up and their are criminals there too. It is frustrating when the pro-gun crowd argues that throwing more guns at everything is the only solution and stops there. Maybe our issue has nothing to do with gun laws.

1541,notFBI-V1,"For one, your ""study"" is locked behind a pay wall, and two, correlation does not equate to causation. Nowhere does it state how they've directly associated a 15% increase in violent crime (generalized) with carry rights. You have literally zero logical or statistical proof showing that allowing more people to carry a firearm inherently leads to more crime; the ""study"" is especially weak when they can't account for a lack of firearm specific crime increases in permitless carry states. If you're going to link a ""study,"" perhaps choose one that doesn't inject bias into the first couple sentences that associates violent crime in general with an unrelated object (firearm). 

Also, high rate of gun violence? Expound on that. You're making the same knee-jerk reactionary statements that most fudds do when attempting to pawn off blame on an inanimate object, rather than cultural behaviors.

Chicago and Detroit don't have high homicides because of ""muh guns,"" and other countries with looser gun laws coupled with a lack of firearm crime doesn't equate to ""muh gun law good!""

The US is unique with respect to its culture revolving around gang crime. Removing firearms from the equation will result only in substitution methods being chosen by criminals. It's no different from the argument that Australia and other nations employed when using suicides as their defense. ""Geez if we just restrict guns, suicides will decline!"" unfortunately that didn't happen. Suicide by firearms declined while substitution methods (hangings) increased dramatically, resulting in quite literally an unchanging statistic.

If you can actually show me any instance with hard numbers relating SPECIFICALLY to firearms, then maybe  you'll have a case to present, but so far, all I've ever seen are desperate attempts by anti-gunners to conflate violent crime in general with firearms, even when they weren't used to commission a crime.",1579728512,ffa5x4g
1542,notFBI-V1,"Here's something to look into if you're interest is as genuine as you proclaim.

Studies looking at a single, or three, years are absolutely bogus. Every country on this earth will see cycles of crime. What matters most is the trend over decades. 

We have that data. 

What is the firearm related crime trend? What is the trend pertaining to carry laws?

Firearm related violence and homicide has been declining for literally decades. Conversely, carry laws have been loosening across the nation over decades as well. Even Texas used to be a no-issue state, but now we have more than a dozen Constitutional carry states, states of which we see no serious uptick in random firearm specific crime.

It has been politicized for years as ""it will turn into the wild west!"" yet that is quite literally the very opposite of what happened.

In states that are now permitless, but prior they required a permit, some states with more than a million permits, they saw no serious change in firearm related violence. 

If people have to go as far to conflate regular violent crime with totally unrelated carry laws, they have no case, and it's simply a desperate and fallacious plea. 

If people are going to freak out over statistically variation between three years during permitless carry, but don't have the same reaction for years prior when the laws were in place, they again have no argument.",1579728995,ffa6stv

1604,devSTL,"If these franchise taxes are gross-receipts \ gross-revenue taxes levied in proportion to total sales, then yeah they are terrible taxes which should be abolished at the state level, because they are probably passed on to customers anyway, and because a gross revenue tax falls on the profits of smaller providers looking to enter the market with greater capital expenditures relative to revenues more heavily than larger providers, which suppresses competition and promotes vertical integration.

It would be preferable to tax either the land, property, or net\excess profits of private utility corporations instead, so as not to tax the profits of smaller providers more heavily than the profits of larger providers.J

Our Republican president is also in hot water over investigating his political opponent, so I guess the right’s resorting to it too. I’ll add that to the pile of your hypocrisy. Finally, you are right. We are supposed to vote bad actors out of office, but how the hell do you do that if no one reports on what they do? How are we supposed to uncover crimes if they are not investigated? If they find nothing, great! Investigating alleged crime is not a waste of resources; our police do it every day.

The only people seeing this ""evidence"" are democrats that have been foaming from the mouth about Russians for the last three years. Every witness seems to precede their testimony with ""I assumed"" and ""I presumed"".

On one hand, I see the point of the professors and the administration. Yeah, they are adults but you can't learn if you're not in class. And with massive lecture halls, you can't do proper attendance records without some sort of self-reporting by students and it taking up most of the lecture time. It is important to a university that their students are there to be taught so they go out into the field and use that knowledge to get jobs. So if this helps students be on time and be there where they are supposed to be, then that can be a good thing. Not to mention many employers make you, as a condition of being an employee, have access to your phone system. I had to have my iOS under my work's program on my phone to be an employee at my law firm. 

On the other hand, forcing students and employees to do this really is conditioning them for a world where everything is micromanaged and people don't really have any freedoms. That seems to go against the principles of this nation. 

I do not think Congress or the State would want to do anything about data privacy rights.

Before ACA health insurance premiums were rising by around 10% a year.   ( [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/\_\_\_media\_files\_publications\_issue\_brief\_2014\_jun\_1750\_gruber\_growth\_variability\_hlt\_plan\_premiums\_ib\_v2.pdf](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/___media_files_publications_issue_brief_2014_jun_1750_gruber_growth_variability_hlt_plan_premiums_ib_v2.pdf) )

After ACA premiums did rise around 12% (so 2% more than they would have increased without ACA) but out of pocket spending dropped but the same amount. ( [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/22/out-of-pocket-health-spending-dropped-after-obamacare-rolled-out.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/22/out-of-pocket-health-spending-dropped-after-obamacare-rolled-out.html) )

In short, with ACA your health insurance is better quality and has more benefits, and lowered your out of pocket expense while stabilizing your premium.

I don’t care what people think they saw, they have no idea, one germ from any of those people that entered without a mask or proper attire could have killed him sooner than when he passed. No one that entered that room had probably cause to enter and accuse. NO ONE!! 
Yes we talked cannabis to everyone and everywhere we went we were patient/caregiver/ cannabis advocates. So I’m starting to realize that this hospital talks about patients when it suppose to be confidential information to only those who need to know. That’s saddens me.

Working in public schools, specifically underfunded schools with high rates of poverty, what I saw was a complete disregard for the legal requirements of students with special needs. Good charters, not all of them, are stepping in to serve those who weren’t served. 

I think the blanket statements are oversimplifying the discussion. Charters belong in failing school systems, not the county. Students who don’t have great options should be given an option. 

I hear you on the undercutting and long term effects. Really. But the students in the short term still count.

The largest charter school networks are also the most successful (Uncommon, KIPP, Achievement First)

The first question I'd argue is complicated. The students left in those schools are still given more money per student than at any charter school. The districts have 1100 more per student. 

But the schools are ineffective. The districts should be mimicking what's working in charters - but they don't because of the bloated admin. Mimicking charters would mean spending money entirely differently, firing people in central office, paying teachers more, having smaller class sizes, implementing curriculum that's more rigorous (money saving again since this is free and textbooks aren't), investing in quality teacher training... The list goes on and on. Public schools could be effective, but they won't do what needs to be done to be effective. If they were effective, people wouldn't put in all the extra effort to go to a charter school. 

SLPS should be asking itself ""Why are kids and families choosing charter schools over us?"" 

Instead, they're asking, ""Why are charter schools even allowed?""

It's so flawed. 

I say this as someone with about a decade in urban education whose worked in both public and charter schools.

So while other cities expanded their boundaries as they grew, St. Louis remained the same size, and a significant portion of the region’s low income and high crime areas are found within that small area. 

For example, if St. Louis city’s borders were the size of Detroit’s, they would extent out far enough to include Clayton. That would obviously pull the crime rate down. If it were the size of Kansas City, it would include the majority of St. Louis county, which actually makes KC’s relatively high crime rate pretty concerning.

Then, of course, they get in office and simply focus on staying in office, not running the state government.

Hawley, for example, is a fine example of just that.  Did the guy even ever do the job of Attorney General in Missouri?  It appears he just spent his two years doing everything he could to unseat McCaskill, with the national GOP propping him up along the way.

I'm also not sure the dysfunction is limited to one party.  Seems most people who are knowledgeable and good leaders find much better things to do for a living than go into politics.  We're not getting our best and brightest to chose from folks.

State politics is now relegated to the land of the egomaniac and big feelin' little town bigshots who just want the power and recognition that come with winning.  And here in 21st century Missouri, all you have to do is spout the standard ""guns, abortion, and gays"" mantra of the Republican party and you win.  Gerrymandering has enabled the Missouri GOP to be quite successful at commanding both houses of the legislature with candidates that, in many cases, are quite ill-prepared and unqualified, but hey, they'll keep pushing that national agenda and trying to ""out-conservative"" our neighboring states.

2090,jmh082016,"He gained popularity as our mayor and then ran for state representative. While I was living there someone rightfully contacted the Freedom From Religion Foundation and reported a 100 ft cross that was in our local park. The FFRF contacted our city council and let them know that charges would be pressed if the religious symbol was not removed within a certain time frame. Our entire town *flipped shit*. It was like a Parks and Rec episode. A bunch of total idiots acting like some minor thing is the end of the world. I remember the local news headline was something like ""Extremist Atheist Group Demands our Cross Be Taken Down"". The mayor, who had his own opinion section in the newspaper, could not talk about the FFRF without using the words ""atheist extremists"" which is hilarious because he's the one who is an extremist and the FFRF is meant to stop people like him. The large majority of the town wanted him to ""stand strong"" and not ""give in to the atheist agenda"" so he tried to fight off the FFRF, but eventually opted to sell that part of the park to a private owner. So now the cross is still there, but it's not technically part of the park anymore. His religious followers saw this as a win and it rallied him into state level politics. He basically ran as the guy who will keep Missouri Christian. 

&amp;#x200B;

He graduated from an academically unaccredited college with a degree in Biblical studies. He belongs to an extremist evangelical church that has a very literal interpretation of the Bible (can't remember what they're called but I call them ""the half-Amish"" because they're basically Amish people who can use the internet, but I don't think they're Mennonites). He's also a young Earth creationist, evolution denier, and climate change denier. He fought to keep up an obvious religious symbol in a public park. He's trying to get Missouri schools to have Bible classes. And now he's trying to ban content that he views as anti-Christian from libraries. He's absolutely insane. I'm embarrassed to be from the same town as him and even more embarrassed that the people in my town were willing to vote for him.

You are arguing that Kansas city is only in Missouri but the reality the greater metropolitan economy reaches far into both states. And yes that has an effect on who likes certain sports teams. 

Sort of like saying the New England Patriot have more fans in Foxborough. So that means only Mass. can really have fans.

2293,Lybychick,"You're looking at 3 levels of care he could qualify for: independent, residential care, and assisted living. His physician would be a good resource to determine if he actually needs the higher level of care (and greater expense) of assisted living.

Skilled nursing care (the traditional nursing home) is expensive and has criteria that he would have to meet.

Independent living is apartment living with amenities for old people ... he would still administer his own meds and would have access to meals, activities, and transportation based on the facility.

Residential care facilities administer meds although a physician can authorize the resident to self-administer if they're able. RCFs provide meals, housekeeping, and activities as well ... most residents maintain a certain level of independence based on their desires and abilities. 

Assisted living facilities take care of meds, meals, housekeeping, laundry, activities,  etc. Some are likened to a cruise ship without a change of port. They may be more expensive if they are part of a more contemporary aging-in-place community or if your father requires a memory care environment.

Show Me Long Term Care is an excellent resource in Missouri to locate the type of facility your father needs and to access information about their inspection and complaint investigation results ... they are inspected by state inspectors at least annually.

A Place For Mom is also helpful and is not limited to Missouri.

Best suggestion, get facility info and schedule tours ... talk to existing residents, ignore the slick marketing materials, visit during a mealtime, ask about actual average expense not just the base room &amp; board rent because some will nickel &amp; dime you to death. 

Location is important....where does Dad live now? Does he still have strong connections to his community and groups? Have his friends gone to a facility that he might like? Where does he want to live? It's tempting to make the choice based on family convenience, but honestly you are likely to visit less than you plan ... life gets busy. The transition to long term care is easier on the resident if there are familiar faces and a shared history of community.

2308,asyst0lic,"Thanks so much for your response.  He's actually at a skilled facility right now (or should be moving there sometime today) after a hospitalization, and if it weren't for us putting our foot down, it would just be the third round in 12 months of hospital-short rehab stay-home.  Somehow, between last visit and this one, he'd managed to let his home become unlivable due to neglect and illness, so unfortunately, going back to his apartment is literally out of the question, but finding a family member who can host him with home health is plan A for the immediate term after discharge.

&gt;  Does he still have strong connections to his community and groups?
Honestly, one of the biggest struggles with keeping him healthy has been that he completely isolated after retiring (I think there's a big depression component), so I think the most important aspect to finding a place where he will thrive is one where the community actively engages him.  They could have all the activities in the world, but if someone doesn't knock on his door and say ""hey, we're going for a walk, get up"", he'll stay in bed forever.  The reason I'm most hesitant about the whole prospect is that I fear putting him in ""a nursing home"" with a bunch of people 20 years older will cause him to just shut down entirely, accelerating the early neurological issues he is having.  I'd much rather him in the most restrictive/least aided setting possible for as long as possible for that reason.  Something to discuss with the individual facilities, I guess.

There are some very good and affordable 
assisted living facilities in your area of the state.

For Show Me Long Term Care, go to www.health.mo.gov, click on the Seniors tab toward the bottom, and select Show Me Long Term Care ... you can select facility information by county or city or zip code. 

Activity Directors are the chirpy cheerleaders of the long term care world .... they can be annoyingly encouraging and persistent to reduce isolation and make new residents feel comfortable.  Most facilities encourage dining in a common dining room and the old man coffee klatch in the morning is still a thing. 

Educate yourself on Resident Rights and read the Resident Agreement/Contract carefully before it's signed. If Dad doesnt already have a DPOA in place, it's time to develop one. 

There are so many details and worries, it's easy to become overwhelmed.  Please make sure y'all are taking out time to take care of yourselves as well.

If you bring Dad into your/sister's home for awhile, consider Adult Day Services that may be in your community....they are day activities only and help with socialization and monitoring while family needs to be at work. They are also licensed and inspected by the state.

Sunday lunch (usually big) at restaurants was huge because people were going to eat at home Sunday night to watch the game.

We place way to much stock in having someone else educate us. We live in a world that has unlimited information at our fingertips, get off your lazy cheeks and teach yourself something. The problem with our education system is the children, 90 % of them don’t give a flying fork about what is being taught because their parents don’t care ( I was one of those kids). Pay the teachers a six figure salary, still won’t fix the issue. Make college cheap,  we will still have students saying “Ds get degrees!” 

Better paying jobs exist. People are unwilling to Educate themselves on different opportunities, move  to a different location, leave the comfort of being a Starbucks barista, or take risks.  Also the problem will only get worse as the population increases and technological/automated systems continue to take over. The human population has grown more in the last 50 years than it has in its entire existence. What do you think is going to happen in the next 50?.

I agree the health care system is dumb. Not because of the quality of the care, but the cost. The system belongs to the insurance company and the hospital systems only care about the dollar. But without that dollar, they wouldn’t be able in invest and grow, to be able to pay the best doctors and buy the newest equipment.

Seems like there is a much larger demand for dispensaries and growers given the number of applications, those jobs would be great for the state, and the market can sort out which ones survive based on which ones give patients the best prices and services.

To that end, any chance of adjusting the cultivation regulations and loosening them up to allow farmers to grow for more patients in smaller quantities (right now a single caregiver is limited to providing for only three patients six plants each, even if each patient only needs one plant or less).

Even my grandma has seen benefits from this and it was a great step forward, but looking at prices across the country and just across the river in Illinois it's a very expensive prospect in a nation where medication is already so expensive.

New rules that enable Missourians to help each other would be great.  There are plenty of healthy people out there with green thumbs who would love to grow a few extra plants for sick people to save them tens of thousands of dollars a year if only things were tweaked a bit to make that easier.

The legal responsibility requirement should be dropped, no reason someone who knows how to grow a plant and wants to help a disabled or sick person should have to be related.

Additionally, a caregiver should be able to apply for a certain amount of plants for each patient they want to care for and simply put a limit (if you must limit it at all) on total number of plants per caregiver and not total number of patients.

Changes like that could give good part time jobs to plenty of stay-at-home moms or farmers and make the lives of sick and disabled Missourians much easier, saving lots of money and hassle.",1580957631,fgo1ilj

2502,Quade2020,"Money and special interests! Until Citizens United is overturned, I do not believe we will ever completely beat this. A sometime unpopular opinion- I believe term limits as we have them in MO are extremely detrimental. Legislators can serve 8 years in the house, it is constant campaign season. This is a multi fold issue. When it comes to policy- the institutional knowledge rests with the lobbyists. We have Reps who max are here for 8 years and staff that are vastly underpaid so turn over is high. Whenever you need to know any history about legislation- the lobbyists are the ones. With that their influence on policy is huge. On the campaign side, it costs so much to run for office. When elections are every two years, and you have legislators always looking to their next office because of limits, money is prevalent. 

How do we stop it? Help elect people who believe it is a problem. Elect people who are there to their job and not constantly working on the next office. Support policy changes that impact campaign finance reforms. Pay attention to the money- who pays for the lobbyists, which bills move, and how much those Reps are receiving in contributions.

2504,Quade2020,"Thanks for the AMA everyone! I have been asked about how we change such a red state and I want to take just a few moments to share my thoughts before I sign off on this one. 

When looking at how the Democrats succeed in Missouri I believe it is important we look at how we got here. It wasn't long ago that the Dems controlled things in MO. The other side was deliberate, it took time and lots of money, they started at the bottom in city council races  and worked upward, and now we are where we are. First step is to recognize where we have been failing- and it is everywhere. Inner cities rightly feel left by the party. ""Safe blue seats"" don't get love and attention because it is just assumed that voters will turn out. Resulting in lower turn out, apathy, and very just frustration. Rural areas feel left by the party because we aren't present and the main issues you hear about are not relatable. Nearly all energy (understandably) is focused on the 5-10 ""flippable"" seats--- but nearly all energy is spent on the statewide races because the legislature seems too lost to even try. 

I believe we need to be hitting both. In MO it isn't just about growing our base. But it also isn't just getting new voters. We have to do both. Which is why I fundamentally believe in bottom up campaigning. We need to run Dems everywhere, and those Dems need a base level of support to run real races. In rural places we most likely can't win a House race the first go. But think of it this way- if we can move a race from a 25% chance of winning to 30%, the next year we move a few points again- eventually it can be in play. But importantly for now we are looking at statewide or senatorial races that a few point move in a rural community can literally change the outcome. In ""safe blue"" seats, we need to be working so much harder to be present in the communities, empower their voices to be a part of the process and bring folks into the fold. A higher voter turn out helps our statewides and senate candidates. We need to be investing time and dollars in the ""flippable seats"". Being strategic in how and where we are investing and really turning out the vote- just like we just did in the special election of HD 99 where we flipped a seat red to blue. 

But it goes beyond just elections. We need to be present everywhere talking about what we stand for, not just how bad the other side is. We need to be listening to input from all over the state and our platform ideals need to be helpful to all. We need to be supporting volunteers and giving them the tools needed to talk to their neighbors, to knock on doors effectively, and to have a structure that changes the way we do things. We need to really spend time on creating something that outlasts elections, that is working on our message in the off years, and understand that this is going to take some time.

It's near the Sac Osage Wildlife area, but the bluffs are mostly on the other side of the river from the public lands. There's a small roadside park on Hwy 82 shown in xcityfolk's streetview link. It's the public area and is how people access the bluff for climbing. Has a small set of stairs that go out to a viewing deck, heck of a place to watch a sunset. But the most fun way to see the bluffs is by water. There's a boat ramp a few miles down the road on 82 and it's a couple of mile paddle (or boat ride) to some pretty cool things that you can't see from above. I have a couple of cool pics if I can figure out how to link them.

This is a perfectly viable way to deliver internet with good speeds and is no reason to have 3Mbps download. A typical DSL connection in those scenarios can easily be over 50Mbps. Charter pushes near-gig services in some areas with their lowest being around 100Mbps.

&gt;""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don't resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don't ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don't bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe.

&gt;Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, George Carlin said it well, too:

&gt; They're all in favour of the unborn. They will do anything for the unborn. But once you're born, you're on your own. Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months. After that, they don't want to know about you. They don't want to hear from you. Nothing. No neonatal care, no day care, no head start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing. If you're pre-born, you're fine; if you're pre-school, you're fucked.",1581349677,fh814hq

So I'm not sure what's more or less ""fair"" because it seems context specific on what you want to be fair. If the goal is to have a proportional number of democratic seats and republican seats to the number of democratic voters and republican voters... I think both are relatively even. But clean Missouri was angled more towards preventing incumbents from influencing their districts and forcing races to be relatively competitive, which probably admittedly favors democrats getting shots where they otherwise might not in our current political environment.

If they only switched the competitiveness/compactness ordering, I'd probably support them on the change, because I can see an argument there. I did like the demographer part though, because it prevented them from drawing the districts they want as incumbents themselves.",1581435589,fhb633c

**Carthage**

Red Oak II is an interesting little village built by a local artist. Worth a stop.

Carthage Square

* Amazing Courthouse
* Mother Road Coffee
* Cherry’s Art Emporium and Woodshed Burger House
* Cage Gang Pizza (not on square but a cool wood fired pizza joint)
* Civil War Museum

Stay at the Boots Court Motel

Check out the epic victorian homes in the historic district - tour the Phelps House, it is incredible

Depending on the time of year - the 66 Drive-In Theater is a lot of fun and feels like going back in time.

**Carterville** \- Supertam on 66 Ice Cream (superman ‘museum’)

**Webb City** 

* Neat little route 66 themed park as you enter town with a big map of Missouri that would make a good photo op
* Old Movie Theater on Main St
* The farmers market on certain days of the week is pretty good
* Visitor Center 1blk west of Main on Old 66 in an old filling station.

**Joplin**

* Mineral and Mining Museum has some gigantic crystals and history of the area
* Route 66 Photo Op/Mural Downtown on the north side of Pearl Bros.
* City Hall has a pretty cool map/mural/photo op
* Hackett Hotwings is a fun place to eat downtown. 
* Social BTB is another fun unique restaurant in a historic warehouse - you can have dessert at Carolines Ice Cream a few doors down.
* Wilders Steakhouse has a cool neon sign - it catered to Route 66 travelers and is STILL open. It's fairly expensive (for Joplin) but is very good.

**Galena, KS** (just across the state line) also has the original “tow mater” and inspiration for the movie Cars.",1581971345,fhy9fdf

IOWA, YOU MAKE ME SMILE!

We got really into saying that. Whenever someone was from Iowa we would say, oh Iowa, you make me smile. Then one Saturday we all said, you know what, we should go to Iowa, and see if all those billboards are true. So six of us piled into Johnnys beat up Chevy Cavalier and drove the hour stretch from Kirksville to Iowa. When we got there, it was barren icy cold and desolate. Just like a desert plain only missing the tumbleweeds, and also it was freezing and cloudier with more wind, and a sideways kind of freezing rain snow, just bleak and barren as shit.

There was one small sign that said Welcome to Iowa. On the sign someone had spray painted out Iowa and wrote ""Nothing."" Welcome to Nothing. We just parked the car right there on the road, there were no cars for miles and miles. Then we jumped out of the car and screamed at the top of our lungs.

Come on Iowa, make me smile!

You said you would make me smile Iowa, DO IT! FUCKIN DO IT!

It didn't work. We collapsed exhausted back into the Cavalier and turned back and drove the hour back in silence. We were not mad at a state so much but our lives in general, how we were told over and over what would make us happy. A phone. A trip. A University degree. Salaries. Engagement rings.

GUN BAN FOR INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF A MISDEMEANOR CRIME OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9)


The 1968 Gun Control Act and subsequent amendments codified at 18 U.S.C. § 921 et seq. prohibit anyone convicted of a felony and anyone subject to a domestic violence protective order from possessing a firearm. The intended effect of this new legislation is to extend the firearms ban to anyone convicted of a ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.""


This bill passed with almost unanimous support and represents Congress's recognition that ""anyone who attempts or threatens violence against a loved one has demonstrated that he or she poses an unacceptable risk, and should be prohibited from possessing firearms."" Congressional Record, p. S11878, September 30, 1996. This new provision affects law enforcement in three interrelated ways. First, it will assist in preventing those individuals who have demonstrated a propensity for domestic violence from obtaining a firearm. Second, it will assist law enforcement by providing a tool for the removal of firearms from certain explosive domestic situations thus decreasing the possibility of deadly violence. Finally, it will serve as a federal prosecution tool in certain situations where alternatives have failed.


Qualifying Offenses: As enacted the statute defines ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" (MCDV) as any state or federal misdemeanor that -


""has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.""


This definition includes all misdemeanors that involve the use or attempted use of physical force (e.g., simple assault, assault and battery), if the offense is committed by one of the defined parties. This is true whether or not the statute specifically defines the offense as a domestic violence misdemeanor. For example, a person convicted of misdemeanor assault against his or her spouse would be prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms. It is anticipated that this issue will be subject to litigation. In the event of such litigation, the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section should be notified so that assistance can be provided.


Date of Previous Conviction: The prohibition applies to persons convicted of such misdemeanors at any time, even if the conviction occurred prior to the new law's effective date, September 30, 1996. See United States v. Brady, 26 F.3d 282 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 246 (1994)(denying ex post facto challenge to a 922(g)(1) conviction) and United States v. Waters, 23 F.3d 29 (2d Cir. 1994)(ex post facto based challenge to a 922(g)(4) conviction).


Limitations on Previous Convictions -- 18 U.S.C. §  921(a)(33)(B). To qualify:(1) at the time of previous conviction, the defendant must have been represented by counsel, or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel;(2) if the offense of previous conviction entitled the person to a jury trial in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried, either the case was tried by a jury, or the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury, by guilty plea or otherwise; and (3) the conviction can not have been expunged or set aside, or be an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored (if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense) unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms. The issue of restoration of civil rights must be carefully researched for each potential defendant. For example, in some states a person automatically loses his/her civil rights upon the execution of a sentence of imprisonment (felony or misdemeanor) only to have the rights restored upon the defendant's release from prison or sentence. However, in those states, a person who does not serve a sentence of imprisonment may not lose their civil rights and, therefor, this limitation may not be applicable. But, in United States v. Indelicato, 97 F.3d 627 (1st Cir. 1996), the Court held that in at least some instances if one group of felons may possess a firearm because their rights were automatically taken away and then restored then those who do not have their rights taken away may also possess a firearm. The Terrorism and Violent Crime Section can provide assistance in analyzing particular cases.


There is no law enforcement exception: One of the provisions of this new statute removed the exemption that 18 U.S.C. § 925(a)(1) provided to police and military. Thus, as of the effective date, any member of the military or any police officer who has a qualifying misdemeanor conviction is no longer able to possess a firearm, even while on duty. We now have the anomalous situation that 18 U.S.C. § 925(a)(1) still exempts felony convictions for these two groups. Thus if a police officer is convicted of murdering his/her spouse or has a protection order placed against them, they may, under federal law, still be able to possess a service revolver while on duty, whereas if they are convicted of a qualifying misdemeanor they are prohibited from possessing any firearm or ammunition at any time. Currently pending before Congress are at least two bills that would substantially modify the impact of the amendment to this section.


Prosecution Considerations: In determining whether a particular case merits federal prosecution, you should consider the following factors: the date of the previous conviction; under what circumstances the firearm was obtained; whether there are indications of current potential for violence (i.e., recent incidents of domestic violence would be a stronger argument for prosecution than if a number of years had passed since any domestic problems had occurred); alternatives available to federal prosecution (state prosecutions, voluntary removal of the weapons); whether the potential defendant was ""on notice"" that his/her possession of a firearm was illegal; whether the potential defendant had made any false statements in obtaining the firearm.


Even if a determination is made that prosecution is not warranted, steps should be taken to assure that the firearm is removed from the possession of the prohibited individual. Depending upon the situation, this might be done by having a local/state/federal law enforcement officer notify the individual of the application of the new law and offer to take temporary custody of the firearm. In other, more volatile situations, it may be necessary to obtain a search and seizure warrant to assure that the firearm is removed immediately.


ATF has primary investigative responsibility over this section. However, in many locales ATF agents may not be immediately available. The Department will be working with the other federal agencies to determine what if any other investigative alternatives are available. In the meantime, United States Attorneys' Offices should be working with state and local law enforcement to establish guidelines for handling these cases which will often arise in emergency situations, such as when a local officer responds to a domestic complaint and learns that a firearm is present and that one of the parties is prohibited under this statute.

Are you kidding me?!?! We can’t even form a committee to discuss city/county merger, much less come up with an actionable plan! 

Hmmm... what to do about tobacco...WTF?! Better driving test instructors, I’m at a loss here.

Taxes! Don’t even get me started. We pay higher sales tax than LA. Our dining out tax in the city, I think it’s almost 13% now. Try owning a business in the city limits. If you have employees you’ll be punished with a 1% employment tax. Finding people in government who agree how to spend it, impossible. Corruption here is rampant. 

Try getting dozens of municipalities to give up their police departments and the revenue they generate in tickets for their respective cities. Good luck. 

Try electing some conservatives to board of alderman (local government). We basically have a one party system here. 

Sorry for the rant. But, I think you need a reality check. Or, you need to be elected to make sure that all of your pie-in-the-sky ideas come to fruition.

Yes, no one wants to give up the taxes they are getting, but if the new system is fair the taxes are not getting lost just regulated.

3378,InfamousBrad,"I think they're all more complicated than you think.

**Homelessness:** Homelessness is almost never about joblessness. A high percentage of the homeless actually have jobs. Thanks to the attempts of the ""Housing First"" initiative, nearly all of the rest are signed up for SSI or SSDI, SNAP, and Section 8. No, most of our remaining homelessness is because our remaining homeless have issues that make no  landlord willing to house them: drug abuse, mental health, or criminal history.

**Gun Violence/Narcotics:** You're *mostly* right on this one: we're not going to beat the narcotics trade, and its related gun violence, until we tackle it from the demand side, and that means free, on-demand drug treatment. But even if you get someone clean, if the underlying mental or physical health problem that drove them to narcotics isn't addressed, they won't stay clean for long; we're not going to solve our narcotics problem without free universal health care. And even then, there are people with health problems that we don't know how to treat -- those people are still going to need, and will find, narcotics in order to function.

But also, drug dealers and people trying to rob drug dealers make up maybe a third of our gun violence problem. That's  not nothing! That's dozens  of lives a year that could be saved (if money were no issue). But you're not going to solve the rest without solving domestic violence. Or childhood lead poisoning, an endemic problem in this city.

**Unification:** Any idiot can see that dividing the region up into 89 municipalities and two (or more) counties is less than ideal. But the devil's in the details, and saying ""we need to fix this"" isn't a plan. Good luck coming up with a plan that doesn't offend so many people that it ends up facing near-universal opposition.

**Increased Regulation:** Good luck persuading the state legislature to let you. I absolutely agree with you, but I will also say this, though. You can argue very credibly that we are letting too many people drive who shouldn't be driving, but when people live and/or work in areas where life is impossible without a car, you taking away their license isn't going to stop them from driving. You can pass all the laws you want that require those people to never leave the house, to starve to death without a job, and you can flood the roads with cops who jail them if they don't, but they're not going to do it. They can't. And we can't afford to jail everybody who shouldn't be driving.

**Listen to the People:** If you think that the people of St. Louis are united in favor of *anything,*I think you're not just wrong, you're hilariously wrong. You might be able to get them to vaguely agree ""something should be done!"" but there's no actual thing that can be done that even half of them would agree to. Politics is exactly like the situation where you and your partner come home from work and say, ""we should eat something"" but everything that either of you suggests gets vetoed -- it's going to take forever to decide and  nobody's going to be happy with the outcome.",1582567501,finp36h

Guns/Narcotics - Absolutely 100% agree this is also based on what has worked elsewhere in the world, mental health facilities is a major key in both homelessness and violence, not just facilities but outreach. To me I would change who responds to what call, I would initially increase EMS responsibility adding mental health professionals to the teams, and also require mental health training to police too.

3412,InfamousBrad,"Here's the plan I'd support.

1. St. Louis City becomes the 90th municipality in St. Louis County. This is already a heavy lift all by itself, because (a) we'd need a state constitutional amendment to make it possible (the Great Divorce was done at the state level), and (b) we would need to have a really difficult discussion about sales-tax and property-tax reconciliation.  As complicated and as hard as this is, trying to do anything else at the same time is ridiculous.
2. St. Louis County is eventually going to *have to* adopt measures aimed at eventually reducing the number of municipalities, because way too many of those little postage-stamp municipalities just don't have the tax revenue to provide essential services. Start with the interim step of encouraging the creation, and expansion, of more co-ops for  police and fire, and the merging of failing school districts into adjacent school districts.
3. Once these things are done, we are going to need a cool-down period. That is already enough change that people are going to be freaking out about it; give them time to adjust, time to reconcile themselves to it. Then ...
4. Once the co-ops have shown successes (and any failures have been cleaned up and reformed), encourage municipal mergers along co-op lines. The ultimate goal should be simplifying municipal government down to fewer than a dozen municipalities, each one solvent because of a balanced mix of households and jobs.
5. Use cooperation and coordination agreements between those 11 or so municipalities and their school and fire and police districts to prepare people for the idea of merging first the fire and ambulance districts, then the school districts, then the police districts, into single county-wide services.
6. Then, and only then, consider (and probably still vote down) merging the whole county into a single municipal government.",1582581010,fiodak1

And for all that (in comparison to the fifties and sixties rates to now), poverty is worse, marriage rates are worse, crime rates are terrible, over a quarter of black pregnancy ends in abortion, mental health is worse, education is just as terrible (and combined with affirmative action and government student loans, we've created a debt trap for minority children), physical health is worse, and virtually every violent crime statistic has blacks holding the lead quite firmly. Mind you, I recognize these things as a consequence of the poverty they've been forced to endure, as well as legislations that have specifically damaged their communities. 

And now, the author of the crime control act of 96, infamous for the number of black families it utterly destroyed, is among Democrat front runners for the presidency (or was it the senate, he isn't sure).

When you understand that liberals line their pockets by robbing the poor and keeping them that way, it becomes pretty easy to understand why a bunch of rich assholes can stand up on that debate stage and try to convince everybody they're a victim. They'll pretend to be your friend while they pass on those charity bucks to their friends and their businesses.

""The white liberal is the worst enemy to America, and the worst enemy to the black man. Let me explain what I mean by the white liberal. In America there is no such thing as Democrat or Republican anymore. In America you have liberals and conservatives. The only people living in the past who think in terms of I’m a Democrat or Republican, is the American Negro. He’s the one that runs around bragging about party affiliation. He’s the one that sticks to the Democrat or sticks to the Republican. But white people are divided into two groups, liberals and conservative. The Democrats who are conservative, vote with the Republicans who are conservative. The Democrats who are liberal vote with the Republicans that are liberal. The white liberal aren’t white people who are for independence, who are moral and ethical in their thinking. They are just a faction of white people that are jockeying for power. The same as the white conservative is a faction of white people that are jockeying for power. They are fighting each other for power and prestige, and the one that is the football in the game is the Negro, 20 million black people. A political football, a political pawn, an economic football, and economic pawn. A social football, a social pawn. The liberal elements of whites are those who have perfected the art of selling themselves to the Negro as a friend of the Negro. Getting sympathy of the Negro, getting the allegiance of the Negro, and getting the mind of the Negro. Then the Negro sides with the white liberal, and the white liberal use the Negro against the white conservative. So that anything that the Negro does is never for his own good, never for his own advancement, never for his own progress, he’s only a pawn in the hands of the white liberal. The worst enemy that the Negro have is this white man that runs around here drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros, and calling himself a liberal, and it is following these white liberals that has perpetuated problems that Negros have. If the Negro wasn’t taken, tricked, or deceived by the white liberal then Negros would get together and solve our own problems. I only cite these things to show you that in America the history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be solved by the white man. The only way that our problem will be solved is when the black man wakes up, clean himself up, stand on his own feet and stop begging the white man, and take immediate steps to do for ourselves the things that we have been waiting on the white man to do for us. Once we do for self then we will be able to solve our own problems’ ""The white conservatives aren't friends of the Negro either, but they at least don't try to hide it. They are like wolves; they show their teeth in a snarl that keeps the Negro always aware of where he stands with them. But the white liberals are foxes, who also show their teeth to the Negro but pretend that they are smiling. The white liberals are more dangerous than the conservatives; they lure the Negro, and as the Negro runs from the growling wolf, he flees into the open jaws of the ""smiling"" fox. One is the wolf, the other is a fox. No matter what, they’ll both eat you."" - **Malcolm X**",1582681562,fisbbj1

You can call me a vulture all you like, but libertarian philosophy lines up pretty well with what Malcolm X constantly preached. Democrats have used welfare programs of all sorts to systematically destroy the black family unit and enslave their votes to the party, just as Malcolm X predicted. Libertarian philosophy agrees completely with Malcolm's belief in personal responsibility. And as the black community wises up to the liberal game, liberals seek to grant citizenship to a swath of illegal immigrants in order to import a whole new minority voting block to enslave.

I think decades of extreme poverty and the complete dissolution of black culture, despite unerringly giving over 90% of their votes to liberals for decades, proves exactly who the vultures actually are.",1582700736,fit1oi9

Toward the end of the year, you will get the Personal Property Tax Bill, which is due by the end of the year.  They will send the form telling you how much you owe, and they base the value (and therefore the tax) on the make/mode/year of the vehicle (you don't have to calculate the taxes yourself or anything).

Your registration and tags are a totally separate process.  The fee is set (I think) based on the class of plates and nothing to do with the vehicle value.  This fee is much lower than in states that combine the registraion and taxes.

3586,sullivan80,"Assuming you will be following 44 here is what I’d suggest - though I have no idea how long you want to spend here.

St Louis is an underrated american city. If you only explore one region of Missouri I’d suggest focusing your efforts there. There is so much to see and do. The obvious thing is the arch. City museum as others have pointed out is AWESOME. Don Robinson State Park is just outside of STL and has great nature hikes if you are looking for that. There is also the Missouri Botanical Garden in STL which is neat. Missouri is known for caves - Onandaga is not far off 44 west of STL. 

Missouri has a TON of great hiking with the best generally south of the Missouri River. Rock Bridge in Columbia is a notable exception. If you are OK with taking some time and going out of the way I’d suggest the cluster of state parks around Farmington - Taum Sauk, Elephant Rocks, Johnson Shut Ins, Hawn, Baker, and some other areas. 

If you are into wineries Missouri has a lot of those as well but 44 only clips the edge of “wine country”. Most wineries are in the hills surrounding the Missouri River. 

There isn’t really a ton to suggest between STL and SWMO. If you don’t get your fill of Missouri from STL and the items above you could spend a day or two in Springfield, Branson or the Joplin area. Branson is touristy, a lot like Gatlinburg, TN. Silver Dollar City is a GREAT theme park. Springfield has some nice parks and trails, downtown is pretty cool, and the Bass Pro/Aquarium is impressive.

Near the state line you could spend a day or so in the Joplin/Carthage area. Not a ton to do there but Carthage in particular is a nice small town with victorian homes, a neat square and courthouse, a few good art galleries and boutique shops and coffee shop, restaurants. A couple museums as well. The mineral museum (Joplin) has some giant crystals on display. Wildcat Glades Nature Center and Grand Falls are nice nature areas. George Washington Carver Natl Monument is just outside Joplin and is very much worth a stop. Nice museum and a great hiking trail.

Personally I think Missouri has a lot to offer but if you just cruise down I44 your impression will be billboards, porn shops, cigarette and fireworks outlets.

3660,oldbastardbob,"Here's my chance to provide another of my unpopular opinions.

Get athletics out of schools.  Make them all club teams, and then the clubs can run their teams any way they wish, or run them according to national standards such as those provided by USAV or USSF, for example.

Then, the cost of these programs is borne by participants and community support, not the tax dollars I have no choice but to pay.  

Want to improve education, which is what schools are there for in the first place?  Stop spending so much money on high school sports.  Parents way over-hype high school and middle school kids and there is a huge amount of favoritism, politics, and plain bullshit associated.  

Worried about scholarships?  Many college coaches in sports other that football don't even recruit high schools any more.  Example?  John Cook at Nebraska, one of the nations most successful Volleyball programs, recruits from USAV tournaments and club teams.

When you look at our kids academic performance compared to the rest of the world, we lag pretty far behind.  Those other countries do sports the way I propose.  Club teams outside of schools.  And yes, a club can still chose to bench a player due to grades or bad behavior, just like schools do now (or should be doing now).

I don't hold much hope that this will happen as in America we can't seem to envision anything except how we have always done things.  We suffer from too much ego in the world and will find all kinds of rationalization for doing things merely because ""that's just the way we do it here.""

Think of the advantages for everyone when the high school sports star doesn't get advantages in the classroom because we have a playoff game coming up on Friday.  Less drama among teachers, less problems with parents and their ""you're ruining Johnny's scholarship chances,"" less hazing, more focus on teaching and education, less money going to fund athletics and more for books and retaining better teachers.

Before anybody gets all defensive and claims I know nothing.  I raised two kids who played sports at the club level as kids, and then went on to play in middle and high school.  My daughter played volleyball for 6 years of middle and high school and also played USAV volleyball.  Trust me, the level of competition in USAV is higher than high school, and the coaches are trained and know the sport.  Her high school coach was a woman with a PE degree who never played volleyball, was a softball player in college, and didn't know the sport very well.  Here's a great quote from the parent of one of her high school team mates parents, ""I don't care if they lose every game as long as my daughter starts!""  I found that a prevalent attitude among parents, it was about status.  In the club environment it's about player development and competition, not about daddy being the coaches insurance man.

My son played baseball since age 6.  Played on a youth team that made the state tournament pretty much every year from age 11 through 13.  Started on the high school team as a freshman and his senior year the team made the state final four.  Also played on summer leagues during high school.  I saw just as much advancement of the players, and in many cases more, during the league seasons.  I have to admit that high school baseball in Missouri is at a disadvantage because the weather in March and April here can suck.

They are both adults now and I think either would tell you that the club or league teams were as much or more fun and in most cases more challenging and rewarding. 

This is such a big leap for the view of youth sports in America that I don't expect much support for the idea, but I really think it would be a better use of school resources.  

And on the topic of resources, how many communities like mine are locked into some sort of facilities race with everyone else in their area.  We are now looking at spending hundreds of thousands on artificial turf for the football field.  Not kidding, the school district in a town with 14,000 population is going to turf the football field.  Of course, then the soccer team will need turf, and of course, the baseball infield.  This is where tax increases come from.  We already have a football stadium that seats 2000 people.  Now we need turf because apparently no one these days knows how to grow grass, in a farm community btw.

With club teams we would still have Friday night football games in small towns everywhere.  Heck, those teams might even still be coached by teachers from the local schools, but they would be their own entities, funded by ticket sales, donations, and parents.

But like I said, this would be a whole scale change in the way Americans view youth sports.  It's funny how we get behind club or city league teams when they are children, but just accept that once they hit a certain age, school athletics is the way to go.  And most every parent who has raised high school athletes will tell you that they took it way too seriously when their kid was playing.  Once they graduate and grow up, the view changes.",1582814619,fix7ouo

3731,AceSpades15,"I want to clear up some misconceptions that I'm seeing here that this constitutional amendment would automatically prevent girls from playing against transgender individuals. It doesn't.

First, the Missouri High School Activites Association (MSHSAA) already has pretty clear and explicit policy when it comes to transgender athlete participation to ensure fairness and equity in high school sports. You can read the full policy [here](https://www.mshsaa.org/resources/pdf/Official%20Handbook.pdf) (on page 140), but here are a few highlights:

* While trans male (female to male) students can participate in male sports before beginning or undergoing hormone therapy, trans female (male to female) students CANNOT engage in female sports until they have started hormone therapy. 
* Similarly, a trans male student CANNOT engage in female sports any longer once they have started hormone treatment. 
* This doesn’t apply to activities like Speech and Debate, Theatre, Scholar Bowl, Music because those are coed and non-gendered. (Page 86)
* This policy was revised in 2019, but it’s been on the books since 2012.

These provisions exist specifically to prevent anyone with too much testosterone, natural or otherwise, from competing in girls sports, protecting the integrity of competition.

The bill sponsor, Robert Ross, has said the bill is about making sure female athletes do not have to unfairly compete against male athletes, which I think most everyone here agrees with. Sexual dimorphism is a thing and male athletes, especially at that age, can have some significant advantages over female athletes.

But Ross' measure in the House could actually ensure trans male students who have already transitioned by taking testosterone via hormone therapy would play in girls sports. Imagine: an 18-year-old, bearded, 6’2”, 200-pound, muscle-bound trans male with ""F"" on their birth certificate next to sex, would be forced to play a sport against girls who are a head shorter and a buck lighter than him. Is that fair? 

The biggest problem with legislation like this is that there's no nuance, no consideration of unintended consequences or possibilities. If you look at the stories of trans women completely outmatching women athletes, none of them have happened in Missouri. 

In large part because MSHSAA has already addressed this issue fairly effectively. It allows protects the integrity of women's and girls' competition while also providing a means to ensure the rights of transgender athletes are respected. And proof of trans status requires a lot more than just saying, ""Hey this is how I identify."" They need to provide medical records and documentation that shows they're actively transitioning. MSHSAA's policy is a win-win. So why is Ross trying to put this bill in the constitution?

All this legislation does is rile up a base that gets indignant reading articles like this one, and it's why ""common sense"" solutions, usually don't work when the solution to the problem needs more consideration, thought and attention detail. Ross' measure is purely political.",1582835037,fiy9a41

If, for instance, it turns out that all the record setting females in high school sports are M to F trans women in 10 years then probably everyone would agree that there should be two different teams based on gender at birth but if that's not the case and trans women's accomplishments in girl's sports turn out to be negligible or statistically unremarkable from cis gender women's accomplishments then we will know there is no competitive advantage. Right now, I think we are mostly speculating on either side of the opinion even if some studies say there is no advantage after hormone replacement therapy.  We just don't have a very big sample size at this point. One thing is certain: at the elite level, it seems, men are better than women at most sports; however, the best pro woman is generally only marginally worse than the average pro man.

Many of the club teams also have differing levels of play.  In USAV there are Gold, Silver, and Bronze level teams, so a given club may have it's top dogs on the gold level team and others playing in silver level tournaments.  As kids improve, they can have a chance to move up to a higher level.  Others may just wish to play and enjoy the level they are at.  Very similar to varsity and jv in schools now.

Also, many poorer communities can't afford school sports now.  Many may have basketball and that's it, or just one sport each in fall, winter, and spring.  Not sure there would be much difference than what we do now.

However, in my experience the clubs run fund raisers and get local businesses to sponsor them which allows for clubs to offer ""scholarships"" for kids who can't afford to play.

From what I have seen, a poor kid that's a good athlete will be in demand by those clubs that are in it to win, so there's not much danger of a great athlete not being asked to be on a team.

Those that will suffer is the kid with no talent.  Again, some clubs account for that by having recreational leagues and competitive leagues.

And I am quite sure there will be rich kid teams from wealth neighborhoods who will follow the pay to play thing.  I don't think that guarantees success, however, as that's somewhat the beauty of sports.  

A well coached, disciplined team that has developed skills among all their players and knows how to play the game well will beat a bunch of spoiled kids with a couple of all-stars and helicopter parents most times.

In my experience, DEET spray does not work. They still attach if you walk by. I have some elastic cuffs I wear that overlap my socks and pants, and keep my shirt tucked in. I use permethrin liberally on pants, cuffs, and boots. Permethrin outright kills ticks on your clothes, and so far appears to be safe for mammals.  Ticks are much easier to see against light-colored (e.g. khaki) pants. I also carry a $1 scrub brush for seed ticks - it’s much easier to brush them off than try to pick them off individually. Duct tape also works but I would end up going through a lot of that. When I combine these methods with some vigilance, I rarely get attached ticks despite being in tick-dense areas.

Avoiding dense brushy places will help, of course. Poultry should help some by eating ticks, but also discouraging deer in your area - they are tick factories. If you’re OK with it, you can hunt them in the fall/winter, or find some other way to keep them away (fences, dogs, etc.).

Minimizing them is pretty straightforward. We didn't have trails to walk on, so we constantly brushed up against plants and would end the day with dozens of ticks. If you are hiking a well worn trail that is wide enough, you probably won't get any. In a normal yard with low grass you probably won't get any. Best practice is ample bug spray, pants if possible, and checking yourself regularly *before* the end of the day. They are looking to find a dark, steamy crevice, so at first they are just crawling up your leg and are easy to pick off. If you have tall socks on, they will move down toward your ankles and bite. In some ways sandals are nice because you can catch them easily, but then chiggerd become an issue.

And what's this bullshit where a tick bite can make you allergic to meat? I met a guy in a bar that has to keep an epi pen on him after being hospitalized twice because he didn't realize he was allergic to red meat, and they traced it back to a tick bite.

I've got the kind of chemical bug spray that comes with a warning label saying it can't be used by pets, small children, or pregnant women. The ticks don't give a fuck. If I lit myself on fire and walked through 3 feet of a meadow WHILE ON FIRE I guarantee those fucking asshole ticks would be trying to eat me anyway.

3852,frigoffmrlahey,in the cities and towns pretty much not really too many ticks you probably won't get any there. but if you're walking through the woods or overgrown fields you're getting ticks more than likely. tuck your pants into your boots and tuck your shirt in and that will keep like 98% of ticks off you in the woods. When I was young and lived on 90 acres and was exploring it all the time I'd get tons of ticks on me from time to time. I'm pretty sure they wait on the ends of branches and the tops of tall grass hoping you'll walk through and brush them onto you so if you take that in consideration you can majorly cut that down. If you get chickens you can essentially guarantee you won't have ticks in your yard if you let the roam.,1582908642,fj0vyje

The State of Missouri does not recognize any type of foreign driver's license. It means nothing. You will need to complete both a written test and a driving test. Neither of these two things is hard at all so don't worry about it. However, considering you're from another country I would go to a testing center or check the website and get a copy of the Missouri driver's handbook and give it a read through. Little things like how far behind a school bus you're supposed to stop is the kind of thing you will find on your test.

If I remember correctly you need to schedule the test writing time and also schedule a separate driving test. Typically this wouldn't be on the same day.

Bring a shit ton of documents with you. The ones you listed are definitely required I believe. Bring your passport as well. If you're not a permanent lawful resident (green card) then you will have to renew your license every year.",1583084405,fj71awn

He passed with a 99% and the point he missed was pointing out the defrost on his car). After that while waiting for your AOS, you can get up to three 60 day extension temporary permits (you'll have no issue with these if you get pulled over like my husband did. Officer shouldn't be confused by it). You should be able to renew after your EAD shows up, but my husband had some issues with that so may they were just dumb at the DMV. Their system was apparently asking for his green card as well so the actual license got held up in Jefferson City and I had to call the Department of Revenue and yell at them. He didn't have any real issues renewing once he had his green card outside of gathering the documents for the REAL id thing.

I have just been directing all my questions to the Department of Revenue through email since their website is useless when it comes to figuring out what is needed for foreigners.

3949,alaskanjackal,"The reason the Ozarks feel “close to” but not really Southern is that the Ozarks actually have cultural and ancestral/settlement ties with _Appalachia_.

Appalachia is a division of the South but distinct from the Deep South.

There’s a lot of cultural similarity to the hills and hollers around my neck of the woods (SW MO) to large swaths of Tennessee/Kentucky/West Virginia, which are in the same boat of technically being part of the South but definitely having a different feel.

A book called American Nations was published several years ago by Colin Woodward that analyzes what he terms the 11 different “Nations” that exist within the US. A good overview and collection of maps is here: http://www.textbooksfree.org/American%20nations.htm

I might argue that his “Deep South” line ought to be bumped northward a couple of counties to incorporate the Bootheel and the extreme southern tip of Illinois (Cairo), and I might also want to split Yankeedom into eastern and western sections (the Rust Belt/industrial Midwest has a decidedly different culture from New England/Boston), but I mostly agree with his main premise.

My personal view is that ""Little Dixie"" was the counties of Boone, Callaway, Chariton, Clay, Howard, Lafayette, and Saline.  The area of big plantation style farms and high slave ownership. This area was settled by wealthy families from the east to grow hemp and tobacco.

But to the point of this post, the ""Ozark"" state would certainly have some interesting politics as this area seems to be the home to the biggest partying hippies I ever knew growing up, and has for years been the home to some of the poorest populations in Missouri. Yet this area only elects hard core Bible Thumpers as their leaders.  And, of course, I believe the Ozarks also harbor a significant portion of America's right-wing militias along with plenty of KKK members.

If you're a registered voter, you can vote in either party's primary next Tuesday, but only in one party's. You do not have to be a registered member of that party, and picking that party's ballot next Tuesday does not make you a member of that party from then on.

The rules are slightly different for Democrats and Republicans.

**Democrats:**

There will be 22 candidates on the ballot. Yes, really. (It's easy to get onto the Missouri ballot and effectively impossible to get off of it.)

If the candidate you vote for gets less than 15% of the state-wide vote, your votes will be discarded.

68 delegates will be allocated among the candidates that did get at least 15%, proportionally to the number of people who voted for each one.

Missouri will also send 10 super-delegates to the convention, picked by party members at the state Democratic convention. These delegates can't vote unless nobody gets 50%+1 delegates on the first ballot. If there is a second ballot (and there probably will be, if you believe 538), both pledged delegates and super-delegates will be able to change their vote to whichever candidate they personally want to vote for.

**Republicans:**

There will be 5 candidates on the ballot.

If any one of those candidates gets 50%+1 votes, the remaining votes will be discarded and that candidate will get all 54 delegates. Otherwise, they will be allocated proportionally. (There is no viability rule *per se,* but if somebody gets less than 1% of the vote, that will round down to zero delegates.)",1583177143,fjant7w

Do we have a problem with voter fraud in Missouri elections?  From my understanding the answer to that is ""no.""

I believe this is simply the Republican National Committee telling their lackeys that Republicans do better in elections with low voter turn-out, so whatever they can do to make it more difficult to vote will favor conservative politicians.

Here's a thought.  If photo id's are going to be required to vote, then will the state not be required to make them free?  Otherwise, would having to pay the state for an id in order to be eligible to vote amount to a modern poll tax?

Obviously those of us who have drivers licenses are all good, but I am quite sure there are Missourians with no drivers license out there, who have no student id with a picture, and whose social security card may be their only form of id.  

If this is not a voter suppression measure, then where is the corresponding effort to provide free voter id's to Missourians who want them, and the outreach to make sure they get them?  Since it is the state changing the rules, I would like to think it would be found that it is then the states responsibility to remedy any harm caused by those rule changes.

Silly idea, I know.  That the state would be required to remedy any harm caused by their political actions.

My personal deduction here is that this is simply a voter suppression measure that appeals to Trump supporters who are continuously told that we have hundreds of thousands of people voting illegally.  Of course, they have no proof of this happening on a large scale and the most likely election fraud happening on a grand scale is violation of campaign finance laws by politicians, which happens to be much more prevalent by conservatives.

Do you not share that opinion?  That if you change the rules, and legal voters are disenfranchised, it is the responsibility of the state, who changed the rules, to remedy that situation.

Because if you don't, it makes it clear that you simply support the voter suppression aspects of this new rule.

If you are a true patriot, you would want to see the government doing everything it can to make sure all of it's eligible citizens can vote in every election, right?  

It is a democratic republic after all, and a functioning democracy requires voters to vote, so should voter encouragement and making voting as easy as possible be the number one goal, as opposed to little rules here and there that chip away at the voters that one or the other party doesn't want at the polls?

I'm not saying photo id's are a bad idea.  Keep in mind how easy it is to get fake id's of course.

What I am saying is that the state should be required to provide outreach to anyone who is going to be affected to help them make sure they have proper id, and it should be free to the voter.

I have no problem with voter id, but the state is changing the rules and should be required to remedy any harm it causes to legal voters.

Also, you may think it's ok to ""ostrich size"" voters who are too ignorant or poor to get a photo id before the election this fall, but we decided a long time ago in America that everyone gets to vote, regardless of ignorance, poverty, race, religion, or party affiliation.

So the question to be debated here is whether we think the state should be doing everything it can to encourage voting and make it as easy as possible.  Or should the party in control of the state government be able to tweak the rules of voting in ways their political scientists and consultants tell them will favor them in the next election?

The fear of illegals voting in mass numbers and influencing elections is simply another tactic by Republicans to suppress poor and minority voters.  Appears that it is working also, in spite of the fact that there is no evidence of that happening.

So, how will it go over when the conservative stranglehold on government is gone and liberals start coming up with ways to suppress the right-wing vote?  Just little things that make it more difficult with great sounding rationalizations.  

Will that be ok?

Tldr the argument against voter id laws is the reality that the more effort required to vote the less people will. With required IDs, politicians can then underfund/understaff/completely shut down DMVs in certain areas where they want less people to vote. 

If a low income person who walks or takes a bus to work over 40 hours a week has to find their paperwork (which may not be available to them) and travel without a car to and wait at the DMV during hours that they need to be at work and pay a fee to obtain their ID...

1. A person commits in-person voter fraud and tilts the scale for one candidate.

4145,InfamousBrad,"Also, the argument that it's easy to get a photo ID fails when you understand that there are many voters, especially rural people and people of color, who were born in places that didn't routinely issue birth certificates. Americans born overseas in local hospitals not only might not have birth certificates, but it might cost tens of thousands of dollars to send lawyers to that country to track down the medical personnel who were present for the birth and certify it. Poor Americans who were born in other states might be able to get a certified copy of their birth certificate mailed to them, but only after paying enough fees that it might make the difference between whether they have enough gas in the car to make it to work this week or not.

The irrefutable fact is that requiring a certified photo ID to vote will absolutely remove the right to vote from some Americans. And despite several multi-million dollar research efforts, Republicans have yet to turn up proof that even one tiny local election, anywhere in America, has ever had its outcome changed by in-person voting by people who couldn't legally vote. If you're asking for proof that it didn't happen, I'd say the fact that Republican prosecuting attorneys have launched multiple large, well funded investigations that all came up blank is that proof.",1583264653,fje3ql2

Since then, both of her parents have passed on.

When Missouri made its first attempt to pass a voter ID law, she asked a lawyer what it would take to document her birth so she could get one. All the lawyer could come up with is that he might be able to get a judge to order the issuance of one if lawyers traveled from the US to that hospital and either found a record of the birth or, failing that, found at least one surviving hospital worker who was present for the birth, remembered it, and was willing to swear under oath that the American couple in these family photos did give birth to a child, in this person's presence, on or around that time. The lawyer wanted a $2,000 retainer and warned that all time and travel costs could exceed $10,000 before it even got put in front of a judge, with no guarantee that a judge would recognize the affidavits.

Needless to say, my friend will never have a RealID certified driver's license.

Obamacare stays and is improved upon. RBG is replaced by a liberal justice, not a conservative one. No more neoconservatives pushing for war with Iran. No more Trump pardoning the excuses of war criminals and despots around the world. 

All the Democrats support science. They support fighting against global warming, and want to rejoin the Paris Agreement. They want to resume diplomacy around the world.

Not an issue. The poll worker just typed my name into her tablet and updated it on the spot. 

Anyone registered in LA county can vote in any polling place. The ballots they give you are blank sheets of paper. You feed them into a printer set up with a tablet, and it loads the relevant elections for your precinct. You make your selections on the screen, it gives you a confirmation screen, and if that looks Ok, it prints your results on the actual ballot. You then review the physical paper ballot, and if all that looks good, the machine takes the ballot back and you’re done. 

All that might sound a little complicated, and I was skeptical when I found out that we switched away from traditional paper ballots you mark with a pen, but the whole process took me all of about three minutes once I got through the line to check in.

Big Spring is one of the largest springs in the United States and the world.  An enormous first magnitude spring, it rises at the base of a bluff on the west side of the Current River valley in the Missouri Ozarks.  Located about four miles downstream from Van Buren, it is within the boundaries of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, and its visitor facilities are managed by the National Park Service.  It is a contributing resource to Big Spring Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.The average flow of 470 cubic feet (13,000 L) of water per second  from Big Spring constitutes the second largest tributary of the Current River.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

The term originally meant an uncouth yokel from the hills or rural areas all the way back to the 19th century. This term predominated the South when Indiana decided that they would call themselves Hoosiers. There are some stories that suggest interactions with people from Indiana may have been a reason that the term has kept its derogatory meaning here while most of the rest of the nation has mainly moved onto the term just meaning people from Indiana without any malice. The two stories that are suggested as the reason it is still an insult here are a 1930's' strike at AB in which non-union workers were brought in from Indiana to take the place of the striking workers and then when a strike at an Indiana auto plant and the subsequent opening of the Fenton Chrysler plant in the 1970s meant that a lot of people from Indiana moved to the then rural areas around the plant and ""stole' the new jobs from the locals.

So far...I'm not even sure that's all of the bills at this point. I have the bills right here that have come in.

4651,infinity_theory,"I'm a bit late to the party, but here's how I avoid ticks: the way ticks get on you is they hang out on things you might brush against. When you brush on their grass or whatever, they grab on with their little legs. I wear the shortest shorts I can get away with and shave my legs before I hike. Not having the fabric of long pants and not having a bunch of hair makes it a lot harder for them to grab ahold of you. It puts you at risk of scratches, so that's something to think about. I spent most of my summers as a kid neck-deep in blackberry brambles, so scratches are nothing to me. I consistently get far fewer ticks than my husband, who wears baggy shorts and doesn't shave. The ones that do get on me I usually catch on my shoes or crawling on my legs before they get a chance to bite.",1583553591,fjpkxss

4691,DarthWindows,"Our government does not run efficiently by design. Our system is in place to keep a large part of the population desperate and hungry and never able to fight back. I could see why you might think expanding social programs might not be a good idea. However, when Bernie Sanders is elected, our goal is not to seize the means of production. We simply mean to ensure that everyone pays their fair share. So we can expand social programs such as social security, medicare, SNAP benefits,.Instead of going to war for no reason and funneling money to the health insurance companies. The current system is unsustainable and we need to do something quickly. I know a lot of people like to treat politics like it's a game. But this is life or death for a lot of us out here and it's not a game.

The problems with Venezuela's government cannot happen here because of the checks and balances that exist. However, under the Trump presidency we have seen a lot of those checks go away. Our movement is looking to correct that.

We're looking to even the scales as they were 75-50 years ago, pre-nixon. But this time with actuall equality and equity in mind. I know many white people don't want to accept that we have serious racial issues in this country but there are. An entire population of people have been completely disenfranchised. So in our economic plan we hope to enrich communities of color to lift them up, because we have spent 400 years ensuring their demise. 

You're a smart person with an internet connection. If you look in the correct places you can find out more about the racial and economic injustices facing this country and you may find that a vote for Bernie Sanders is right for you. Because when we win, we're not going to gloat, we're not going to be assholes, we're going to give you affordable medical care, opportunity to go to college and pursue your happiness, clean air and water, safe roads, good jobs.

Bernie's plan, in addition to wealth taxes, includes a payroll tax. Businesses with over 1 million dollars in payroll would pay 7.5 percent. Individuals would pay 4 percent on income over 29,000. Considering that the average person pays 10% of their income (or so) just on premiums, that's a huge savings for the average person AND small businesses. 4% of your income helps guarantee ""free"" healthcare for you and everyone else. No more deductible. No co-pays. Free at point of service, which is absolutely how healthcare should be.

Sorry, no. Have you consulted the  [Missouri Constitution](http://www.moga.mo.gov/MoStatutes/ConstHTML/A010231.html) recently:

&gt;That the right of every citizen to keep and bear arms, ammunition, and accessories typical to the normal function of such arms, in defense of his home, person, family and property, or when lawfully summoned in aid of the civil power, shall not be questioned. The rights guaranteed by this section shall be unalienable. Any restriction on these rights shall be subject to strict scrutiny and the state of Missouri shall be obligated to uphold these rights and shall under no circumstances decline to protect against their infringement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the general assembly from enacting general laws which limit the rights of convicted violent felons or those adjudicated by a court to be a danger to self or others as result of a mental disorder or mental infirmity.

You're not going to get much by strict scrutiny. Certainly not Bernie's proposals.

4922,sidekickman,"It may seem an asinine idea - but it has already been done. If anything, the US is behind the ball pretty badly on this one. Let's look at Canada, who has a fairly moderate single payer system:

Their government has very little coverage for oral health. While their system is still single payer, many people still acquire private dental insurance to supplement the publicly funded care. In fact, about a third of Canada's healthcare spending is still in the private sector. And yet, the cost of getting treatment is still drastically cheaper than the cost of treatment in the United States.

**So, here's why that is:**

Currently, I pay my insurance company premiums. Then, when I need treatment, my insurance company will pay my healthcare provider for treatment. The problem is that insurance companies will engage in incredibly nefarious manipulation of treatment costs to drive up profit and to sabotage other insurance company's ability to provide coverage. For instance, the absurdly inflated cost of medications like insulin in the United States is a result of this malicious price setting. Insurance companies are selling a product with inelastic demand - they can charge you whatever they want for your life if there's sufficient cooperation on the supply side.

**Now, let's look at how single payer systems mitigate this problem:**

*Everyone* pays for this coverage, and the government pays the provider. Because everyone shares the same payment plan, the **price-setting power of the manufacturer is drastically reduced.** It also dissolves the malicious price-fixing paradigm that private healthcare has set up with drug manufacturers around common treatments. Again, insulin is a really good example of how corrupt this has become in the USA.

The key difference is that the government has strong footing and clear motivation to drive healthcare costs down, while your insurance company doesn't. It isn't the end of private coverage. **A lot of single payer countries still have private supplemental care plans if you're dissatisfied with the public option. Dental insurance in Canada, for instance.**

It's a complicated issue, but the top level is still very straightforward. Pick a country with a high quality of living for it's citizens, and see where it falls on [this map.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care)",1583788878,fk1xkku

Unless your goal is to cultivate, which OP hasnt stated, then the idea that being able to possess your illegally purchased weed, legally in the state isnt worth the cost of the med card IMO. 

Those legal protections that you speak of are still a bit of gray area. There hasnt been direction given by the Attorney general to police on illegally obtained marijuana and med card holders. Several people have been involved in legal hold ups and have spent nights in jail even though they had legal protection to posses. The protections that you speak, IMO, arent there at the moment. 

I personally feel like spending the $$ to obtain a card when the advantages are only marginal at this point is foolish. I have my med card and smoke, but never needed to the card to smoke in my home.

You CAN buy in state from a caregiver , also having a medical card HERE allows you to get temp ones (like from Oklahoma) which will allow you to purchase medications from there. Not an opinion, a FACT.

2.
The legal protections I speak of are a hell of a lot more valid than for those without a medical card.
Who are subject to the archaic laws in Missouri with regards to marijuana. And that’s not an opinion that’s a FACT.


If even the piece of mind that you probably won’t have Legal issues in regards to possession with a medical card, have the option for a caregiver or using it as a way to get a temp out of state medical card, or that you can cultivate (if choosing to do so) isn’t worth  the 50-150 bucks for you, than that’s your opinion. 

but seeing as you DO have your medical card , I still think it’s incorrect to tell someone not to get it

Not as easy as you are making it out to be since OP would need someone else to obtain a caregiver license. Of which OP has already stated that they cannot find a doctor in their area to prescribe. 

I agree there are some legal protections but to me they arent worth the money at this point. There arent statewide rules at this point coming down from the AG office instructing police depts on how to handle some of these cases. Individuals have been arrested and have spent nights in jail. MMJ has been confiscated and not returned. A loss of both time and money and then dealing with legal proceedings. These protections that you speak of are more a false since of security. The larger cities in MO, KC, STL, Columbia, and Springfield decriminalized MJ years ago and is now only a $25 ticket. The protections that you mention are there on paper but in a real world where direction from the top has not been given, its simply not there at this point. 

As someone that has their card, and friends and colleagues that also have theirs, the number one complaint that is talked about is that they wish they waited as the market will not be available for some time. Most feel like they were scammed. We basically paid for a card to be able to do what we've always done. Or have the opportunity to drive out of state to OK to purchase and maybe catch a Thunder game.

* The primary matters just as much in states that will vote for Trump in the general, because the primary works totally differently.
* The primary isn't winner-takes-all for each state. Instead, the delegates are awarded proportionally, so every vote in every state counts.
* Seventeen-year-olds can vote in the primary in most states if they turn 18 before the general election in November.
* There are enormous policy differences between the two front-runners, Biden and Sanders:
   * They are opposite on marijuana policy - Biden against legalization and Sanders for it.
   * Sanders proposes far more change in areas such as health care and minimum wage, whereas Biden is very moderate.
   * The 52% tax on everyone by Sanders meme floating around is a complete fabrication. Only the very highest income bracket would pay anything like that large a tax, and that is still far less than it was 40 years ago.
   * There is a case to be made for either candidate in terms of electibility, but I actually think Sanders more likely to beat Trump. I have concerns about Biden's speaking ability recently and how he would fare in a debate, and many voters are seeing Sanders as more of a populist rather than a scary socialist, so I think Sanders will have more swing support than he is given credit for. Many polls show them as very similar vs. Trump (as in: close either way).

&gt; Televangelist Jim Bakker Sued Over Fake Coronavirus Treatment The Missouri attorney general asked a judge to block the sale of Bakker&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Silver Solution.&amp;quot; The FDA and FTC warned seven companies to stop hawking so-called treatments for the coronavirus.

&gt; Televangelist Jim Bakker held up a blue and silver bottle, gazing intently at the label, as he questioned the woman sitting next to him.

&gt; In addition to The Jim Bakker Show, the FDA sent warnings on Monday to six other companies that were selling colloidal silver, teas, tinctures or essential oils as treatments for the coronavirus.

We know we have no cure or many tests to confirm what is/isn't serious. The best we can do is make sure as few people as possible get it. If we catch it early it won't be AS bad, no. But if we keep pretending it's not a big deal it's going to grow into one.

(B) Charge within a disaster area an exces- sive price for any necessity; or
(C) Charge any person an excessive price for any necessity which the seller has reason to know is likely to be provided to consumers within a disaster area.

Rights are largely city specific, but [here's](https://www.aclu-mo.org/en/lgbt-mo-know-your-rights) what the ACLU says for MO. Culturally it's very hit or miss, but has improved massively in the past five years. A lot of people are out, and there's not much in the way of public hate that I've seen, but there's a long way to go. I think a majority of people in St. Louis are at the stage of either ""I don't like it but I'm not going to make a stink about it in public"" viewpoint, or well meaning but kinda ignorant. Rural areas are more conservative for sure, but not as bad as the Bible Belt by a long shot.

5769,missouriman777,"Let's address this point by point.

First off, the statistics show that there's a correlation between higher gun ownership/permissive gun laws and lower gun crime.

Currently, there are 393 million guns in the US, according to the Small Arms Survey. This is way up and is the result of a continuing increase in civilian gun ownership in the past 50 years. Gun violence peaked in 1993 and then sharply declined by ~49%. That's 18,253 gun homicides in 1993, down to 11,101 gun homicides in 2011, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics study. That same study found that nonfatal firearms offenses dropped from 1,500,000 in 1993, to 467,300 in 2011.

Missouri legalized concealed carry in 2003, after being illegal for about 150 years. Many other states legalized concealed carry and instituted shall-issue permitting between 1992 and 2011. Some examples are Ohio, Indiana, Washington, Iowa, Wisconsin and Alabama. According to city-data.com, after concealed carry was legalized in Ohio in 2004, Cleveland experienced 109 homicides in 2005, and most of the following years had less homicides, including 75 in 2006 and 74 in 2011. That's a pretty sharp decrease. In fact, the largest increase in homicides in Cleveland was 135 homicides in 2016, and the most likely cause is due to the Michael Brown shooting in 2014. Homicides weren't even officially tallied in Cleveland in 2015. Homicides in Cleveland dropped sharply again in 2017 and 2018, with 107 and 86, respectively. It is to be noted that, during this crime period, Ohio also eliminated restrictions on magazine capacity.

Second, even where there's no correlation between higher gun ownership and lower gun crime rates, there's evidence to suggest that lower gun ownership rates and stricter gun regulations don't result in lower gun crime rates. Arkansas and California are diametrically opposed when it comes to gun ownership (57.9% vs. 20.1% of the 2015 population owned at least one gun in 2015, respectively) and gun laws, but gun homicide rates (3.7 per 100,000 vs. 3.3 per 100,000, respectively) are almost exactly the same, the sources being US Census Bureau estimates and the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics.

Third, according to a 1993 CDC study and several studies by Kleck and Gertz, self-defense with firearms is *extremely* common, with between 2.1 and 2.4 million defensive gun uses (DGUs) per year. In fact, most DGUs, at least 99% of them, do *not* involve the discharging of a firearm. Most respondents stated they either brandished the firearm, verbally referred to it, or brandished *and* aimed it at their attacker. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics, there are ~400,000 offenses involving firearms annually in the United States. This includes nonviolent offenses like unlicensed carry and straw purchases, which make up for a *lot* of firearms offenses. If guns are supposed to be some scary thing that only criminals use, why do the statistics show that guns are used several times more often in self-defense than to commit offenses, including nonviolent offenses?

Fourth, there's been many documented cases of foreign guns being shipped into ports like Oakland, New York, San Diego, etc., to be sold by underground dealers to gang members. California and New York have some of the most stringent gun regulations in the nation, and US Customs are known for enforcing some of the most efficient border security operations in the world. If they can't stop illegal guns, I don't think you would want to subscribe to the old idiom of ""less guns mean less gun deaths.""

The statistics show that gun regulations don't reduce gun crime. In fact, the opposite is very much true. Loosening of gun regulations is likely the cause of the decrease in gun violence in the past few decades. Also, I would like to add that there are way more guns than registered motor vehicles in the United States, but there are roughly 36,000 motor vehicle accident deaths and many-fewer gun homicides. Gun suicides and accidental shootings are also a concern, but there's philosophical and analytical criticism on the inclusion of those in total counts.",1584422744,fkpxrbk

\&gt; So the science is different with influenza than with this coronavirus. With influenza, the disease spreads through schools out into the population, and we have more illness problems with kids. We're seeing very few kids under 19 get this disease at all, and they apparently are not shedding the virus at a level that is very contagious. Closing schools has all kinds of other negative implications; teen pregnancy rates often go up, violence can go up, kids aren't then learning.

I am a certified CNC operator who by all means should be making $36 an hour ""last job offer I had running a CNC for Honeywell"" but couldn't get that job because I can't pass a mental health evaluation required to make what they make ""guidance systems and such for the military"" and most of the other manufacturing jobs are leaving the state or country so now I'm starting over in my life back at the bottom pushing carts for a major retail store making $11.22 an hour. Even with my insurance from work if me or my 2 children get sick from this we are looking at a minimum of 6 months of my loving income to cover just that cost and that's just if ONE of us get sick. Throw in the fact that my elderly disabled mother with so many health conditions that when I fill her medications they fill a paper grocery sack is babysitting my kids so I can work and the fact that I work on the front line handling every single cart from over 5,000 people easily a day and having to be face to face with over half of those people and you can start to see how this is stacking up. I'm a single father with full custody that stands to lose everything if any of us get sick but I'm not allowed to take any time off and have to deal with every one of the crazy people that are infected fighting over toilet paper all while trying to keep myself from getting it. Us that make next to nothing are literally living one paycheck away from homeless most of the time and not because we don't have skills like most people believe. Yeah there are a lot of people with no skills or training to do something better but there are also a lot of people working retail and food industries that have skills that don't have work for us anymore because it's all been sent out of the country. We don't get the option of getting to take time off and no one is going to shut down stores like grocery stores Walmarts targets none of that because people still need their food and tp and whatnot. Count what blessings you do have at your work and realize there are many many of us that are doing way worse. Even I know there are people doing way worse than me at a time like this. Luckily I have an abundance of survival skills that I have already set into action so I'm not hurting. I've got plenty of supplies I know how to hunt farm process my own meats fish I've got freeze dried food and medical supplies because I have an IQ right around 150 I know that most prescription medications have options I can get over the counter not intended for human consumption like fishmox which is the SAME EXACT pill given to humans and is amoxicillin just for an example I've got plenty of everything I need to survive this but I also know that none of that matters because people are losing their minds and that's the dangerous part because people are unpredictable creatures. I break down daily hearing my co workers stories of how bad it's already gotten for them and yet it doesn't seem this state cares about them. These are people that have no survival skills no real skills for anything and yet here they are just working away trying to act like it's just another day. Many of them are having mental breakdowns daily at work hiding in the freezer to cry and it's just now starting. We are far from over with this and I myself expect it to last the next 4-7 months just from my own analysis. If people don't can down soon you will see the true side of human nature and I can tell you right now that's not a side of human you want to see because I know what they are capable of when backed into a corner.

5807,oldbastardbob,"""... Joplin, which is not far from St. Louis....""

I see the writer of this article is not in any way familiar with Missouri geography.

I like the job creation in Joplin.  I don't like that their city or county politicians will probably give away the farm to get them there.

Not a fan of tax abatement's and those undefined ""incentives"" local governments like to give away to corporations.  It's typically a bunch of local yokels and their city or county attorney who fall for this shit presented to them by seven figure salaried lawyers and corporate marketing and ""site selection"" committees with little due diligence or oversight.

My nearby town gave ConAgra a complete property tax abatement because they said they were going to hire 400 new workers.  City and county fell for it.  There is no oversight and no requirement for ConAgra to prove they actually hired those 400 workers.

The extra kicker is they went after this just after a 200 person layoff, so in reality, they hired formerly laid off workers back, minus the ones they didn't want back, and have never been required to prove they actually increased their head count by 400 at that plant.

But they still pay no local property taxes.

Corporations excel at taking advantage of local governments, which, god bless them, are usually staffed with some local big shots who have no idea what they are doing beyond owning the local car dealership or grocery store.  Small town attorneys are typically not experts in public-private partnership contracts, taxes, or corporate laws and regulations either.

I asked, through a letter to the editor of the local newspaper, what the planned budget cuts were to balance the decreased revenue from this abatement.  I got blasted by all sorts of the town bigshots about how ""I didn't know anything"" and it was all going to pay for it's self.  The general small town ""you're just being negative"" thing you get when you ask questions of the powers that be.

About two years later we got a significant increase in sales taxes for the city, and an increase in the levy for the school district.  I'm so happy we can all now pay ConAgra's property taxes for them, as their gross profits for the past 10 years are averaging around $2.5 Billion.",1584470896,fkrky8b

The updated letter below provides a link to detailed instruction from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on how to clean and disinfect. Please note: although bleach is an effective cleaner used to combat the virus, it should not be mixed with other household cleaners or chemicals.**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Thank you to the constituents who reached out regarding this important issue. Together, the people of Missouri’s 4th Congressional District will come together and beat this virus.**   
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Please read below for important information regarding what Congress has done and is doing to support these efforts:**  
&gt;  
&gt;As we as a nation continue to work together to diligently and safely handle COVID-19, commonly known as the “coronavirus,” I wanted to update you on Missouri’s and Congress’ actions to prevent, prepare, and respond to this pandemic.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;For the most up-to-date information from the CDC, please visit this website: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html. My office will also be diligently tracking the developments of this virus and updates will be posted on my website: https://hartzler.house.gov/coronavirus-updates.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I was recently briefed by the Director of Missouri Health and Senior Services on the state of readiness among all levels of government in the State of Missouri. He assured me that Missouri is one of the few states with a “high” level of readiness with plans in place to contain and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Additionally, the director informed me that until a vaccine is created, the best tool to avoid getting ill is proper hygienic procedures, such as washing your hands throughout the day, using hand sanitizer, covering your coughs and sneezes, and following CDC guidelines on cleaning solutions when cleaning home and office surfaces. You can find detailed instructions from the CDC, here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html. If you need additional local information regarding response efforts and personal safety measures, you can call the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services at 877-435-8411.

&gt;The letter asks four actions by Parson, each with a proviso that he should keep them in place “until public health officials advise” that it’s safe to relax any restrictions. Leaders asked Parson to: order all gatherings and events to be limited to 10; close all schools across the state; order all restaurants and bars to transition to take-out or delivery, or close; and “strongly urge that all Missourians stay home as much as possible” and observe social distancing.

I don’t see why he doesn’t just do it. Many towns are already enforcing gathering limits,many chain restaurants are switching to take-out and delivery only, and social distancing is constantly being harped on. He’s already “suggested” social distancing and gathering limits. Many school districts are already closed. Just do it so everyone is on the same page. 

&gt;”...go back to personal responsibility.”

I have friends who seem to catch everything there is, and will hold events while they have a cold, and they don't tell anyone they're sick. You end up finding out after you're there an hour and you hear them coughing or sneezing.  Then it's just ""oh yeah, I have a cold.""

I was taking precautions because of others and well quite frankly I don't want to be sick. Anyway it hit me that I could be at risk, actually I'm definitely at risk. 

Last year I had something happen that's never happened before. Sinuses and bronchitis all hit within 24 hours. From nothing to I can't breathe while laying here. It was on a holiday so only one walk in was open (they are cheaper than an emergency room even with insurance).

My work instituted a stay home if you feel sick and you can be paid up to 2 weeks sick leave. But the problem is that with this you can go for like 2 weeks without ever knowing you have it spreading it. And on top of that the ""cool"" idiots who think it's all a joke and nothing to worry about. They will spread it for sure.

I don't want to die drowning in fluids as I lay there burning up. The thing that really proved to me how at risk I might be was reading of the 34 year old guy who had similar health issues dying the other day. I'm going to contact my HR and see what their plans are for at risk people. If they say I can just stay home without repercussions but not get pain I'm going to have to risk it and just go to work. It's not just me though. Everyone at work knows someone who is at risk or is at risk themselves. I don't know. I try to ""haha I'm gonna die"" to maybe make it not as real.

Here are some things that I think are important to this dialogue. Even through the Workforce 2030 plan was written up my the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, something like that won’t get widespread approval unless it is picked up by a legislative arm. The Chamber unifies the business community, and while many educational institutions are members of the Chamber, ideas don’t cross pollinate well unless there is a bigger entity that can unify policies to affect both groups. 

And, just because a policy isn’t perfect, I will take some forward progress over none at all.

Correct.  But also the group who, when they turn out, win every single election for the Dems.  If you have high youth turnout, Democrats win every time.

Almost seems like that's the group the party should be catering to since the other demographics consistently vote Democrat regardless.

How is running an outsider campaign against the combined might of the entire DNC and liberal media bought and paid for by billionaires while simultaneously refusing to take money from the rich and Super PACs ""being explicitly catered to"" here?

just fine.

Medicaid and Medicare, which are horribly flawed systems, by the way. Missouri is known nationally for the lack of Medicaid and Medicare, and yet we're doing just fine without it. Healthcare in Missouri is adequate in places other than St. Louis and Kansas City.

&gt;Just plain false. We're actually right near the bottom with literally hundreds of thousands of young women unable to get the access to birth control they need.

Not at all false. Teenage women in Missouri aren't crying out for help.

Also, congratulations on failing eighth grade English! You have committed one of the cardinal sins of journalism: citing an unreliable source. Seriously, are you ignorant of academic bias?

Not true. Missouri ranks in the lower 25 for STD rates in general. I highly doubt our teen STD rate is among the highest.

&gt;one of the highest medical bankruptcy rates in the nation

Again, not true. We're in the middle, leaning to higher. Overall bankruptcy is about the same.

For one, this is a national problem, and Missouri is, again, very average in this respect.

We have nothing at all and our state legislature has convened session a month and a half early. That’s good because one of our legislators is in the ICU with coronavirus.

Who makes it up? We do. That’s why the Republican Gas Tax bill will be on our ballot in August or November- again. They need money and they are passing this shit onto regular people because Republican donors who support corporate interests pay them to. 
Kansas finally figured out that gutting school funding is bad. Kansas finally figured out that taxes make things work- that includes corporations paying in. Kansas still has their problems but they now have a governor who actually cares about people and not just donors.

1.7% is not a ""we're screwed"" number of people. It's not great. It's not good. But it's also relatively low for a pandemic like this.

We survive all kinds of horrible things every year that costs precious lives-- car crashes, the flu, substance abuse, etc. Things that cost so many lives, yet we just  sort of live with them. They suck, but we deal with it and we move on. 

This virus should be no different. But it is. People are freaking out, and the panic is in turn fueling the problem rather than helping it. This is where I start to agree with you, that better leadership and crisis planning could have really made this entire thing far more manageable and less painful than it is.

We should have shut down things long ago, including public transportation such as airplanes, trains, and cruises. We should have closed out borders to international travel outside of trade, where we should have forced nonface to face trade offs at the border of cargo. We should have shut down our stores at the first signs of panic buying and initiated rationing of goods to ensure every household can stay comfortable stocked  without having to mob Walmart every morning in search of key hard to find staple food and hygiene items.

But we didn't. That just means we are far less organized and secure than we would like to think, and that our leadership is very much a failure despite any political biases we may hold. But we still aren't screwed. 

We just have to realize that this virus isn't the end of the world, stop treating it like it is, and start playing the game with a real plan. We need to focus resources where they're needed, prop up the people, pause the economy, take a few weeks off, secure the supply chains and refocus them, and just wait this out.

We have fewer than 8500 hospital beds in the state right now, and even though it's projected to almost double by the end of this we're looking at them being overwhelmed by early May if we only do social distancing. Keep in mind that hospital beds (about a million in the US, total) is a little misleading, since only a small percent of them are intensive care, which seems to be what is required in a lot of cases here, and there are still car accidents, heart attacks, cancer, and all the other things to deal with that have always put people in the hospital. We tend to forget how many of those other people are going to die or get worse, too, if medical care is no longer available. 

I'm glad that St. Louis city and county have closed down so much. I just hope it's enough, as there are still too many businesses that can call themselves ""essential"", and others that force people to come in when they could easily work from home. With shelter in place or lock-down measures it's entirely possible to ride this out without overwhelming our hospitals and getting to a nightmare scenario: you can barely even see those areas on the graph.

6799,Staff_Guy,"I have been talking to folks around me using my county population and number of hospital beds. Trying to bring it closer with stuff people are familiar with. And I have been using better case scenarios, if I can use that term (and apparently I can....).

So we have about 250k folks in my county, if only 10% of them need a hospital, not even talking ICU or dead, that is 25,000 people. 10% is the very low end of serious case percentages, insofar as I can tell. That is almost 1000 people a day, for a month. We have fewer than 700 hospital beds in the county, and I am counting one hospital that is just outside of the county line. And those beds are not empty right now.

Even the most die hard Trump fans will listen for a minute to some familiar numbers about their local area. And the numbers are hard to argue. Using better case scenario numbers gives people the idea that I am not fully influenced by whatever. Trump's deep state, or whatever.

1000 a day. Yes, that rate cannot continue for months on end. But it can for long enough that all of our medical care will be very badly affected. And I am still talking just my local area.

MO death rate seems to run about 1% a year. We are looking at doubling or tripling that. Or worse. So the streets will not be filled with the dead. But everyone will know someone that died from this.

People keep saying this shit like this and then when it affects YOU, you will blame others for something YOU never took seriously. 

Fact 1: We have no clue whether this virus will go away in the Summer. That's just a wait and see. 

Fact 2: IF COVID-19 is very similar to the Spanish Flu: In that case, it leveled off in the summer only to come right back in the Fall/Winter. Guess what? Fall/Winter are coming back eventually. 

Fact 3: At the current rate, if we socially isolate for 3 months (March-June), there will be 45,000 hospitalizations from this. If we don't, over 80,000. 

Fact 4: There are only 13,000 hospital beds in Missouri. 

Fact 5: It will be at least 18 months until we get a vaccine. 

Missouri is not prepared AT ALL for this crisis and Gov. Parsons's inaction is going to lead to a loss of a lot of lives. Not to mention that 1.7% can be seasonal if no vaccine can be developed. So we can lose 3-5% of Missouri population by death to COVID-19, not to mention other deaths within the next 2 years from natural causes, cancer, heart disease, car accidents, and so on. 

AND FURTHERMORE, the people who survive are likely going to have massive lung issues for the rest of their lives. So if there were in hard labor, they can breathe properly because COVID-19 destroyed their lungs, they can't work anymore. So who takes care of them? How are we going to have enough pure oxygen to give to survivors? Because with 45,000 hospitalizations, there are going to be a number of them who need oxygen to survive.

In addition to strictly enforcing much lower occupancy limits, retailers which wish to stay open can be required to issue all employees interacting with customers, cash, or credit cards to wear disposable gloves. Additionally, nominal fines could be issued any groups clumped outside of the entrances of stores enforcing the stricter legal occupancy limits.

Rather than encouraging everyone to pack into a handful of large grocery stores to which the shelter in place rules does not apply, in which the 6-10 foot CDC recommendation will be violated, simply using zoning and fire safety rules to enforce stricter occupancy limits could encourage groceries to be distributed from a larger number of smaller restaurants or other retail locations which are willing to enforce stronger restrictions on quantity of individuals entering and exiting so that 6-10 foot physical distancing rule is actually observed.",1585041201,flcptk6

Fines can also be issued to discourage residents clumping when queueing outside of businesses which are strictly enforcing reduced occupancy limits.

This might actually be superior to shelter in place rules, because it would not encourage people to pack into grocery stores and other ""essential"" businesses exempt from order in which the 6-10 foot CDC physical distancing rule will be violated.

If the reduced occupancy limits also applied to large grocery stores, then it may encourage baskets of groceries to be sold from a larger number of smaller locations which are not typically used to distribute groceries, at retailers and restaurants which are actually willing to hire a bouncer to ensure 6-10 foot physical distancing recommendation.

It obviously doesn't make sense to tell a hunter they can't go outside in an area where there is unlikely to be another person at all.

Simply amending existing building occupancy and fire safety rules to reduce the number of allowable occupants in commercial buildings with respect to floor space seems like a much more sensible solution. This can be combined with rule that all retail businesses must leave external door open and supply employees with disposable gloves.

Shelter in place with exemptions for essential businesses like grocery stores is a worse policy if it it doesn't require essential businesses to obey reduced occupancy limits and allows people to pack into grocery stores at less than 6 feet from each other.",1585045560,flct88i
7005,devSTL,"&gt; I'm glad that St. Louis city and county have closed down so much. I just hope it's enough, as there are still too many businesses that can call themselves ""essential"", and others that force people to come in when they could easily work from home

It might have been preferable to allow any business to stay open but temporarily reduce building occupancy limits by fire code by a factor of 10, require businesses to leave external door open so no one shares door handles, require businesses to issue gloves to all employees interacting with customers, cash, or credit cards, fine businesses which fail to observe reduced occupancy limits, require self-service gas stations to clean pumps and distribute wipes or hire additional gloved workers to fill gas for customers, fine any groups clumping outside of stores enforcing reduced occupancy limits, and allow grocers to setup temporary franchises to sell baskets of food from cafes or alternative ""non-essential"" locations as long as these locations also strictly observed reduced occupancy limits.

A shelter in place order does not seem effective if it does not require big box retailers deemed essential businesses to reduce occupancy limits and allows people to pack into these stores at less than 6-10 feet away from each other in violation of CDC physical distancing recommendations, it seems like it just encourages more people to pack into same location at smaller distances in a faster time period.",1585046408,flctx2b

You beat this by getting ahead of it.  This is the same mentality as the Italians just locking down the north.  Turns out, when everything is closed in the north people just travelled to where bars and shit were open and spread it in the south.

You lock down cities everyone sick in those cities starts going out to the surrounding areas.  And those surrounding areas already have it.

7067,devSTL,"No, it's the opposite. The government already has the power to enforce occupancy limits per square footage of building space for fire safety. It can temporarily tighten those limits in a fair and uniform manner without discriminating against specific businesses or issuing shelter in place orders for residents which are unlikely to violate the 6-10 foot rule anyway, such as hunters engaged in rural outdoor activities. Government can also require retailers which wish to remain open to distribute disposable gloves to employees interacting with customers or handling cash and credit cards, in the same manner that it already enforces workplace safety standards. It can also require self-service gas stations to disinfect pumps or require gloved employees to direct cars and fill gas for customers.

What is the overstep of government power is allowing it to arbitrarily declare certain businesses essential and other businesses non-essential in a manner which forces small businesses to shutter while allowing large businesses to remain open, for purposes of security theater without actually reducing the risk of transmission among patrons and employees of larger businesses.

Also, Bubonic Plague did not originate in China, nor did the Spanish Flu. Targeting China is a Trump game plan meant to blame the country of origins piss poor handling in the early days of viral emergence  in order to distract from his own piss poor handling of the virus here at home. The reality is that deadly virus's and diseases can originate from virtually anywhere. This is further complicated by our global supply chains and international travel, of which the United States participates heavily.  So just as China could have done far more to contain this virus in the early days, the US could have shielded itself by closing off our borders to all international travel and non face-to-face trade practices. But we didn't.  


As far as what I was proposing, it was not specific as it could come in many forms. It could be mandatory sick days paid by the employer during a national emergency (with some sort of limit), it could be a requirement that all companies must offer equal sick pay/days to all of its employees. It could be a tax leveraged on stock buybacks that funds increased unemployment benefits (that can only kick in during and in the immediate areas of a national emergency).  You could come up with hundreds of ways that you could promote an increase in sick days or emergency unemployment funding during these kinds of things, and they don't have to all be related to a worldwide pandemic.

I personally supply PPE to first responders, and medical staff throughout the country. Right now, they are sewing their own masks. Right now, they protect themselves with office supplies and duct tape. Right now, the professionals are going down faster than the rest of us. 

That is because your psychotic party leader cut the CDC funding that specifically deals with EPIDEMICS. And, just to make it obvious for you Capitan_Obvioso, that orange fuck couldn't have made that decision on his own because he wouldn't know a pandemic from a pussy--even your pussy.

Slower than Kansas in our race to the bottom doesn't seem like a bad thing to me. Why should we be giving billions to corporations to bribe them to come here?  Much better uses for the money.

&gt;Google fiber was gonna come to KC, backed out for KS then eventually found its way to our side of state line.

Google fiber failed because rural folks voted in decades of Republican politicians getting huge donations from telecom companies to ban municipal fiber and restrict access to building out new networks. Cost of entry into the market was their biggest barrier and it is 100% entirely Republicans who did that.

I actually got well into the process of trying to establish municipal fiber for my own town before running into these delightful rules that fucked over Google. 

&gt;Kanas City spends $15,336.69 per pupil on education, 1.5x the state average

The cost of living is more than twice the state average as well because the average town in Missouri is a rural shithole that no one wants to live in.

If they weren't spending more than people living in a town where it costs $30,000 for a house they would be doing something wrong.

Also they are graduating 88% of students from high school in KC which despite not being great is not the worst in the state by any means. 

&gt;St. Louis isn't even fit to keep an NFL team.

It's hard to keep an NFL team in a struggling state with shitty graduates that graduate from shit schools with no skills and have shit healthcare and very few job prospects.  

Not many people can afford tickets and merchandise when they are struggling to survive and again, all the education cuts and all the refusal to expand Medicaid are 100% thanks to rural voters electing GOP idiots. 

&gt;St. Louis elects politicians that advocate assassination of the President and sit for the Pledge of Allegiance

Fuck the incompetent criminal fascist in the white house and fuck your ridiculous song.

Real people are suffering and dying thanks to him, the dude who mocked disabled people and bragged about sexual assault and advocated for the torture of children.

Anyone elected should have a soul and anyone with a soul should be against Trump.

&gt; Acity wide income tax?! How can any person possibly think this is acceptable when there are entire states that have no income tax? St. Louis and Kansas City apparently do.

Those states have other ways to get funds like taxing oil in Texas and Alaska and Dakotas or taxing tourism in Nevada and Florida. 

No one wants to come here and the GOP cunts in Jeff city consistently cut revenue to the cities who are producing the majority of the state's money anyway. 

So the cities had to take things into their own hands. It takes more money to run a metropolis than a Walmart and a strip mall and a hundred trailer homes around it.


&gt;When I think about all the great things about this state, t

What's one great thing about this state? A single thing we do better than any other would be fantastic. 

Sure as fuck isn't healthcare or education or jobs or crime or innovation or industry or social safety nets or equality or environmental protections or quality of life or citizen happiness or poverty or technology or infrastructure.

I've lived my entire life in various places in this state controlled since the day I was born by Republican majority due to scumbag gerrymandering and voter disenfranchisement.

I've seen nothing but things getting worse and us being left behind. 

&gt;Yet somehow the rural folk who are poor, don't complain about being poor and actually look out for one another are somehow the bad folks, simply because they vote Red. 

They are the bad folks because they vote against their interests and keep our state in the red and taking more from the feds than we contribute.

Thanks to the GOP we are a welfare state that only exists thanks to the good graces of our federal funding and those poor rural folks electing in corrupt idiot GOP criminals is why.

We could have steadily been improving for decades with proper investment into our state's social infrastructure but instead we listened to the GOP, raced to the bottom to funnel all the money to the top, and sat there and prayed that trickle down would work.

Now they see a giant racist criminal up there and happily vote for him and what, we are supposed to think of them as good guys here?

The ones fighting against healthcare for all in an epidemic who have been crusading against living wages for employees that are now so very essential to our society functioning?

This is basically entirely false. 

It is true that if you ask the Russian Government ""how many people died in the Chernobyl incident"" they will probably say ""31"" because it's technically accurate. If you asked the UN or the US in the 80s they would say the same number. If you asked the UN in 2006 they would say it was more like 54, but that's only because they broadened the definition, not because they found more bodies. 

However, and this is a big however, if you ask the Russian Government ""yeah but how many people died as a result of radiation exposure related disease in the years following the Chernobyl incident?"" they'd probably say something like ""oh thousands for sure, you can see our research in the multiple international studies we have contributed to and cooperated with on the subject.""

A good comparison is if you ask the US Government ""how many people died in 9/11"" they will say ""2,996"" even though the total deaths caused through disease, cancer, respiratory issues, etc. is much higher (and still rising).

Anyways, I finished my job yesterday and started having what I thought was an asthma attack but I haven't had one in like 10 years. I started to pass out while driving (short of breath, tight chest, numb/tingling limbs). I was very close to a hospital so I went to the ER as quick as I could before passing out. They told me I have general anxiety with panic attack and panic body response. I know it's due to me constantly having my mind run wild while I'm working thinking I'm going to catch this from a coworker, customer or surface that's been touched by an infected. I go see my primary tomorrow, I think they are going to put me on some medication. As of now I'm terrified of going back to work and dont know if I can or should use fmla. Can anyone help with what my options are? I dont want to quit or lose this job, but I'm under so much damn stress that its causing panic attacks. Is FMLA something I should do?

DOL still needs to release guidelines on this, but if your company is under 50, or over 500 employees, this legislation doesn't help much. This is why it is very important in the coming week or two to read the guidelines when they are finally released.

Fort Osage (also known as Fort Clark or Fort Sibley) was an early 19th-century factory trading post system run by the United States Government, on the American frontier being located in present-day Sibley, Missouri. The Treaty of Fort Clark was signed with certain members of the Osage Nation in 1808 calling for the creation of Fort Osage. It was one of three forts established by the U.S. Army to establish control over the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase territories. Fort Madison in SE Iowa was built to control trade and pacify Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region.

7953,DollyPartonsFarts,"I think it's ridiculous to put your life in danger to go hunt mushrooms.  I think it's ridiculous to take extraneous trips that could end up being a resource draw for first responders.

If you have private land to mushroom hunt on: Have a great time.  Still remember if you are taking extra risks right now, they are just that: Risks.  Break your leg 4 months ago on a hike and it's no big deal.  Break your leg now and you're an undue burden on your local healthcare system.

If you're on public land though:  I have never been on a trail in Missouri where I could keep 6 feet away from someone I had to pass or someone walking toward me.

Also, just because something is out in the woods on doesn't mean it hasn't been touched by other people.  That low hanging branch you just hopped up to touch?  That dead tree that is easy to grab on to to get up that step?  Viruses live on those surfaces.

Nobody knows enough to be confident as to when that will be, not least of which because we're losing the race against time on this one; the longer it takes, the more tests we need, so the longer it takes. Earliest? Maybe August? Latest? Or ...

**It turns out that re-infection is super-rare, and herd immunity develops.** The earliest *safe* time for this? Maybe August of this year, but that'd be really pushing our luck. If we try to get it done too soon, we lose a high percentage of our hospitals and a higher percentage of our doctors and nurses. Latest? Maybe late October? Or ...

**We get a vaccine and enough doses that nearly everybody gets one.** We don't even have a confirmed vaccine that works yet, let alone a start on manufacturing them. Earliest? Probably combined with October 2021's flu shot. Latest? October 2022's flu shot season, if it can be done at all. Or ...

**Remdivisir or some other anti-viral becomes a miracle cure.** And, presumably, we somehow get enough of it for everybody who develops pneumonia from covid-19.

State Auditor Nicole Galloway is calling on the governor to issue a  statewide stay-at-home order to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.  Galloway, a Democrat running for governor, says public health experts,  organizations representing healthcare workers, business and faith  leaders, local governments and others have urged Parson to issue the  order. Parson responded to Galloway’s call.

“I would say the state auditor needs to worry about being the state  auditor right now,” says Parson. “All of us elected officials right now  need to have one thing in mind – it’s what do we do to help with the  COVID-19 situation. This is not the time to play politics out of this  issue and try to figure out who gets one up. There will be plenty of  time for that down the road.

When those idiots don't stay home and become infected, they put further strain on the healthcare system, from both a financial standpoint and a resource management standpoint. The latter creates much more risk for rural hospitals that don't have the money to adequately supply PPE to their staff, isolate confirmed cases, or care for the critically ill.

It was a travel ban on people who didn't live in the USA/weren't American citizens who had visited China.   If you were American or a resident of America you could still fly back and forth between China for WEEKS after that.   That was the only major action taken by Trump until March.   The entire time from January to mid-March Trump spent saying there were only 5, 10, 15 people in the USA with it and it was a fake news made by the media to make him look bad.   The reality is that there were tens of thousands of undetected cases because we had next to 0 testing for MONTHS.

I'm sorry, you can say ""well its unfortunate there were manufacturing problems"" but that is a shitty excuse and passing around responsibility.  Would you accept that excuse from China or Canada or XYZ country?   No - you'd call them out on their bullshit and say get the job done.  


Meanwhile Trump turned down WHO German-made tests for an unknown reason that we could have had on hand while we produced our own.  

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-says-who-coronavirus-test-was/


So if you think doing some travel ban on non-US residents/citizens who had been to China recently was enough you are deep in denial, and Democrats were begging to spend more money on testing and more action to be done FOR MONTHS.

Do you seriously not remember this in January and February?  Trump spent weeks and weeks downplaying it - remember March 8th when Trump was saying we shouldn't let a cruise ship full of Americans dock because it would make our numbers go up and make us look bad?  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/8/21170411/coronavirus-cruise-ship-trump-white-house-grand-princess-carson-adams

Fact is Trump did next to NOTHING for MONTHS we had experts warning us to do something.

But I'm sure you'll reply with how great it is to be like Italy in handling this now.

List of things you claimed and then when you were wrong you ignored:

* Trump's China travel ban doing anything - it was weeks late and didn't affect Americans/people who live in America   could still go back and forth between China

* Trump's repeated comments about how this was a hoax by the Democrats and it isn't that big of a deal - FOR MONTHS

* Trump bragging about about not wanting to spend 8.5 billion on testing and medical supplies and that 2.5 billion was enough - calling democrats alarmists and overreacting February 28th.

* Passing the buck on late testing while other countries had been testing for weeks before us

This is on the DOL website:   


"" The recent passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) which expands unemployment benefits has greatly increased the number of calls into the DES claims centers. “We understand that everyone is anxious about what this means for them in terms of being eligible if you are self-employed or when a claimant might expect to receive the $600 supplement,” said Slinkard. “Since the program is fully federally funded, and not a state program, DOLIR must wait for the guidance issued by the US Department of Labor (USDOL) to properly administer and receive the funding for the program. Trying to do this before we receive the federal guidance, could cost the State and the employers millions of dollars. We expect this guidance very soon and like thousands of Missourians, we’re anxiously awaiting word from our federal partners so that we can provide the new benefits as quickly as possible.”

I'm a LOT angrier about the coronavirus deaths. 9/11 was, more or less, unpreventable and was impossible to repeat by the end of the first day, when the order came down to resist in-air hijackings. It was a tragedy, and we were absolutely right to be angry and the murderer who planned it and at the government that tried to shield him from us. But it's been over for a long time.

This? Was *entirely* preventable. A system to prevent it *was in place and got dismantled* by a leader who just plain doesn't believe in disaster prevention or preparation. (See Michael Lewis's book that came out just months before the disaster, *The Fifth Risk.*) And it is still getting worse, will continue getting worse for quite some time, because of corruption, incompetence, vanity and stubbornness, both at the top and in the voters who support him. I'm mad enough to chew nails and spit tacks.

If you're asking why average Missourians aren't as angry about this as about 9/11? Because this was done by someone they didn't already hate, because they can't blame this on Muslims or whatever. Because this was done to them by someone on their side, by someone they enthusiastically turned out to vote for in huge numbers. So if they let themselves get angry at him, they'd have to be angry at themselves for putting him there. Cognitive dissonance won't let them do that.

To extent the 9/11 analogy: there are Muslims who recognize that bin Laden's attack on the US didn't achieve its goal of liberating Palestine or ending the al Saud alliance with Christian America, and did get millions of Muslims killed, and did result in the overthrow of the Islamic caliphate of Afghanistan. Lots of articles to that effect have been written by Muslim scholars and clerics. But there are also tons of Muslims of the same sect as bin Laden, Salafists, who don't blame bin Laden for that, they blame George W. Bush. Why? Because bin Laden was one of their own. So it can't be his fault.

Why do you think Trump keeps calling it the ""China virus""? And why do you think that he keeps lying about the pandemic preparations that he inherited? Because cognitive dissonance will only carry him for so many deaths among his own followers. After that, he needs somewhere to deflect their blame onto. Then they'll be angry. But won't be at him. It can't be at him. He's ""on their side.""",1585975811,fmdrm69

Other presidents have come into their transitions unaware of those labs and indifferent to them (until they found out the hard way how important they are) but Trump is different: Trump is the first president, in the nearly 100 years that we've had government disaster research labs, to be actively hostile to the idea that these labs existed, to take deliberate steps to try to disband as many of them as he can.

The ""consolidation"" you referred to? ""Merged"" two other disease labs' functions into the Army biowarfare lab -- but didn't transfer any of the personnel, equipment, facilities, or funding. That really does mean ""disband."" It's been all over every newspaper.

And scientists all over the world stopped naming viruses after countries because there were too many false calls.

This suggests we need to add 100,000 children in this example.

This suggests 124,000 adults need coverage. It also tells us that 5.9 million in MO and 15% on Medicaid, which means 885,000 on Medicaid. It states that 10.1 billion was spent on Medicaid, which would amount to about $1,243 per person. Therefore covering those that need it and aren't covered would add about 279 million in costs.

https://www.incomebyzipcode.com/missouri

This says about 4.4% of households make over $200,000/year.  There are approximately 2.2 million households in Missouri. That means about 97,000 households in Missouri make more than $200,000. That would mean that at least 4.8 billion in income is made in Missouri between $150,000 and $200,000 incomes per year. That means with a 5.7% increase on income over $150,000 could cover the expansion. That is $2,900 per household. If my family made $200,000 we could easily swing $2,900 to help all missourians have healthcare... HOWEVER...

""Starting in 2017, the states gradually started to pay a share of the [Medicaid] expansion cost but the states’ portion will never be more than 10 percent.
Because of that federal funding for Medicaid expansion, states that reject it are missing out on billions of federal dollars that would otherwise be available to provide healthcare in the state.""

Which means Missouri would only be on the hook for  27.9 million for Medicaid expansion, at most. Which means only $290 per household on income between $150,000 and $200,000 (more as you make more). That adds 0.6% to income tax on the fairly wealthy (of which I would be included in part in this proposed tax).

So... yeah. That's how I would approach it. I'm sure I'm missing things as this is of the top of my head, but it seems like a good place to start looking.",1586033661,fmfs25z

Each state has its own FMAP based on per capita income and other criteria. The average state FMAP is 57%, but FMAPs can range from 50% in wealthier states up to 75% for states with lower per capita incomes. FMAPs are adjusted for each state on a three-year cycle to account for fluctuations in the economy. The FMAP is published annually in the Federal Register.""

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/coronavirus-trump-white-house-live-today-update-petition-propaganda-daily-briefing-a9438606.html

EVERY DAY he comes out and lies in these briefings.  This is after lying for MONTHS about the severity of the situation leading to the severe spread of this thing to begin with.

It's criminal negligence and he should go to jail for the rest of his life along with multiple others in his administration for the thousands of Americans killed as DIRECT result of their fucking lies.

&gt;This is laughable. Look at the timelines. He's WELL ahead of past pandemic responses.

LOL get out of your fucking bubble.  He was out there along with Fox News for WEEKS telling us it was bullshit.  When he should have invoked the DPA to produce test kits and PPE in February he was instead out there saying our 15 cases were about to be 0 and patting himself on the back for what a good job he was doing.

He was railing against the Democratic hoax while other countries were shutting down their cities and mass testing their citizens.  Even NOW we can't get fucking tests we request in my city months after this shit started.

&gt;Was he downplaying the potential impact of the virus? Yes, he was. I'm not excusing his words and have no idea why he thought what he thought when he made various statements, and neither do you.

You know why and so do I.  Because he's a lying grifter who says only what benefits himself.  You know that like ANYONE who watches him talk for 5 minutes knows that.  Like anyone who has ever been around him, anyone who knows his past, or anyone who has seen him in office.

He lied because it made his brainwashed dumbshit followers watching Fox News feel better to know this wasn't a problem and they shouldn't worry or prepare for it and he feels good when people like him.  It is no more complicated than that.

&gt;His response, though, has been pretty good, considering what he was being told and when he was being told.

Weird cause Trump himself is now claiming he always knew it would get this bad.

And we have reports that he was briefed of potentially 150,000 deaths in the nation in the middle of January by the military.  How, exactly, does finding out about something in February and still telling people not to worry about that shit until the middle of March constitute a good response?

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html

&gt;He let the experts at the CDC do anything they wanted and followed their advice. When they put their asses in a sling with a manufacturing error of the tests, he brought in manufactures quickly to turn it around.

NO HE FUCKING DIDN'T.

He could have authorized the DPA to mass produce tests February 10th when the CDC reported their tests to be faulty.  It was already critically too late at that point and at this point we are STILL unable to secure the testing we need when we needed it which was weeks ago.

He blew a whole fucking MONTH while this thing spread unchecked because no doctors could test their patients.

&gt;If we weren't three weeks behind on testing because of the initial manufacturing error, we would be ahead of everyone else in our response.

No we fucking wouldn't be.

What?! What?!

He wasn't fired for ""whistleblowing"", dimwit, he was fired for blasting confidential and critical information over unsecured email to over 20 people NOT in his chain of command that ended up in the media, instead of following regulations and using his chain of command.

His violations of duty compromised his men, his aircraft carrier, and the navy. He aided the enemy with information he didn't provide to his own superiors!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;EVERY DAY he comes out and lies in these briefings. This is after lying for MONTHS about the severity of the situation leading to the severe spread of this thing to begin with. 

Yeah, he does exaggerate and boast in his briefings. He's also over-optimistic. I guess it's not unfair to call them lies.

However, you're accusing him of *lying* about the severity when it's completely unsupported. He was being told, repeatedly, the danger was low and that advice was based upon lies by the Chinese and WHO.

On the other hand, he also has exposed numerous lies by the left like lies by NYC Governor Cuomo who was lying about what he needed, lying about what he had, and hiding stockpiles in NJ.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;LOL get out of your fucking bubble. He was out there along with Fox News for WEEKS telling us it was bullshit. When he should have invoked the DPA to produce test kits and PPE in February

More bullshit. He was perhaps over-optimistic and being misguided by some of the world's leading experts. You have no support for your claims.

He DIDN'T NEED TO USE DPA. When the CDC ran into trouble, he marched in manufacturers to pull their asses out of the fire. When we needed DPA, he called on corporations and we are now awash in DPA.

Any shortages you think we had, weren't actual shortages. It was hoarding and the failure of states to support other states. At no time have we not had far more DPA than we needed.

When he did need DPA, he used it immediately. I know this is going to shock the left, but not all problems are solved with brownshirts and guns.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He was railing against the Democratic hoax while other countries were shutting down their cities and mass testing their citizens. Even NOW we can't get fucking tests we request in my city months after this shit started. 

Yes, he was. The hoax he was referring to was them calling him ""hysterical"", a ""xenophobe"", and a ""fear monger"" for shutting down travel before it was even declared a pandemic just days after we were told it wasn't human to human.

The hoax he was referring to was Biden claiming he refused WHO tests, which is so stupid and laughable coming from a former VP because he should have known, that isn't how it works.

No, we can't get tests. Tests are being rationed for those who need them. The reason we can't get tests has nothing to do with Trump.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And we have reports that he was briefed of potentially 150,000 deaths in the nation in the middle of January by the military. How, exactly, does finding out about something in February and still telling people not to worry about that shit until the middle of March constitute a good response? 

He was briefed by a whole lot of people and departments with a whole lot of opinions. You're trying to paint a picture using hindsight bias because it serves you. When we know what he was told when and by whom, THEN we can start debating what he knew and said. Until then, it's just more leftist spin. 

&gt;NO HE FUCKING DIDN'T.

Dude...what are you even talking about?

We didn't need brown shirts and guns. The manufacturer screwed up and he brought in massive manufacturing by ASKING FOR IT. Not all problems need a hammer.

I FOLLOW these companies. I trade their stocks. I've NEVER, in 30 years of following corporations, seen so many companies race to fill the needs asked for like this. 

Force was NOT called for.

He ""blew"" no time at all. The CDC came to him and he solved it. End of story.

Can you explain what you mean by that? I would assume you are implying he's a socialist, but he's been very clear he's a social democrat. There is a vast difference between democratic and authoritarian socialism. 

Or are you referring to when he referred to bread lines as a good sign that people are being cared for in a time of crisis as opposed to a capitalist system where the poor are left to fend for themselves? 

Or was there some other meaning you had?

So if you're implying he's a richie rich that can't relate to the masses, then you're ignoring the prior 70+ years. He was born poor and clearly did not go into politics for money based on his aggressive stance on the people who actually have money.

Plus I have been fascinated over the last 30 years or so at how badly Missouri seems to want to identify as a deep south state.  Toss in that race to the bottom of conservatism that we seemed to be involved in with Kansas for a couple of decades, as in ""who can be the most regressive and blind when it comes to education, public assistance, or healthcare,"" and we seem to have a legislature that is dumbfounded by anything but ""guns is freedom!"" and ""Jesus is a Republican!""

We are firmly in the grasp of ""it's them poor peoples fault they're poor"" as well.

I'm on the fence about whether the majority of Missouri's conservative politicians really believe the shit they are selling the public, or they just know it works to get you elected and that's all that matters.

I will bet a dollar that the majority has been brainwashed into believing that worn out old Republican campaign bullshit about trickle-down economics being a good idea to solve poverty, lack of health care, and lack of opportunity.

The're trying to sell that shit to a third generation now, but it seems the millennials are a lot better at critical thinking than the GOP thought.

Seems to me, a boomer, it's time for our generation to get the hell out of the way, but we have a lot of old white guys with big ego's who think they actually know something, but their societal views are stuck in 1980 with the Reagan neo-cons, who were wrong about their economic and social policies in the first place. 

I wonder if any of them have stopped to realize that we have been cutting taxes on corporations, businesses, and wealthy folks for 40 years now and income stratification and poverty are at all time highs.

Or that a ban on abortion only pushes it back underground where the whole thing becomes even uglier than it is now.  We've been there pre-Roe v. Wade.

Or that easy access to semi-automatic weapons and hand guns by immature and mentally ill teens is a factor in school shootings.

I'm not advocating for a complete flip to extreme left ideology here, it would just be nice if our flag waving, card carrying, hard core Republicans would recognize reality and acknowledge the society and world we now live in.  Their Holy Bible does not contain the solutions to 21st century problems and you can't pray away mass shootings, hunger, poverty, mental illness, or racial bias.

The constituents are going to see that and if your small town mayor comes out and goes against that and people start suffering despite no cases confirmed yet and the governor saying don't worry about it if you're rural, well that mayor is going to take a ton of heat.

I agree it's an issue, but nobody with the money to support this kind of thing is going to be a) on reddit or b) be willing to front the cash for this sort of endeavor. It is clear that you haven't taken an economics class or heard about specialization, because a place that doesn't specialize isn't competitive when you are talking about profit. The reason there are few restaurants in your area is because there is no profit in putting one there. If a typical, ""efficient"" restaurant can't turn a profit in your area then a place with high overhead from having lots of different chefs (even part time) certainly won't be able to. This isn't a jab at you, but it's just how venture capitalists think when they see an idea like this.",1586129580,fmjg0hq
