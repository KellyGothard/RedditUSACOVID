Literally the only thing that this law changes is that poor people will have the same access to pretrial release that people with money have always had.

Robbery, in and of itself, is violent by nature, as it means to take by force. There are levels of robbery such as robbery with a gun, robbery with bodily injury, etc, but by itself robbery it considered one of the violent crimes by nature.

From the Bureau of Justice:

""Violent crime includes murder, rape and sexual assault, robbery, and assault.""",1577986659,fcuqv1s
171,171,skatenox,"So as for Spectrum having a hand in 100% broadband you have to look at the definition of broad band speed and what their general infrastructure plan looks like. 

FCC definition of broad brand is 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload. 

Spectrums residentially infrastructure delivery plan is primarily dependent on coaxial cabling (not fiber) utilizing either DOCSIS 3.0 or 3.1 (with 4.0 in development) these technologies are capable of delivering broad band speed no problem, the limitation is that because it uses an electrical signal it sees an issue with distance from Spectrums equipment locations to a residential location. Typically this maxes out at 30 miles in practical use. 

If you‚Äôve ever been any where rural 20-30 miles is not that far, throw in mountainous terrain with only logging roads from 25 years ago and it‚Äôs much more challenging.

The most effective way I‚Äôve seen these problems solved is to use fiber optics and GPON technologies. You are no longer limited to an electrical signal that faces resistance, you now use light with significantly less resistance and the ability to double or triple the distances that Spectrum is working with. 

Spectrum is a business that focuses on population dense areas. They‚Äôre not in the business of handouts to folks in the woods so they‚Äôre already behind the 8-ball as a hope to solve these problems. 

So we have the technology to get everyone to the FCC definition of broadband. The issues are that the vast majority of costs are man hours for hanging fiber on telephone poles. ~10% of that cost is material the other costs are man hours and equipment to do it. Road work safety is massive for this. 

It starts to fall into the domain of a water utility or electrical utility at this point as there‚Äôs virtually no way to do that at a profit. Grants were an answer to this however these avenues were pulled back after a few years of massive privatized infrastructure investment.

204,204,BullsLawDan,"&gt;The bail system is exactly that, incentive for you to return to court. 

It's not exactly that. It's supposed to be the **least** amount of money that both (1) allows you to be out of jail pending trial, and (2) ensures your return for future hearings. 

The problem is, DA's were abusing the system and judges were going along with it. They would set bail too high for a person to be released, and wait for them to get sick of sitting in jail so the defendant would take any plea just to go home. It caused a **generational** destruction of entire communities. 

For years, people brought this up and DA's pretended to care, well, finally, the people took their tools away.

&gt;It's all based around whether or not you'll return to court, and how much of a danger to society you are. 

No, the amount of bail in NY never was designed around ""how much of a danger to society you are."" In fact in most cases and in most ways judges in NY were explicitly prohibited from considering that.

&gt;Also: Great details on those numbers too bud. Without what those numbers represent and the source for them they're totally useless. 

[Here's one story about the NJ results, the numbers of people who showed up for trial fluctuates from 89% to 91% depending on the source](https://whyy.org/articles/n-j-officials-have-finally-released-data-on-bail-reform-their-conclusion-its-working/)

California and DC have similar numbers (behind academic paywalls if you have access), but the overriding theme is that there's not a big change in how many people show up for trial with these reforms. 

&gt;But yeah. Throw some useless statistics at me say a snarky comment and walk away, probably for the best anyway huh? Perhaps next time offer a fucking explanation instead of literally useless shit and bitchy little comments.

Maybe we could allow them to continue to work with a police escort, not necessarily at their job but on the commute to/from to make sure they only go there and then only return home after.

Any solution will cost more money and that's why no one wants to do it... because they care less about the rights of the accused than they do about saving a few dollars a year in taxes (you can see just from this discussion how most people automatically assume accused people are guilty... which is honestly fucking scary if this is the way our society is going, we are primed for a very dystopian future like this).",1578581410,fdnabew

The governor described the effort as a long overdue criminal justice reform that could help salve wounds in communities affected by the decades-long war on drugs.
‚ÄúFor decades, communities of color were disproportionately affected by the unequal enforcement of marijuana laws,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said in his annual State of the State address. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs legalize adult use of marijuana.‚Äù
The effort comes as the state faces down a $6 billion budget gap; on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, said that legalized marijuana program could bring in $300 million a year in tax revenue, and billions of dollars more in economic activity when fully implemented, though that could be years away.

The governor‚Äôs proposal was part of a lengthy agenda that included bids to boost environmental spending, support small businesses and address a range of social ills, from overpriced feminine products to a lack of diversity on the state‚Äôs farms.
Little mentioned, however, were specific answers to how to solve the looming budget deficit, which is largely a result of overspending on Medicaid.

Mr. Cuomo did not say whether he supported raising taxes on the wealthy ‚Äî a proposal popular with progressives in his party, including the Democratic-led State Assembly ‚Äî or cutting spending to tackle the fiscal imbalance. Instead, Mr. Cuomo said that he wants to slice tax rates for small businesses by a third, something he said would help some 36,000 taxpayers.
At the same time, Mr. Cuomo retained his penchant for higher-priced infrastructure projects, proposing to invest $300 million to repurpose the Erie Canal to attract tourists, $9 million to build a drone facility upstate and an unspecified sum on an ambitious plan¬†[to revamp Penn Station](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-penn-station-nyc.html)¬†to accommodate an additional 175,000 riders by building eight new tracks.

The governor‚Äôs address kicks off the start of the year‚Äôs legislative session, and comes on the heels of a historic year in Albany, where lawmakers passed¬†[major new laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/nyregion/albany-wrapup-legislature-ny.html)¬†on¬†[rent](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/nyregion/rent-protection-regulation.html),¬†[climate change](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/nyregion/greenhouse-gases-ny.html)¬†and¬†[congestion pricing](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/nyregion/congestion-pricing-new-jersey.html), among other issues.

Last year was also a period of transition for Mr. Cuomo: For the first eight years in office, Mr. Cuomo worked with a Republican State Senate, which often backed his pleas for fiscal austerity and batted back progressive reforms. That changed in the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats took control of the Senate with the help of a number of young, liberal candidates who repeatedly challenged Mr. Cuomo, sometimes leading to¬†[heated conflicts](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/nyregion/governor-cuomo-fundraiser-albany-budget.html).
That rift has already surfaced this year, as the governor and other Democrats grapple with the political fallout from a new law that sharply reduced the use of cash bail. The law went into effect on New Year‚Äôs Day, and since then, concerns over a spate of anti-Semitic incidents and other recent¬†[alleged crimes](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Albany-man-accuse-of-woman-s-death-set-free-under-14944854.php)[¬†committed](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/01/04/long-island-burglary-bail-reform/)¬†by those released have led to calls for changes in the law, including by Mr. Cuomo himself.
Mr. Cuomo made no mention of the bail reform on Wednesday during his speech, which included quotations from George Washington, Henry David Thoreau and the singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, and an extended nautical theme, with mentions of rocky shores, rough seas, and a ‚Äúpolitical and social superstorm‚Äù of anger and divisive rhetoric.
Considering the state‚Äôs financial straits, Mr. Cuomo leaned heavily on proposals that would need little or no state funding, like banning gun ownership for people who have committed certain misdemeanor crimes in other states,¬†[banning foam food containers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/nyregion/styrofoam-ban-new-laws-ny.html)¬†and outlawing synthetic opioids similar to fentanyl.

The governor‚Äôs marijuana proposal came with numerous caveats: He said that he intended to coordinate New York‚Äôs plan with similar efforts in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut, though his office later clarified that the state would not wait on other states to pursue its own plan.
He also proposed that New York‚Äôs state university system be enlisted to do research on marijuana and its effects, likening the drug‚Äôs potential peril to that of opioids.
‚ÄúThe federal government failed Americans with opioids,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said, in a briefing book released with the governor‚Äôs speech. ‚ÄúAnd we cannot allow that to happen with cannabinoids.‚Äù
The governor‚Äôs agenda ‚Äî entitled ‚ÄúMaking Progress Happen‚Äù ‚Äî also outlined a robust list of social proposals, with many geared at improving women‚Äôs status in the state, including studies to increase representation for women on corporate boards (California just enacted a¬†[law](https://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/women-boards/)¬†guaranteeing that) and $20 million in grants for female entrepreneurs. Mr. Cuomo also promised to take aim at the so-called pink tax, by which businesses charge women more for services and personal care items.

Mr. Cuomo has trumpeted his actions on gay rights ‚Äî including legalizing same-sex marriage in 2011. His top-line proposal for the L.G.B.T.Q. community ‚Äî permitting paid gestational surrogacy ‚Äî had failed to gain enough support in 2019, after some advocates for women‚Äôs rights and religious groups¬†[argued that such surrogacy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/nyregion/surrogate-pregnancy-law-ny.html)¬†commodifies the body.
On Wednesday, even before Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs speech ended, the state‚Äôs Catholic Conference, said ‚Äúsurrogacy is a dangerous policy that will lead to the exploitation of poor, vulnerable women, and has few safeguards for children.‚Äù
Mr. Cuomo also said that he supported paid sick leave for workers of businesses with five or more employees, and wanted to codify benefits and protections for workers of the growing gig economy, although he did not offer specifics.

Other ideas were recycled, like an equal rights amendment to establish factors such as sex and sexual orientation as protected classes; a law change to allow movie theaters to sell alcohol; and a law to allow automatic voter registration. That idea passed last year, but was waylaid by technical legal concerns; the legislature will pass it again on Thursday. The governor also brought out a revised version of an idea that he recently vetoed: legalizing e-bikes and scooters.

Like last year, Mr. Cuomo made the environment a cornerstone of his agenda: He proposed leveraging $3 billion in bonds to restore wildlife habitats and mitigate flood risks, while offering plans to preserve 4,000 acres of land in the Mid-Hudson Valley and upgrade the wastewater treatment plant at Lake George, a popular vacation spot.
‚ÄúNo economic strategy, no social justice reform, no education policy will be worth a damn if we don‚Äôt have a planet that we can live on,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said.
Mr. Cuomo also took aim at sexual predators, proposing legislation to ban high-risk sexual offenders from New York City‚Äôs subway and prohibit them from using social media, dating apps and video game chats.
If 2019 was any indication, Mr. Cuomo tends to get what he wants from his yearly wish list. The overwhelming majority of his proposals were approved last year, except for marijuana legalization.

 The long answer, for me, is you're ostensibly the property of the State. It's not worth it, politically, to discuss it as an ethical thing to enable (assisted suicide), because it juxaposes taxes with individual suffering. It's not worth it, financially, to spend tax payer money on the beurocracy required to handle such a thing, and some would argue unfair (i.e.: Why should I have my money going to help someone who decided to off themselves? Not my position) 

 It was only in 2007 the State decided they can't just kill people, prohibiting capital punishment, and also until fairly recently, illegal to even attempt suicide in most of the U. S. 

If it's legal for a state to take your life because the deme that you've wronged them, but illegal to take your own for whatever reason I don't see any real basis for it besides a means of control. You are the property of the State and do not have the right to make decisions for them.

Barbaritano will remain free until his Wednesday court appearance. If Bararitano does not go to court for his arraignment, Albany County Judge William Carter must wait 48 hours before signing a warrant for his arrest.

Police and prosecutors say that in early July, Barbaritano wrapped a nylon-styled belt around Nicole Jennings' neck, tied multiple knots, tightened it and plunged a knife into her throat. She was found July 5 inside 8 Brevator St.  On the day Barbaritano was released, Assistant District Attorney Ariel Fallon informed Albany County Judge William Carter that the case could be upgraded to second-degree murder.",1578942993,fea004a

As for unions - Private unions are fine but public ones drive me crazy because there is no one representing the taxpayers at these meetings where unions get pretty much whatever they want and in turn support the candidate that showers them with gifts. Its BS. The gauranteed raises, ridiculous pensions that will cause major financial headaches soon, incredible health care, etc, etc.  Its a gold mine and as a privately employed person I get the bill for THEIR benefits and have to deal with my own.  It aint right. 

As for services.... thats another sticky issue since a lot of us pay for these services but dont get anything from them.  Sure, Florida has less services but if you dont need them then why wouldnt you go there to avoid paying for them?  We have far too many people ""milking"" this stuff and coming u with areative ways to soak the taxpayers for free stuff.  I dont think anyone minds helping those truly in need but its gone too far the other way where its a game now to see how much people can exploit it.  I guess Id rather live somewhere with less services and lower taxes.  

Maybe you're right about Cuomo - perhaps he isnt ""left"" enough but Im not a fan of most leftist policies.  I prefer to handle my own problems and not rely on the Govt to dictate my life or taxthat much of my income for ""feel good"" stuff. Im a working class guy and just want to keep more of what I earn.

Ah. Well, I'm here to tell you, as someone who is far more expert here than you, that your common sense isn't correct.

In other jurisdictions that have removed cash bail and made lower level offenses ROR, removing bail has basically not even moved the needle on how many people show up to court. In NJ for example it's still around 90%, which is the same percentage it was at before they removed cash bail.

So, to be blunt, your ""common sense"" is wrong, and you need to listen to people who actually have done the research on this.
 
&gt;I don‚Äôt believe the old system was perfect, but at least there was a financial cost for those who fled. 

See, again, this is your ignorance. For most people there wasn't. A bail bondsman pays the bail. The person pays the bondsman a non-refundable fee. They aren't getting that back whether they show up or not. 

What you need to do here is admit you really don't know what you're talking about, and listen to people who are telling you what is going on, without some reason to lie (for example, elected Sheriffs and DAs who have an incentive to keep conviction rates high, even if it puts innocent people in jail).

&gt;This bail reform has not only helped the poor get released, it has also helped those with means to flee. 


No, it hasnt.

&gt;On top of all this is: When someone flee‚Äôs who goes after them? In the past the bail bondsman (who have a financial interest) would.

Well, for starters, there are a bunch of former jail deputies sitting on their hands, now that there are 80% fewer people in jail.

But what you don't realize is it's not even a major issue. Bail or not, the vast majority of people show up for court, and the ones who don't are by and large not running, but aren't showing up for some other reason. Like not knowing when they need to appear, or not having transportation, or needing to work, or needing child care, and so on.",1579458383,fezktis

Dangerousness has never been a factor for these crimes in NY. 

Before the bail reform, he would have received bail (meaning he would be out if he had the money). The only thing this law changed is that he doesn't have to pay a bail bondsman a few to put up his bail anymore. That's literally the only change.

Here is a food for thought for you: In Russia we don‚Äôt have bail system so person who may or may not have committed  a crime is decided to go to jail, stay in house arrest or sign an agreement to stay in town/country depending on how serious the crime was. The difference money makes - the quality of lawyer that advocates lesser measures for you.

If you think the bondsman pays all that money without some kind of guarantee, you are naive. This means there is a non-refundable cost, plus maybe your moms house, car, or other promise to pay. For example, I personally had a $50k bond. I put up $5k plus 2 vehicle titles and a boat title. 
I still believe that people charged with what I consider serious crimes ( stalking, 2nd degree manslaughter, assault, robbery, burglary) if given the chance to flee...will. Maybe because I don‚Äôt live in a place where such crimes are commonplace.

  1. With respect to any principal, the court in all cases, unless otherwise provided by law, must impose the least restrictive kind and degree of control or restriction that is necessary to secure the principal's return to court when required. In determining that matter, the court must, on the basis of available information, consider and take into account information about the principal that is relevant to the principal's return to court, including:

  (a) The principal's activities and history;

  (b) If the principal is a defendant, the charges facing the principal;

  (c) The principal's criminal conviction record if any;

  (d) The principal's record of previous adjudication as a juvenile delinquent, as retained pursuant to section 354.2 of the family court act, or, of pending cases where fingerprints are retained pursuant to section 306.1 of such act, or a youthful offender, if any;

  (e) The principal's previous record with respect to flight to avoid criminal prosecution;

  (f) If monetary bail is authorized, according to the restrictions set forth in this title, the principal's individual financial circumstances, and, in cases where bail is authorized, the principal's ability to post bail without posing undue hardship, as well as his or her ability to obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond;

&gt;An NYPD officer and his fianc√©e who allegedly starved and abused his autistic eight-year-old son, taunted the child for being cold as he collapsed from hypothermia after being forced into an unheated garage overnight in 'freezing temperatures.'

&gt;Micahel Valva, 40, and Angela Pollina, 42, attempted to emulate the Brady Bunch with their blended family - Valva's three sons and Pollina's three children- but that facade fell apart after little Thomas Valva died on January 17. 

&gt;Valva‚Äôs initial story ‚Äì that Thomas was trying to catch the school bus and died after falling in the driveway - quickly came apart as homicide detectives investigated the death. 

&gt;Audio obtained by authorities from family surveillance footage at the couple's home, captured him mocking and joking about his son, who as suffering severe effect from hypothermia that would later kill him, to his fiance. He was also recorded telling her he was 'f**king suffocating' the child. 

&gt;The couple was arrested at their Long Island home for second-degree murder on Friday by Suffolk County officers.

&gt;The tragic incident began when Valva became enraged with Thomas and proceeded to beat the child before banishing the boy to the family's frigid garage when temperatures were a bitter 19 degrees that night.  

&gt;The following morning, Thomas was so cold that he was 'face-planting' on the floor because his body had gone into hypothermia, according to Assistant District Attorney Laura Newcombe who cited extensive audio recording's taken from home security footage. 

&gt;Nearly every room was set up with surveillance cameras to closely monitor the children, with labeling based on the child's name and room.  

&gt;The camera found inside the garage was ominously labelled 'kids room.'

&gt;Thomas and Anthony Valva, his older brother, were seen on camera sleeping on the garage's concrete floor and 'shivering' two nights before the boy's death.

&gt;‚ÄôThey are on cold concrete. There are no pillows, no blankets, no mattress,' said Newcombe.

&gt;New York Post reports that one of the other children asks why Thomas can't walk. 

&gt;Pollina said: 'Because he‚Äôs hypothermic. When you wash with cold water and it‚Äôs freezing out you become hypothermic'.

&gt;She later asks Valva the same question only to receive a callous response from the father. 

&gt;‚ÄôBecause he‚Äôs cold. Boo f**king hoo,' he said, according to prosecutors at the couple's arraignment. 

&gt;At one point, Pollina walked into the garage and asked Valva what he was doing. 

&gt;‚ÄôI‚Äôm f**king suffocating him that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing,' Valva said, prompting Pollina to answer, 'Take your hands off his mouth. There are people everywhere.'

&gt;Before calling 911, Valva is said to have placed the boy's cold body in a warm bath to raise his core temperature.

&gt;Authorities were dispatched to 11 Bittersweet Lane around 9.40am following reports that Thomas had fallen in the driveway and lost consciousness.

&gt;Responding officers found Valva performing CPR on Thomas in the basement before he was rushed to Long Island Community Hospital and pronounced dead.     

&gt;Thomas' body temperature was just 76 degrees - 21 degrees below a normal temperature - when doctors later attempted to revive him.

&gt;‚ÄôThe medical examiner has ruled it a homicide with a major contributing factor of hypothermia. We believe certainly that Thomas was kept in the garage overnight preceding his death,' Suffolk Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart said, according to NBC News.        

&gt;In addition to hypothermia, Thomas also suffered head and face injuries that were not consistent with Valva's story. 

&gt;‚ÄôWe have determined Thomas was never in the driveway that morning and he suffered head and facial injuries that were not consistent with the father's account.' 

&gt;Besides Thomas, Valva's six-year-old and 10-year-old brothers lived with the couple, as did Pollina's 11-year-old twin daughters and her six-year-old son.  

&gt;The home security footage also helped investigators discovered that Valva's other sons were punished with 'food deprivation and exposure to extremely frigid temperatures.' 

&gt;Newcombe said that authorities had conducted a welfare check at the home in May 2019, but the family was not home. 

&gt;The remaining children have been placed in Child Protective Services.

&gt;‚ÄôWe are still investigating the extent of the abuse and if it extended to all of the children,' said Hart.",1579998055,ffjh0m8

I like AOC - she's smart despite what those ridiculous right wing memes say. With that said, if she - or really anyone unseated Schumer, we'd no longer have a senator who is party leader in the senate, and when it goes up for vote, another experienced, well-liked senator will get the position. 

Now - if she unseated Gilibrand who is NOT the minority leader, that would make more sense. With that said, Senator is a big job, and I think no matter how much I agree with her, in general, she needs the legislative experience to do a good job on such a high level.

Most apartments are shown with the windows closed, open the windows to get a feel for noise levels (try to see apartments at rush hour).

Check the address against the DOB complaint website. You can see if there are consistent complaints from tenants (heat, hot water, noise, rodents, structural issues, etc...).

Check the garbage collection room, make sure it is well maintained and clean. 

Make sure the ""street door"" is well maintained and secure.

Check the heat source. Some apartments include heat and some do.

Is the AC thru the wall? Or will you have to put ACs in the windows during the summer (added expense, plus you'll need room to store them during the winter). 

ALWAYS change the key cylinder to the front door when you move in ASAP.  You have no idea how many other people may have keys to the apartment.

You don't need years to get vetted. As a matter of fact, if you are illegal and even commit a small crime, you get deported. There's a reason why the 11 million undocumented in this country are not gone. The government knows who they are.

So you either support open borders or you're a racist? I find it difficult to reconcile that argument.

&gt;Contrary to popular belief, illegal immigrants don't cause an increase in crime.

I live in an immigrant heavy community. There are plenty of undocumented people here, they work hard and follow the law. But it is disingenuous to argue allowing tens of millions of unvetted people into the country wont include bad apples. It's not right when a legal resident is a victim of a crime committed by someone who isnt supposed to be here. I think anyone convicted of a crime should be deported. Put the hardworking, otherwise law abiding undocumented on a path to legal status. 

&gt;The truth of the matter is, the immigration system isn't hard because of vetting, but an attempt to maintain white Americans as the majority.

This is disingenuous. 1965 immigration laws spear headed by Ted Kennedy (D) changed the immigration laws opening up the country from poor and developing countries away from European centric immigration.

1123,1123,cityboy2,"Going off your two main disagreements, I already stated that well into the 80s, U.S. immigration law was quite progressive, including even Reagan's amnesty.

However since then and the rise of nationalism, the Tea Party, and a post-9/11 world, immigration has become more and more restricted.

As for your first point, I should make it clear that I do not support open borders, however I am arguing that due to such restrictive immigration laws and procedures, illegal immigration is left as the only option for many not grandfathered into the system.

I also argue that the present restrictive immigration laws are based on fear of other nationalities and people, hence xenophobia. 

Furthermore, the fight against illegal immigration is based on such xenophobia and racism, evidence includes the use of dog whistles, stolen jobs from ""real Americans"", hence making the argument based more on nationalism than actual security. We see such comments come alive through fear mongering of things like the caravan of refugees with Fox news focusing their forecast on them 24/7, comments about shithole countries, etc. 

As for bad apples among illegal immigrants, I should make it clear that I am against the current system and advocate for the system to be reformed so those bad apples are properly vetted. For example, giving illegal immigrants a legal path to immigration that includes such vetting.",1581034671,fgqz8m4

However, I don't agree the fight against illegal immigration as always being based on xenophobia and racism.

I think if you're a country, you need to have a rule of law, you need to maintain your borders and vet those who would cross them. And it does irk me that as a naturalized citizen, so many people cheat the system, even if it is broke. What place would I have as a non citizen to disregard this country's laws, even the broken ones?

I think it would be revolutionary and world changing if there was more cross bordering in the Americas, North and South. And the US needs immigration if it wants to remain a world power.",1581037359,fgr3kx3

I guess what I'm trying to say is, if illegal immigrants were given a process to immigrate legally, even if it was a difficult process, many would take it instead of illegal immigration.

We also have to take into account the countries that people are illegally coming from, countries like Guatemala and El Salvador which currently suffer tremendously from anarchy, civil war, drug wars, extreme gang violence, etc.

People are not cheating the system because they want to, it's because they have to.

The Equal Protection Clause is a clause from the text of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The clause, which took effect in 1868, provides ""nor shall any State [...] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"".

A primary motivation for this clause was to validate the equality provisions contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which guaranteed that all citizens would have the guaranteed right to equal protection by law. As a whole, the Fourteenth Amendment marked a large shift in American constitutionalism, by applying substantially more constitutional restrictions against the states than had applied before the Civil War.

     3    ¬ß 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
     4  declares  that  protecting the physical, mental and behavioral health of
     5  veterans is critical to ensure successful re-entry into  civilian  life.
     6  Studies  have shown that time outdoors can be a valuable adjunct therapy
     7  in addition to more traditional health care, while also  reducing  reli-
     8  ance  on prescription medication. The therapeutic benefits of time spent
     9  outdoors is clinically proven  and  is  known  to  help  reduce  stress,
    10  improve concentration, and promote overall well-being, both physical and
    11  mental.  Outdoor-based  therapeutic programs hold particular promise for
    12  people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress  Disorder,  Military  Sexual
    13  Trauma,  Traumatic  Brain  Injury,  and Substance Use Disorders. Outdoor
    14  programs including adventure therapy, wilderness therapy,  horticultural
    15  therapy,  walk-and-talk  therapy,  and  other nature-based programs, are
    16  currently being used by mental health professionals  and  are  shown  to
    17  have  benefits  including reduction of stress, restoration of attention,
    18  and an improved sense of well-being. New York state is home  to  natural
    19  beauty from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, and has a significant

     2  Recognizing the healing benefits of outdoor-based  therapeutic  programs
     3  to  residents of the state, particularly veterans and individuals recov-
     4  ering  from substance abuse or a physical or mental trauma, the legisla-
     5  ture supports the establishment of an outdoor Rx act.
     6    ¬ß 3. 1. The director of the division of veterans' services  shall,  in
     7  consultation with the office of parks, recreation and historic preserva-
     8  tion,  the  department  of environmental conservation, the department of
     9  health, and the office of mental health, review:
    10    a. barriers that exist to provide veterans with  increased  access  to
    11  state  lands  and  opportunities  for medical treatment and nature-based
    12  therapy and programming, including barriers to transportation,  handicap
    13  accessibility,  cultural  barriers, mental health stigmas, public aware-
    14  ness of state outdoor resources, lack of experience in the outdoors, and
    15  funding for public and private programs;
    16    b. current state policies regarding  free  and  discounted  access  to
    17  state  parks,  lands,  and recreational facilities by veterans, service-
    18  connected disabled veterans, gold star families, and other military-con-
    19  nected individuals;
    20    c. opportunities to formalize coordination  between  the  division  of
    21  veterans'  services,  other  state  agencies,  and partner organizations
    22  regarding the use of public lands or other outdoor spaces to  facilitate
    23  access, medical treatment and nature-based therapy for veterans;
    24    d.  state  lands,  based  on veterans' demographics including, but not
    25  limited to, service-connected disabled veterans, that should  be  prior-
    26  itized for access;
    27    e.  recommendations, following consultation with appropriate veterans'
    28  outdoor recreation groups, to reduce barriers and better facilitate  the
    29  use  of  state  owned  and  managed lands for access, preventative care,
    30  medical treatment, and nature-based therapy; and
    31    f. estimated costs of implementing such recommendations and  expanding
    32  access/benefits,  as  well as potential funding sources, including state
    33  funding and public-private partnership opportunities.

    35  months  from  the  effective date of this act, the division of veterans'
    36  services shall submit findings to the governor, the temporary  president
    37  of  the  senate, the speaker of the assembly, the minority leader of the
    38  senate, the minority leader of the assembly, the chair of  the  assembly
    39  committee on veterans' affairs, and the chair of the senate committee on

1304,1304,asafum,"Come on now, no one but the opposition ever says anything about ""free stuff."" We would all be paying through taxation, not just one group or another unless you're super poor in which case we should all be wanting to help these people anyway. We have a real bad tendency to imagine all poor people as all lazy and that it's 100% their fault. My brother is just one small example, but he's not mentally disabled enough to be considered disabled for state care, but in no way can he ever hold a job that will pay enough to support himself. It's not his fault he was born with this condition and I can't afford to pay for all of us on my own. Some people are even more intelligent than him, but still not capable/intelligent by no fault of their own to find/do a job that would pay ""enough."" As a society we should all look out for each other.

Instead of the $12k/year my boss pays to the insurance company we would all be paying a much lesser amount in taxes and not have to pay at the hospital. Now imagine if you had a great employer that wanted to maintain your compensation, so maybe not all 12k as you figure for taxes, but imagine something like 9k extra in ""cash"" to you as they aren't paying for your insurance anymore but want to maintain your compensation. The same goes for tuition, if we get tax funded education that we all pay for then students will be putting as much money as possible back into local economies once they start their careers as opposed to being loaded with debt and trying to save as much as possible. 

We know there's no such thing as a free lunch and we have reasons for wanting these plans. We believe they'll work. :)",1581442064,fhbgx7j

I just think Bernie wants to spend way too much money on things and doesnt have a way to fund it other than taking it from those that earn it.  I cant get on board with that.",1581442818,fhbi88y
1306,1306,asafum,"I'm with you there, I'm kinda sour about paying it all off too since the whole reason I didn't go to college yet was having all that debt. Setting the interest rate to 0% is a good idea too.",1581443177,fhbiuto
1307,1307,QuiGonMike,Yeah - just get rid of the ridiculous interest rates.  I can get a car loan for 1.9% but college loans are like 7%-8%?  WTF is that?

1308,1308,UEMcGill,"Yeah except the math doesn't work out.

The plan would tax your employer at the amount he pays now for your plan. So you'd be trading private funding for an oligopy for a public taxed monopoly. How's that work in places like Italy? You have long waits and denials of service for minor non life threatening things, but sure good care for emergency stuff. And they pay more in taxes. Oh and people who are better off? Still have private insurance because well, the government runs the Healthcare.

Want to make college more affordable? Flood the market with supply. Instead of cheap credit that removes the risk from the lenders and drives up the cost of tuition because of rent seeking. College enrollment is down because the cost benefit isn't there.  Instead of free tuition why not more capable schools producing real life skills?

It always floors me that people like Bernie lament about how bad the government is, and how it excludes the common man from getting ahead and yet his proposal is to make it even bigger? Big government is opportunity for big corruption.",1581445780,fhbn9ld

Right.  Instead of profit, you'd create a massive bureaucracy whose institutional and mission creep would be unchecked by that pesky thing called profit.  We all need another massive government department whose sole job is to disperse money.  Do you think rent-seeking is bad now?  It will turn into corruption and denial of service.

That pesky thing called profit which is in theory a feedback mechanism on the system that we rely on heavily to produce positive outcomes is producing negative outcomes at an ever increasing rate and to an ever increasing degree.

Replace one poorly performing economic system with another, even worse performing system and you will get an even worse outcome.  European systems are small compared to the US.  The biggest country? Germany, at about 1/4 the size of the US.  It has a blended healthcare system.  Single Payer systems are countries like Italy.  Where corruption and denial of service are rampant.  All of them are fighting cost overruns and lack of capacity.  So why do you think we're all that special that it won't happen to us?

Bernie doesn't understand economics or unintended consequences.  It's a horrible idea that will turn into the biggest boondoggle in the world.  It will start off ok.  But then the government will need to increase the size of the agency.  Then government workers will get fat pensions, and oh now we have to include this job and that job, etc.  Then they'll start telling doctors ""We'll only pay this much"" because hey we can negotiate prices!  And doctors will say, ""Fuck you.  Don't pay me that."" and only take private insurance.  And then, the government will have to tell them ""Ok, no more private insurance"" and then doctors will say ""No thanks"" and many will leave, but also many won't become doctors, because hey they can go into research or something else, and not have to deal with the government.

These are a small minority of the country's population.  Their greed and desire to have it all is leaving the vast majority of people to be living day by day.

The majority of people who are hurting DO work for a living, and it's a bullshit narrative to suggest otherwise.

So the wealthy and the businesses get to enjoy huge profits on the back of ""cheap"" labor.

And that's exactly what you're claiming, and you forgive yourself by saying ""anyone else could have what I have if they just worked harder"" but that is literally a myth, a total fucking myth, which leads you to believe that everyone who doesn't have what you have simply doesn't deserve it.  It's fucking sad.

&gt;  Oh and its ironic how the usually very ""left leaning"" unions have NO interest in Bernies free, crappy health care.

First, unions are EXACTLY what Bernie loves, because unions fight damn hard to ensure that their workers actually have real health care.  That's the reason why they don't care as much about healthcare, and its also why Bernie wants to increase union membership by 2x.

Second, unions have been near eviscerated in the past few decades by major corporations, such that union workers, and those with good health care, are no longer the norm.

Third, it's a lie to say unions have NO interest in Bernie, nothing more than a long list of lies you seem to be telling yourself.  The following unions support Bernie, and you should ask yourself, why?

*  American Postal Workers Union (200K workers)

*  National Nurses United (150K workers)

* United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers (50K workers)

* National Union of Healthcare Workers (20K workers)

And while major national unions have not endorsed ANY candidate, it's noteworthy that the LOCAL branches of national unions HAVE endorsed Bernie.  For example, the NH LOCAL branch of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) (the 2nd biggest union in the US) broke with the national union's ""non endorsement"" policy and endorsed Sanders.  And its not ""small"" local chapters doing this: the Los Angeles local chapter of American Federation of Teachers (AFT) (the 3rd biggest union in the US) also endorsed Sanders.  And the largest local chapter of United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) (the 6th biggest union in the US) endorsed Sanders.  

And if we look at 2016, we can expect many of the major unions to endorse Bernie.  In 2016, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) (the 7th biggest union in the US) endorsed Bernie over Hilary.

&gt; Health care is readily available to people in this country

Another lie.  Literally 30 million people have no healthcare, and thousands go bankrupt due to medical bills.  That simply is NOT how it is in every other major democratic western nation.  On what planet do you live that you think folk have ""ready"" access to healthcare.  Most folk literally hold off on medical care due to the expenses involved.

&gt; I love how Bernie used our health care to get his heart trouble taken care of so fast. Ironic, isnt it?

I don't think you understand what irony is.  Bernie is a senator which means he is covered under the  Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).  That program is 90% of what he is suggesting should be extended to all americans, as that program is subsidized by the federal government that amounts to about 3/4 of a person's subsidies being paid for BY THE GOVERNMENT.

Literally you are arguing from a place of complete ignorance.

&gt; Its OK for him to be rich but not anyone else. Fail.

Another retarded argument.

He isn't saying you are evil for being rich, he is saying rich people should pay more in taxes.  As a ""rich"" person, he would be subject to his own taxes, so he isn't an exception.

I'll assume you make less than $500K.  If so, Bernie's tax plan literally has ZERO IMPACT on you and your wife.  He wants to raise taxes big time, yes, but only on high earners.  https://www.bernietax.com/#150000;5277;mj

&gt; We worked for it though. Bernie didnt give it to us and neither did any Govt boob. 

What on earth is the point of such a stupid statement?  Bernie isn't saying he did give it to you, and he isn't saying you didn't earn it either.  You're just saying nonsensical talking points that ""sound good"" but literally make no sense.

&gt; Under the guise of ""fairness"" I will see a tax INCREASE and so will almost everyone that ""dares"" to produce at a level that gives them a home and a few nice things(like classic middle class here, NOT rich people). 

Again, you lie ... and it's pretty obvious you're lying.  Bernie has been pretty transparent about his tax plan.  Maybe you've not even read it.

&gt;  Whats ""selfish"" is socialism and stealing money from people to distribute it as you see fit. Sorry.

So let me get this straight, it's ""selfish"" to take 40%+ in taxes from folk who earn $500K or more from their ""labor,"" when the average american earns less than 1/10th of that.  So in order to allow the $500K earner to not simply own a home and a few nice things, but to literally earn enough money to be able to BUY A NEW HOME EACH YEAR, we should make it so that 10 other americans can't even afford rent.

Cool, so we agree, though I'm confused when you say ""possibly education"" - are you seriously suggesting we shouldn't pay taxes for free education of children, like seriously?

&gt; Im sure if we removed the bloat and BS that we wouldnt need to tax people as badly as they want to. 

I love when folk say this ... okay, cool ... so the annual budget is about 4 trillion each year.  In order to have some sort of MATERIAL impact on your taxes, you will want to cut 1 trillion of that spend, but even that only reduces taxes by 25% ... I would argue you really want to kill 2 trillion to see a real impact (assuming a similar decrease in state taxes.  

If you make $500K, reducing the budget by 25% will likely save you about $60K of $250K paid in federal and state taxes.  But reducing 50% will save you big money - $125K of the $250K you paid.  

So here is my simple question - look at a regular budget (not Trump's budget for this year because its bloated as fuck).  Pick Obama's last budget when he was president, and identify what you'd cut.  Seriously, I challenge you.

What you'll find is that the costs to maintain what is ""necessary"" is pretty fucking high.  The only real source of bloat is spending on the military ... if you want to cut that, I'm 100% behind ya.

&gt;  the public unions are a bad idea(even FDR thought so) and add a lot of cost,

So all public unions due is fight for workers rights.  So what exactly is it that, say, postal workers get, that you think is a ""bad idea"" that would save MATERIAL costs?  Seriously, how are postal workers ruining america?

&gt; and then programs on top of programs that spawn more programs. Govt is like a virus.

This is rhetoric - give me SPECIFICS.

&gt; Flat taxes get everyone equally. A rich guy will pay MORE than a poor guy with a flat tax because XXX% of a million bucks is more money than XXX% of 100K bucks. Right?

A flat tax also means that a poor person gets hit with taxes on necessities.  It means that a poor person has to pay 20% (or whatever) on necessities, and that should not be the case for obvious reasons.

&gt; Right? Why do we want to penalize success?

This is such a stupid fox news talking point.  You aren't ""penalizing"" success.  Those who are successful, STILL MAKE MONEY.  They just don't make as much money.  The reason is that penalties need to increase with wealth in order to stay a penalty (a $300 parking ticket to a postal worker is NOT the same as a $300 parking ticket to a millionaire).  The other reason why is that we believe that those who are wealthy don't ""deserve"" the money because they are ""better"" than other human beings, they were simply able to get there money.  If you actually know wealthy people, they are NOT smarter than average folk in MANY instances.  They aren't ""better"" in terms of much of anything other than luck or opportunity.  

&gt; Why is that so ""in"" now? 

You do realize that the United States has taxed the rich SIGNIFICANTLY MORE for a very long time.  It is actually only ""in"" now, since Reagan, not to tax rich people.  Bernie's tax rates are returning us to tax rates that America had for DECADES in and before the 1970s.

&gt; Our jobs and the economy depend on those mean, evil rich people.

Da fuck you talking about.  My job does not depend on Jeff Bezos.  In fact, his money has been made on the back of DECREASING jobs by eliminating local stores.  You seriously don't understand how economies of scale harm the lower class.

1451,1451,joez37,"&gt;I‚Äôve been working in public schools in a very low-income area for the  last few years and I fully believe that would have changed things for  the kids I work with and their communities. Bernie‚Äôs idea of guaranteed  federal jobs would do nothing to address families who are already  working and can‚Äôt make ends meet and would not give these families the **much** needed time with their children.

I'm not against UBI. I think we should give it a shot on a smaller scale to start with, say, in a poor state like W. Virginia and see what happens. Once we work out the kinks, we could implement it nationwide perhaps. I would be all for experiments like that, and Bernie is an open- minded guy, I think he could be persuaded to do such an experiment. After all he was alerting people about climate change in the eighties and warned people about getting embroiled in the Middle East before the first Iraq war. Not to mention being decades ahead in advocating for gay rights when he first started politics. 

With regard to helping working families, you have to admit that Medicare for All would help out A LOT. I looked at Yang's plan and while I like his ideas for incentivizing cost-cutting and such and preventive care (all things we definitely ought to do), it would not immediately help out lots of struggling people (87 million with no health insurance or underinsured) who need healthcare. Lots of states have not extended Medicaid to low-income adults so those people are now out of luck, and it is such an expense and burden that it could very well eat up the whole 1k divdend for some families. Bernie also has policies to directly increase the SS payouts to low-income disabled and older Americans. He is also advocating universal daycare and college as you know. With help on all these problems, a lot of struggling working families could be helped.",1581698152,fhlb0lo

1641,1641,autumntown3,"The only thing you‚Äôre really going to find in Manhattan with that combined salary are studio apartments that are the size of your current closet, if you can find anything at all (and that‚Äôs not an exaggeration). You should source the other boroughs for places as they‚Äôre all still close to the city and an easy commute in (most places you live outside of manhattan won‚Äôt take much more than 20-40 mins max on the train, sometimes 10 mins if you live right on the edge of a borough). You have to keep in mind that the more prime or known or desirable the area is, the more you will end up paying for a lot less space. You can find some pretty spacious (spacious by NY standards that is) apartments in areas you may know a little less about, that will be a lot more affordable than the tiny closet you‚Äôll be spending life savings on in Manhattan. Some neighborhoods to check out in Brooklyn: Crown Heights, Bed Stuy, and Prospect Park have apartments with great bones, I lived in a really nice place in Bed Stuy and I‚Äôve seen some stunning older buildings in Crown and Prospect that were really affordable. If you don‚Äôt want to live as far south in BK, a lot of Bushwick is affordable. If you want a more hyped Brooklyn neighborhood, (hyped in this case meaning one you‚Äôve heard more about) Greenpoint and Williamsburg could be for you. Both neighborhoods are a bit more expensive but you‚Äôd be close to Manhattan and it would still be more affordable than Manhattan (and you‚Äôre a close train stop away). Don‚Äôt look at DUMBO in Brooklyn because it is the number one most expensive area to live in New York (but do visit there because it‚Äôs stunning).
For Queens, a lot of people choose Astoria or on the other end of Queens, Ridgewood (which is closer to Brooklyn). Some areas of Queens are not as close to the trains so be sure to research your areas a bit if you‚Äôre looking there. 

There‚Äôs a lot to unpack, but in short, I would say definitely look into other boroughs vs trying to live in Manhattan as it‚Äôs really not very affordable.",1582287528,fi9yffg

1754,1754,dynex811,"Okay I am not doing any more research on this. But, NY leads the residential deaths in raw numbers but not in rate. NY has had 268 residential fire deaths in the last two years (Jan1 2018 to Jan1 2020) while Kentucky has had 113. That means NY has had almost 14 deaths per million people while Kentucky has had 25. In fact out of the other high death states I looked at ([source here](https://apps.usfa.fema.gov/civilian-fatalities/incident/reportMap)) New York isn't all *that*  bad. Please note these numbers come from media reports.

&amp;#x200B;

|State|Population|Res. Fire Deaths|Rate per Million|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NY| 19,540,000 |268|13.7|
|KY| 4,468,000 |113|25.3|
|TN| 6,770,000 |145|21.4|
|MO| 6,126,000 |123|20.1|
|MI| 9,996,000 |200|20.0|
|PA| 12,810,000 |245|15.5|

So New York does not lead in rate of deaths. Now on to causes:

For New York I have found very few hard statistics for fires causes. According to the [Health Department of NYS the leading cause of fires are cooking, mainly caused by people leaving the kitchen unattended](https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/injury_prevention/children/fact_sheets/10-19_years/home_fire_prevntion_10-19_years.htm). The problem is I don't know if this is a nationwide statistic and no definitive numbers are provided. I have will email them cause now I'm curious. 

According to FEMA, the nationwide [leading cause of Fire is cooking at 51%](https://www.usfa.fema.gov/data/statistics/#causesR) but this is *nationwide.* According to the fatality statistics for NY there is no real useful information as 90% of the causes are under investigation but not many outright point to heating (though with the majority under investigation that's not sayign much). You can search it yourself [here](https://apps.usfa.fema.gov/civilian-fatalities/incident/reportList?id=New%20York&amp;format=html&amp;page=1&amp;listFormat=&amp;mapFormat=&amp;searchStartDate=Wed%20Jan%2001%2000:00:00%20EST%202020&amp;searchEndDate=Sat%20Feb%2029%2000:00:00%20EST%202020&amp;searchCause=&amp;searchResidentialBuildingType=&amp;searchChildren=&amp;searchOlderAdults=&amp;searchDisabled=&amp;searchMale=&amp;searchFemale=&amp;searchMulti=&amp;searchSmokeAlarmsNotPresent=&amp;searchSmokeAlarmsPresent=&amp;searchSmokeAlarmsPresentDisabled=).

Okay now for non government sources, according to the Fireman's Association of New York the major causes are [not having a functioning smoke alarm and improperly maintained heating equipment](https://wbng.com/2019/12/17/fasny-new-york-leads-nation-in-fire-deaths-in-2019/). I have not been able to find the stats they used but I'll keep looking.

According to the National Fire Protection Association, heating accounts for only [15% of fires and of those space heaters cause 44% of incidents and 86% of heating related deaths.](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/US-Fire-Problem/Heating-equipment)

So as of right now I cannot believe that this gas shortage is causing deaths. That said nothing here disproves it either the fact is there is not enough evidence for me to draw on. But that means that it is unlikely there is enough evidence for others to draw on also. 

So PLEASE if you have a source linking the shortages to fires I want to see it because I spent too much time looking this up when I have work to do.",1583009376,fj4izrq
1755,1755,ofd227,"You'd have to examine NFIRs data from OFPC to get a actual number of heating related home fire.   I will the majority of fires I've been to are always heating related from using wood or coal due to lack of access to cheap heating fuel (hint natural gas).

We also don't have any source which states there is an increase in alternative fuel sources. If it's common sense then it should be easy enough to find.

This is the stupidest way to go ""green"" because it turns people off the idea of being green altogether. Instead of dealing with a systemic problem of a disposable culture we go after one of the few things that offer people real tangible convenience with little to no environmental impact. And as part of that deal we scare people off the idea of doing anything else because damn this green stuff sucks.

Bottom line, they're idiots and the blowback from this could flip the political landscape. What if the next election is the ""bring back the plastic bags"" election? Maybe we get a shitheel republican just because people are pissed off about bags.",1583201377,fjbtzmm

Coronavirus in N.Y.: Cuomo Declares State of Emergency
The announcement came as the number of patients in New York rose to 89, including a Queens driver who worked for Uber.

March 7, 2020

ALBANY, N.Y. ‚Äî Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday as the number of coronavirus cases in New York rose to 89, which include a Queens driver who worked for Uber and two unexplained positive tests of patients 200 miles to the north.

Moving on multiple fronts to curb the spread of the virus, Mr. Cuomo said the state of emergency would allow New York‚Äôs government to respond faster by lifting regulations.

The governor‚Äôs announcement came as concerns about the outbreak grew in New York City, which has 12 confirmed cases, up from six that were disclosed as of Friday. The epicenter in New York State continues to be just north of the city, in Westchester County, where there are 70 cases in total.

These cases were mostly, if not all, related to a cluster in Westchester that first came to the authorities‚Äô attention after a New Rochelle resident, a 50-year-old lawyer, was confirmed as New York‚Äôs second coronavirus patient.

State officials said they were testing dozens of mouth and nasal swabs from people who might have been exposed to the lawyer, who has been hospitalized but whose condition is said to be improving. Technicians are working around the clock at private and public laboratories, including a major site near the State Capitol.

In the United States, more than 380 cases of the virus have been confirmed, and at least 19 people have died, according to a New York Times database.

Despite the spread in the state and the mounting toll of the virus, which has killed more than 3,500 people worldwide, Mr. Cuomo sought to calm the public during a news conference in Albany.

‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs worse than the virus ‚Äî the anxiety,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said, noting that most patients would suffer mild or no symptoms.

The declaration of emergency will allow the state to speed up the purchasing of supplies and the hiring of workers to assist local health departments that have been handling the monitoring of thousands of self-quarantined patients, Mr. Cuomo said.

‚ÄúSomebody has to go knock on their door, once a day,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is labor intensive.‚Äù

The declaration would also allow officials to skirt purchasing regulations, if necessary, he said.

Still, there were signs that the outbreak was spreading, including a pair of patients in Saratoga County, north of Albany ‚Äî the first such confirmed cases outside of the New York City region.

On Friday night, the Uber driver from Queens tested positive, and the case prompted more than 40 doctors, nurses and other workers at a hospital there to go into voluntary self-isolation over fears that they might have been exposed to the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday.

The man, 33, walked into St. John‚Äôs Episcopal Hospital in the Far Rockaway section of Queens on Tuesday and reported flulike symptoms. He went home and returned later when his symptoms worsened, an official said.

Dozens of workers at the hospital are now being tested, officials said.

‚ÄúObviously, 40 people are out,‚Äù said Councilman Donovan Richards Jr., a Democrat who represents Far Rockaway. ‚ÄúThe hospital will need to replace those people temporarily. They will need money to do that. They need supplies. We need to keep the health care up and running.‚Äù

Tom Melillo, a hospital spokesman, said that the patient remained in quarantine at the hospital on Saturday, and that hospital officials were monitoring everyone who might have been exposed to the patient.

A spokesman for Uber, Andrew Hasbun, confirmed that the man worked as a driver for the app. The company is assisting health officials to determine whether the man exposed passengers to the illness, Mr. Hasbun said.

The man was not licensed to pick up passengers in the city or at its two airports, but he was free to drop off passengers in the five boroughs, the company said. Those limitations might affect the number of people he exposed to the virus.

Other cases in New York City include three family members who live in the Upper West Side, two Brooklyn women in their 60s and 70s who showed symptoms after returning from a cruise in Egypt and a Brooklyn man in his 30s who remains hospitalized after visiting Italy, one of countries with the biggest outbreaks outside China.

Several of the new cases announced on Saturday in upstate New York added a layer of mystery to exactly how residents were contracting the coronavirus.

In Saratoga County, the two new cases involved a 57-year-old pharmacist and a 52 year-old woman who may have contracted the virus through contact with a Pennsylvania resident at a conference in Miami.

The source of contraction seemed more direct in Westchester County: All 23 new cases announced on Saturday involved people who had been in contact with the New Rochelle man, Mr. Cuomo said.

The man, a partner at a small Midtown Manhattan law firm, had attended synagogue services before becoming symptomatic.

Public health officials closed the synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, and asked that anyone who had attended services, a bat mitzvah or a funeral there recently isolate themselves as a precaution.

Also on Saturday, the governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, said a New York doctor who commutes to work at Bridgeport Hospital tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Lamont said the physician did not show visible symptoms while treating patients and isolated himself.

New Jersey officials said four people in the state had tested positive for the virus: a 32-year-old man, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 30s, all from Bergen County near New York; and a man in his 60s from Camden County, in the southern part of the state.

Mr. Cuomo on Saturday did not say how many New Yorkers were now isolating themselves at home over fears they might have been exposed to the virus. But as of Friday, New York officials said they had asked about 4,000 people in the state to self-quarantine.

About 2,300 of that quarantined group were in New York City, and most of them had recently returned from five countries where the outbreak has been most severe: China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea.

In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said the state was aggressively testing as many people as possible.

‚ÄúWe want to find positives,‚Äù the governor said, adding that while some people might be disconcerted by the rising number of patients, it showed that the solid medical detective work was underway. ‚ÄúWe say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs good news, that we know who the people are.‚Äô‚Äù

New York City officials have asked the federal government to send more diagnostic kits for the coronavirus, saying in a letter on Friday that the city‚Äôs limited capacity to test had ‚Äúimpeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.‚Äù

Jesse McKinley reported from Albany, and Edgar Sandoval from New York. Michael Gold and Tracey Tully contributed reporting from New York.

The Coronavirus Outbreak
How Is the U.S. Being Affected?
Updated March 5, 2020

So far, 17 deaths have been linked to the virus with more than 350 confirmed cases across the country. We are tracking every case.
Cut off from their relatives inside the virus-stricken nursing center in Kirkland, Wash., families are frantically searching for help and basic information.
A cruise ship with thousands of people on board was being held off the coast of California.
Many health care workers say they lack protective gear and protocols to keep themselves and their patients safe.
Six Americans who have tested positive spoke to The Times about their experiences.
Coronavirus is already being viewed through a partisan lens. Public health officials say that injecting politics into the growing outbreak could make it harder to fight.
An outbreak would test the American education system. Few schools have detailed plans to teach online if schools were closed for long periods.

On February 3rd, the NY state senate committee on domestic animal welfare voted unanimously in favor of a bill to shut down the ‚Äòpuppy pipeline‚Äô in NY. To keep momentum moving forward, you all should contact your legislators and give your support (or, if you oppose ‚Äì for whatever reason ‚Äì it‚Äôs still good to voice your opinions anyway); this can be done at the provided link or by contacting your state legislators directly. If you don‚Äôt know whose yours is, you can find that information \[here\]( [https://www.nysenate.gov/find-my-senator](https://www.nysenate.gov/find-my-senator)).

With the added support, the bill might be able to passed by the full senate and move in the assembly.

What‚Äôs the puppy pipeline? It‚Äôs the supply chain of animals from out of state breeding mills, trucked for days across state lines, and brought to local stores near you. There‚Äôs a myriad of health problems with many of these animals and where the animals come from don‚Äôt get disclosed to stores. 

Finding the perfect pup (or kitty) to adopt from a shelter is made easy with sites like \[theshelterpetproject.org\]([https://theshelterpetproject.org/](https://theshelterpetproject.org/)), which let you search for breed or age. Most animals come with shots already given, reducing future expenses.

Senior living facilities have already implemented measures, closing facilitates to outside visitors and providing extra support to residents.

Cuomo said this days ago.

* Community and faith-based organizations should move gatherings of any size to video-accessible venues or postpone/cancel.

Cuomo banned these types of gatherings days ago.

* ¬†Healthcare facilities should implement triage before entering facilities.

Not to worry though, I've screen shot EVERYTHING.  Link to exchange [here] (https://old.reddit.com/r/newyork/comments/fk799n/steve_hofstetter_here_my_shows_in_albany_nyc/fkrcbxw/)

* Steve has an uncontrollable urge to use exclamation points at the end of his sentences!!!  Now that I'm pointing this out to him, I'm sure he'll adjust his strategy moving forward, because the ""tell"" is so obvious!!!

* Also note that Jake_the_Dog11's first comment was spam - he was specifically directing people to look for Steve's heckler videos on youtube

  -  Bummer! Got into your comedy from the **destroying hecklers videos on YouTube, I binge those all the time** [here] (""https://old.reddit.com/r/newyork/comments/fk799n/steve_hofstetter_here_my_shows_in_albany_nyc/fkrcbxw/)

  -  Here is is claiming he is [ten years old] (https://old.reddit.com/r/okbuddyretard/comments/e89oyg/these_people_just_make_me_wanna_rofl/fab6fvt/), and then [sixteen years old] (https://old.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/asgzsp/should_i_go_on_accutane_need_some_advice/)

I would probably stick with the men‚Äôs small. Thinking back from my younger days, I remember thinking that the chest area was tight on my youth jersey. Probably not optimal for a women lol!] (https://old.reddit.com/r/sportsjerseys/comments/ekdsp9/sizing_recommendation_for_my_gf/fdaf41h/)

  - Also note that this fake account posts generic questions but then RARELY actually engages with people who respond, even when they respond to his specific question.

Trump seems to have a visceral fear of admitting he doesn't know something, and he'll make shit up when he doesn't. (""Only 1 person from China has it"", ""It's a hoax"", ""We have it well under control"", ""Google's got this nationwide website"", ""I alone can fix this"").   Unfortunately it's a stupidly dangerous thing to do.  You can actually see the Dow or Dow Futures go down in real time whenever he's speaking because people have gotten long past the point where they believe him to actively worrying if he himself believes any of the shit he's saying.    It's gotten to the point in Caine Mutiny where he's talking about the count of strawberries and that's scary.

Cuomo and Fauci give me the reassurance that even if they don't know what is coming, they are doing everything in their power to mitigate the issue.

It all depends on what guidance your state is giving to the people making the initial decision. 

When you talk to the UB people do not use the word ""quit"". Dance around that word as much as you can. Say you were forced out because you are pregnant and they could not guarantee a safe environment, for example.

2342,2342,WikiTextBot,"**Constructive dismissal**

In employment law, constructive dismissal, also called constructive discharge or constructive termination, occurs when an employee resigns as a result of the employer creating a hostile work environment. Since the resignation was not truly voluntary, it is, in effect, a termination. For example, when an employer places extraordinary and unreasonable work demands on an employee to obtain their resignation, this can constitute a constructive dismissal.

The exact legal consequences differ between different countries, but generally a constructive dismissal leads to the employee's obligations ending and the employee acquiring the right to make claims against the employer.

Example: a Subway worker having to commute 2 hours on the MTA from southern brooklyn to UWS. He's going to expose himself for 4 hours on the train AND bus. To only bring it home to his elderly father on an oxygen tank, his 80 year old mother, his newborn child, his wife and his two brothers. He is mandated to go to work or he will lose his job. his two brothers cant go to work because Uber doesn't need drivers right now. So they can't work right? But this one Subway worker has to go into work because the city won't close restaurants and take out. This one Subway worker is afraid he will lose his income because Subway isn't giving paid time off. So he will continue to expose himself on the trains and buses for 4 hours. Because ppl in UWS need Subway sandwiches. Who cares about his family at home? Luckily this is my Uncle and I was able to provide masks and gloves I had at home. I am worried for him. 

My dad works at home Depot. He was the borough park example I used earlier. My dad is 65 and has high blood pressure, so he's considered to be a good candidate to host COVID19. Why is home depot still open and considered to be essential? Home Depot allowed employees 2 weeks PTO. The employee can pick when he starts the PTO at any point. Meaning if you feel uncomfortable you can start taking the 2 weeks or if you're infected you start the 2 weeks. Think about how messed up that is? My dad has barely any vacation or sick days because Payroll year just started. They don't accumulate enough time yet. He told me people were coughing on him. Customers got in his face and told him that they pay his salary so he should find them a freezer. He called me crying yesterday after his shift. He called out sick today, has the day off tomorrow, will be starting the home Depot 2 week leave on Mon. We can't risk our lives at this point. 


Why is this happening? I just can't understand it. If someone is exposed to more than 10 people in a small confined area for more than 2 minutes should automatically assume they are infected. From what I'm witnessing that's just not happening right now in NYC. The numbers are not even at peak yet.

2622,2622,chickcat,"I am a police officer in one of the hardest hit areas (I know, Reddit hates cops, save it). Due to my profession I have a bigger personal problem with Cuomo than most. I am one of few left-leaning cops. It‚Äôs just a job to me, I thoroughly enjoy the moments where I‚Äôm able to help someone and avoid making nonsensical arrests. I don‚Äôt believe drug users should be punished. I believe the majority of people who receive public assistance actually need and deserve it. It‚Äôs just the small percentage of abusers making the welfare system appear as a scam. I believe prisoners should have more rights; there‚Äôs no benefit to anyone to keep them under a rock. However I don‚Äôt think the average citizen understands the ramifications of the bail reform laws. From the outside it appears logical, no bail for low-level crimes. It runs much deeper than that. Bail needs to be entirely eradicated. Money shouldn‚Äôt dictate freedom. However, someone tells an 80 year old lady ‚Äúgive me your purse or I‚Äôll punch you in the face,‚Äù they‚Äôre out of jail in an hour. Someone who beats their spouse is out the next day with a majorly useless order of protection. Someone breaks into your home, they‚Äôre out in an hour. And will victimize someone else. With what‚Äôs going on, myself along with underpaid, overworked EMT‚Äôs (hate cops all you want, they are the real MVPs) are getting assaulted, spit on, and literal shit and piss thrown on us more and more. So there are people who have to worry about taking this virus home to their grandmas because shitty humans are able to freely walk the streets. And we can‚Äôt do anything about it. A lot of people joke that cops are lazy when in reality we‚Äôre just fucking burnt out. Believe what you will but most of us signed up to help people. But in the overwhelming majority of cases, we‚Äôre not allowed to. To be honest, it wasn‚Äôt much better before but Cuomo fucked up majorly on this and gave the public a false sense of positive reform.

Biased opinion stated, I immediately recognized that Cuomo is doing an excellent job with this mess. Guy appears to be working around the clock. It‚Äôs admirable that he isn‚Äôt afraid to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù...when the fuck have you ever heard that from a politician? People are criticizing him for waiting too long to shut things down, but I believe it was great timing. Reddit lives in a white collar IT bubble (for the record, I previously worked in IT for over 10 years) and doesn‚Äôt understand there are A LOT of people in NY who rely on retail and service industries for income. They can‚Äôt ‚Äúwork from home.‚Äù Deciding to shut the state down, albeit necessary, is a double-edged sword. A lot of people I know will not survive a shut-down. I‚Äôm very afraid for my local businesses. My husband works in retail and will likely get laid off. Once this passes, I won‚Äôt be too surprised if I get laid off, working in an agency that is already short-staffed.

the spread of COVID-19, workers and employers alike will face difficult
economic times. Businesses across the state are forced to lay off
employees or shut down their businesses due to an inability to afford
their numerous expenses. These tenants should not be held responsible
for paying money into rent while their income is being interrupted by
this pandemic.  Additionally, mortgagors experiencing financial hard-
ships because of the virus should also receive relief All New Yorkers
are sacrificing as a result of this crisis and government must do what
it can to help. It would be harmful to our entire society to expect
tenants without income to continue to take on financial liabilities.

I honestly can‚Äôt believe NY is only now going on lockdown.

We took drastic preventative measures 2 weeks ago when we only had a dozen or so confirmed cases (but we just had our March break end so there was a huge influx of residents from infected places). Was the smart thing to do.

2829,2829,itouchabutt,"We ARE flattening the curve, but the US is part of the handful of countries who simply aren't doing it aggressively enough, so we are shrinking the r-nought value, but not nearly as much as we could.  By having leaky quarantines and an inconsistent message across the country, we are delaying the inflection point people are hoping to see.  We are slowing the rate of actual growth, just not enough to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed, and honestly we were too late anyway.  I was expecting worse by now, and still expect much worse over the next two weeks.  You do need to realize though that the effect of our current quarantines are time-delayed--you won't see R-nought values drop for 2-3 weeks AFTER real quarantine has been instated.  You can't trust Americans to voluntarily do the right thing, look at Florida, in general.

The rate of spread was expected to accelerate, we knew the disease was spreading rapidly a month ago, and we knew that we're chasing the disease with testing rather than staying ahead of it.  I knew that, and I'm not an epidemiologist, I just did some really basic graphs, researched some data on hospital capacity, and immediately warned everyone I knew that quarantine was inevitable.  We also knew hospitals would be overwhelmed.  I told all my closest friends the timelines the data predicted, and they're pretty much on point--reported cases are still way below actual.  You can also do a reverse analysis on the infection rates based on mortality and see that of course the reported numbers aren't accurate.  I got the virus in mid-January in rural Vermont, and just brushed it off as a severe flu until I started doing some back of napkin math and realized LOTS of people probably had it.

We also knew that for every 1% of global unemployment, 40,000 people die just from the direct effects of poverty, and to do a proper quarantine we'd bench at least a 1/3rd of our country's workforce and send the world into a global depression that could last years.  Trump is a complete moron and doesn't really get it, but people around him were obligated to explain that the cure is also not without inevitable deaths.  He's on the bargaining stage of the Kubler-Ross scale, I think.  He certainly passed denial and anger. I don't envy anyone making that sort of decision, but I also wouldn't give the responsibility to a narcissistic megalomaniac with hate in his heart.  

The only way we could have prevented this was a shelter at home order in January, and back then only a few senators, virologists, epidemiologists, pentagon officials, and people who were following the messages (in pinyin) from chinese scientists.  You won't get bold actions from senators just based on intel unless they are an idealist, and let's be honest, most of them aren't.

I'm not going to forgive all the foolishness from the top, nor will I forgive any of the republican fools who are going to wait to give shelter-in-place orders.  The US Government was effectively briefed on this, but with people like McConnell in place you can't expect the senate to do anything just, decent, good, or practical.

This isn't a hostage/war scenario... And again, we're not looking to nationalize, we're looking to recommons and collectivize.

It starts with abandoned properties, because that's what we can acquire now. Slowly we build better alternatives... Demand for high-rise apartment space or incredibly over-priced apartments in general decreases if free or cheaper housing is available. It slowly becomes no longer profitable to lord over people that need housing. By transforming those abandoned properties in to cheaper alternatives, or acquiring properties which are not abandoned and then distributing them to collectives, not for profits, or to families which can maintain them, making them tax free (because the state does not own the land, and the benefit for having people in the city, as a part of the economy is positive enough), then the profit driven justification for owning those high-rise buildings and milking citizens will slowly become less tenable. Landlords cannot afford to maintain their properties, they need to sell them, and then as municipalities can afford them they buy and recommons...

Look at Syracuse and their abandoned properties... http://www.syrgov.net/VacantRegistry.aspx Who is living in those houses, and who is buying these? Those houses and properties are abandoned, deteriorating, and could be used for far better things... such as housing.

How our brains make coronavirus seem scarier than it is

&gt;  The flu is a far more infectious and deadly disease, but it is familiar, which is, at it happens, one reason many have not had their flu shots this year.

&gt; ‚ÄúClearly, the flu poses the bigger and more pressing peril; a handful of cases of the new respiratory illness have been reported in the United States, none of them fatal or apparently even life-threatening,‚Äù Bernstein wrote.

They would never admit Trump handled this perfectly, from shutting down transportation early, to enlisting the private sector to ramp up medical supply production, to providing stimulus, and urging everybody to keep calm so that the response isn't worse than the virus itself.

Not really. It was the same as always. Opinions were all over the place. There was absolutely no real consensus because at the time all you had was unreliable Chinese data.

Some ""scientists and medical experts"" thought it would be easier than the flu, some thought it would be slightly worse, and some were alarmist and some hyperalarmist. 

Conflating ""don't panic"" with ""telling the country the virus was contained"" is a poor argument. He shut down flights early and once we had more data effectively shut down the country's economy. He released FDA shackles and we now have a treatment/therapeutic and many areas other than shittily-managed urban shitholes don't have any real tangible problem.

Cuomo signed the legislation last year, but made it clear he didn‚Äôt like it, and set about trying to roll it back this year ‚Äî threatening to put more people in jails even as they are ravaged by the novel coronavirus. Rather than asking the legislature to consider changes in open floor debate, he stuffed his criminal justice agenda into the secretive budget process, where legislators would get virtually no chance to even review the changes to the law, much less discuss them before voting on them.

In typical hardball fashion, Cuomo‚Äôs opening bid was a reformers‚Äô worst nightmare. His draft legislation proposed to give judges the power ‚Äî unprecedented in state history ‚Äî to jail defendants, even people facing misdemeanor charges, on the basis of a premonition that those defendants might commit some future act of violence. The same judges who have spent decades using money bail to incarcerate New Yorkers before their trials would now be handed the power to lock people up based on their powers of divination, the reading of entrails, or the huffing of oracular vapors.

Once they are down in NYC and put in use, they will stay in use. If our hospital loans 5 ventilators, they won't be just sitting around in NYC but will be hooked up to 5 patients.  What are they going to do when we ask for them back, unhook the patients?   I can imagine the uproar if they wheeled those loaned ventilators, past people who desperately need them,  out of NYC hospitals to ship back upstate.  

There would also be an uproar here when the cases rise higher, when we have many more patients than ventilators, people are dying for the lack of them and it comes out that we had more but they were taken away.    

Getting paid for the loaned ventilators would be cold comfort. It's not like you can run over to the ventilator big box store and pick up another one.  And it's not like we have the luxury of time, the numbers are rising fast.

I get it - everyone is desperate.   We in upstate watch what's going on in NYC, look at our projections and say ""holy shit.""  

It's like the sinking of the Titanic.  Person A in the water asks Person B high on the upturned end of the ship for his life preserver since he isn't using it at the moment and promises he'll give it back when asked.  Person B is watching the ship slipping down and knows he's going to be in the water within a couple minutes.  They both want to live.  It makes perfect sense that Person A will say anything to get a life preserver and is highly unlikely to give it back.

I don‚Äôt think most reasonable people would be opposed to sending almost all available PPE and other non-durable and easy to acquire items to Downstate as quickly as possible, I imagine you‚Äôd find quite a few people/organizations would volunteer to assist in the effort. I believe the problem is that items like ventilators are expensive complex items, that are not easily replaced. Sort of work around would be to talk to Heath Care Managers and Medical Logistics professionals. Ask them to compile the data on how many vents are used on a regular basis, then factor in best- and worst-case scenarios based on similar sized population densities. Only then send the additional capacity to support downstate. Another way, or even an additional step would be to count vents by county or municipality and not by facility. But to pit one geographical location against another, is both irresponsible and dangerous. The Governor really needs to hold a press conference about his statement regarding this and the use of the NY National Guard (NG) to enforce/expedite this action. 
My next issue with this situation, and over the past several hours different explanations have been given. Is the NG going to be used strictly to gather and transport or is seizure and confiscation their purpose? This question gets even muddier, if the answer is seizure and confiscation, where will it stop? The use of the NG in this capacity, is well within the rights of a States Executive, but is it the best use? Add this to the confusion created by a certain Mayor claiming the NG is not the military creates confusion. The Governor needs to sit with all these high-profile leaders and hold a sync as to what these resources are and aren‚Äôt, so they can let the constituencies know what they do and clear up confusion.

On top of that, he failed to prepare the state hospitals in advance, which is why doctors and nurses are working without PPE.

Absolutely. The banks and corps in the city gutted the manufacturing sector of upstate in the 80s and 90s. Sure, this fattened up their balance sheets when they moved all their operations to China, and on paper the companies are more profitable. Woooooo! But it destroyed hundreds of communities and millions of lives upstate. Once proud, thriving towns and cities are just shells of what they once were. Oh, and they also left the rotting carcasses of their factories for us to deal with and clean up.

252,252,dannylenwinn,"Here are aspects that understandingly need to be addressed and have some improvements on, and updating some of the bugs

'Banned from Most Roads

People wouldn't be allowed ebike on streets with speed limits over 30 MPH. That's 90% of roads run by the State DOT or counties -- the roads that get people to other places.

People crash cars into the back of construction trucks on a regular basis. Visibility isn't the problem.

Patchwork of Local Laws

Each municipality and county would be allowed to make their own rules for how, when and where electric bikes can be operated. That includes the possibility of requiring helmets and reflective clothing. So for every trip you want to make, you'd have to look up the laws for each village, town and county on your route. Pro Tip: high-viz gear and foam hats don't create safety.

Hills Become Speed Traps

Folks couldn't¬†operate¬†a Class 1 or Class 2 ebike¬†over 20 MPH. Going down hills would require riding the brakes.

Single File Only

People would have to go single file when riding ebikes, while people on manual bikes and people in cars are allowed to be side by side.

No Sidewalks

Can't use ebikes on sidewalks anywhere. Municipalities are blocked from allowing it locally. There are places where the road is very dangerous and the sidewalk has few people walking on it. In cases like this, cycling on the sidewalk needs to remain an option.

Yielding Variation

Ebike riders would have to yield to people walking under all circumstances. While people using standard cycles and driving cars generally have to yield to people on foot, there are some situations where they don't.

Unreasonable Age Limit

Ebike riders would have to be at least 16 years old. This limits mobility options for families in hilly towns. There are smaller, less powerful ebikes available for kids who need them.

Path Access is Ambiguous

The bill says electric bikes ""may only be operated on public highways..., private roads open to motor vehicle traffic, and designated bicycle or in-line skate lanes."" Since multi-use paths don't explicitly fit under any of those categories, would people still be able to commute to work on an ebike via the North County Trailway in Westchester County?

Disproportionate Drug Sentences

The alcohol and drug provisions are overly strict. They're quite convoluted, too, with two different sets of penalty tiers. In the event of a crash, ebike riders face a wide range of penalties. The low end starts at a $300 fine and/or 15 days in jail. Repeat offenders (over a 10 year span) with over 0.08% Blood Alcohol Content (or even over 0.05% under certain conditions) could be convicted of a Class D¬†felony, with a fine reaching $10,000 and up to 7 years in prison.

Misses 3 and 4 Wheelers

The text specifies electric bicycles as having two wheels. Thus it doesn't legalize the use of electric tricycles or quadcycles. Such vehicles are important for disabled people, families and deliveries.

Class 3

No Class 3 Outside NYC

The only place Class 3 ebikes¬†could be used is New York City.

Non Standard Limits

The industry standard speed limit for Class 3 ebikes is 28 MPH. New York would require the creation of special bikes with a 25 MPH cap.'",1586307506,fmqus35
253,253,spec_of_cp,"This is just dumb. I live in Rochester and while we have a fair number of cases, the situation is just nowhere near what it is like in NYC. My county has around 600 confirmed cases, which is .07% of the population. NYC on the other hand has around 75K confirmed cases corresponding to around 0.9% of the population, over an order of magnitude higher. Furthermore cases have been leveling off here, suggesting that we are past the peak and social distancing is working. It would be insane to hang onto a bunch of ventilators that it is extremely unlikely we will need while people are dying right now in NYC. 

Plus Cuomo has said he is requesting 20% of the projected excess ventilators. For example, if a county projects that they will need 40 ventilators in the next few weeks and they have 60, NYC will take 5 of those 20 excess ventilators. They're not just going to take tons of ventilators away from hospitals that need them right now.

Then Dems took over Senate and the bill was signed eventually and pushed through by Senator Hoylman, and signed into law by Gov Cuomo. 

Main update to the previous law was that S2440 increases the amount of time during which perpetrators of these crimes may be held criminally accountable regardless of when the crime occurred. Under previous law, child sexual abuse offenses cannot be prosecuted after five years from their occurrence and civil lawsuits for this conduct must be brought within three years from the victim's 18th birthday.

Dont confuse us with Jared and the kleptocrats in DC. 

also lets not pretend eventual layoffs are off the table.  last in first out will probably start at some point, so holding raises instead of layoffs is not a sincere alternative, just a defense that positions management in the union negotiation today

What can we do? To start with, i like a furlough, where nonessential staff are reduced voluntarily to less time and less pay. Studies show people are more effective working four days and now is the time to normalize that.  Second, many state workers are working from home and getting not much done.  We need accountability and different civil service rules for evaluating and removing incompetent or underperforming staff regardless of tenure. Third, a slight across the board reduction in top end appointees would set a better tone than holding raises for the rank and file.  

until that is tried, this freeze feels a little easy for the gov (who i think has done a good job, but who is starting to milk some extra free press out of this crisis).

This has nothing to do with the fiscal condition of New York state. This is just a ham fisted complaint that's got nothing to do with anything. 

Immigration is good. At its worst - unskilled illegal immigration - there's conflicting research on its fiscal impact. At its best - skilled legal immigration - there's a massive net positive fiscal impact.

No government favors non citizens over citizens. You're most certainly not paying attention if you believe that. Ensuring undocumented residents pay taxes and can access certain services is not favoring them over citizens, it's using evidence based policy to maximize their tax liability and safety. Assuming the state of New York isn't going to deport them, which it absolutely is not going to do, it would be prudent to deal with them in a fiscally and morally responsible manner. It's not immoral to talk about immigration, but it's immoral to shit on somebody because they were born somewhere else and pay taxes.

Goddamn man. It's not up to NY who's here legally or not.

Oh my god you're actually not worth talking to if you can't even read your own comments.

&gt;We're spending hundreds of millions of dollars for college for illegal immigrants, but we can't afford cost of living raises for our state workers.

We most certainly are not.

&gt;That's prioritization, and it's a fact.

It's not a fact. The absolute best I can find is [this](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/democrats-college-immigrants/), which shows that undocumented high school students (who were honestly probably just brought here as kids and are DREAMers anyway) and that costs $27m a year, which is 0.015% of the budget.

If you're just going to live in your own fantasy world where you can make shit up then you're a pretty shitty excuse for an American. We're harmed as a country when our *actual* citizens can't be bothered to research the things they build their worldview around. God fucking dammit this shit is frustrating.

[Here](https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages) is a cato article, which is a pretty high profile libertarian group, which shows exactly that. There's no evidence to show that there's any significant impact on wages when immigrants are accounted for. The only reason to not support immigration is because you don't approve of the immigrants for some reason other than their effect on wages, because they effectively have none. Stop using that as an excuse, because you're wrong. Not only are you wrong, but if you've convinced yourself otherwise it's because you *want* immigration to be bad and you've looked for biased information to make yourself feel like you're right. You have to look at evidence to decide your worldview, not choose your worldview and seek out anything that confirms it.

&gt;or that people who are here illegally sway the electoral integrity of the country when they're counted in the census.

Because this is on the NY subreddit, I'm assuming you live in New York. Now I don't know where it is that you live in the state, but I can tell you that I live in a very rural portion of Upstate NY. Upstate NY, and Republicans in general, are heavily overrepresented in our state's legislature. I actually did a small research project on this a while back, as shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/cq2iyn/effortpost_on_the_new_york_state_senate_and/). I did that because I personally have a very strong opinion about political representation and ensuring that everyone not only is represented, but that they *feel* represented. Otherwise that leads to people becoming disillusioned with the system in general, which is only a detriment to a democracy.

Anyway, you're looking in the wrong place if you want to attack undocumented immigrants for skewing the census. It's important that the state and federal governments know where to appropriate funds, since everybody needs roads, education, infrastructure, healthcare, etc. But as far as political representation goes it's rural areas in New York that receive a far greater benefit than urban areas, which is where most of the immigrants (legal or no) live. This is accomplished a few ways. First, you can change district population a bit from being even across the board. In this way, rural Upstate New York districts can be almost 20% less populous than those near The City, or in our cities upstate. Another thing that's done is to put prisons in Republican areas, to increase their population but without adding to those who can vote. One not-so-fun fact about New York - there are *zero* state prisoners in State Senate districts which are held by Democrats. They're all used to increase the power of rural Upstate.

All of this is really besides the point, which is that you're not looking at the big picture. All that undocumented immigrants do as far as the census is concerned is essentially give us an extra house district or maybe two. That's it. They don't vote, they don't have that right. They do increase *your* vote's influence, so you shouldn't be worried about that. If you're concerned about them increasing Democrats' political power because they're concentrated in urban areas, again, that's really not how that works in practice. At least in New York we go very, very far out of our way to make sure Upstate and conservatives in general are far more powerful per person than are Downstate and liberals.

&gt;Why, anyone who would ever question the practice of allowing illegal immigration to prosper is clearly a racist with no valid reason to be skeptical about the practice.

Your rationale for questioning so far has been that they're economic drains and harm the political process, and to be frank those are both bullshit. And the only reason that we have so many *illegal* immigrants here in the first place is because the federal government refuses to just increase quotas and make it easier for them to do it legally. We could easily have ten more happy, tax paying Americans tomorrow if people wanted it. Instead, a certain segment of the population pretends that not only do they have as many rights as citizens, but that they're draining us fiscally and corrupting our politics. None of these are true and it's easy to see if you're willing to open up a budget pdf or google what our state's political districts look like.

I'm being a dick because you're blatantly lying to yourself and acting smug about it. If I could find any evidence that there's some conspiracy to replace me with an immigrant, *maybe* I'd see things your way a little easier. But there's not, and it frustrates me to no end that you'd be willing to just shit on these people when they've got essentially zero (or a positive) impact on your life. Being against immigration on principle is just unamerican as hell in the first place, but being against these people because of the reasons you're relying on is not only racism, it's lazy racism and it's just so disappointing to have to deal with from fellow New Yorkers.",1586579538,fn26wvb

Because there are no legitimate reasons to blindly be against immigration, be it legal or illegal. It's a net positive regardless. At the end of the day, ""economic anxiety"" is just what people blame for being anti brown folks. This is America, and we're better than that.

&gt;You think Republicans are overrepresented, 

There's no thinking, I literally made sure to include a thoroughly cited project I wrote that had pictures to make it easy to see that they *are* overrepresented in New York. Which wasn't even the point - I was explaining that it's rural areas that are overrepresented, and this is to let them have more of a say in Albany. There's no ""thinking"" about this. My state legislative districts are around 20% less populous than those in, say, Brooklyn. And that's including the several prisons in it.

&gt;yet you don't admit that illegal immigrants skew the population

Pretty sure I said that, and that it only serves to give New York an extra congressional district. Regardless of that, undocumented immigrants are spread across the country. Between their spread and the way we purposely overrepresent rural areas they most certainly have nearly no impact. This isn't difficult to understand, and I know you understand it. So stop pretending you don't.

&gt; apportionment of representatives to actual citizens.

Again, as an Upstate rural New Yorker my vote counts a lot more than any urban New Yorker for literally no reason. The apportionment of districts is far, far more heavily influenced by this than it is by undocumented immigrants.

&gt;You're being disingenuous and actually being racist in assuming there is one type of race that make up all illegal immigrants.

This is America. When someone says ""illegal immigrant"", they mean brown folks from south of us. Both you and I know you're not talking about a few thousand folks from Europe, and I'm frankly disgusted you're pretending you are. I would say you're better than that, but you clearly don't care to put the effort into being a decent citizen.

&gt;That CATO study does not, in fact, even claim that immigrants don't suppress wages.

Man, it's right fucking in the conclusion. This is the easiest it can possibly be made for you. And I quote, ""Empirical methods that relax the two assumptions described above likely **lead to estimates that more accurately describe the impacts of immigration on native wages and that are either very small or zero**"". It's in the conclusion. You didn't even have to read more than four sentences and you can't bring yourself to do that. Disgraceful.

&gt;Nice try, though.

I'm not convinced you're literate, given you aren't reading jack shit.

&gt;We disagree that a country's laws and its democracy be respected. You think they shouldn't.

I'd just change the laws to make sure everyone's more represented, but you seem stuck on this idea that immigrants are inherently bad. I'd change our electoral system from a blanket fptp to a hybrid system with fptp districts and proportional list voting like Germany because that way, if the party you like gets 35% of the vote they get about 35% of the seats and not 0% like they would in our system.

I'm pretty sure you don't have a freaking clue how even our state's political institutions are proportioned considering you're fixated on illegal representation over the extremely clear and damn near codified rural representation issues. My vote is 20% more important than somebody's in Brooklyn and that's horseshit. If I were against democratic institutions, I'd support things like gerrymandering or the electoral college. But those things disenfranchise people from their political institutions, and that is *bad*. It's important that people are not only represented but that they *feel* represented. First past the post and the arbitrary +/-10% district size are massively more influential and damaging to the system than any number of undocumented immigrants in the state could possibly be.

&gt;That's really all there is to it.

All that's to it is you've chosen a worldview and disregard anything that challenges it. I don't know why you would choose to be that way, and you're clearly not willing to grow as a citizen. I want you to know that in spite of that, I'd still rather reform the system so your vote in New York could actually count, instead of being drowned out by Democrats. Because mature people don't look to diminish anyone's importance as a person, and certainly not as a citizen. If you choose to look down on others because you refuse to accept new information, you shouldn't be surprised when the world leaves you and your views behind.

I figured you might accept a libertarian's perspective on immigration, which is what I consider myself on immigration policy. Just be aware that it takes a big government to enforce immigration law. I don't know about you, but I'd rather have a smaller and more efficient government than one that gets so hung up on whether someone born in Mexico or South America is here legally or not that it wastes tens of billions a year in trying to keep them out. Anyway, this is pointless and I'm absolutely positive you aren't willing to learn. I'm just going to disable my inbox replies.

If you decide to start supporting efficient and small government though, that'd be cool. There aren't many of us in New York that care about that.",1586584199,fn2cckm

**From the study:** As the pandemic escalates, rural counties with high shares of seasonally vacant housing are seeing higher rates of COVID-19 cases than either urban or other rural areas. In the nation‚Äôs 199 rural counties where seasonal housing accounts for 25 percent or more of all housing units, average cases per 100,000 are more than twice as high as in other rural counties and 15 percent higher than in urban areas as of April 5 (Figure 1). This is consistent with anecdotal reports of hot spots in popular vacation locations as visitors, including some who are unknowingly infected, exit urban areas attempting to socially distance at second homes and seasonal rental properties. There are, however, several possible explanations for the higher prevalence of cases including differences in the level of testing and the higher median age seen in these areas.",1586615835,fn3987l

Trees are known to grow massively after hurricanes come through because they bring a whole lot of ozone into the water, ground and air.

&gt;Sure enough, on September 12, 1988, Hurricane Gilbert made landfall in Jamaica. With winds upwards of 125 to 150 miles per hour, the massive Category 5 storm traversed the whole 235-kilometer-long island, the eye passing less than 10 km south of Tanner‚Äôs study site.

&gt;A few years after the hurricane, Turner was surprised to find more growth among the surviving trees. For example, between 1989 and 1992, the increase in the area of ground covered by trunks of Alchornea latifolia, a flowering tree in the spurge family, was eight times the rate of change from the pre-hurricane data.2 Growth remained high for more than a decade following the storm. ‚ÄúWe thought we were going to document the damage, not an increase [in growth],‚Äù Tanner recalls. His and others‚Äô studies make it clear that tropical forests are well-adapted to hurricanes. Two decades after Gilbert, 54 percent of the 1,670 trees Tanner had been tracking since 1974 were still alive.

585,585,zoeyjax,"Two  groups of governors, one on the East Coast and one on the West Coast,  announced Monday that they were forming regional working groups to help  plan when it would be safe to begin to ease coronavirus-related  restrictions to reopen their economies.

Their announcements came hours after President Trump, who has expressed impatience to reopen the economy, [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249712404260421633?s=20) that such a decision lies with the president, not the states.

‚ÄúWell,  seeing as we had the responsibility for closing the state down,‚Äù Gov.  Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania said, ‚ÄúI think we probably have the primary  responsibility for opening it up.‚Äù

He  joined the governors of Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and  Rhode Island on a conference call, where they agreed to create a  committee of public health officials, economic development officials and  their chiefs of staff to work together as they decide when to ease the  restrictions they have put in place to slow the spread of the virus.  They said they did not necessarily expect to act together or to create a  one-size-fits-all solution, but they stressed the need for regional  cooperation.

On the West Coast, the  governors of California, Oregon and Washington also announced Monday  what they called a Western States Pact to work together on a joint  approach to reopening economies. They said that while each state would  have its own specific plan, the states would build out a West Coast  strategy that would include how to control the virus in the future. ‚ÄúOur  states will only be effective by working together,‚Äù they said in a  joint statement.

Gov.  Gavin Newsom of California said on Monday that he had been in  discussions with the other governors to coordinate efforts on the West  Coast. He said that on Tuesday he would outline the ‚ÄúCalifornia-based  thinking‚Äù on reopening and promised it would be guided by ‚Äúfacts,‚Äù  ‚Äúevidence‚Äù and ‚Äúscience.‚Äù

The stay-at-home orders that have kept a vast majority of Americans indoors [were issued state by state, by their governors](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-economy.html).  The president did issue nonbinding guidelines urging a pause in daily  life through the end of the month; in some states that had resisted such  measures, including Florida, his input helped spur governors to act. If  the federal government were to issue new guidance saying it was safe to  relax those measures or outlining a path toward reopening, many states  would most likely follow or feel tremendous pressure from their  businesses and constituents to relax restrictions.

But  Mr. Trump, who said Friday that the decision of when to reopen the  country would be the biggest he would ever make, said Monday on Twitter  that it was up to the president, not the governors, to decide when to  reopen the states.

‚ÄúA decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!‚Äù [he wrote](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249712413219397632).

But  several of the governors who spoke Monday made it clear that they did  not intend to let businesses in their states reopen until experts and  data suggested it would be safe to do so. They noted that their fates  were bound by geography. ‚ÄúThe reality is this virus doesn‚Äôt care about  state borders, and our response shouldn‚Äôt either,‚Äù Gov. Gina Raimondo of  Rhode Island said.

‚ÄúWe can put  together a system that allows our people to get back to work,‚Äù Gov. Ned  Lamont of Connecticut said. But he warned against reopening too soon and  risking a second wave of infections.

In  Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday that he was working closely with  the White House on his plan to reopen the state‚Äôs businesses. He called  for a staggered approach in which businesses that have a minimal impact  on the spread of the virus would open up first.

‚ÄúThis  is not going to be a rush-the-gates‚Äù situation, said Mr. Abbott, who  has been criticized for making Texas one of the last states to issue a  statewide stay-at-home order.

Earlier  on Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said New York‚Äôs known death toll had  exceeded 10,000, with 671 people dying on Sunday. Nearly 2,000 more  people were hospitalized on Sunday ‚Äî a vast number, though lower than  previous tallies ‚Äî and there were fewer intubations. But even as he  hinted that he believed that ‚Äúthe worst is over,‚Äù [he warned the situation would worsen](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage) if New Yorkers behaved recklessly.

‚ÄúNot  as bad as it has been in the past, but basically flat, and basically  flat at a horrific level of pain and grief and sorrow,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said.

There  are more than 500,000 confirmed cases in the United States and more  than 23,000 people dead, according to a New York Times database. In one  case, a sailor assigned to the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt died  of complications stemming from the virus, according to Navy officials.  It was the first death for the ship‚Äôs crew, which numbers more than  4,800.",1586812066,fnbaghe

A: If you currently live in another state, but all of your work in the past 18 months was in New York State, you must file your claim with New York State. See¬†How to File a Claim¬†for instructions.

If you worked in 2 or more states in the past 18 months, you must file your claim with one of the states where you worked, no matter where you live. You may be able to combine wages from all the states where you worked in the past 18 months. OR you may use only the wages earned in the filing state.

&gt;If you worked in 2 or more states in the past 18 months, you must file your claim with one of the states where you worked, no matter where you live. You may be able to combine wages from all the states where you worked in the past 18 months. OR you may use only the wages earned in the filing state. File your claim in a state where you worked, then that state will tell you all your filing options to receive the highest benefit amount.

Really? Based on what?

We now know the numbers are garbage. Not only has the CDC directed hospitals to list cause of death the Wuhan Coronavirus even if that is not how they died, but NYC just retroactively added over 4000 Wuhan Coronavirus deaths without any testing.

So we have models that don't work (1.7M Deaths! No...200K! No...100K! Nope....61K! [Now less than Influenza]), and actual counts being inflated for political gain.

So it isn't the numbers that justify this. Otherwise we'd be wearing masks **every season** due to Influenza killing more people.

&gt; don't know it, and are spreading it

You mean like Influenza.

Have you been keeping up on how this is inhibiting herd immunity and that if we continue these practices we'll be playing this game for **years**?

Probably not.

&gt;everyone must now wear a mask out in public. 

Again my multi-pronged why:

* If we believe the masks don't work to protect you from the virus but protects others, then (As I have asked repeatedly) Please go into the technical detail on how that works. Because you know, different fabrics have different gaps. Oh, and don't forget ""attractive bandanas"" and how they meet the requirements. Governor Junior's wording; not mine.

* Thanks to politics at the CDC and Mayor DeBolshevik the numbers are not accurate. So basing decisions on them is flailing at best and disastrous at worst. Why make decisions on bad data?

* All the models to date are garbage. Even Dr Fauci admitted he doesn't put much stock in them (Before reversing his own words). So again, why use the models to make any decisions?

* If there so much Wuhan Coronavirus flying around, why is the MTA operational? Or do you think shoving millions of people in small tin cans underground uninterrupted since this all began a brilliant move?

I stand by my statement Governor Junior is flailing and flying his dictator flag (At least when he's not putting guns in the faces of upstate health care workers for shits and giggles).

I asked for technical details. One can't discern the effectiveness of the mask if you don't know the droplet size and the gap between the fabric weave. So you don't know. As such you can't make the statement ""They do work to prevent droplet spread from carriers.""

And in addition you say it doesn't stop it. I quote:

You see I've seen all these statements. You know what I don't see? The explanation on how these ""experts"" are drawing their conclusions. We have evidence that the models and actual death counts are complete garbage so a ""Trust me I'm an expert"" doesn't cut it.

As I myself do not have the technical details, I will refrain from commenting on thing outside my expertise. However, if you are going to group all experts as monolithic with the same set of characteristics, then I'm afraid I won't share the same thought process. Additionally, we need to put trust in experts of a subject matter that we do not have expertise in. You and I wouldn't be the ones leading a virus mitigation strategy, so the best we can do is find experts we believe in and make educated decisions.

If unanimously and across different countries, physical contact is described as the primary method of transmission, then I will trust that, and I will do things that prevent myself from catching droplets (staying home) or spreading them (wearing coverings).

At it comes down, I can present all the evidence in the world, and if you don't believe the sources, you don't believe the sources, and that won't change.

Obviously not 100% infallible, but chances are they're onto something and it's up to you whether to believe them or not.

Is it your assertion that if a mask does not filter effectively against a small particle, that there is no reduction is propulsion distance of a viral particle from when a carrier coughs / sneezes uncovered vs. covered with a non-N95 mask?

729,729,CanonFodder913,"&gt;SARS-CoV-2 particles are thought to be smaller than SARS-CoV particles which are, IIRC, 0.08 - 0.14 micrometers.

That's great. Now what's the gap in the mask weave and ""attractive bandanas"" since that meets Governor Junior's requirement for an effective mask?

&gt;physical contact on someone.

So it's not about a mask? If the primary transmission is physical contact then why the need for potentially ineffective masks (Like bandanas made by pretty much anyone)? Doesn't that promote a false sense of security?

&gt;Is it your assertion that if a mask does not filter effectively against a small particle, that there is no reduction is propulsion distance of a viral particle from when a carrier coughs / sneezes uncovered vs. covered with a non-N95 mask?

My assertion is that we don't know if the mask is effective if we don't know the gap in the weave. Especially if the mask can be something as poorly made as an ""attractive bandana"".

And if you're going to rely on RNJesus to catch all the droplets then you're a bigger fool than I originally thought.

If the mask isn't effective then why give a false sense of security to people? That will just spread the wuhan coronavirus faster with people thinking they're safe when they're not.",1586981959,fnil9v9

&gt;Every other country that has gotten this thing under control has required all citizens to wear masks.

Not true. IIRC Sweden, Brazil, and others did not require masks and they have it under control. So do states who did not require masks.

As a side note: With the exception of NYC New York has had the Wuhan Coronavirus under control since the beginning. But keep that under your hat; no one is supposed to know so Governor Junior can treat the whole state like NYC.

&gt;They lied about the masks in the US because they didn't prepare in advance, and were caught with a shortage. They didn't want the public to buy them out and then store them at home, when those few masks should ideally go to healthcare.

""This idea, that large droplets of virus-laden mucus are the primary mode of transmission, guides the CDC's advice to maintain at least a 6-foot distance between you and other people.""

I think we're talking about very different sizes of droplets as primary transmission vectors. We're talking about visible droplets to the naked eye, the things that cloth masks can catch. We're not talking about small particles that can get through a mask and aersolize.

But if you're not gonna trust the CDC, (and you have reason not to), then you're probably not listening to this piece of advice.

But Canada has similar guidance: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/assumptions.html

""The virus enters a person's body:

    by large respiratory droplets containing the virus that adhere to mucous membranes of a person's eyes, nose or mouth""

""Airborne transmission is not known to be occurring in community settings (i.e., ""routinely"")""

For particles to go through masks and remain airborne, aerosolization would have to occur. (Do you agree or disagree?) Regardless, as aersolization is not a primary transmission vector, it's not a primary driver in flattening the curve.

First off, it's totally unenforceable. What cop is going to fine/arrest people for this? Under what law? Cuomo is not a king. An executive order isn't a royal decree.

Secondly, there's no clear definition on what constitutes a mask, so you could conceivably walk around with your shirt pulled up in front of your face like someone just farted and call it a mask.

Third, masks don't completely prevent infection. The only time they really make a difference is if they're being worn by someone *who is already sick* and it's absorbing the droplets that come from their coughing and sneezing. Other than they really don't do much.

Now, does that mean that masks are pointless? No. If you're sick or showing some kind of symptoms and are going out in public yes, you should absolutely wear one.

But forcing *everybody* to wear one for an indeterminate amount of time?

No. That's idiotic.

Common sense will get us through this. Hand washing, social distancing, diligent hygiene maintenance, and effective testing/quarantining protocols. You know, smart and logical decision making.

Forcing healthy people to wear a sheet of fabric on the lower half of their face just to go to 7-Eleven is kind of ridiculous.

Edit: Look, don't get me wrong, if you feel that wearing a mask out of an abundance of caution is a good idea, I can't argue with you. 

But there are consequences here, most notably that this mandate is going to deplete the overall mask supply and possibly take them away from people who actually need them.

Also, what about people who can't afford an indefinite mask supply? 

Finally, with how stressed out everyone is it's very possible that people who aren't wearing masks in public could be targets of violence. This was happening even before the requirement. Shit, there's slapfighting *in this very thread* over it. If you see someone without a mask, just avoid them. Harassing and threatening people is out of line, even if the Government ostensibly agrees with your position.

How would that go exactly?

Now the article says ""civil penalties"". But this would take place on the street level, which means the involvement of law enforcement officers, and consequently that implies questions of legality  and Constitutional Rights. So if there is a legal element in place, and LEO's are responsible for said enforcement, we're looking at a real dilemma from where I sit.

For example, I leave my house and go to get on the bus to go to work. I'm not wearing a mask and a cop sees me. He comes up to me and says that I am in violation of Governor Cuomo's executive order. Now what?

Does he write me a ticket? Does he even have legal authority to detain me? Under what law? Because an executive order isn't a law, and if the consequences of violating the order are civil ones, that calls into question an entire host of due process issues. 

How do I challenge the finding of the cop? What court do I report to in order to do that? Will I be afforded representation? What if I had my shirt pulled up over my face? Would that make me innocent of the violation? Who determines that? What if I refuse to pay? What if I keep refusing to wear the mask? Can I be incarcerated for that? Again under what law? How long would said incarceration be? What if I continue to refuse to wear the mask in jail? Will this dance continue on into eternity?


See it's easy to talk about forcing people to do things, but then the messy issue of having guaranteed rights under the Constitution gets in the way. And I think the person you were arguing with's point wasn't whether or not it's a good or bad idea to wear a mask in public, it's that unilateral decisions by our government that erode our personal freedoms can't just be hand waved away because you agree with them. Especially when they involve and impact literally everyone everywhere.

We are waaay too quick to accept things without thinking them through rationally. Our society is supposed to operate from the ground up, not the top down. Just blithely accepting policy decisions by the powers that be and then insulting those who don't automatically snap to attention and agree with them, especially when they're not entirely well thought out, could very well lead down some very bad roads.",1587049124,fnl8pov

Now the article in the OP said that these infractions would likely entail ""civil penalties"". So in any event it's highly unlikely that you would be issued [a Desk Appearance Ticket, which is reserved only for criminal offenses](https://www.new-york-lawyers.org/desk-appearance-tickets-d-a-t.html). I really don't know where you got that information from.

[It's much more likely that you would get a Summons to Appear for Civil Penalties Only, which is more like a littering or beer ticket.](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/oath/clerks-office/understand-your-summons.page)

Also your speeding ticket analogy doesn't work because failure to pay said ticket would result in the suspension of the driving privilege, and you can't suspend somebody from walking around in public unless you lock them up, which you can't do in a civil infraction situation.


[Also Gov Cuomo himself said, ""You will not go to jail for not wearing a mask.""](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/governor-cuomo-orders-new-yorkers-to-wear-masks-in-public.html) So there's also that.

But let's stick with the beer ticket analogy. [Governor Cuomo does have leeway in issuing temporary directives during a disaster situation](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20217-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency), but that does not enable him to strip away legal recourse and unilaterally limit personal freedom without due process. So if he does order police to issue summonses to people without masks it would absolutely flood the court system with utter bullshit. And if people fail to answer the summonses, they absolutely can run the risk of being issued a bench warrant and going to jail, which runs counter to what Cuomo said in the press conference. This presents numerous problems, not the least of which is asking police officers to expose themselves to people without any face protection on a regular basis, sometimes with decidedly physical results. 

Additionally, it's going to stress people out and punish them for literally just going about their day, and given that it is legal to not wear a mask when you are not within six feet of somebody, are all cops going to be issued tape measures now? Like how is an officer supposed to do all this and still be required to do their regular job at the same time? 

And what if there's a whole bunch of people that are in a congested area without masks? Does he stop them and write tickets for every single one, or does he just pick somebody?

This mask thing is so incredibly half baked and stupid, and I just can't see how any cop can reasonably be expected to enforce it fairly. And don't pretend like there's a simple answer to this. There isn't.",1587052067,fnleco4

Abstract

&gt;The current COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating events in recent history. The virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. Therefore, if we could reduce the risk for vulnerable populations, it would make the COVID-19 pandemic more similar to other typical outbreaks. Children don‚Äôt suffer from COVID-19 as much as their grandparents and have a much higher melatonin level. Bats are nocturnal animals possessing high levels of melatonin, which may contribute to their high anti-viral resistance. Viruses induce an explosion of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin is the best natural antioxidant that is lost with age. The programmed cell death coronaviruses cause, which can result in significant lung damage, is also inhibited by melatonin. Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients‚Äô health after the active phase of the infection is over.  
&gt;  
&gt;Considering the fact that melatonin is known as a safe, inexpensive, readily-available OTC product, how would we justify to millions of people, who did not benefit from it at the time of a deadly crisis, that they and their relatives (who may not be alive anymore) were not timely informed of the potential benefits of melatonin? Thus, we believe that one should immediately conduct comprehensive retrospective studies comparing disease progression among patients who were or were not self-administering melatonin during the course of their disease. Although such data is not readily available yet, it is still possible to collect. The retrospective studies should be supplemented with a prospective one following the incidences and severity of post-infection complications in patients receiving and not-receiving melatonin. However, in addition to these above-mentioned conventional research strategies, we propose to immediately inform doctors, nurses, healthcare providers, and the general public of the potential benefits of melatonin. Extraordinary situations require out-of-the-box modus operandi. The lack of timely action is, in and of itself, an action

This will need to be peer-reviewed.

Firstly, let me be clear. I don't give a shit about this piece of shit Michael Cohen. And I also agree that no one in prison *deserves* freedom based on this pandemic. But pretending prisoners should not have the right to life is wrong to me. I don't think that some guy in prison for six months for possessing some weed or magic mushrooms deserves to be die horribly over the course of two weeks from Covid 19. They are in prison. They are not getting the death penalty. This complete lack of compassion for the incarcerated gets on my nerves because it seems like people on Reddit either are lacking empathy, or don't know about our prison system. A quarter of people in prisons are there for non violent crimes. Almost half of all people in federal prisons are there for drug offenses. Drug offenses aren't good, but considering most are simply possession, that can't be considered a violent crime. We can't keep pretending that everyone in prison is there for the right reasons, and deserve what their getting. And I'm not going to pretend that the fact that their in prison means death penalty by Covid is fucking justifiable. Forcing prisoners to stay locked up and get them, the guards, and guards family infected all so we can feel morally just and ""tough on crime"" is fucking cruel and unusual.

I think it's wrong for people who commit heinous acts to be released into society. Especially without proper rehabilitation. But considering there is currently a pandemic going around, I understand why some nonviolent prisoners in minimum security prisons would be put on house arrest rather than risk the lives of prisoners, guards, the guards families, and our communites all to pretend like those in prison done even deserve the right to not suffer and die slowly.",1587154512,fnpyvel

985,985,HeyMama_,"If we can erect hospitals to keep Covid and non-Covid separate then we can and should erect prisons to keep people who break the law or abuse the system in prison. I‚Äôm not saying they deserve Covid but they sure as hell don‚Äôt deserve to be free.

If you knowingly break the law, no matter how menial you find it, then you need to understand that there‚Äôs consequences and accept them. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Possession of drugs is not legal. If you choose to possess drugs and get arrested then you deserve what you get. You knew it was illegal. You did it anyway. It seems fairly straight forward to me.",1587154791,fnpzebm
986,986,Son_of_a_Robot,"I honestly to God never understood the ""tough on crime"" mentality so many people have. Or the idea that every law we have is just and should not be questioned. Or how some people never question why two people can break the law, but one can go free or get a far less harsh punishment based on the representation they are able to afford. It astounds me how black and white someone people think the world is. As long as something common that they enjoy isn't being declared illegal, people don't seem to care about what happens to others when unjust laws attack them. 



Something being illegal does not mean it is immoral. Something being illegal doesn't mean it causes harm or infringes upon someone else's freedom. For example. Some people need medical cannabis to aid in their physical conditions. Are you really going to walk up to someone with Parkinsons or Multiple Scolerosis and say they deserve two years in prison because they dared to want to move comfortably in South Dakota? You gonna walk up to someone with treatment resistant depression and a history of suicidal thoughts and say they deserve 5 years for trying psilocybin in hopes it could help them wake up and not want to die? Crimes are far more complicated than they may seem. Are we going to pretend that throwing addicts in jail and making it impossible for them to find employment or housing, and scratching our heads as to why they keep relapsing is effective?
 

Or maybe, just maybe, we can treat people with a little human decency and understand why the crime was committed in the first place. Maybe we can have a little compassion for our fellow man. 


Or we can be even tougher on crime so that anyone who breaks commonly broken laws should get the death penalty because hey, you knew it was illegal and shouldn't have done it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",1587156059,fnq1sln
987,987,HeyMama_,"I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs immoral. But it is illegal. There‚Äôs a difference between questioning a law and knowingly disobeying it and expecting not to face the consequences. I‚Äôm not tough on crime. I‚Äôm tough on people. I expect them not to break the law. Like, it‚Äôs not hard. In my 35 years facing a bevy of mental health issues, I haven‚Äôt ever broken the law, nor have I been arrested. If I know something is illegal, I don‚Äôt do it, and if I did, then I‚Äôd have to accept the consequences whether I agreed with the law or I didn‚Äôt. I mean, it‚Äôs two fold: it‚Äôs your crime and the fact that you knowingly committed a crime and you expected not to be punished. That‚Äôs just crazy talk. You should be able to disobey a law because you don‚Äôt agree with it and never face repercussions? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Going to jail causes relapses? Perhaps these people were going to relapse anyway. Statistics say that‚Äôs the case whether a person is jailed for their crime or they go to rehab. Those are the odds. If you‚Äôre an addict then you are likely to relapse multiple times until you either get/accept help or die.

Like it or not there are people who continue to break the law because they think they should be able to do what they want. Going rouge isn‚Äôt how the world works. If you don‚Äôt want to be in jail then don‚Äôt break the law. Don‚Äôt use your shitty life as an excuse or crutch. Stay in your lane and do what you‚Äôre supposed to.

It‚Äôs fine for there to be a difference of opinion on this but coming from a diverse place of working with inmates, non-inmates, et cetera ... I just find that a lot of people who haven‚Äôt been in jail have the same philosophy: I don‚Äôt want to be in jail therefore I don‚Äôt break the law.",1587156750,fnq32qi

For every day that you work, regardless of how much you make, you lose 25 percent of your pay.  For example, there was a single mother in Rochester who was offered a part time job at a local university.  This university has a practice of starting people part-time and if they work out they are offered full-time positions.  The pay and benefits are good once you are full-time.  She wanted to take the job but would have made less per week doing so.

then I'm grateful that my hours weren't cut too severely, just 20% for now.   


I don't feel like they're taking necessarily advantage of the situation with loans and whatnot as we're actually still fairly busy I don't think we'd qualify for them, for now at least, and everyone is still being employed at 32 hours a week for the time being.   


Though I do worry if they cut back hours more than this in the future, that they at some point might keep us working 5 days a week but drop us to 4 hour shifts a day and leave us shafted for unemployment help :T
