In the missoula office, you have to take a number to get served if you don't have an appointment. If you rush in and grab your number so that you are the first in line, your wait may be less. I did this after my birthday when I realized I had let my license expire by accident. I was there about 20 minutes before my number got called. 

But you have to be assertive about keeping your place in line before the doors open. There was a lot of jockeying to be the first one in.  If you are not successful at being the first person in, you will wait a lot longer than 20 minutes.

44,44,Fallout99,"I bumped into a childhood friend last week, while doing some last-minute Christmas shopping.  Gerald (and his brother Mike) were just like any other Great Falls kids back in the day—socializing and playing sports. We ran in some of the same circles.  They were also part of the “lost tribe” of Chippewa.  Years ago, when other Indian tribes in Montana settled into reservation lands, the Chippewa stood strong against settling for an inadequate offer from a more-powerful United States government—and it backfired.  The Little Shell tribe of Chippewa got nothing, and they became somewhat ‘lost’ without a piece of land to call their own.

It’s an interesting idea regarding land: “We were here first” often has a strong legal foundation in civilized courts and governments.  But not always.  Just because a tribe or nation occupies a certain plot of land hasn’t historically assured its future ownership.

Just days before I ran into Gerald, I was in Israel.  And wouldn’t you know it—they’re dealing with the same thing!  Kinda.  Several other Secretaries of State, and myself, spent the better part of a week learning about the small nation of Israel and all the nuances of living in a region where different tribes and nations really don’t like each other.  Trying to allocate land and property based upon who was there ‘first’ doesn’t always work very well, to say the least.

Both the Jewish people and the Palestinians want to live in the same place.  Both sides have claims of ownership going back to the beginning of recorded history.  But the creation of the new country of Israel in 1948 on the location of Palestine (as a direct response to the devastating World War II holocaust that ended in 1945) is the rule of the day.  Israel is the mandate of the modern world.  The Jewish people were given a place of their own.

So, here’s the question:  When is it better to blend tribes together, and when is it better to keep them apart?

Both the Jewish and Palestinian leaders agree that a ‘two-state solution’ is the only acceptable course.  In other words, they each want to have their own country, and be physically separated from each other.  They don’t want to live in the same neighborhoods, have children attend the same schools, intra-marry, or vote in the same elections.  They do not want to assimilate cultures.

In Montana, we refer to our Indian reservations as ‘sovereign’ in some regards, but in other situations the tribes are treated just like other citizens of the state and nation.  I guess we could call it a ‘softer’ two-state solution.  Our Montana and U.S. constitutions attempt to balance both cultural respect and assimilation as noble goals for Indian reservations.

I suppose Charles Darwin would have a different answer to my question.  Darwinism would likely emphasize evolution and “the strong survive” argument, pointing out that national borders of countries have changed a million times.  Nothing stays the same, even the continents break apart and drift away.  Species, languages, races all adapt and assimilate or they fade away.

With our world’s population approaching 8 billion people, I think this question of assimilating tribes versus separating them will not be going away anytime soon.  Luckily in Montana, we have lots of land and not many people.  Native Americans and Hutterites have plenty of room to segregate themselves, while the Irish, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, German, African, etc., tend to blend into our towns and cities without much fanfare.  (Too bad the French didn’t negotiate for a reservation, back in 1803, when they sold us Montana in the Louisiana purchase.  We could drive to the French reservation to shop, eat!)

I congratulated Gerald and his Little Shell tribe for their long, hard-fought victory in recognition.  I know how important it is to them, and other Native Americans, that they honor the wishes of their ancestors.  Gerald inherited this struggle from his tribe.  The Little Shell tribe was just recently given 200 acres for a new reservation.  I pray for the Little Shell tribe of Chippewa, that they blossom into their full potential.  Gerald is now the Chairman of the Little Shell tribe.  He’s a quiet, persistent leader, and I’m proud of him.

I pray for peace in Israel and Palestine, too.  My brain isn’t big enough to figure out how to solve the problems of the Middle East.  But I do know that the world is getting smaller, with more and more people, and our modern governments have to learn from the horrendous lessons of last century.

Perhaps the best wisdom for settling land conflicts, something both Gerald and I would remember, is from an 80’s movie called Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure:

Affordability is a better measure and compares the ability of people making an average wage to afford things like housing. In terms of affordability Missoula is horrible.

&gt;Searchers continued looking for a missing 16-year-old girl Thursday morning near a rest area on I-90 where she was last seen. 

&gt;Selina Shelley Faye Not Afraid was last seen at the eastbound I-90 rest area between Billings and Hardin near mile marker 474 near the Fly Creek Exit at 2 p.m. Wednesday.

&gt;According to Bighorn County Sheriff Lawrence Big Hair, Not Afraid was part of a group of six people driving from Billings to Hardin. The car broke down, then restarted. Four people left the rest stop in the vehicle, and the driver called a relative who was also driving from Billings to pick up Not Afraid and another girl who were left behind at the rest stop. 

&gt;Searchers gather at the Fly Creek rest area on I-90 on Thursday. Teams are searching for 16-year-old Selina Shelley Faye Not Afraid on private land south of the rest area.

&gt;However, when the relative arrived, only one girl was at the rest stop. Not Afraid had walked off into a nearby field.

&gt;She was possibly intoxicated and is not dressed for weather conditions, according to an email from Big Horn County Sheriff's office.

&gt;The Sheriff's office and other agencies including the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Crow Agency Tribal Police have launched a search from the rest stop. Officers and volunteers on horse, foot and ATV have combed nearby areas, and a helicopter flew over the area in the morning. 

&gt;The search has focused in fields south and east of the rest area in a 3-4 mile area. No sign of Not Afraid has been found so far, Big Hair said. 

&gt;A post by a search party participant on the Bighorn Crime Watch Facebook page Thursday night stated that another search will begin Friday at 8 a.m. at the I-90 rest area between Billings and Hardin near mile marker 474. Anyone who wants to participate should check in at the rest area before starting their search, the post states.

&gt;There is some hope that she either returned to I-90 or crossed over to Highway 87 and received a ride, Big Hair said. Low temperatures in Hardin reached 32 degrees late Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service. 

&gt;A group of searchers from the BIA heads back out to search on ATVs from the Fly Creek rest area on I-90. Teams are searching for 16-year-old Selina Shelley Faye Not Afraid on private land south of the rest area Thursday, January 2, 2020.

&gt;Not Afraid was last seen wearing a black coat, gray sweater, blue jeans and gray ankle boots. She is 5 foot and 9 inches tall and weighs 133 pounds. She has brown eyes and black hair. She has a scar near her mouth and a tattoo of a cross on her middle finger. 

&gt;Anyone with information on Not Afraid is asked to call Big Horn County Sheriff's Office at 406-665-9780 or call 911.",1578076631,fcy9g9k

Also false that you need a college degree. You do meet to go to federal law enforcement training and of course qualify for a job, but on NPS LE applications a combination of experience and education or simply experience alone can get you on the cert list

380,380,HopeInThePark,"The problem with your requirements isn't that they're too difficult. It's that they're so broad that you could go almost anywhere in the western third of the state and find something to your liking. 

You're probably vastly overestimating how perilous our mountains are to hike. Not to say that they don't exist, but the treacherous hiking paths that you see in popular culture are fairly rare. You're going to find the majority of hiking paths suitable for your purposes. 

Likewise, encounters with predators (including bears) are exceedingly rare. I've never been within thirty yards of a bear. 
They don't like hanging around hikers. In fact, the only dangerous confrontations I've had were accidentally stumbling across the path of a moose because I wasn't paying attention. (However, if you come in early autumn, be aware that not only are you likely to experience cold weather, but bears and other animals will be more active since they'll be foraging for winter.)

Your biggest risks are getting lost or suffering from exposure. [Leave No Trace](http://www.lnt.org) is an excellent resource for camping and hiking out west. Read some of their beginner articles, make sure to pack some bear spray (better safe than sorry)*, and be prepared to enjoy yourself. 

(As for recommendations, Glacier National Park is probably the most beautiful part of the country, but it can also get crowded.  If you want to avoid crowds, I'd recommend landing in Missoula and researching places around the bitterroot range [which are nearby] or the Bob Marshall Wilderness.)

Mind if I offer a couple of minor edits? Mostly about your stream issues.

You've got something funny going with the transparency of your stream layer. You can see the overlap at segment intersections as being less transparent. That's odd. What software is this?

You can also see the network lines in the lake.

I'd suggest getting rid of any transparency in the water layer. You don't need it and it's showing flaws.

Put it under the transparent hillshade, but above your hypsometric layer. Same with the lakes. Lose the transparency. If you find the color is popping too much, turn down the saturation, or turn up the value.

Go ahead and keep the slight transparency you've got on the thermal layer and keep it on top. That works with what you're presenting.

For the streams, do you have an option for round line caps, rather than square? Not saying it's a must, but you might like it better for natural features like streams.

Also, some of your line caps for the streams extend out beyond the bounds of the Park. You might consider making a YNP mask (a really big square poly with a YNP-shaped hole in the center) and put it at the very top with white fill, 0 border. That should give you a nice, clean border.

Lastly, I'd suggest de-emphasizing the scalebar a bit, it kind of draws the eye.

If keeping it 50 miles is your intention to show the scale of the Park, you might bump the text size down a notch, maybe back it off from 0,0,0 black a few shades. You could also move the unit label to center of the bar, opposite the numbers, to keep it from unbalancing the width of the text. Personally, I like putting the numbers under the bar, but everyone's got their own style preferences.",1578505316,fdkk5dn

I'll definitely try just putting everything under the transparent raster except for the hotspots and I'm sure I could round the stream edges as well.

562,562,Fragrant-Caterpillar,"Made a profile just to answer to this. I don’t think that knowing these people personally is enough. I understand that you care for them and probably know them better personally, but it is idiotic and quite frankly offensive that you think this is enough to state how they managed their ministry. Through pictures?! That’s how you can tell how our kids were helped through the ministry? I say our kids because as someone who worked on the field for a couple years with the ministry I consider them my kids. Some of them told me I was like an older sister and a second mom, and I still maintain a relationship with them to this day. I really don’t mean to offend you, but it is deeply upsetting that  you think you can talk about how happy they looked and how nicely they were dressed and how that is because of the ministry. Having a media person was ESSENTIAL for each team. Even if we were short on people it was a priority to have someone take pictures and not to help out with setting up, serving food (that was some only once a week, not as often as it’s portrayed) or playing with kids. Never ONCE did we give out clothes. Why would you assume that? Pictures say absolutely nothing. A lot of them were posed, I light even dare to say staged. People would purposely play with kids to get a good picture to post for sponsor. The few times I was the Rozells plying with kids it was for pictures. Maybe at the beginning of the ministry they deeply cares about spending time with them, but not while I was there. I would talk to moms from the communities and villages and they would share how hurt children would get because of how often interns left (6 months). No one cares to explain to them anything. Everything was so systematic and not centered on the kids at all. The interns that cares enough to build relationships and to treat the kids as individuals were the ones that made an impact. Not the Rozells. I don’t care how nice they were to you, they didn’t treat the kids like that. Never did I see them treat them poorly, let’s make that clear, but I never saw them care enough either, it seemed more like a chore. The budget we had for kids clubs did not reflect the quantity of sponsors and the success of mudman (“non-profit restaurant that “helped” to pay the work around the world). Money was used to helped interns travel and cover expenses, but at the end of the day, kids were the last priority.",1578668275,fdqjmk9

575,575,Boiferns,"Ditto, me too, that’s what got me to The Murray the first time, then I fell in love with it. Last year I stayed in the room next to the The Peckinpah Suite and the door was open after they cleaned it, definitely took advantage and checked it out, it’s on the bucketlist to stay in that room sometime, but it’s spendy. Whenever I’m in Livingston, normally late summer, I always get some fishing in, but as others have said, it’ll be more difficult that time of year. 

To be honest, my girlfriend and I do a lot of eating, drinking, walking around when we’re in Livingston or Jackson, or any town for that matter. But that area of Wyoming, Central Idaho, and Southwest Montana is our jam. 

In Jackson we stay at The Wort downtown, we always hit Thai Me Up (killer beer, it’s Melvin Brewing’s original spot, killer Thai food), Silver Dollar Saloon (in The Wort), Snake River Brewing, The Bird (lil’ outside of town, great burgers on English muffins), Gather is great, Local Restaurant is good too. On the finer side; The Restaurant at White Buffalo Club and Wild Sage. Pinky G’s for that late night pizza craving. 

Livingston we spend a ton of time at Murray Bar, they have a great happy hour and good grub. We always make friends at Murray Bar, it’s just one of those bars, the back patio is always fun those summer nights. We do make it a point to eat at 2nd Street Bistro each trip too, always a good meal. The recently reopened Livingston Bar and Grille is good (deep fried deviled eggs!), Stockmans has good steak and it’s just a fun experience, drinks at The Mint and The Owl Lounge. 

If you stay at The Murray, drinking a cup of coffee on the roof is a must for sunrise, likewise, take a bottle of wine up to the roof for sunset.",1578674395,fdqt9g4

I'm glad I bought my house 7 years ago because I wouldn't be able to afford it today.

I belong to a weekly social group and there's a new couple that just moved here from California. He makes really good money and she doesn't work.

This is the wrong reason to move here.

Good reasons for moving to Montana include what Montana has to offer you, and what you have to offer Montana.

Moving to get away from ""those people"" whoever you think they are is a terrible reason to move anywhere. Largely because wherever you go, there will be people you'll be able to lump together as ""those people"" (the definition is irrelevant).

Also, You're making assumptions of what you THINK Montana politics is. I guarantee you you're mistaken. Montana politics are still very local, and defy the national pigeonholes.

Honestly, we don't hate Californians. It's the economic displacement they cause that causes us to grumble. But Washingtonians, Coloradans and Texans do the same thing. California is just so big and so close that it's an easy emblem to latch onto. On a personal level, noone every really picks on an individual Californian. This isn't gang territory, and don't get baught into the ""change your plate right quick"" hype. Nothing is going to happen, no one will say (or likely even think) anything.

None of those rights exist at the federal level. I don't think even California has those at a constitutional level.

Montana also suffers from a lack in variety of perspectives. It can be difficult to describe but many people who are born and raised here don't ever leave and that means they're not exposed to other cultures, other value systems, or a variety of other life experiences.  While working in California have met a ton of refugees, a lot of immigrants too. Those people's life experience incredibly alien to mine and exposure to it has given me a much broader worldview. I understand the consequences of some of America's actions overseas better than I ever would have. I have a much deeper understanding of the privilege that I enjoy as a white male.

Montana has a depressing lack of old growth Redwood forests. I think that's definitely a point in California's favor.

If we're being objective there are some things about California that are better. There's definitely things about California that you're going to miss, and rightly so. There are things that are great about California and I don't think that anyone who says otherwise is being honest with themselves.

Californians take a bad rap because they were the first big harvest for what is becoming a national problem. This nation has bred a new generation of YUPPIES who grew up in middle class suburbia out of touch with hard Knox in pampered childhoods where everything was given to them. Then they became relatively wealthy at an early age through the housing and tech booms. This adds steroids to their sense of entitlement and superiority.

But we do have [old growth cedars](http://www.libbymt.com/areaattractions/rosscreekcedars.htm) near Libby.  I'm not sure why you settled on that one thing, or maybe you were just making an example.  Both states have a diverse geography, and have their own stunning parks and places to visit.  Yosemite is gorgeous, but I think Glacier is 10-times more so.  CA has the coast, something we obviously lack.  Etc. etc.

The biggest issue we have is people who come from urban areas, and try to apply that urban policy to more rural towns and cities.  Bozeman is nothing like SF, LA or Chicago, yet we get people who move here and tend to bring those viewpoints with them.  These turn into ballot initiatives and votes.  Like others have said, someone in SF could sell their house for $2M and come up here and buy 4 houses for that, rent out 3.

And, ultimately, I really like old growth redwood forest. I'm not necessarily saying everybody has to but if I'm compiling a list of the things I like to do in California that is kind of near the top.

I hear you on the home prices thing. It's a crapshoot that's for sure. Higher home prices here benefits the people here who already own homes at the expense of people who don't. The people who don't own homes have to buy them further and further away from the city and that can suck. On the upside it brings generally increased wages although that's not necessarily Universal.

As far as City viewpoints and ballot initiatives that's another really good point. One of the upsides and downsides of democracy. 

Not all of those viewpoints are objectively bad but they are certainly different. It is tough to be in an area with that kind of change happening when you would prefer to stay the same.

That's actually kind of the heart of the entire conservative ideology, at least the old-school conservative ideology. Generally speaking conservatives work to conserve the status quo. To maintain a lifestyle and social structure that works for them and that they identify with and are comfortable with. Liberals, at least old school liberals, accepted a much higher rate of change. They saw Society has something to constantly try to improve. Maybe it was good now but could it be better if we changed? Sometimes the answer is yes and sometimes the answer is no but most of the time the answer for a large group of people is I don't want to find out because I like it right now.

I think that cuts to the heart of out-of-state people moving in state. They have a broader view point and so it will have things that they want to change about Montana to make it more like what they had and many people who live here don't want that",1578785514,fdz0tb9

As far as conservative vs. liberal, I tend to agree, however I think of it more in terms of left vs. right.

People who come from places like SF bring more left-leaning politics to a largely right-leaning state.  While I think a lot of us can agree that we want society to move forward and want the standard of living to increase for everyone, we don't all agree on the method of getting there.  For example, I want better roads, transportation, better wages, lower cost housing, etc.  But I vehemently disagree with, for example, Bernie's way of getting it done.

The right: you're looking for work that can get you here. Many people assume that things will just work out if they go for it. And sometimes they do. But often people don't realize that a state of just 1 million just won't have the career opportunities and services that larger states do.

Take a good look at the offered salary vs the cost of living where you're looking. Bozeman, Missoula and Kalispell are expensive, Butte, Great Falls and Billings not as much so. Helena is somewhere in between. The salary will likely be far less than what you'd be offered in another market. But many think it's worth the sacrifice.

The wrong: don't try to ingratiate yourself by throwing Californians under the bus. If you come here, you'll be adding to the numbers and taking up about 1m^2 of space just like everyone else.

Also, specific questions get great responses on this forum. Extremely vague ones like ""Where in MT should I move?"" get downvoted into oblivion.

To my knowledge, MT may be the only state with an immediate, if working, vehicle registration statute like this.

877,877,Badlands32,"Well luckily for you you will be living in probably the best state there is for camping, fishing, hiking and photography and your typical activities. 

Best part about Montana is that you can pretty much basically walk out your door and be just minutes away from all of those things you seem to enjoy. 

As for the people, you will find that if you treat people good, and are honest with them, most people will give you the shirt off their backs to help you.  Dont be condescending with your ""outside"" views of the world, people from Montana often get that from outsiders alot, thats the first way to turn them off toward you. 

Again, be honest, if youre not it will spread fast. And not just within your own town, everyone in Montana knows somebody in another town, and likely very well. You drop a name in a town, and theres a good chance they know them.  

Get involved in the community. A lot of small Montana communities are slowly dying, not for the lack of want or pride, but the lack of knowledge of how it can be done better, or examples of how places outside the state do things better, or more efficiently. If you have good ideas that can be shared, dont be afraid to float them out there. 

Dont push your political views or politics on the residents. That will generally be responded to with ""great, you can move back there then"".  Montanans are proud people and very proud of their difference from other states. 

There will be some things that are very different, and that youre maybe not used to seeing or hearing. Guns in truck windows, people talking about hunting, lots of agriculture, specially where you're at. Its considered Montanas golden triangle, big wheat country.  You dont have to love hunting, or guns, but dont shit on it to the people that do. Maybe ask them about it to better understand what it means to them. To many, hunting season is part of who they are as a person. 

Pay attention to weather, and take it seriously. If locals give advice on weather events listen. Specially where youre moving, you will see some amazingly beautiful and rugged storms roll off the Rocky Mountain front. Travel smart. 

Lastly, congratulations on moving to the best state in the country, from someone who grew up in Montana!",1579101092,fegrvkl

888,888,johnnyblood2,"Do not stay in Browning. Browning can be dangerous at night. Your best bet is to get a room in East Glacier Park Village, St. Mary, or Columbia Falls.

Remember the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Most tourists are stupid and enter the park from the west in the morning and come out in the east in the afternoon. Do not be ""most tourists."" Get up BEFORE the sun gets up and travel Going to the Sun Road starting during the twilight hours. First stop? Wild Goose Island or Many Glacier at Swiftcurrent Lake. BOTH are amazing spots to be at day break. Then, race to the top of Going to the Sun Road at Logan Pass and you will have the entire roof of Glacier National Park because ""most tourists"" don't wake up until 10 AM. If beauty is what you seek and memorable photos, then wake up early and nap during the middle of the day.

Logan Pass is full of wildlife (usually) when there are few people around. Keep your head on a swivel and look for mountain goats, yellow bellied marmots, grouse, bighorn sheep, deer, bears, etc.

Carry bear mace if you plan to hike. There are MANY brown bears in Glacier National Park. And I'm not kidding.

Read the book ""Night of the Grizzlies"" by Jack Olsen before you go to Glacier National Park.

Schedule a morning stop at Polebridge Mercantile on the west side of the park.

Drive Highway 49 from Kiowa to East Glacier Village. Its a road not often traveled but the views are quite nice.

Schedule a stop at Goat Lick Overlook in the morning on Highway 2 if you can.

If you like whiskey schedule a stop at Glacier Distilling Company in Coram, Montana.

For a unique idea for a night's stay, check out [Recreation.gov](https://Recreation.gov) and rent a fire lookout on the east side of Flathead Lake (which isn't far from the western entrance to Glacier National Park). But you will have to do it soon for 2020.

If you are going to Idaho and Washington, don't forget to stop to see the Ross Creek Giant Cedars near the Idaho/Montana border. I would also encourage a stop in Eureka (Montana) and Bonners Ferry (Idaho). Whitefish is a tourist trap.

If you want to do something totally different but AMAZING on your trip west, drive south from Spokane a few miles in the heart of what is called ""the Palouse"" and spend a night in Colfax, Washington. The landscapes there are absolutely beautiful and stunning and most American know NOTHING about this region of the United States. This is farming country; big rolling hills, red barns everywhere, and schedule a trip to the top of Steptoe Butte at day break. Just Google ""Palouse"" and look at the beauty. It reminds me of Tuscany, Italy. Then you might drive to the Snake River, go to Palouse Falls, head on into Walla Walla and visit some wineries, go to Mount Hook and Trillium Lake, spend a night in Portland and a day in Astoria, and along the Oregon coast for the most beautiful coastline in America.

Lastly, depending on when you go, see if your trip coincides with North American Indian Days in Browning (Montana), huckleberry picking, or wheat harvest in the Palouse. Each of these would be a treat to observe and/or participate in.

Lake Elwell is near and has some of the best  walleye, northern and sauger pike fishing anywhere in the country.

912,912,johnnyblood2,"Havre is at the end of the cul de sac, so to speak. But it has many positive qualities. Just be sure to visit it before you make a decision.

Havre is located on the Hi-Line, about 60 miles from the Canadian border in one of the last places in the country where you can experience both cowboys AND Indians. Nestled between two Indian reservations, you can expect to have several powwows throughout the year to attend if that's your thing, and plenty of cowboy related activities too. Branding cattle with a rancher who still ropes cattle is something most people will never see in their life times. In fact, back east, some people will pay thousands of dollars to participate in something like a branding that you would have an opportunity to experience for free.

Nearby are the Bear Paw Mountains and Fresno Reservoir. Though those native residents of Havre would never tell you, I can...it has some of the best walleye and northern pike fishing anywhere in the world. There are also several lakes in Beaver Creek Park (the largest county park in the country) just south of Havre. The Bear Paws are beautiful and at times in spring and fall you can drive through and around them and experience three seasons all at once. There's also plenty of hunting in the area; pheasants, deer, etc.

You will also be located in a very old part of the state. Old abandoned churches and grain elevators dot the landscape, and offer a constant reminder of where you are. They are fun to photograph and explore.

Food-wise, most of Montana is a culinary wasteland, but there a few good restaurants in Havre (a few...5th Avenue Grind, Guadalajara Mexican Restaurant, breakfast at Char's). There are two large grocery stores in town, and the Walmart Supercenter is no better or worse than any other Walmart in the country.

In the summer you will have plenty of county fairs, rodeos, and festivals in the vicinity to visit. In the winter things slow down, but there are usually some wonderful church suppers and other events to enjoy. The swimming pool in town is also indoors.

Location-wise you will be three hours from Glacier National Park, 90 minutes from Great Falls, three hours from some of the best elk hunting anywhere in the United States, 90 minutes to the beautiful Missouri River Breaks, and a host of other outdoor wonders.

927,927,Montaire,"It's not terrible. It's a great town to go to school because you'll have a chance to focus on school. There are recreational opportunities but there a little more distant then they would be in any other City.

Just like anywhere it has good people and bad people, good places and bad places.

Honestly, it doesn't have a ton going for it but the school up there has some programs that really are excellent and have good reputations. You'll meet some good people at school although last I heard it was pretty distorted and the men heavily outnumbered the women which can be difficult.

Think carefully about how you're going to spend your off school time. If extracurricular activities are important to you or if you're trying to build a portfolio to get into advanced programs or high-level jobs then Havre probably isn't a great place.  If you're looking to get a solid working job right out of School from one of their technical programs you're probably going to succeed. It is kind of a party town but the party is pretty much just drinking.

One word of warning and I'm deadly serious here, if you have poor impulse control or if you have substance abuse problems or think you might be susceptible to that then don't go. The Town can pull you under, there's a lot of opportunity for abuse up there and if you can't handle it it's a great place to destroy your life.",1579129758,fei3yms

I probably know more about the TERO process on Montana reservations and hired more Native American Indians and invested more cash into businesses on reservations since 2010 than almost anyone in the state. I bet you didn’t know that. I have also worked with two Native American school districts to begin teaching computer code to children on the reservation starting in the first grade and not ending until they graduate high school.

The reason there is greater than 50% unemployment on your reservation is because (1) the zip code has fewer registered home based businesses than almost every other zip code in the state, (2) the BIA and Dept. of Interior has created pure socialism on the reservation offering little incentive for members to create their own jobs where there are none (i.e. entrepreneurship), and (3) because your council members make $80,000 a year where council members off reservations are lucky to get a tiny stipend for food and gas at each meeting, which means your council members are not serving for the good of their constituents, only the good of their wallets. I own my own business on the Hi-Line and my customers are not on the Hi-Line. They are in Chicago, New York, Seattle, etc. You could do something like that too, but instead you would rather ignore your horrible crime rate, blame your station in life on no companies hiring, and using racism (real or not) as an excuse for everything else.

Things to consider:  
1. Checkerboarded public lands (there's a lot and you'll likely lose access to these lands)

2. Roadways: what roads pass through these properties which are considered public but which have some ambiguity around their status?

Since buying a property has nothing to do with your job here, the oldtime more ""Montanan"" Missoulians are much fewer in proportion. The ones who rented mostly got priced out an left years ago.

And although the East does not have the same views of the west, the views are much more diverse: Beartooth Mountains, Bear Paw Mountains, Little Belt Mountains, Crazy Mountains, badlands, oceans of prairie grass and wheat on the plains, Sweetgrass Hills, Capitol Rock, Medicine Rocks, Makoshika State Park, railroads, grain elevators, abandoned prairie churches and homesteads, train trestles, ghost towns, hidden 4x4 gravel roads through the mountains, Lake Elwell, Missouri River Breaks, Fort Peck Lake, Yellowstone River, river ferry crossings, Slippery Ann, etc. The west has their thing and the east has its thing.

It takes a long time to remove snow on the top of a 6000' range of mountains. That said, the do open the road some before it is open to Logan Pass. All you would be missing out on is a trip to Logan Pass, which is not really that spectacular. You would still be able to visit Many Glacier, Wild Good Island, the shores of St. Mary Lake, and several hiking trails. It would give you a chance to traverse the area through its other scenic roads, like Highway 49, Highway 2, Highway 17, etc. You would just spend a day or two on the east side and a day or two on the west side. No big deal.

As for going in the fall, that's an option, too. But I usually like to time my visit for when the aspen trees turn yellow. Usually the first week in October or last week in September. Though you could also be snowed out, too.

Kalispell -- Conservative big town, getting kind of expensive but there is a massive influx of Seattle/Portland people. Downtown is up-and-coming. Health care I don't know about.  
Missoula -- Hippy town U.S.A. This is a big university town, has lots of great places to eat, beautiful downtown and music scene is vibrant. Access to some amazing mountain biking, skiing, and hiking (trailheads get busy in the summer). A good place to find health care work,

Helena -- (My town) Best kept secret until now. This is a sleeper town, A LOT like Asheville. 6 breweries, more mountain biking than you know what to do with, super cowboy ski hill called Great Divide (within 20 minutes). Nestled off the beaten path, it doesn't get crazy foot traffic in the summer. St. Pete's is a large hospital, easy to find work. Nightlife doesn't exist in this town. Very much a family or retirement center.

Great Falls -- Flat, lots of places to eat...cool access to the outdoors. Quick to get to Eastern Glacier. 

Bozeman -- Gateway to the luxury of Montana. Nightlife is vibrant, people drive fancy SUV and Lambos. There is a large university there that pumps drunk students into the streets Wednesday to Wednesday. Very expensive to live, but honestly a beautiful place. You can be to Big Sky ($130 a ticket) in 1.5 hours (without traffic), Bridger 45 minutes without traffic. I honestly love Bozeman, but I am not a city influence kind of guy.

Butte -- A beautiful mining city that makes you wonder why no one lives there. Some cool spots to see, a town that needs some help to develop. Really cheap to live there. If you are a medical professional, I bet you will see some INTERESTING things. Great mountain biking, hiking, fishing, skiing is kind of far. 

Billings -- Yeah just don't. Well, I don't spend any time there. Close to a place called Red Lodge and it is a breathtaking town.

I suspect the laws you are referring to are similar to those passing or on the agenda in Colorado; in that they're motivated by a combination of extreme liberalism and fear. Like you I am eying a move to Montana to escape that. Though in all honesty I have wanted to live in that state since I was a child. 

From my vantage point and experience I agree with your estimation of Idaho, but fear Montana will follow the rest of the country. Though perhaps slower than Washington or Colorado has.

One thing I noticed in 2019 was Montana appeared to have more gay rights marches than Colorado. A person's sexuality *never* factors into how I treat someone else. It's as unimportant to me as race, sex, religion, and so on. Nevertheless, in my experience it seems to me political and cultural change follows mildly predictable paths. That could just be my experience, though. And that's right or left. I've learned to be deeply suspicious of anything extreme.

But I also see a cultural libertarianism in Montana and parts of Wyoming that is as stubborn as it is freeing and gratifying. I suspect the rest of my life (and I'm past the warranty period and into the second half) will see a relatively libertarian live-and-let-live culture 'up there'.  And that means much more to me than red or blue.

I have faith in the free thinking men and women on Montana and most of Wyoming. They represent, to me, people who will repay respect with respect. And a little geographic separation from the rest of the mess can't hurt.",1579622039,ff694ta

As more people move to the cities, they have less firsthand knowledge of firearms, instead relying on news and fictional portrayals, which are overwhelmingly negative. I don't see the news stopping the click-bait ""if it bleeds, it leads"" style of reporting and I don't see movies and TV dropping the over-the-top action/shoot 'em up genre, so I believe many people who lack deep, first-hand knowledge of guns and hunting culture will continue to have an irrational fear of guns.

Before the NRA remade itself a partisan political organization in the 70s guns were pretty much just viewed as tools. If you lived in a rural area you might have a .22 for small game, .30-06 or similar for larger, shotgun for fowl etc, but you didn’t really have people stockpiling a few dozen guns and massive amounts of ammo (around one in four Americans own a gun, but over half the guns are owned by just 3% of the population).

Preserving gun rights would probably be best served by espousing the traditional view that they’re a tool for living in/near rural areas like a shovel or anything else.

Up until very recently, guns were not a political issue in Montana. Montanans understood that guns were tools -- you hunted with them, killed predators when necessary, and occasionally blew off some steam or had fun at a firing range. The notion that gun ownership could be a political issue was almost totally foreign. 

Or at least it *was* apolitical until a bunch of fucking gun fetishists started crowing about Montana being the last bastion of independence and other stupid, far right libertarian nonsense.

Simultaneously, a pack of hand-wringing losers from the west coast, enamored with the picturesque wilderness of Yellowstone and Glacier, began showing up and worrying to anybody in earshot about the dangers of firearms. 

And now these two groups, both scumbags from opposite sides of the same coin, are fomenting political discord and turning what was once a harmless non-issue into a major social and cultural argument.

Any full auto gun... like a chain fed stationary machine gun? What about RPGs (tongue in cheek)? Honestly we’d probably be better off with access to full auto guns but no loopholes for who could purchase them and universal red flag laws (those seem to be one of the statistically best ways of reducing gun violence in the state / county) if you’re serious about the ‘only those who pose no threat’. But if you’re serious about the latter you’re down with the State being able to take away someone’s firearms. 

I mainly think that there’s a vocal subset on the right that does gun rights a disservice by a creepy fetishization of them. It’s really been the last ~60 years or that private gun ownership has been tied to the second amendment (a 1939 Supreme Court case rules that regulating sawed off shotguns crossing state lines because they had no real role in a well ordered militia). People hear about the nearly daily mass shootings, and the loudest voices on the right are often those with two dozen guns wearing a 2nd amendment shirt that says they’ll shoot anyone that disagrees with them (have met a few of this type, didn’t care for them). 

The quiet competent sportsmen voice could make a better case IMO.

I've done a bit or research, going through forums, so here's what my understanding is:

Being #2 or #3 on % of firearm owners by state (nearly 60%), I assumed Montana is currently for the most part pro-firwarm.
Being that I've seen more than enough ""Government overreach"" and a more anti-taxation (or over-taxation I should say) mindset from residents,
Being that Montana, despite its physical location, not only has great hunting regulations, but also has great firearm laws, has medical marijuana, and is LGBT friendly (I'm not homosexual but I dont give a **** about who people choose to love) 
and has more of a ""constructive"" approach to political issues (with most of the state being divided - politically speaking)
And despite a democratic governor, most residents I met seemed more on the cowboy side of things. Lol

I would assume Montana would be the most ""libertarian"" state out there. I don't think there is a single state that manages to come THAT close, maybe Alaska? I can't think of any others.

Again, this is just what I've found after a lot of research online. I'm also in a lot of hunting forums so I've had some great (albeit envious) discussions with Montanans.

Can you elaborate here? I dont get how wanting to leave a state you dont agree with makes you a bad community elsewhere. For the past four years Washington voters have shut down initiatives to initiate a food tax. Despite this, our governor is trying to override this by passing it into law without voter approval. In 15 years, washington voters have approved two initiatives reducing a car tab fee to $30, despite this the state used executive powers both times to shut ir down (after voters made it law). The same thing happened with gas tax. 

Believe me, I wish I could do more than call representatives, voting or going to rallies but I cant. When your vote no longer matters I no longer care to live here.

I'm not sure if you're aware of I-1639 that went into effect in Washington last year. It involves requiring a permit and such to by assault weapons (like a Ruger 22 LR)

The walmart where I live had a stand that was advertising a ""no more gas tax"" bill (that never existed) and were actually collecting 1639 signatures. And this isnt just a blatant accusation, this happened in Spokane and King county as well and pictures were online and all over the news. Despite this apparent legality, Inslee let it go through. And while our car tab fee bill was challenged in court by King county, a judge ""halted"" it while its unconstitutionality was being challenged. Despite this, while 1639 was in a 9 month long legal battle about its ""constitutionality"" it was never halted and was already in effect when the proceedings went through.

1281,1281,HopeInThePark,"&gt; Can you elaborate here?

The problems you cite immediately following this question are the same problems you're going to find no matter where you move. Montana does not have a special immunity to the abuse of state power. In fact, as the state has become increasingly fractured along political and social lines, politicians and government officials have shown more and more willingness to ignore the concerns of their constituents. 

Public access is a great example of the political fuckery happening in the state now. (I won't elaborate on the issue here except to say that the major point of contention involves landowners blocking access to public lands by preventing passage through their property.) For me personally, where you fall on that issue is a great litmus test of whether or not you should consider moving here. If you side with the landowners, consider moving elsewhere.

There are dozens of good reasons to want to move to Montana (or any place for that matter). Alignment with your very specific, very individual political positions is at the very bottom of that list, if it's even present at all. I guarantee there are political issues here on which you are very much going to disagree. 

You're joining a community of people who I guarantee are very different than you might expect. Instead of asking whether they will continue to support gun rights -- which of course they will, and for as long as they remain a state, I imagine -- a better question is whether you're truly suited for this lifestyle and how you can be a good neighbor.",1579632532,ff6q3vq
1282,1282,MortalFellow,"I think the laws will become more strict because of societal decay more than anything.

In the Flathead Valley recently two teens emptied a clip (at least 20 shells) into a house in a ""drive-by"". There have also been unsolved killings of horses with rifles, and quite a few ""joy kills"" of game animals.

I'm guessing in many of these cases, the perps were not raised in the traditional way of respecting guns and learning how to hunt. They were raised in broken families in a town where guns were everywhere and easy to get.

As these instances increase, the newcomers who came for a better life (and who often have wealth to influence with) will start pushing for stricter laws because a large portion of the population is not taking care of itself or its children.

On the other hand, I know a lot of the core population that works in city and county jobs are responsible people who were raised with traditional values and respect for guns.

I hunt and before I hunted I was an avid hiker so public land access has always been a pain in the ass especially in washington. We have plenty of landlocked BLM land but fortunately most landowners are friendly of it.


Personally I believe the state should face some punishment for allowing parcels of land that lockout public land to be sold. I am kind of divided here. While I see the access being extremely important I can also see why a homeowner wouldnt want a hiking trail or better yet a bunch of delinquents walking through my property. I figure the only way to fix this would be having the state buyback certain land (or parts of land) given that the homeowner agrees. 

Obviously none of this applies to me. But I understand that every state has major issues.

Baker positioned his men in the high ground above the camp in a ""natural firing range"" and prepared to attack.

&gt; Although scout Joe Kipp recognized that the camp belonged to Heavy Runner, who was considered peaceful and was not to be attacked per orders from Fort Shaw commander Colonel Philippe Régis de Trobriand. When told that the camp belonged to Heavy Runner, Baker responded “That makes no difference, one band or another of them; they are all Piegans [Blackfeet] and we will attack them.”

&gt; The noise alerted the Piegan camp and Chief Heavy Runner. Heavy Runner ran toward the soldiers, ""shouting and waving a piece of paper - a safe conduct from the Indian Bureau."" He was immediately shot and killed.

&gt; As many of the men of the camp were out hunting, the U.S. Army raid was a massacre of mostly women, children, and elderly men, many of whom were found to be suffering from smallpox. Some survived by hiding in the freezing waters of the Marias River. Learning of the raid, Mountain Chief's band escaped over the border into Canada. Piegan oral history recounts that the U.S. Army threw every dead Native American man into a fire. A rough count by Baker's men showed 173 dead, 54 of which were women and children, along with an additional 140 women and children captured. Only one cavalryman, Private McKay, was killed, and another soldier was injured after falling off his horse and breaking his leg.

Also, unless the brewery took on new debt over the past 18 months (which it may well have), [this case](https://casetext.com/case/konopatzke-v-and) that dealt with the divorce of the current owner seems to suggest that the brewery has $150,000 debt as of 2018 in the form of a business development loan.  The owner's ex husband seems to have taken on the rest of the brewery's debts.  

Assuming that debt still exists and teh brewery hasn't taken on more debt (which it may have), we're looking at a debt plus list cost to a purchaser of $1.1 million.  Now that's certainly not chump change, considering the far less well known Glacier Brewing in Polson sold for about $600,000 last year, I don't think the price to buy the brewery (and acquire the aforementioned debt) is outrageous, especially considering the brand is iconic and the company has significant distribution.

If what u/wadebosshogg stated about the last 18 months of equipment purchases, that would put that balance sheet at losses that are unrecoverable.  

The only item to buy is the equipment at bankruptcy or liquidation sale.  Drop the name, the brand, using balance sheet review, apparently the brand was not that strong.  So buying the brand is a loss especially with the bankruptcy ghost to follow it.  Vendor and suppler would be shy to extend any type of credit for a new owner.

So this was a Texas owned outfit.  $722,562 gross profit and net income of $104,118.  14% net income for that type of output of capital?  No money sense there.  What to distribute for shares and reinvestment?  Zilch really.  

If the new buyer, if there would be one, bought just the machinery and equipment (again not knowing true equipment) using August 2016 report, and depreciating the equipment and machinery, the price should be around $325,000.  Again, not knowing actual components and value or contents of the proposed buy.

So if there is a brewer out there that would be interested and then others, up to 6, willing to gamble, I would take a 1/6 share of the buy.  Then take 1/6 share of lease or buy for property with the right terms.  The brewer would have to provide a break out of quantities of goods by dollar to produce this dollar.  Example: $10 total material, process cost and energy cost produces $30 dollars of final bottled product. 

If someone could provide that type of info for today's market, something solid to look at, that's how you attract investors.  It's easy to look at the bankruptcy sheets and figure out but apparently that is inaccurate since it created a belly-up.",1579825174,ffdodox

Some of the larger towns will have indoor or outdoor ranges where you can go pay for the amount of time you are there with targets set up and stuff.

Its important to know legally where you can and cannot do this though, so a range might be better unless you are comfortable taking on that responsibility. 

You do need a fishing license, and it will be an out of state one. a google search will tell you how much that will cost.

But this is like the most stereotypical ""moving to Montana"" post I've ever seen.

You're a pair of city slickers from California and Texas who want to move to a part of Montana that looks like the pictures you've seen of Glacier and Yellowstone, but you want somewhere that doesn't get cold. No immediate job prospects, though you're both working on your degrees. You visited Montana one time, and it didn't quite live up to your imagination. 

If I had a dollar for each post I've seen exactly like this one, I could buy the imaginary cabin in Tropical Glacier Park you're dreaming of.

It does get cold in the winter *everywhere* in Montana. Not everybody gets to live in the Bitterroot Valley in a Hallmark Channel cabin, especially not on a teacher's salary.

Now, there are certainly plenty of job opportunities all over the state for someone with K-12 teaching certification, and there are definitely jobs available with Fish Wildlife &amp; Parks. I suggest you start looking at job opportunities, and do some proper research on the communities that have job openings. Look at the housing markets, look at the year-round weather, look at Google Maps and street view to get an idea of what these towns actually look like.

1485,1485,mountainbonobo,"This is so sad and disturbing. I currently live in Bozeman, but moved here from Missoula. In Missoula, we obviously heard/read more about stories such as this occurring on the Flathead and Blackfeet reservations. Now I am exposed to more stories involving the Crow reservation (and surrounding areas), and in my naivety, I did not know things could be worse than they were around Missoula.

I have yet to see anything that really drills down on who exactly is kidnapping/killing these girls, and why. The most I gather from when it is written about, to speaking with people somewhat knowledgeable about the situation, it is: 

* young(ish) adult Native American men 
* either using or trafficking drugs (primarily meth but also heroin)
* the girls are taken to be either sexually assaulted and/or trafficked to other drug users for money to continue the cycle of drug use and trafficking, and then killed 
* very few and in many cases zero arrests are made in these cases!

I also see an absurdly complex layering of problems contributing to this crisis, some of them highlighted in this article:

* extreme poverty on the reservations
* crippling substance abuse on the reservations (meth, heroin, and alcohol)
* poor (if any) law enforcement response on the reservation. I've read some stories recalling that tribal members are often not even calling the police anymore, due to a lack of a response
* some level of informal corruption among tribal law enforcement, i.e. local officers turning a blind eye to situations they might have information on
* racism and discrimination from neighboring communities
* problematic dichotomy of the reservations wanting to govern and police themselves, creating 'space' between them and surrounding resources, but then asking for help. these are difficult waters to navigate.

Wtf is even a possible solution here? I don't work in law enforcement, but I would love to be a part of a solution if possible for our fellow Montanans, even if that just meant supporting the right kind of legislation for this issue. 

Is anyone familiar with a similar dilemma anywhere else in the country with so severe a problem that carries such a complex set of contributing issues?",1579967550,ffi8436

1491,1491,PerplexingEnigma,"Grew up half an hour from a reservation and had many Native friends who told me stories of the problems from family to government level. I'm not sure there is anything similar to the problems on the reservation anywhere in America. Probably very poor African American communities is closest.

The only solution is for young Natives to demand change. Vote out corrupt elders, run off corrupt cops, and banish abusers in the family or get them treatment. I thought with all the news last year of this endemic problem of missing Native women, the circle had been broken and enough people fed up with the way it is they would mobilize and demand change. However, I'm afraid the momentum is fading and apathy setting in again. 

I don't think external intervention solves the issue. Decades of the obvious abuse by non-natives has lost any goodwill or trust. There has to be buy in from the community.

Another major problem is many of the best and brightest Native students leave because of the problems. I went to high school with many of these kids, who went on to college and got degrees. Some express desire to come back and help, but I don't blame when pretty much all of them don't come back. The problems are huge and they just want to live their lives. I know one guy, has a degree in computer engineering, and all he said was if he went back he would build a safe space for kids who had been abused. Not build a school to teach programming, a space to stop abuse. If it's going to break people like him have to come back and maybe if there's enough activism to change something a few will return and build momentum towards change.",1579972519,ffifc6a

That's incredible country, and some of the most beautiful in the lower 48 outside of a National Park. It's hard for me to recommend trails, as I certainly have not been on even close to all of them. The Chinese Wall is popular when it comes to the Bob, but it's really worth your time to do a bit of reading on hike options in both wilderness areas.

The lakes and rivers in both areas will have good fishing. For more 'mainstream' options, both for floating or wading, the Blackfoot and Sun rivers are great. Not sure where you plan on entering from; if you come from the NW, the Flathead is also great. Lake fishing in the Swan Valley is also excellent.

In any of this country, **you must bring bear spray, and camp with extreme bear-proof caution.** This is literally the highest density Grizzly Bear population in the lower 48, and that early in the year, they will still be very actively feeding after their hibernation. **Grizzly Bear safety and awareness in those wilderness areas is no joke.** I'd bet money you will see at least one.

Speaking of seasonality, early June will be tough when it comes to accessing high country. You'll want to call local Forest Service offices to get an idea on snow pack and trail accessibility.

That time of year can be a little rough. The weather can be unpredictable. We woke up to 6"" of fresh snow one morning in early June. The creeks and rivers are also really high and can be quite dangerous.

I'd recommend July but if you have a rigid timeline, I'd recommend Big Salmon Lake as it's probably my favorite place and it's at a relatively low elevation. Go in at Meadow Creek and head South along the river for about 12 miles. You'll come to a big wooden pack bridge at Black Bear. From there you'll want to take the West side trail to head South another 8 or 10 miles. This route is mostly flat hiking, no passes to get over. And if you are too tired to continue on from Black Bear, just stay there! Black Bear is awesome, too!

When you set up camp, be damn sure to be far away from any dead trees. In old forest fire areas, the trees are a huge hazard. I was near Big Salmon Lake in a wind storm once. You could see the gusts coming at you down the hillside by the dead trees falling over in waves of dozens or even hundreds at a time. Definitely in my top ten list of scariest/most exciting times of my life. I had more than one close call out there with falling trees and a good friend of mine was killed by one a year or two later.

Also as some others have warned, watch out for bears. You will probably see some, so know what to do.

1627,1627,runningoutofwords,"OK, I'm going to nit-pick the shit out of this because there is just so much wrong.

&gt; Bozeman just built an insanely humongous jail in 2010

No, Gallatin County did. Small distinction, you might think, but actually an important one. The City is about to build their own Justice Center on Rouse.

Now ask why did Gallatin County build the new Detention Center? Because the old one was a hazard to both the health and safety of the inmates. It was a poorly built and outdated disaster, and you would have screamed human rights abuse had you spent 5 minutes in there. It was nasty.

Yes, Gallatin County overbuilt the capacity of the Detention Center. Obviously they would, it'd be ridiculous not to have. It took them a decade of trying to finally get the residents to pony up the money to build a new jail in the first place, if they built if just for the immediate needs of 2010 Gallatin County, it'd be overcrowded and outdated already. They had to overbuild.

And rather sit on empty capacity for the next 15 years, they charge other counties to take their detainees to recoup some of the expense of building the thing. What would you have them do? Preside over a half-empty Detention Center? You know that would have been your talking point had that been the case.

&gt; they doubled their police force in 2013

This is simply not true. No further discussion needed.

&gt; force people to linger in jail for months for outrageously petty charges, enforce unbelievably high bails, disproportionately hefty sentences

A little bit but with honest intentions.

&gt; English not your first language?

Quite the opposite. I tend to take some pride in using clear and exacting language.

I tend to feel that thoughts that must be expressed in unclear, poetic language are possibly not well thought out in the first place.

Montana, Arizona and Kentucky do not call anybody. This language is needlessly poetic and assumes agency where none exists.

People may feel attraction to those places, but in constructing your language in such a way as to displace the active role to the recipient of the affection, it seems to be a way of deflecting agency away from yourself. Like there's something shameful about wanting to move to Montana and you don't want to take the blame for it.

Plus ""MT calls"" is just so non-specific that it's entirely up to the reader to interpret what this means.

While I never flat-out discourage anyone from moving to Montana (as many here will), I strongly discourage romanticizing Montana. It is a place of staggering beauty, true. And poetry can certainly have its place in describing that. But it is also a place of stark and grim realities. It can be a hard place to live; there are reasons why Montana consistently leads the nation in per capita suicides. Consistently. Meaning that's not going to change any time soon.

What I'm trying to get at is to separate the harm that the drug (if ingested, or not, in the case of the children) might do versus the harm surrounding prohibition. I submit that the greater harm for children are the consequences of prohibition, including not having a father present. If marijuana were completely legal, this guy probably wouldn't have been growing large quantities at home, versus renting a warehouse.

Tributaries, like the White River, Youngs Crk, etc, will be upwards of 100yds wide, 6’ deep at times leading to 4th of July. So crocs or flip flops wont cut it, you need something like Tivas, Chacos, etc that you can tighten down and I preferred a closed toes.

Source: also did trails there &amp; still work for the USFS

Other advice: bears are not really an issue, as the Bob’s terrain is really broad and sweeping (besides the reefs) so bears dont feel cornered and usually just run away. Theres only been one bear attack in the Bob in the past 40yrs, it was in 2012, and it was a yearling black bear. Firearms arent necessary unless you have stock. Id roll with bear mace and a .22 survival rifle for small game personally. Fishing wont be good in June.

A silky/folding saw and small axe will be useful for making nice, big fires. If you have fire, the Bob is yours.

It can def snow in June.

Hiking gaiters and trekking poles may be of use.

River crossings are scary (a major reason I sought work elsewhere actually). Some static climbing rope can be a good insurance policy there and can double as a bear hang rope. Many smaller river crossings will have a log across them within 100’ of the main ford.

Its horse country, always be prepared to run into horse packers.

There are a lot of cabins/people/campsites along the main river corridor. Help can be found easily, I wouldnt worry about packing a SPOT. Assume there are large outfitter camps at any major river junction, most will be unoccupied in June.

Id recommend 7 days, as the interior of the Bob basically takes 1 day to access (on foot) plus another to exit &amp; thats where all the good shit is.

If you’re going to be in South central MT, pretty much any trail in the Custer National Forest is pretty neat during the winter.

I don’t know how experienced you are with winter hiking, so obligatory:
-	Notify the forest service what your hiking plans are
-	Carry flare gun, radio, ski poles, spare batteries and fuel for everything, spare dry clothing, spare food, spare everything really
-	Personal Locator Beacon if you can afford one or rent one

The schools, colleges, civic institutions are suffering. People will point to mismanagement by tribes, which certainly occurs just like w mainstream communities, but our indigenous people have been stripped of 99% of their resources and when the govt gives them a fine they’re derided as being nothing but leeches.

In America you get two views of IP — Dances with Wolves or sneaky redskins.

You grow up in Indian Country and somehow miss the racism, that is as bad as anything in 1950’s Birmingham, Alabama, then you’re not paying attention.

Imagine, as recently as the 1950’s the govt was kidnapping Indian children and putting them into Christian schools where the goal was to grind down their Native souls and create an ‘assimilated’ citizen. Bearings were common, and a family could easily be jailed for protesting too much.

The BIA — Bureau of Indian Affairs — still rips off Native communities to the tune of $100’s millions a year.

Yellowtail Dam &amp; Powerplant are 100% on Indian land, but every executive &amp; most managers are old white men. The plant sends multi millions of wholesale electricity to prop up mainstream communities and the tribes get squat. They barely get jobs.

I’ve already lost 99% of people because owning genocide is not simple, but the results are predictable. We could talk aborigines or Maori’s - same story.

As a simple example, “Custer Battlefield” sits on the Crow Reservation. White Montanans cries foul when the state finally moved to rename it “Little Bigjorn.”

1919,1919,amusso18,"I guess here's a few questions: 

1) Is anyone, as far as you know, buying the recipes to brew them at other breweries?  Alternatively, how likely do you think it is someone else will buy the brewery and continue operating it, either at the current location or a new one?

2) Do you think the switch from bottles to cans was a factor in the closure?  In other words, was it too expensive and not enough cost savings?  

3) When you say ""bad management"", does that mean they didn't understand the business, they were looking to cut costs at the expense of the product, etc?  No need to name names or throw anyone under the bus, I'm just curious.

4) What do you think was the best beer brewed at GNBC while you were there?",1580514341,fg4z22g
1920,1920,McCrushinator,"1. As far as I know, no recipes are being sold. All the beer recipes are still with the company (GNBC). If someone else buys the brand, they can either take it and run anywhere, or (I believe) they have the option to rent from the new owner. How likely that's to happen? I would say not very likely.  I'll explain.

Great Northern, located downtown Whitefish Montana, is a 3 story building constructed in 1993/94. It's on a corner lot, with roads on the north and east side, and a grocery store (Marcus Foods) and a Bar (Craggy Range) on the other two sides. It is essentially as big as it's going to be, because buying those properties to expand was far too expensive. 

So growing our footprint as a business was not an option. We had kind of 'peaked', or grown as much as possible. No room to expand, we just had to make the 'small space work'. You can't grow your sales and production by 30% every year if your footprint can't get any bigger.

It also required us to maintain a separate warehouse to store dry goods and finished product. It was a mile away and was an additional cost and time sink. Needed to be heated in the winter, shoveled, maintained, and secured. Not to mention we had an old (82) Ford flatbed truck that we had to drive through downtown to get there. Not ideal.

2. The switch from bottles to cans was a good choice. It's not 1994 anymore, we needed to upgrade our equipment for many reasons. The bottling line that was there when I came on in 2017 was absolutely falling apart and in disrepair.

It was a 100 percent hands on operation. The bottles had to be loaded by hand, the filler and crowner watched like a hawk, the labeler constantly adjusted, the six packs opened by hand, the bottles loaded into them, and then put into a case. 

This required LOTS of time and effort for what we could deliver. 

The change to cans was not only a 'get with the times' move, but a move that was needed to upgrade the equipment. The bottling line that was owned had run it's life cycle, it had no more to give, and fixing the problems to keep it in 'top shape' would've not been worth the investment. Some parts were so old and outdated, they weren't even produced anymore. 

Cans also reduced our cost in production and shipping, and allowed us to raise our quality level.  The cost of upgrading was worth it because we could produce more in the same space while doing it better. I'm sure some of that investment debt still remains.

3. By 'bad management', I mean that I feel like the 'high ups' didn't understand our problems and limitations. Yes, every company wants to grow by 30% every year, but like I said above, if your business footprint can't grow, how can your business? 

The Brewers and the production guys worked their asses off, as anyone who has worked in a brewery knows. The sales team, a one woman force, was the best and the brightest. Her dedication and hard work was essential in our growth. 

Also, let's not forget about the bankruptcy that the company went through somewhere around 2015. It's hard to crawl out of that hole. It's hard to run a business with literally no money. 

4. MAN-BUN. Dark, roasty, damn delicious.

So will someone drop a million bucks to get into this? I'd say no, but I'm just a dude who likes Star Wars and gardening and drums...

2037,2037,uglycsnva,"I know there are a few Democrats left in this state that aren't full blown commies yet, so as a reminder to them of the dangers of socialists in Montana, here we go. 

In the early 1900's, out of state communist agitators formed a socialist collectives and bullied Union members to join their group. If they did not, they were threatened and beat. This all came to a head on Miners Union Day in 1914 (an event still celebrated today for the formation of unions in Butte.) When these out of state communist party agitators assaulted union members, set fire and robbed the union hall, and dynamited union leaderships homes. 

10 days later the national union President arrived in Butte to speak with people and see what's up. 200 people showed up at the Butte Union hall. Everything was going fine until one agitator tried to enter and commit a mass shooting. He was stopped. And then the agitator surrounded the building, dynamited it, and shot at anyone attempting to leave the burning and crumbling building. Thankfully, the Union members were able to escape. The National Union President went to Helena the next morning, and got the Governor (Democrat Sam Stewart) to send the guard to protect Union members, and to declare martial law. Three Months later, the courts would remove the actual Socialist Party Mayor of Butte, and he crony Sheriff, for failing to protect the citizens of Butte. 

The irony of this, is all the striff between the socialists and the Union, came because the socialist didn't want a profit sharing agreement offered in 1909. The profit sharing was eventually implemented, and is still in effect with the current Butte mine operator MRI. And, has people from the entire area seeking jobs at the mine, to the point where there is a waiting list to get a job there.

So, Democrats. Remember that these socialist agitators are not your friends. You are not extreme enough for them. And, if you don't do what they want, as they've shown in the past, will kidnap you, try to mass murder you, set your meetings on fire, surround you, shoot at you, try to blow you up, etc... All for not being so extreme. These groups still have members that think this way in Montana. There still are IWW larpers that worship these people. Including the ""Democrat"" Amelia Marquez that is allowed to speak in this article. They list some of the most influential on their lives as the leaders that attacked actual Union members, for not being as far left as them. 

As a reminder for when you vote in your primaries in June. These people billing themselves as the DSA, or having support of the IWW, or calling themselves socialists, are not a threat to the rich they want you to hate. Are not a threat of the Republicans they fear monger about. Because, as shown in history, they are a threat directly against Democrats, Union members, basically people they think should be on their side, and will try to convert you or kill you if you aren't as extreme as them.",1580727891,fgf70r5

Sure, I wouldn't have a leg to stand on here if Bernie had disavowed his staffers beliefs and fired them. But he didn't. He's refused to even comment. All his campaign has done about it is send a letter around to campaign offices telling them not to say anything that could look bad.

Having lived all over the US, Dillon was a very intentional choice to move back to a quieter, more rural way of life. We love it, but we (1) moved here with jobs already lined up, (2) aren't attracted to living in the hustle and bustle (we turned down jobs in Bozeman for that reason), and (3) spend every moment we can out enjoying nature (headed out this morning to snowshoe up in the Pioneers! Having lived in SE Wyoming, the sheer number of ranges accessible from town without too many other people clogging trailheads is still jawdropping!).

Honestly, we both sacrificed some career prestige (and income) moving here, but we had long ago decided that quality of life matters *much* more to us. Dillon has a wonderful small town vibe (actually, more so like a town smaller than it is, so it has the benefit of slightly more resources with an intimate culture). It lacks big box stores, but has a surprising variety of restaurants. The housing market is a bit inflated (I guess we're used to that effect from universities, though). Oddly, the town swallows the student population - they're surprisingly not evident off campus.

The first shock your probably going to experience is the friendliness. On the east coast, in the cities at least, it's keep your head down, don't help anyone else, take care of number one. At home it's help your neighbor, talk to the people in the grocery line, pull over for the guy on the side of the road to make sure they're ok, support the local high school team even when they suck. It's a community, the larger cities might have that on a smaller level in the suburbs but I doubt it's even close to what you'll experience in Culbertson.

Life is so much slower at home, I honestly miss that the most. When I call home to talk to my family, nothing has changed, and I miss that more then anything. I live in Phoenix AZ and everythings changing but I'd give anything for that small town, same people everyday feeling again.

It does have its issues though. Alcohol and drugs are a problem as people get bored and there's nothing else to do. Income is low. People know everything about each other and try to get into your personal business some times. You'll learn who to avoid and who you can trust pretty quickly.

Some thoughts:

* If you're coming from a smaller community, then there shouldn't be too much adjustment to Billings. We, on the other hand, came from a medium/big city, and the adjustments have been difficult.
* We live on the west side of town, and like the area. It's relatively quiet and easy access to most things. Traffic is never really an issue, so everything is pretty easy access. Can just be slow because we never get on the highway for day to day trips.
* May be good or bad depending on your views, but Billings is the whitest major city in the U.S. The lack of diversity is a con for us. May not be for others.
* Shopping is rather limited, unless you're looking for outdoor gear. There is Scheels, Cabellas, and soon will be an REI, so outdoor clothing is covered. Everything else is rather limited for physical stores so there will be a lot of online shopping. For comparison, there is no Gap, Banana Republic, Express, Macy's, etc here; common mall stores that have existed everywhere else we have lived. Oh, and no sales tax here is pretty nice.
* Winter driving is a bit different here than in the midwest and eastern states. They don't use salt, so icy roads are common. But with a well-maintained car and some practice, it's easy to get used to. Longer road trips need to be limited or have back-up plans, since they do close highways due to weather.",1581274323,fh41pdr

*You have never experienced a winter like that in NE Montana.*

Trust me, this isn't a dick-measuring contest. Yes, you've experienced cold, and yes Philly weather is (I imagine) quite damp which makes the cold all the more penetrating and miserable. I get it.

But you have never experienced anything like a NE Montana Winter. We Montanans think the weather in NE MT is brutal, and I personally love winter weather.

It's not just the cold, the wind is going to leave you feeling physically battered. Outside of some cottonwoods on the River, there are *no* trees on the Hiline. Nothing to break the wind for 100's of miles. That wind is what really makes the winter hard.

I say this not to scare you off, quite the contrary. NE MT needs hard working productive people. And lots of people live there quite happily. I just want to suggest you prepare now.

Because your shopping options will be limited when you get there, you're going to want to invest in several sets of **thermal underwear**. Tops and bottoms. Get enough that you can just wear them every day. Three or four pairs. Get mostly thin ones but one pair that's like really cold-rated. You'll know what days you need that pair.

On top of that, of course, you'll want to add additional layers, but on top you'll want something that can block the wind.

And if you're going to be working outside; well, good warm boots and gloves will also be a must.

The conditions that make tornadoes a common occurrence in the Mississippi Valley (tornado alley) just don't apply here. It's not a matter of ""north"" so much, as too far west of the warm/wet airflows coming up from the Gulf of Mexico that mixes with the Rocky Mountain cold fronts.

Sounds like you're getting ready. Just remember that long underwear is your friend, and maybe get a good wind/water shell for a top layer. The winds in Culbertson won't be a bad as, say, Shelby or Conrad. They're getting the winds coming down right off the Rocky Mountain Front. The winds in NE MT are just more constant.

This is meant to reduce the influence of monetary and industrial interests in politics. Perhaps more of a symbolic measure today in an era of fast transit and instant communication.

So it is intended with the upper house of Congress. The Senate is established to ensure that State Governments are represented equally, rather than by population. So that the will of the few powerful State Governments don't ride rough-shod over the interests of the less powerful.

I agree that apportionment of representatives to the lower house has gotten well out of balance. This is largely because they are limited to 435 voting members by the Apportionment Act of 1911. That could easily be overwritten, however, by passing a new Apportionment Act that increases the number of representatives.

When comparing to Rhode Island, even Wyoming is under represented in the house. 

The average size of an electoral district is 710k people. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island and Hawaii, are the only states that fall below that average size. The largest house district is Montana, followed by Delaware, SD, ND, and Alaska. 

Out of the 10 Representatives representing a district of less than average, there is only one Republican. In the Electoral College, out of all these states with less than average Representation, meaning their population gets more of a say, including DC, they combine 41 electoral votes. Of those 41 electoral votes, 24 of those votes went towards the Democrat Candidate, while 17 towards a Republican. If you're talking the Senate, out of those 11 states, there are 10 Republicans, 11 Democrats, and 1 Independent that caucuses with the Democrats. 

In the end, Democrats benefit more than Republicans do in every way in every way in our current system.

2557,2557,CUBuffs1992,"It’s unfortunate to see what has happened at UM because it’s a good school. Some of the issues have been due to poor leadership and other issues have been due to circumstance. 

Krakauer’s book Missoula sucks because it could have been any school and college town in the country. Hundreds of universities and colleges have sexual assault issues. MSU was included on the list of schools being investigated by the Feds. I went to the CU Boulder and we were too. But Krakauer lives in Boulder, CO and there was no way he would have portrayed his hometown like he did Missoula. 

I do think there are two things that UM could do to help themselves out with gaining students back. The engineering school at MT Tech should honestly be moved to Missoula. Montana doesn’t have the population to support 4 year colleges in every decent sized town. Secondly, UM needs a four year nursing program. I think if UM could do those things, it would help them move into the 21st century. Kids just are not getting degrees in humanities, social sciences and the liberal arts anymore.

 How can the damage from the last 30 years of gerrymandering be undone? If I understand it correctly, the Republican party has been unabashedly stealing congressional seats, (as well as two presidential elections) from the voting will of the people. 

This was accomplish back in the 90's when the Republican Party worked to control down ticket races and win Governor seats at the state government level. Then gerrymandering or redrawing the lines and redistricting to pack as many democrats into one or two districts. That is how and why America got George W Bush &amp; Donald Trump when BOTH lost the popular vote.

I would also strongly disagree with the other post about skipping Snowbowl. Sure, the double fall line thing is true on a lot of runs and can result in some uneven wear on your legs, but Snowbowl has some really great expert terrain in terms of steeps, bumps and trees. Try to link up with someone on the lift and have them show you the tree chute, windows, meadows, and grandpas - all unmarked steep and bumpy tree runs. Definitely go down west bowl as well. Lost Trail does consistently have better snow, but Snowbowl is more of a fun challenging day imo. When they gettins good at Snowbowl, it is hard to beat. It will likely challenge you much more than LT and it will provide you with a larger variety of terrain. 3 days at LT might be a little much - you'll be itching for a scenery change.

[Here is an annotated map of Snowbowl, though its a little old and missing some good stuff.](https://i.imgur.com/c6QNHqk.gif)

Also, Snowbowl has awesome pizza and bloodies. If you are heading up Saturday, I'd aim to get there by 9am to avoid having to park down the road.

Personally, my favorite brewery with food in Missoula is Bayern - they have authentic German style beer and food. If you like NEIPAs, I'd recommend Imagine Nation, but the Shady from Kettlehouse is great as well (plus Kettlehouse has a variety of other solid beer styles). If you're looking for great beer, I'd skip Big Sky and Highlander in favor of Bayern, IN, Kettlehouse, Draught Works or Conflux. Maybe Gild if arcade games are your thing.

But while you’re there, take some time to explore! Did you know Butte is the home to one of the largest superfund sites in America, the Berkeley Pit? Or the grave of Evel Knievel?

Hell, if you get the itch for adventure, head down to the rehabbed ghost town of Virginia City. It’ll be quiet in March, but it’s beautiful country. Or make the short drive to Helena for dinner - the landscape between Helena &amp; Butte is unparalleled.

Oh, don’t forget Anaconda! It’s home of the largest freestanding masonry structure in Montana (maybe the country? I hear different versions of the story every day) and has a few great dive bars. The locals might need a little warming up, but when they get going, they’re some of the friendliest in the West.",1581694219,fhl1p8y

For skiing you have 3 fairly close and great options between Showdown, Teton Pass, and Great Divide. White Sulphur and Helena both have hot springs which can make for a great combo day of skiing/hot springs. If you’re into (or want to try) snowshoeing or XC skiing check out BigHorn sports downtown and they can hook you up with a rental and good trails or put you in contact with a class. 

Mighty Mo, Black Eagle Brewery, Elevation, and The Front/Montana Pints are all great places to stop off for a drink and some more refined night scene compared to your typical bar. 

There is a new axe throwing place, virtual reality arcade, Highwood creek outfitters has an indoor shooting range, pizzazz hosts some really fun and great cooking classes, and an escape room. 

The peak is a pretty solid fitness club with 2 locations now. There is also a sweet Little Rock climbing gym thats decently priced for drop ins too. 

Summertime is amazing! GF is within day trip length to Glacier, hiking/biking on the RM Front, Highwoods, and both little and big belts. More than enough to keep you busy for years.

2829,2829,amusso18,"So I made a post about this a while back that you can reference [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/es0bpz/great_northern_brewing_company_a_whitefish_and/).  There is some good info from a lot of people in there about what's happening.  

Anyways, here's a quick rundown.  A few years back, GNBC went through bankruptcy.  A few years after that, the current owner got the brewery in a divorce settlement.  It appears that last year, the owner decided they no longer wanted to operate the brewery.  They sold the GNBC building, as well as an adjacent building, to a developer.  The brewery itself was not included in the sale.  Apparently, employees there knew something was up in late 2019, and rumors started to appear that the brewery might close.  

In January 2020, this became public.  The brewery itself is actually listed for sale for about $950,000 and that includes everything except the building.  As far as I know, there are no prospective buyers for the brewery itself.  Three days from now GNBC is slated to close down.  

The plan seems to be that the developer wants to redo the GNBC guilding as well as the adjacent building.  The adjacent building is legit ugly and needs to be redone, but an iconic grocery store (Markus Foods) will probably be forced to close down.  The renovations are supposed to happen in 2021.  Anyways, the developer has stated they want to attract a brewery/pub business to the redeveloped building when the renovations are done in roughly 2022.  

Now, take this with a *HUGE* grain of salt, but a friend of mine says he's got a friend in Great Falls who has told him that Jeremiah Johnson is tentatively agreeing to be that brewery/pub when the renovations are completed.  This is literally an ""I know a guy who knows a guy"" thing, so again, just rumor.  

There is fading hope that someone might buy and relocate the business, even if they just buy the brand and recipes and start from scratch in a new location.  It's still possible, but no one wants to buy and relocate the equipment, especially after having to shell out close to a million dollars just to buy it all.  

And this is my own opinion, but it's kind of absurd to me that you'd demolish or heavily renovate an iconic building in Whitefish, forcing a brewery and pub out of business just so you could then put up a building with the intention of attracting a brewery and pub.  No one is happy with this in the area.  GNBC is one of those iconic businesses that you can't just replicate.  And the building is gorgeous.  It really is one of those buildings that looks like it belongs in a small mountain town.  It's a real shame that it will probably be demolished (in part or in whole) and replaced by an ugly brock building that looks vaguely ""western"".  Hopefully the brewery can be saved somehow, but it looks like GNBC is riding off into the sunset this weekend.  RIP GNBC.",1581786276,fhpc6z8

Kinda like the first two respondents telling me to leave the state.

That’s an oft-used tactic in Montana politics. There’s a small, obnoxious minority in Montana who responds to any contrary opinion w the equivalent of: “Go back to California, hippie!”

So it can be helpful to establish I’m a multigenerational Montanan who grew up ranching, had a graduating class of 8, served in the state National Guard, active Army, worked as a Wildland firefighter &amp; wilderness ranger, in addition to having owned my first .22 at 8 yo, and my first hunting rifle at 13 yo, after completing Hunter’s Safety.

I do NOT think those characteristics are in any way required to have a voice in Montana politics.

But it’s used as a weapon. Residents who weren’t born here can be hesitant to engage in public forums precisely because of these sorts of attacks.

I’ve had folks express gratitude before, as it helps provide cover when a native is willing to stand up &amp; express contrary opinions. 

So, there’s sometimes value in making the wider group aware of my roots just to defuse the nonsense.

Myself, and plenty of other “real Montanans” aren’t all a bunch of blind neoliberals or neoconservatives.

Ha ha!! Haven’t that one — funny!

I’ve lived in a bunch of different states &amp; a few nations. Frankly, they all leave a lot to be desired.

The US system is uniquely corrupted among developed nations due to the legalized bribery that saturates our country &amp; has only gotten worse.

Northern California had some neat areas that seemed better managed, but California as a whole is pretty tough to compare with Montana. 

California is the fourth largest GDP is the *world* — Montana is 133rd. They have almost 40 million people, mostly congested into the hell-on-earth of modern LA county, whereas we have less than a million  the fourth biggest state with 40% public land our citizens can enjoy.

That said — I didn’t say anything about California, period.

I voiced my concern as someone who lives here, raised children &amp; grandchildren — and has paid &amp; pays a buttload of property taxes — about the use of the public’s money.

And as happens too often in Montana — I was told if I don’t it I should leave my home.

Voicing an opinion that’s different than yours doesn’t mean I’m bitter or that I should be exiled from my home. 

It means I’ve seen our common lands getting neglected on an almost criminal level. Anyone who has lived &amp; recreated in Montana for 20, 30 or 40 years would be hard-pressed to deny or justify the decline in land stewardship &amp; basic administrative services.

I realize it’s a bit snarky to have tossed out the comment on this post, but as an independent citizen, I admit seeing the almost blank check these larger enforcement agencies get disturbs me.

Not talking about rural cops &amp; sheriffs — that’s part of my irritation — we NEED those folks, but they’re scraping for every cent. Same with rural clinics &amp; ambulances — most rely 100% on volunteers! But fed dollars pour in to militarize LE.

Unfortunately such mundane discussions somehow devolve into issues of left/right rather than simply fiscal common sense. My issue is not funding the public commons — it’s when the state starves public services. Montana highways, as an example, are a well-worn joke in our neighboring states.

3026,3026,Epistemogist,"Wolves can be found in a variety of climates and habitats. These habitat variations are sometimes seen in the type of morphology, or physical characteristics, seen in gray wolves living in different geographical areas. These differences sometimes differentiate types, or subspecies, of gray wolves around the world.

However, these different types are so subjective that over the years scientists have disagreed as to whether in North America alone there are 24 such subspecies or only four. Current workers generally accept five, but a recent article lumped those into four. Subspecies of gray wolves in North America include the Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos), northwestern wolf (Canis lupus occidentalis), Great Plains wolf (Canis lupus nubilus), Mexican wolf(Canis lupus baileyi) and the eastern timber wolf (Canis lupus lycaon), which is debated by some as a distinct species, the eastern wolf (Canis lycaon). In reality, any differences among all these proposed types are so minor as to be meaningless except to a few specialists.

Of course it is not historic in scale, but like it or not, we have 350 million people here (but if we're considering Canada as well - which we should when discussing our wildlife at a large scale, that ratio is much better). I think our effort to maintain and conserve our wild spaces and wildlife has been reasonable, effective, and sustainable. We really have done well. Wildlife management is not a world of black and white, rather it is one of pragmatism and compromise. That's not always ideal, but it is reality.

Now, unfortunately, the same cannot be said for most of the rest of the world. That discussion will make me cynical, depressed, and angry.

I agree about the APR and I support their current mission. But again, to make an attempt at optimism, there is also a lot of great habitat and wildlife on surrounding BLM, state, and even private land in that part of the state. Yeah, those lands might not enjoy the same levels of protections and restrictions that APR land might, but it's better than a concrete jungle.",1582086508,fi2qv9p

3176,3176,pitamakan,"Used to work in Glacier, and consumed much alcohol in Freida's over the years, but it's been a while.

For a long time it was the local dive bar, patronized mostly by the seasonal employees up there -- park service and concession workers, river guides, folks like that.  Low-key and cool vibe.  The whole West Glacier complex was sold to a fairly evil corporation a couple years ago, though, and they're trying to pretty the whole place up, much to the disgust of the locals.

Lots of other watering holes in the area, and there's a half-decent grocery store in a town called Hungry Horse, about a dozen miles away.  Columbia Falls has a bigger store, and Kalispell and Whitefish have pretty much everything you need.

Living just a few hundred yards from America's greatest National Park is pretty amazing, though, especially if you're a hiker and outdoorsman.  The backcountry there is some of the best America has to offer.

There's a long backstory with the West Glacier business, but the short version is that it was a small, family-owned operation for over 70 years, pretty well-loved by the community.  Then Pursuit bought the place out and started acting all corporate all of a sudden, giving the place a more circus-like atmosphere and building a big-ass RV park at the edge of town.

Missoula area has a couple dog focused recreation areas (Mt Jumbo/Waterworks Hill and Blue Mountain). Off leash, but they are very high traffic. The Bitterroot valley (south of missoula) have a variety of trails that are less trafficked and are good for dogs. The Seeley/Swan area of the Missions (northeast of Missoula) is great as well. It’s about 1.5 hours south of Glacier and near the Bob Marshall Wilderness, so it has a high density of griz. 

Not too familiar with trails around Bozeman area with the exception of Hyalite recreation area. Very dog friendly - took one of our pups swimming at the reservoir and on a couple hikes, but it’s pretty popular.

Lots of people enjoy tinkering with and driving motorcycles and cars, but there isn't exactly a muscle car ""scene"" here like you might be imagining. However there is a yearly vintage car show in the summer, and a few car related events that happen each fall during Havre Festival Days.

A lot of social activity here centers around the two main breweries, which often host live music, trivia nights, open mic nights, fundraisers, and food trucks. But you aren't obligated to drink much or even at all, and Montana's brewery laws prevent breweries from becoming too drunken and rowdy.

If you're into nerdy pursuits, there's a new board game and Magic The Gathering shop that recently opened up in town which attracts a fairly large, friendly crowd.

Do you have a job lined up that pays reasonably well? The cost of living here is fairly low, a single person can live pretty comfortably here on $40-50,000. I wouldn't recommend coming out here without a job offer, most of the ""come in off the street"" jobs in the area are entry-level service jobs that do not pay well.

Housing can be an issue here sometimes, the rental market is very tight. Start looking for housing early, and call some of the local realtors because not everything will be listed online on Zillow or something.

How's your spoken English and your accent? You aren't likely to face much overt discrimination up here, but there will be *very* few other Korean people. If your accent is strong, some people here might struggle to understand you. You actually might be mistaken for Native American until people start talking to you. 

Havre can be a rewarding place to live if you put yourself out there and get involved in some local social circles. If you can make friends and find activities that you enjoy, you'll be fine.

If you were arrested 100% the correct way and for something you did wrong than good. The cops shouldn't be applauded for literally just doing their jobs the right way. It's what they signed up for. If some crackhead spits in your face that doesn't give you the right to beat the shit out of them or disregard their rights. It sucks, it really really sucks, but that's part of the job. 

3, just because you were treated 100% properly in this one arrest doesn't mean there isn't a problem. That's saying ""Hey this huge thing that is an issue - isn't - because I was once treated well."" 

There are an insane amount of arrests made every day, some are made by good people who are cops. But- good cops stop being good cops if their colleague starts doing things badly and they don't do anything about it.

There are bad apples in every bunch, it doesn’t make the whole batch evil. 

I’ve done quite a bit of work with police in my various jobs and have never seen them do anything but their job. I do know there have been many Rodney King-like incidents and those Officers should never be allowed to do the job in the first place, and when they’re caught doing that stuff, or raping someone, or any of a number of other things that cops arrest criminals for, they should be prosecuted. There’s no excuse for it. 

But I refuse to agree that every cop in the US is a corrupt POS. Often times it’s criminals trying to not go to prison or Hug-A-Thug types that make accusations of police brutality. Sure, like I said, sometimes it’s true. Most of the time it’s not though.

The mere fact that you mentioned junkies, tweekers, you were in the military, and that you hunt (people in this sub are normal anti-gun liberals), you were downvoted, and the resident UM and MSU students from California controlled the conversation. 

As long as you stay out of missoula, you won't have to worry about tweekers, and junkies. Missoula is an extreme leftist city that caters to these people so they can consider themselves diverse and welcoming. Literally anywhere else in the state, you can go weeks without seeing a tent under a bridge. Missoula, and its inhabitants, want to be exactly like portland, they even stole their slogan of ""keep xxxcityxxx weird.""

Honestly, if you stay out of Missoula, you'll find you can find cheap costs of living, especially compared to what you have. Like minded people. A place where you don't have to worry if you don't lock the door and go to the neighbors. And, a hell of a place to live.

The comments and stares that he gets makes me want to smack so many people. He gets comments of ""Why did you move here?"", ""why would you move here?"", ""You wanted to move here?"", ""why the fuck would you leave there?""

Just because someone looks different, talks different, doesn't mean that comments, even those like above are racist. Some people could be genuinely curious. In other cases, these people may have never heard that accent and are wondering. Some people may even hate Montana and how not diverse is it and are wondering why someone would move here. 

Just because someone sees or hears someone that is generally out of place for here, and questions it, comments about it, or has questions about it, doesn't mean they are racist. Sometimes questions out of general curiosity, or just wonder, can be interpreted as racism, as sometimes general questions may seem rude. But, in the end, it may just be a harmless question or quote that without context, can mean many different things. 

I'm a white dude that moved to a tiny town that died over 100 years ago. I always get questions like ""where are you from?"", ""Why would you move here?"", I was even told to ""go back home.""

Just because someone looks different and people see that, comment on it, or even stares, that doesn't make them racist. 

To be honest, you seem a little racist yourself. When you say that diversity is appreciated, you're only looking at the color of a persons skin. Meaning that the color of a groups skin is how it's judged. That's pretty fucking racist. It's should matter if everyone was black, white, or 6 out of the 6 people in a group were every shade of primary color. Judging people, or groups of people, on what color their skin is, or what color the collective group is, is exactly what racism is. By saying that other colors are appreciated more than just one color, is literally what racism is. 

Though, you're from Chicago, lives in Missoula, and loves Portland. That makes you 100% a Democrat. Part of a group that was founded to keep slavery, and since them has judged people only by their skin color, no matter if it's one color, or many, that's all Democrats have done. So, its not surprising to me that someone from Missoula, would think that someone looking at someone, or making comments about people different than them is racist, when they talk about how the color of peoples skin makes a group better or not.

Hyalite canyon in Bozeman has a bunch of easy to moderate hikes, I recommend Mt. Blackmore. While in Bozoville get a Pickle Barrel sandwich I suggest a Ken's Special.  The Museum of the Rockies is an awesome experience. Drive south along the Gallatin river to Big Sky and check out Lone Mountain.  There are a bunch of great hikes off this stretch of highway.  I recommend Spanish Lakes trail.  The drive to the trail head goes over Ted Turner's Flying D Ranch and is super scenic.  Castle Rock or Lava Lake trails are easy and fun.  Drive west to the Willow Creek cafe for good food and another scenic drive. From there hit up Lewis and Clark Caverns.  Keep west to Butte and see the pit, take a guided tour of the uptown historic district and learn about the Sullivan brothers.  Take a short drive south and hike the Highland's Peak.  Glacier NP is few hours north west.  Bug spray is key, bear spear is essential, a high quality camera is most needed.",1583665024,fjxaogh

You could hike the Spanish Lakes trail but in early May expect a lot of snow.  Lava Lake or Castle Rock trails might be more accessible.  You could make a slight detour to Big Sky and see Lone Mountain.,1583666660,fjxbt3f

They also tend to hang around wet areas and muddy places like lakes, rivers, and the eastern plains, but if we get a dry summer, that will help. Encouraging birds and wasps to your yard can also keep the population down. We had yellow jacket nests in our tree two years in a row and had like one mosquito all summer and no caterpillars eating our apricots. 

Since we have a shorter growing season, we’ll have less pollen then MS, but you will likely be allergic to what we have until your body gets used to our pollen. Eating local honey (of which there is plenty) can help a lot! The University of Montana also has a pollen station and they keep count of what’s blooming when, so you can at least keep track. You can find them here:


https://health.umt.edu/publichealth/faculty/facuty-research/Pollen%20Report/default.php

The big pollinators here are pine, juniper, grass, and ragweed, and they bloom roughly in that order late April - Sept. 

I think one big thing you’ll need to get used to is how much drier it is here than in Mississippi. The Whitefish area and NW Montana is wetter than the rest of the state, but even so, it’s waaaaaaay drier than anywhere in the South. Moisturize, and you’ll get used to it.

Id rather see the government mandate visitor suspensions to nursing homes or long term care facilities( where the most vulnerable to die are). So if anyone who has it doesnt come in contact with those that are the weakest.  

The only group of people that are most vulnerable to the deadly side effects are those over 70. People younger than that that are exposed to the virus DONT DIE.  Essentially if the flu would kill you this will.  But if the flu would just make you feel like hell for a week and be good with fluids then COVID-19 wont kill you. Id sight the research but its so painfully easy to google this and find reputable sources I'll leave that up to you if you even care to be educated. 

As far as not having a vaccine, they have a vaccine for the flu...but people dont even get it most of the time. So if there was a vaccine id be willing to bet 70%+ of people wouldnt even get the shot.

2 things I'd take with a grain of salt here:

1. This is a very limited study. 12 is an extremely small sample size for a scientific study.
2. Nothing in this article says anything about how sick these particular individuals were, beyond the fact that they were clearly sick enough to be hospitalized and have lung scans done multiple times. 

I'm not saying we shouldn't be careful and that there isn't the potential for long-term lung damage, just that a broader study of recovered people who have experienced the full spectrum of the illness (mild to severe) should probably be carried out.

Even if you're not at risk, you can spread it to people that are. So it's a problem. Maybe not for you, but for others. 

I didn't even mention the problem of huge surges of patients into hospitals that ends up filling all of the beds, consuming supplies, and completely overwhelming our healthcare system. But that won't be a big deal, right?

What happened to the formerly universal sense of social responsibility that Americans have shared in the past? 

I wonder if in this situation it seems to be lost because a pandemic uniquely illustrates the need for a centralized, coordinated response that only the government can provide. Which is completely antithetical to the core principles of right wing politics in America.

4862,4862,micro_cam,"""The introduction of horses was soon followed by devastating epidemics of non-native diseases, against which tribal people had little or no immunity. The deadliest of all the exotic viruses, smallpox, is documented in the written historical record to have struck the region in 1782, decimating many tribes. However, some archaeological evidence suggests that smallpox may have first swept through the Inland Northwest over two hundred years earlier, in the early-to-mid 1500s. In any case, it is clear that throughout the 1700s and 1800s, repeated epidemics of smallpox, measles, influenza, and other diseases struck the various tribes of the Plateau and High Plains regions. Researchers estimate that the epidemics of the 1780s took the lives of somewhere between one-third and three-quarters of the total population of Salish-speaking tribes, and similar percentages in neighboring non Salishan tribes.

You have posted somewhat misleading information, which is frustrating to me because I am seeing it left and right on the internet. You are stating this is a disease that has the potential to kill 3-4% of the population. I understand you looked up the amount of individuals reportedly infected and the amount reported deceased from infection then just did straight math from there.

If you would have taken an extra minute to look at the data separated by age and/or comorbidity you would see the variance in mortality. For the most part you are looking at a very low percentage in healthy individuals under the age of 60. Mortality greatly increases beyond this age and in those with a comorbidity, which is the case for pretty much every infectious disease as these individuals have weakened immune systems. Another issue would be separating the amount of people above this age range and those with comorbidities and then calculating based off those numerical values to estimate how much of the population would be die from this viral infection.

You would see very similar mortality data with prior years of influenza and this is taking into consideration the mass amount of coronavirus infections unreported.

The takeaway here is there should be a concern with how contagious coronavirus appears to be, but those who should express serious concern are those with comorbidities and that of old age.

Definitely don’t go to work. Best thing is to assume you have it until you find a test that you can prove that you don’t. Especially your job in retail: you could easily pass it on to coworkers/customers, who again take it home and transmit to all over the place. No one wants that to happen.

Your employer should understand, and if they don’t just tell them “I’ll let everyone know that [name of employer] makes employees who have covid symptoms to go to work”. If that doesn’t work just drop their name here and we’ll do what we can.

And to answer your question: yes, there is a serious shortage of covid test NATIONWIDE. The pres said that anyone who wanted a test could get a test and THAT’S A LIE. There are only a fraction of the tests we need, so we can’t test people who need to get tested so that we can find out how many people actually have this and track it’s progress. (A shitload more people have it than the official numbers. Just do the math backwards: if it’s a 1% fatality rate, and 46 people have died in WA alone, then there should be 4600 cases, but the number of cases is (checks seattletimes) 904.)

The person you responded to made a mistake and said it could stay airborne for an hour instead of a half hour which really isn't that big of an error while also stating that they would personally recommend people not use the trails closest to town which get the most use during the summer. Pretty fair advice.  Also just because these scientists findings aren't consistent with what the WHO is reporting doesn't make them any less credible. They are reporting on what their tests that they personally ran show. The guy who led the study was Dr. Vincent Munster who is a virologist for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and even though Dr. Linsey Marr wasn't involved with the study, she corroborated Dr. Munster's finding based on her own personal research based out of Virginia Tech as an expert in the transmission of viruses by aerosol. As for the first part of your quote from the article that you don't find credible to begin with, it says, “For weeks experts have maintained that the virus is not airborne. But in fact, it can travel through the air and stay suspended for that period of about a half-hour."" What this is saying is even though the experts don't agree that the virus could be considered airborne, it very much does travel through the air when the virus is small enough and can take around a half hour to fully descend to whatever surface it lands on if it is not moved by a breeze or someone walking by it altering it's course. After it lands on a surface, depending on the type of surface and temperature/humidity levels of the area, it will be contagious for a while. Dr. Marr said later in the article that, ""based on physics, an aerosol released at a height of about six feet would fall to the ground after 34 minutes."" So if someone who is 5'5"" and infected sneezes, the higher particles could float around for half an hour. I believe that was the main point u/Dython was trying to make in the first part of his post. No one here is claiming that if you leave your house you will get infected and die, even the link I posted as you picked up on says that catching the virus through the air is unlikely. Unlikely doesn't mean not possible. Even though it says if we practice social distancing and are conscience of our actions the chances of getting it are low, that doesn't mean the chance is 0%. All that is trying to be said is even though you think you are safe outside on the trail, you never know if someone who is infected was on the trail or how long ago they were there. That's what makes the quarantine so important and why people should take it seriously. No one wants to be cooped up in their house for a couple weeks but if too many people across the country get sick at once then our under-prepared hospitals will be overloaded and doctors may have to decide who gets life saving treatment and who doesn't like what's going on in Italy. The source I linked, regardless that it hasn't been agreed upon by the WHO, was sharing the findings of some of the scientists research who are actively combating this problem so I don't have to worry about beating myself up because the source isn't verified in your eyes. Since you left me with some advice at the end of your comment I will return the favor. You may not purposefully be trying to come of as an anonymous pedantic asshole on reddit but you are.

This is where MT will get you: salaries here tend to be fairly low, compared to any given industry average. Programmers, professors, nurses, accountants...any of your ""professional"" careers, all tend to make about 70% (give or take) of the national average, for any given level of experience.

Meanwhile, the cost of rent or real estate can be quite high. A two bedroom apt in Bozeman will set you back $1300/mo for a bad one. Twice that for an apt in a new building. A 2000ft^2 house will generally sell in the $500k and up range.

So the ratio sucks. There are more costly places to live, like New York City, but those places will generally offer *higher* than average salaries, not lower.

As for weather, it's probably about what you imagine. Summers are wonderful but short. Winters are long. It was single digits yesterday, but looking to warm up into the 30's today. First snow usually comes in Sept, but doesn't start to stick until Oct. Last good snow is always in Jun, though minor snow falls in Jul and Aug aren't unheard of.

5192,5192,girlwhoplaysgolf,Actually.....our critical access hospitals are pretty great at what they do.  They stabilize and ship people that need a higher level on a regular basis.  Nurses in that setting are amazing.  They can start a line and titrate a drip and then go to the next room and assist in a delivery of a baby.  They are badass.    The other piece of this is that in Montana you usually know at least one person on the crew that is performing the transport...in fact we often have a working relationship with the nurses and RT's that are flying into a rural area that a big metropolis wouldn't have.

I noticed you dropped 4 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

5230,5230,VeblenWasRight,"Maybe quickly maybe not.  It is more likely to be a series of waves over the next 12+ months.

The goal of slowing it down right now is twofold.  One, make sure we don’t overwhelm our bed/respirator capacity so that twenty year olds that will die without hospital care can get the care to survive it.  Two, to give our scientists time to come up with vaccines and/or treatment therapies. 

This is likely to go through several waves based upon how infectious it is.  Lots of anecdotal and growing evidence of transmission through the air by asymptomatic people.  No knowledge yet if you can get it more than once.  Early indications are that it isn’t mutating substantially, but it is possible that getting it once won’t make you immune.  At this point eradication seems impossible.  Warm climates (it’s summer in Australia) don’t seem to slow it down.

If it keeps doubling in the USA every three-four days, and 5% of confirmed cases need icu (China numbers) to survive, we’ll blow through our ICU capacity in weeks.  For those that need oxygen or respirator or other clinical care to survive (14% of China confirmed cases), that number gets up to 5+ million by end of April.  And as of right now we have 250k or so non-icu beds available and fewer respirators.  Oh and by the way early critical care numbers are 10-15% (New York) and higher than that in Italy.

I live in a small town in Montana.  One hospital that serves around 10k people.  We have around 20-30 hospital beds and a half-dozen doctors.  If we peak in a month (10k infected) then we are looking at 1500-2000 people that need care.  ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  Not possible to do.  Say 2/3 of the people that can’t get care survive without care.  That’s 500+ people dead, or about 5% of the population.  We have one coroner/mortician.

So we gotta stretch it out not to save the old people but to save the younger people that will benefit from care.

There’s a reason public officials are taking drastic measures - they are scared shitless.  They have experts who have done the math.  If we can slow it down so that our healthcare system has a smooth flow instead of a giant spike we will save 100s of thousands if not millions of lives, lots of them under 40.

If you are under 50 seems like death rate is pretty low, more like flu and kids/elderly.  0.1% of 330mm *5/8 is still a couple hundred thousand non-boomers dead.  That’s WITH clinical care.  If lack of care and case severity numbers hold, that 0.1% could jump to 5 or 10% if we can’t treat the serious cases.  You do the math.

Now if you are over eighty, or over seventy with co-morbidities, you’re probably the walking dead, unless our scientists can come up with something before you get it.

I’m not twenty but I’m not eighty, and I like my odds of surviving (with care), but if one out of five cases need hospital care I don’t like my odds so much anymore.

Yes numbers are in flux but the middle of the distribution numbers combined with the speed this thing is moving turned me from “ya whatever so what it’s the boomer remover virus” to “holy shit a lot of &lt;40 could die”.",1584739743,fl1zqjl

Yeah, that's what i thought.

You're repeating back some of my comments. But this isn't about me, this is about changing the flag for an entire state. My opinion matters almost nil. I'm just one Montanan out of a million.

Besides, *I* don't entirely know why Montanans like our flag. As far as I know, it would take surveys and outreach to learn. What I was saying in those posts to come find out why we like it. Not that I had the answers.

Look, I helped build a park once. It took years and rounds of charettes to get public input, going back to the professional drafters and landscape designers for multiple revisions, before we had enough consensus to proceed.

Were the State of Montana to undertake this task, the amount of effort they'd be obliged to put into it would far exceed the effort of building a simple park for one county. Like I said, surveys and outreach. Then design.

### Wear a facemask if you are sick

* **If you are sick:** You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room.

&gt;MONTANA – Governor Steve Bullock today issued a directive to extend closures of public schools and dine-in food service and alcoholic beverage businesses through April 10 and mandate social distancing measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Montana.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“Montanans have an obligation to slow the spread of this virus. Our fellow Montanans can all continue to set a good example for each other in adhering to social distancing directives – and know that it will save lives,”** Governor Bullock said. **“For every person who stays at home and avoids non-essential gatherings, the better our chances to fight this virus and protect our frontline health care workers and emergency responders.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;Governor Bullock announced that effective immediately, non-essential social and recreational gatherings of individuals outside of a home or place of residence of greater than ten people are prohibited, if a distance of at least six feet between individuals cannot be maintained. This measure is consistent with actions taken in other states to slow the spread of COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Retail businesses are also required to establish, implement, and enforce social distancing policies to ensure a minimum of six feet between customers, effective March 28, 2020. This requirement does not apply to grocery, health care, medical, or pharmacy services, although they are also encouraged to comply with social distancing protocols if possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;School districts should follow the planning guidance provided in the March 19, 2020 Directive to seek waivers of pupil instruction time and obtain continued state funding during this period.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Directive, like its predecessor orders, is a public health order enforceable by county attorneys. It preempts all county health ordinances if they are less restrictive.  
&gt;  
&gt;Montana is also preparing for a potential surge of patients needing hospital care. On Monday, Governor Bullock announced a Directive that temporarily waives the bidding process to quickly procure or distribute emergency supplies or contract for additional space to care for patients. Additionally, the directive streamlines the process for releasing patients and discharging them back to their home communities without delay as they recover, which will free up beds and equipment for new patients.",1585087757,flengrq

5573,5573,JoeHappy,"Speaking as a seasonal tourism industry employer.

What I am supposed to be doing right now is putting together my summer season hiring. What I am actually doing is fuckall because of the vast uncertainty. 100 days from now we could either be over the hump, or still fighting this same battle, or perhaps fighting a new battle.

So for recreation and tourism this year I predict:  
a) everything stays shut down. Seasonal workers do not get hired at all. Company offices (big, small, as many as possible) hold on by their teeth until the 2021 season.  
OR  
b) We get past the hump and outdoor recreation starts to open up a little. The big national park outfits that rely on cheap foreign labor get hurt the worst because the labor they need is not there. There is a sudden last minute (june/july) surge in demand for hospitality and outdoor specialty workers among the little guys and everyone is happy for the scraps that are available. Roughly 50% of last years job opportunities. Perhaps a little better if American workers are willing to work with foreign labor minimums and conditions. Operators hanging on by their teeth is a tiny bit easier.  
OR  
c) The landscape has changed. No foreign workers available. Death toll changes all the supply demand equation of tourists, operators, and employees. Demand for tourism services is down in general. (No money and/or no desire to travel.) Social distance becomes a new normal and the existence of crowds drives markets away from tourism to other pursuits. Takes years for the Montana tourism industry to recover.

Reality will probably be a mix of all the above with possible surprises added.

So for everyone that needs a job, particularly a tourism/hospitality job, particularly entry level work, my advice is to hoard your cash. Plan to live on near nothing for a year. Work on yourselves and your marketable skills as best you can. With luck it won't be that bad.

good luck.",1585097274,flf3kf7

I've even got an iPad plan on T-Mobile proper along with a rather large account shared with some international students at UM (they don't need to do a credit check, I get to pay $25/month instead of $75/month for my unlimited iPad line, I just ask that they Venmo me their share of the bill each month). No one's reported anything really wrong with coverage to me, but they also rarely leave town except to go to bigger cities.

But yeah, Sprint is kinda poo. I've got a $15/month Kickstart line I'm maintaining solely because of the Japan roaming (I travel there often) They're supposed to have full access to the T-Mobile network now so you should see better coverage in and around Missoula, though.

5687,5687,Immo406,"Well your mind is about to be fucking blown apart when you go to Bozeman if you haven’t been there for 20 years, I remember when 19th st didn’t go to the fucking interstate!!! I remember when Costco opened in 97 and they were like the only thing when you got off the interstate! I work there very often and every week I’m there, there’s a new f’ing building going up! Land on 7th went up for sale and is sold and beginning building in 2 weeks! Shits insane! 

Entry point to own in the greater Bozeman area is $325,000, that’s the Manhattan area starter home package. The cheapest house inside of Bozeman city limits is a 1,429 sq ft for $360,000 (actually a nice house too). If you’re going to rent you’re looking at around $1,600 for a 1000 sq ft apartment. Can you buy a mobile home and live in a nice trailer court they have there to get started? Highly doubtful, good luck finding something for sale to begin with and anyways it would cost you easily 60-80k out of pocket, you’re better off finding an open lot in a trailer court there (good luck at that too, but it is possible), buying a mobile home used for a decent price many miles away from Bozeman, and pay someone to pull it into the spot and get everything hooked up / sided. That would cost 40k out of pocket. Can easily sell it for 60k if you want to leave.

Livingston is pretty cool, have to drive over a legit mountain pass in the winter time to get to Bozeman, entry into the market there is about 250k-275k for a 1,200-1,700 sq ft house. Livingston is the new “Bozeman” in my opinion.

Helena city limits price entry is about 215k, you can easily find a really nice modular home on a permanent foundation 5-15 miles outside of Helena on a 1-5 acre lot for 200-225k. There’s a good stock of homes in the 215k-250k range. 

So that should tell you how vast the price difference is, if you’re planning to work as a car salesman in Bozeman or Helena area then it might be very difficult for you to find a job position somewhere, and unless your wife makes a shit ton a year I think Bozeman would be a huge struggle for you.

If Montana wants affordable housing then it needs to build more apartment complexes and homes. The former drops the COL faster than the latter. Rent is high because demand is high. Increase the supply. Go to city council meetings and actually vote. Voice your opinion and get places rezoned so apartments and houses can be built.

5799,5799,johneyt54,"Full text of press release (actual directive not included):

&gt;MONTANA  – Governor Steve Bullock today issued a Directive  requiring Montanans to stay home and temporarily closes all  nonessential businesses and operations to curtail the spread of  COVID-19. The order, which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on March 28,  will buy time for health care workers on the frontlines and seeks  to limit long term impacts to the state’s economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“In  consultation with public health experts, health  care providers, and emergency management professionals, I have  determined that to protect public health and human safety, it is  essential, to the maximum extent possible, individuals stay at home or  at their place of residence,”** said Governor Bullock. **“There’s no doubt that COVID-19 is causing a lot of hardship. It’s also causing incredible  hardships for our frontline doctors, nurses and other hospital staff across the country.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;The  Directive will be in effect through Friday, April  10 and requires all businesses and operations in Montana, except for  essential businesses and operations as defined in the directive, to stop  all activities within the state.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Directive also prohibits all public and private gatherings  of any number of people occurring outside a household or place of residence.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“I  am taking these measures today because we need to  stay in front of this pandemic and slow the growth of infections. In  order to have a healthy economy we need a healthy population. We cannot  rebuild our economic strength without doing everything we can now to  flatten the curve and slow the spread of this  virus,”** continued Governor Bullock.   
&gt;  
&gt;Essential  services and businesses will remain operational  and open. Businesses deemed essential are required to comply with  social distancing guidelines when possible including maintaining six  feet of distance, having sanitizing products available, and designating  hours of operation specifically for vulnerable populations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under the directive, Montanans may leave their homes for  essential activities, including:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**For health and safety.** To  engage in activities or perform tasks essential to their health and  safety,  or to the health and safety of their family or household members  (including, but not limited to, pets), such as, by way of example only  and without limitation, seeking emergency services, obtaining medical  supplies or medication, or visiting a health care  professional.  
&gt;  
&gt;**For necessary supplies and services**. To  obtain necessary services or supplies for themselves and their family  or household members, or to deliver those services or supplies to  others, such as, by way of example only and without limitation,  groceries and food, household consumer products, supplies they need to  work from home, and products necessary to maintain the  safety, sanitation, and essential operation of residences  
&gt;  
&gt;**For outdoor activity**. To  engage in outdoor activity, provided the individuals comply with social  distancing, as defined below, such as, by way of example and without  limitation, walking, hiking, running, or biking. Individuals may go to  public parks and open outdoor recreation areas, including public lands  in Montana provided they remain open to recreation.  Montanans are discouraged from outdoor recreation activities that pose  enhanced risks of injury or could otherwise stress the ability of local  first responders to address the COVID-19 emergency (*e.g.*, backcountry skiing in a manner inconsistent with  avalanche recommendations or in closed terrain).  
&gt;  
&gt;**For certain types of work**. To  perform work providing essential products and services at Essential  Businesses  or Operations or to otherwise carry out activities specifically  permitted in this Directive, including Minimum Basic Operations.  
&gt;  
&gt;**To take care of others**. To care for a family member, friend, or pet in another household, and to  transport family members, friends, or pets as allowed by this Directive.  
&gt;  
&gt;The attached Directive follows federal guidance to determine  the businesses and operations deemed essential, which are summarized in the Directive and can also be found here: [https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce).

Death is not nice. It's not nice for it to happen sooner than expected. However ending the free market economy and putting just about everyone on welfare will cripple the nation state and force forwards a hunger games scenario where who knows what will happen if civil society breaks down during it.

That's basically who this has an impact on. The officers that matter a lot here. Offices, restaurants, places where people Gather in an enclosed space. One person sneezes and the droplets from there cover about a 4-foot area. On most of the surfaces in a restaurant it will last over 24 hours.

You can infect a half a dozen people that way. Each of those people will infect two others sometime in the next 10 days. Those people will infect two more. 

Remember you can spread this disease without any symptoms at all. Just the air you breathe out has the potential to do it. You rub your eyes or your nose and then touch handrail for a door handle.

One person does the same thing and then another and another.

Small-sized office will have 20 people in it a middle-sized office could have 50 and a modestly sized office building to have 300. That's 300 people opening the front door everyday at least twice. That's hundreds of people opening the bathroom door everyday.

This thing grows exponentially and it will overwhelm hospital. It will overwhelm our ability to deliver health care at all. It will overwhelm our morgues.

We'll have quarter million people with this in a week. Half a million people for 5 days after. 2 million people a week after that.

""A True Realtime COVID-19 story

Monday 

A 77 year old man, living in rural Montana, was experiencing fever, headaches, confusion and some coughing. 
After a call to 911, it was determined he should go the emergency room. However due to possible Covid-19 exposure, his wife could not take him. He was transported via Ambulance, over 30 miles to the hospital. 

6:00 PM At the hospital he was immediately quarantined and isolated. Still suffering from some confusion and fever. The hospital ran a gauntlet of tests from brain scans to blood draws to Covid-19. 

9:00 PM ll tests came back negative except the Covid test, results take at least 48 hours at this location. He was put on oxygen to keep his O2 levels up which helped with the confusion and disorientation.
Because of his isolation and the hospitals current policy of mission critical people only, he is alone at the hospital with no contact with his family. His family in the meantime is using group chat to stay in touch. Since many of them are in Washington state, they are on lockdown. 

End Monday, seems like things are going in the right direction, he is feeling better.

Tuesday

Tuesday AM A quick trip to the hospital for his wife to drop of his Parkinson's meds. Chest X-rays done over night show some concern, so they are now planning on doing them a couple times per day. He was disoriented again over night, but the amazing medical staff was on top of it. Still no visitors.

5:00 PM she was able to talk to him over the phone. He seems upbeat, was hungry and still joking around. They are giving him an antibiotic, oxygen and potassium. Family members are now getting tested for Covid. Everyone goes to bed feeling the worst could be behind them.

Wednesday

9:00 AM starts terribly. He had to be restrained in bed because his confusion compelled him to try to get out of bed and pull his oxygen out, his fever was high and they cranked the oxygen. Still waiting to know if it is Covid, though pretty sure now. 

Noon his confusion starts to get the better of him again, he starts wheezing. When asked if he wanted to talk to his family, he said ""No"". They give him meds to calm down. At this point all of the family can't help but think how scared and confused he is. 

2:00 PM, the doctor, a renowned lung expert, calls, things are deteriorating fast, he will need to be on a ventilator very soon. Now family is terrified. 

3:00 PM they start prepping him for the ventilator and to fly him to a bigger hospital in Kalispell, where another cardiovascular expert will continue his care. 

5:30 PM they intubate him, which cause so much stress, they had to resuscitate him. Now on his way via ambulance, FDA does not allow Covid on helicopters. COVID-19 confirmed.

9:00 PM he is in Kalispell, in a medically-induced coma, in critical condition. Conversations with the doctor revolve around his DNR order. The family commiserates over chat, each drinking at least one extra drink and all head for a restless night of sleep. 

Thursday

10:00 AM He is still in the coma, he has been medically paralyzed and is being treated with THE antimalarial drug. Stable, unaware and critical are the key words. Stories in local papers identify him as first case in Lincoln County and first critical case in Montana.

Noon On duty doctor calls with no real change of the situation, but shares the prognosis is not good, she said 5% chance of survival.

2:00 PM Palliative care doctor called. It is time to make the hard call. He is alive only because of the ventilator. 😭

3:00 PM His wife made the call to the doctor that it is time.

4:30 PM Last rites were given over the phone. His wife got to say good bye and that children love him, over the phone.

4:37 PM He is gone.""

\- site:leg.mt.gov inurl:mca ""stay at home""  
\- site:leg.mt.gov inurl:mca ""shelter in place""

So, we then will defer to the emergency order enacted by the executive branch.  The directive defines ""stay at home"" but has no mention of ""shelter in place"".

Missoula County: 339 hospital beds. 120k population. 20% ICU, ~50% occupied by non-covid cases. That leaves 40 beds with ventilators. Other beds can be freed for ventilators, assuming vents are available. This leaves about 80 total accommodations with critical ventilators in Missoula County.

- Present confirmed infections is 8 in Missoula County (Saturday, the 28th). 

- Percentage of infected persons requiring hospitalization with respiratory support across US: 10%. That means there is about 80% chance there is a person in a hospital now requiring a ventilator in a hospital in Missoula. 

- The time it takes to double the infection rate in the US is presently less than three days and accelerating. 

- Therefore, available life-saving ventilators could be occupied as soon as 20 days from today unless the epidemic is drastically different than elsewhere in the country (it does not appear to be), and unless ventilator availability is drastically different than outlined here. 

By drastic, I mean if the number of ventilators is twice what is outlined here (which was already doubled to accommodate the claims of the AHA), the time until they are all occupied is delayed by only three days (the doubling period).

* 83 hospital beds and 8 ICU (although I think their expansion to 20 ICU beds is underway?)
* Using the same 10% rate as above, that means currently there could be 4 people in the hospital on a ventilator.  
* If the infection rate continues to double every three days... yeah... wait for it... it seems worse than I was thinking...
* Bozeman runs out of ICU rooms on Tuesday and that's assuming no one else other than COVID-19 patients are in there
* Let's assume they can use all 83 beds and we slow the rate to double every 4 days.  That means somewhere around April 13th they run out of beds?

The next closest state is Texas at 8.8%. Guess where Montana comes in... 0.2% ([Source](https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2019-04/qgdpstate0519_4.pdf)). Furthermore, their GDP per capita is $79,764 compared to Montana's $49,393.

California has 12% of the countries documented citizens, add in the undocumented residents and it is probably 13+%  California is only carrying a fraction of extra weight if you factor in national GDP by percentage of residents. Texas is exactly 1:1. How much of that GDP is produced by undocumented workers that don't pay their fair share back into the system? Instead, California has to pull it off the backs of the folks that file every year. California does grow a lot of great food, but a significant amount of that GDP is big corporate tech. San Fran Bay Areas GDP alone is $500+ billion. 

California is overtaxed to ridiculous amounts with very little positive social gain,  the social systems are crumbling, homelessness is rampant, the illegal immigrant population is out of control of which a majority are NOT all here to pick strawberries and lettuce. This is after years of democrats dominating the political scene in local, state, and national levels. Starting a small business without massive startup capital is nearly impossible, earning your money back after clearing all the red tape is even harder. Look at the amount of small and large shops and companies in Montana that were started by Californians. It is a significant amount. Why didn't they stay in that great state if it such a booming pro success place? Whether they tell you or not, tens of thousands of able people are fleeing California for lower taxes, safer cities, and affordable living. Many won't admit it because they are still democrats and embarrassed about what has become of their beloved state. Yes, it is about politics because California is one of the most politically toxic states in the union. Folks are not moving here for higher pay and promotions, they are moving here for better opportunities and a higher chance at personal success, both in careers and life.

Not going to embarrass you with the rest. Sleep easy knowing you gave it you best at shutting someone down on Reddit. 

The ""whats your source"" gig is played out and degrades how smart you really are. A truly bright person doesn't try to degrade their intellectual opponent by constantly picking at where they got their information. Since you went straight into GDP with some hand picked literature, it is obvious that you have been waiting for you moment for a while. You put up a hell of a defense for California against a trivial remark about how poorly run the state is. Your enthusiasm to pick that apart and defend your argument is commendable, but is actually quite immature. I would recommend that you don't do that when you enter the big world. Life experience beyond our masters degrees goes much further than newspaper clippings and hand picked sources of news and information. Have you lived outside of academia yet? When you have created a successful company, hired employees, sourced product and material internationally, marketed said products, and rescued failing companies so employees could go home with a larger paycheck for their families and not a pink slip, you will probably have enough empirically gathered insight to know that the players in the world don't care that you can academically pick apart someone words and that California is a DUMP. And the really hate Democrats/Republicans thing? Don't believe the media and politicians on that, most adults grow out of it since it is not sustainable when you get out and start making the gears and the grease in society.

You can camp in the recreation area or around there and then make a day trip to each lake. Dont bother with bond lake later in the year though cause it gets drained. 

Canyon creek is beautiful, so is birch. You could also go up the backside of canyon and goto browns lake and lake agnes, you can drive into browns some camping spots further up a side road.

It's one (common) measurement, I don't agree with it either but it's what this country uses and that's why I used it. Your grievance is with economists, not me.   


&gt; Ive never had to step over used needles or human waste while walking down the street in Montana. 

I have but, neither of us has lived in every town/city in the state. I've lived the north, central, and southwestern part of the state. Drugs are a problem almost everywhere in this country so I don't know what your point is here. Besides [standard of living is distinct from quality of life](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp).  


&gt; California has some big tech company's making alot of money but that doesn't mean every resident is even remotely well off. 

I'm not going to bother with looking up the industry breakdown of California's GDP. I'm sure technology is a big part of it but, I think there's more to it than that. There's no point in wasting my time on it. Just because I challenged the OP's statement that ""California is hell to live in and they keep electing the same knuckleheads who are running it into the ground"" doesn't mean I'm some apologist for the state. If anything, I'm advocating for the Union. One state trashing another is bullshit unless you've got a well constructed and evidence based critique of their policies and the consequences of those policies; this is why I asked the OP for citations on their claims. I never got that from the OP. Instead, they continued with more personal opinions and then started giving personal insults.

I don't know what policies you are referring to since no specifics were given but I do know of this sovereignty movement you are referring to and it's a popular sentiment throughout the intermountain west where there are rural areas that are regulated by urban centers. In my opinion, there is a crucial rural/urban divide issue in this country that will tear it apart if it's not dealt with in a civilized way.

6380,6380,Montaire,"I have read the article. I am also modeling the current Health crisis for one of the largest organizations in the country.

Montana is not in first place, there is no doubt about it. Although for a state that is still feeling its way towards understanding the scope of the crisis ahead of it we are not doing too badly.

There are certainly many states that are in a worse spot but there is a lot we could do to improve especially as it regards testing and contact tracing.

Ultimately our state's demographics are so far in our favor that it is unlikely to matter. Our population density is so low. The mobility of our population between cities is another powerfully mitigating factor that will likely work in our favor.

While there are signs of community spread in most of our large cities the shelter in place is working, we are definitely off the curve in terms of new daily cases and our testing per capita isn't the best but it is still solid.

We are doing okay given the limitations of a very rural state. I know that Governor Bullock's fever check points might be a tiny bit behind the curve but his shelter-in-place was timely and definitely appears to be working.

Montana is very well positioned as it stands right now. The sooner that we Implement fever checkpoints within the state the better off we will be but as it stands right now I think we might be one of the first states to implement mandatory fever checkpoints at the borders.

To be honest this whole thing is a shitshow. Nobody is going to come out of this unscathed, this will be the defining moment for two generations if not more and given the lack of leadership from the federal government there really is no winner here. 

All we can do is hang on and hope for the best for ourselves, our families, and our communities.

Montana is better off than many places and I think that we are on a good path",1585633464,flztxhy

There is no magic wand. There is no one easy trick to defeating this pandemic. Multi-layered approach with variety of policies and tools that address multiple vectors of threat is the only way we're going to address this.

Ive obviously learned a few tricks during my 37 years of winter....pump your brakes (obsolete with ABS), dress in layers, and how to smile through a winter day. 

Most of the unenjoyable winters were spent working.  Dark when you go to work, scrape your windows, let the car warm up, go to work, let the car warm up, scrape your windows, go home when it's dark.  Beyond that, a fire and a cup of cocoa doesnt sound like a bad night to me...and is much more likely than me going outside after a day like that to build a snowman.


^^^That's the long answer.....the short answer is:  when spring is in full bloom, take a drive from Lincoln to Missoula...from Helena to Garrison....from Anaconda to Drummond via the Pintler route.

When this is over. All out of state travel by state employees should be banned. And when the next flu season starts. Everyone that leaves the state should be quarantined in a montana guard tent for two weeks under the threat of an 5.56 to their heads for threatening oir state. And the moment anyone sneezes in the country, every short term rental, hotel, and ski area should be forced to close until the next season.

...yet all some people remember about the state is the 0.5% of the population that can shop on Rodeo Drive.  So now if someone from literally any of the incredibly diverse corners of the coastal state reveals that they are ""from California"", they are immediately stereotyped as fur wearing, latte sipping, LL Bean models...

...but when we build a drive-thru espresso shop on every Montana street corner, we don't blame it on the spread of Californian culture. Smh.

California is a great place overall and I personally think that the hate Californians receive here in Montana is just insecurity and inferiority complex by Montana's who DON'T love this state enough to actually be proud of it without putting another one down for comparison.

Sure enough, a week later, the guy is initiating another personal lawsuit. He is totally the kind of dude that would sue Walmart if he slipped on wet a spot that wasn't roped off.

The article in the post does not say how many actual digital signatures he turned in, just how many he needs to turn in by the 25th. Why didn't he approach this before collecting the signatures as he knew damn well they would be disputed. He put the cart before the horse and now he is getting the media coverage that he craves. If you have followed this guy the last 4 years, it seems deliberate. Like he collected the signatures knowing they would not be taken so he would have a bigger case to push this. He is no dummy and loves being in the courtroom. Activist lawyers are notorious for this stuff.

If he is serious about running, why didn't he start months ago? He filed on the deadline day if I remember correctly. This guy is always up to something and I don't think is figuring out how to be a great and successful Attorney General.

Good areas to look at are south of Bozeman in the Gallatin range, Spanish peaks, and west towards Bridgers. Just to name a few.

Rogan needs an airport to get in and out of the state...Butte has an airport.  A comedy club in Montana wont have enough ""regulars"" in the area (even in Bozeman), so will have to rely partly on tourists and travelers.  Butte/Anaconda sit at where i-15 and i-90 meet....both interstates dissect the country....one from east-west and one from north/south.   Perfect to catch comedians ""passing through"" or on Tribble runs.

Butte/Anaconda are ""mile high"" cities as well...a sought after commodity in the MMA training community.  Albuquerque, New Mexico became a bit of an MMA training mecca based on who moved there and the elevation it offered.  Butte used to be a common place for Olympic athletes to train for that reason.

Land is cheap...hunting/skiing is all around...and he is close to his hunting/SEAL buddies.  How much would it be buy the town of Rocker (between Butte and Anaconda...right were 90 and 15 meet)?  Rogan made that in Fleshlight ads alone.

Start making the push for a Rogan compound/club/training facility/studio in the Butte area.  At the very least we can finally get Robert O Neil on the JRE and maybe Joe will find out what a drop in the bucket Flint, Michigan is compared to Butte.",1585951411,fmcrka5

Canada has a rapidly aging demographic, much more so than the US.

This puts more and more stress on the budget for Canada's enviable social programs, and makes them particularly reliant on money coming from provinces with a younger demographic and resource-extraction economies. Namely: Alberta.

And Alberta doesn't necessarily like floating the budget for the rest of the Provinces. I think it'd be much more likely that Alberta tries to break away from Canada than Montana going North (which would only result in a nuclear confrontation, so THAT ain't gonna happen).",1586445802,fmwfsmy

680,680,CliffHangerKilledMy,"Fortunately, many heavily affected areas across the globe have rolled out widespread testing. From that we can get a good of how many pneumonia-related hospitalizations there are compared to how many people have or had the virus. Thus, if we know how many pneumonia patients there were an area, we can extrapolate a decent idea of how many people had COVID-19 even without widespread testing.

If Montana had 5000 cases, we'd expect about 1000 people hospitalized for pneumonia in addition to the usual. No such surge exists.

697,697,bockscarenola,"Kelly clarkson has been at her ranch for a while now. Her husband has been there full time since they bought the place. She could be seen frequenting local businesses just about daily before this all went down, including the businesses she bought in the area. 

But, Bullocks buddy, Jim Manley, founder of  50 billion dollar Atlantic-Pacifc Capital and owner of the Ranch at Rock Creek (the most expensive accommodation in America) where Bullock takes his kid to fish at, invited numerous family and friends NYC, Seattle, and other places to stay at the ranch. 

This move prompted Granite County to issue a 14 day quarantine for out of state travellers because his family and friends, fresh from covid hot zones, were going around the entire county hoarding groceries and not abiding by social distancing standards. 


Drive into granite county, and you'll see a sign telling out of state travellers to quarantine for 14 days. These signs are only coming into the county and the towns of drummond and philipsburg. The only other 2 signs not coming into granite county or the two towns, are posted on the right on the road going to the ranch at rock creek. 

It's funny how articles like this blast people that move here and try to become part of the communities because people know their names. But the super rich out of state Democratic Party donors (and donors to Bullocks campaign) dont get mentioned when they bring dozens of people from hot zones to ride it out, that dont even try to quarantine themselves. And it sucls even more when they treat their workers like servants that have to take his friends and family on pony rides or to eat, and then be quarantined themselves. 

Not sure if you're part of the backcountry hunters group on FB. But plenty of people from Missoula are pissed they got kicked out of fishing on rock creek by the FWP for having out of county tags. But that's all because these super rich hedge fund managers have decided it's cool to go fishing on their ranches right after they come from NYC or Seattle and without licenses. 

But hey. Hate on the people we know the names of. Not the Governors buddies that give him and his political party money. Just because I'm downvoted for talking shit on Bullock, doesnt mean the dude and his friends arent scum bags either.

It is merely to transport their petroleum to market, which helps to keep the market price low. Canada can’t build an east-west pipeline to move shale oil to British Columbia or east coast ports.
