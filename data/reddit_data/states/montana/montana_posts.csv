2,darkmatterskreet,1577815358,ei6das,Nan,"Hey r/Montana!

I’m currently working on forming a trip to Montana. I’m a medical student, so unfortunately my timeline is restricted to June for when I will be visiting. I know this isn’t the best time to visit for what I want to experience out there (fly-fishing, hiking) but hey, it is what it is. 

I’m looking to start in Glacier NP as it is closest to me for my travels. I wanted to spend about 1.5 days there, then I’m heading to the Bitterroot valley for some fishing for a week or so. After that, I’m planning on hopping over to Dillion and fishing in that area for a few days. Then maybe finishing my trip in Yellowstone or Bozeman (or both) before heading back. 

I’m mainly looking for some advice on what to do in Glacier NP. I’ve read that it’s very likely most of the higher elevations will be closed/severely limited in what to do. Plus, I don’t have a lot of experience snow hiking, so I’m not really willing to do something like that. This lead me to finding the Belly River Trail area. It looks equally as gorgeous as some of the “main” park, the trail seems relatively easy, and it also has a River that follows, so I could fish as well. 

Right now, I would be arriving in the area around 2-3PM. I figured I could just kind of drive around the area and sight-see for that day. Then the next morning I could start the trek into the Belly River trail. Would this be worth it? I don’t plan on backpacking, it would just be a day hike in and back out. Anyone here have experience with this region and have advice? 

I am mainly looking for some advice with Glacier, but any other tips for those areas I listed will be much appreciated! I spoke with a fellow in my area who has gone to Montana 2 times a year for the past 30+ years for fly fishing, and he suggested the fishing areas, so I most likely won’t change that - but anything else is definitely appreciated!",Montana,Belly River Trail Advice + General Tips Wanted
3,ManintheMT,1577815889,ei6hsm,Nan,"The post regarding getting a replacement driver's license reminded me about my recent trips to the DMV for titles and/or registration renewals.  

In Kalispell there are three windows for title changes and three for renewals.  Of the three renewal windows, one is typically closed.  The wait times for title service is long.  You can show up before opening and wait in the line outside the door, or wait likely an hour behind at least 15 other people if you show up during the day.

Is this typical in other Montana counties?  Our DMV was remodeled in the last few years and they made the waiting area much smaller.  I think this was done to add more office space because they do seem to have many more employees.  

Because I haven't dealt with other DMVs in other areas I just assumed the lack of efficient services was typical.  But I was in another state visiting family this summer and noticed an ""outlet DMV"" in a small shopping center.  I was told there are several of them, and that there was never a long waiting line.  This is in a county with 1/3 the number of residents of Flathead County.

Makes we wonder why we only have three title service windows here for a county of 100,000 people?  The ability to renew annually via mail has been convenient but if you need anything more than just new tabs you have to go to the DMV office.",Montana,DMV wait times - Flathead County

I would classify us as beginner hikers/campers. I don't want to do anything very challenging or dangerous, just explore and enjoy your incredible state.

I'm mainly looking to go in late summer/early fall. I watch shows and see pictures of beautiful gradual sloped mountains with forest and open meadows mixed in. Personally, I'm terrified of heights and sketchy climbing and ideally would like to avoid that. I would love a hike up to a mountain peak but relatively gradual with no shear cliffs.

We know nothing about bear and other large predators. Where I grew up there's no bear whatsoever. I want to be as safe and smart about this trip as possible. Again, we're relatively novice I would say, and are looking for an enjoyable experience out in the mountains to hike and tent.

I know this is probably asking a lot with all my requirements, so I appreciate any and all input on places to hike/camp that generally fit this description (if it exists). Thank you!",Montana,Camping/hiking questions

My goals for the trip:
- See Yellowstone and Grand Teton
- Try fly fishing ( 1 day guided trip)
- Eat steak and drink whiskey
- relax and enjoy the scenery/ a new area of the country
- get a round of golf in ( realize this may not be an option weather wise)

Bozeman, Livingston and Jackson Hole are three places I definitely want to stay. Would be using Marriott points for most nights and that dictates some of the decision making for where to stay, for example 5 nights in Bozeman would only cost 4 nights of points.

Missoula and Big Sky are two places I am considering, too. Not sure on if I should include these or focus on less driving. 

Here are three of the itineraries I am weighing. Thoughts on these? Is it worth the extra time in car to stay 2 nights in Missoula with a stop in Butte? 


Any feedback on these options?

Option 1 - most driving - estimate is 17 hours travel

-Day 1 - arrive Bozeman
-Day 2 - Bozeman 
-Day 3 - drive to Missoula w/ stop in Butte
Day 4 - Missoula 
-Day 5 - drive to Livingston (maybe go via Helena?)
-Day 6 - Livingston Fly Fishing day
-Day 7 - drive to Jackson Hole
-Day 8 - Jackson Hole golf
-Day 9 - drive to Bozeman
-Day 10 - fly Home From Bozeman

Option 2 - less driving - around 10 hours travel

Day 1 - arrive Bozeman
Day 2 - Bozeman 
Day 3 - Bozeman trip into Yellowstone
Day 4 - Bozeman - Fly fishing day
Day 5 - Bozeman
Day 6 - drive to Jackson Hole
Day 7 - Jackson Hole - golf
Day 8 - Drive to Livingston
Day 9 - Livingston - fly fishing day
Day 10 - fly Home From Bozeman

Option 3 - less driving - around 10 hours travel

Day 1 - arrive Bozeman
Day 2 - Bozeman 
Day 3 - Bozeman trip into Yellowstone
Day 4 - Livingston - Fly fishing day
Day 5 - Livingston - golf
Day 6 - Livingston
Day 7 - drive to Jackson Jackson Hole
Day 8 - Jackson Hole - golf
Day 9 - Drive to Bozeman

I’m not sure what city even, but it’s not Missoula (I lived there for the past 2 years). 

The restaurant itself is similar to a stationary food truck and it’s an old train car/subway car/ old metal camper and it served really good breakfast burritos. It was situated in a downtown area with big multi story buildings all around it.  

I was traveling from Yellowstone to glacier so I would assume either Billings, Bozeman, or Helena. 

If anyone knows of the place I’m talking about I would greatly appreciate it!!

This is all good an well if you want to feel at home with your traffic, population density and east coast bartender/waiter. 
If you want to visit glacier or Yellowstone go in the fall. September/October will reduce your traffic by about 1000%. Summer is ridiculous. 
The same with every fly fishing hole in western MT. I've been ridiculed by every idiot from California for fly fishing in converses, cut off Jean's and tank tops. You catch the same amount of fish as people dressed out in the latest simms gear.
Head east. The snobs in western Montana will tell you that the western part of the state is the only thing worth your time. Check out the Missouri river breaks national monument. Check out the Charlie Russell national wildlife refuge. You'll find the same scenery and wildlife as western MT with none of the traffic. You'll get a genuine experience in every small town bar/restaurant/hotel.
Western Montanans also like to think that the mountains end in Lincoln. You can chase legitimate mountain ranges to the north Dakota border. 
My point is that you can find all the cushy parts of your home in Missoula/Bozeman/Kalispell. If you want to actually see some unspoiled beauty without humans...head east.",Montana,Real Montana

Hey  folks, the US Census is offering a variety of part-time temporary jobs,  entry-level and supervisory with a flexible schedule and a competitive  pay. Most jobs will last for 4-8 weeks. They welcome students, veterans,  retirees, single and stay-at-home parents, and those currently employed  or just looking to earn some extra money. For many of these jobs no  prior experience is necessary, mileage is reimbursed and conditions like  veterans benefits, SNAP and TANF support, etc are taken into account.  Those receiving SNAP and TANF support can earn income from a census job  without having it affect their benefits. They pay weekly, you would be  working in your neighborhood, supporting your local community (An  inaccurate census will end up costing Montana money) and it would look  great on the resume. The census badly needs people, so we are  encouraging people to fill out applications and pass the word along to  anyone you may know looking for work. Thanks!

From tribes to wildlife, I’ve done quite a few. But I’ve really fallen in love with “old America” and I’ve been itching to go out and find new stories to tell.

Basically what the title says. My partner got a job in Helena and we’re fairly certain we’re going to take it. We’ve lived up and down the West Coast, mostly in larger cities, but welcome many of the smaller town aspects Helena will bring, as well as the outdoor activities. 

I’m not naive. I know that Missoula would be ‘the place’ to move to in MT if we were looking for overt LGBT inclusivity, but since that isn’t an option, I’m looking for insight into Helena’s vibe? We largely keep to ourselves but would like to have some sort of community there for support and visibility, even if it’s small. We’re both late twenties and currently appear as a lesbian couple. 

I’ve also recently started an FTM gender transition— great timing, I know. Again, I know I’m giving up some ease / rights with this move that I would have in more trans-friendly cities, but I’m wondering.... am I fucking myself over? Or just making it so I’ll have to hunt a bit more for medical services?

Any and all insights into the trans and/or LGBT experience in Helena would be greatly appreciated. Montana is a gorgeous place and this is a dream job for my partner. At the end of the day, I just want to feel like I can safely call this town my new home, instead of feeling helpless and isolated, or being outright denied medical care.

Can you refer me to any scientific studies that you guys used to arrive at the allowable amount that I need to treat my multiple sclerosis or a burn victim needs to ease their pain or a cancer patient needs to get their appetite back or someone needs to treat their epilepsy. 
 
 I also feel on the eve of recreational why are we putting stricter rules on medical this seems like a bad allocation of resources unless the goal is to shift everyone into a recreational market for higher tax purposes. 
 
 Also concentrates and edibles are necessary to get the amount of cannabinoids in someones system to find relief. There is no pain meter you can use to discern when someone finds relief. You are basically forcing them to take opioids for the remainder of the month they need pain relief but have reached the weird arbitrary amount that you guys have selected for them.  
 
 There is emerging research that is showing that some people have an endogenous cannabinoid deficiency (we produce our own cannabinoids in our body called anandamide)and may benefit from supplementing so one size does not fit all on allowable amounts. ",Montana,Fellow Montanans speak now

I’d prefer to go through from the East to to west side of the park but if that makes it too complicated that is fine.  

I’m hoping to avoid busier areas (again, thats fine if I can’t) since I’ve heard that the park can be a little packed in the summer.  

I like to think that I am in good shape so I don’t mind going through tough hikes.  

I’d like to try and do backcountry camping if it’s not too dangerous.

I don’t have that much money available so I’m trying to keep it fairly low budget

After a long spell out of the state, my wife and I are planning to move back to Montana later this year to be closer to family. I’ve been focusing on finding a job, but at the same time collecting part-time temp positions to piecemeal together to make a living.

But then we remembered that we need health insurance when we live there.

I know what when Obamacare initially passed, the MT leg decided against the Medicare expansion (pardon me if my attempt to summarize complex health care policy is a little off). What’s the status of that now?

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

500,Mrs_Schyster,1584389407,fjrhpn,Nan,"*Members of an exclusive Montana club have surreptitiously guarded Chris Evan's secret COVID-19 infection by shushing community members.*

According to several sources in connection to the matter, Chris Evans is rumored to have contracted COVID-19 and is self-quarantined in Big Sky, Montana. Big Sky is known for its world-renowned skiing and the Yellowstone Club. Beyond the majestic views and pillowy cotton powder (er, um, *power*?), Yellowstone Club is a celebrity hideaway in which Chris has been a member of for years.

After being short of breath and feverish, Chris quarantined himself in his 8,125 square foot cabin in the Yellowstone Club gated community with his social media manager, Jeff Born, and hairdresser, Sylvia McDonald. Since reporting this story, I have reached out to both Jeff and Sylvia for comment. They have each claimed to have signed a non-disclosure agreement. 

According to Montana state reporting, Chris has denied testing and has been avoiding ""public surveillance in lieu of scrutiny"" regardless of his symptoms. Chris’s social media manager quoted him as saying, “my health is none of their business. If my family and friends don’t want the Coronavirus, well, then, they should practice social distance. But I don’t think they can resist, and it’s not my problem.” 

Chris Evan’s Yellowstone Club neighbors have shut down tweets and paparazzi, citing that “this hysterical media farce has gone on long enough.” According to a close source, Chris is able to charm anyone into believing anything. So if he says he doesn’t have the Coronavirus, people will believe him, continue working for him, and get infected themselves.

Chris has not officially been tested in fear of mandatory identification (i.e. Tom Hanks, Heidi Klum, Bella Hadid). Despite available COVID-19 testing kits for the very sick and the very rich, Chris doesn't want to risk exposing the true dangers of the virus to the public, his employers, and his fans.

Chris cannot afford to risk the public’s (or Trump’s administration’s) confidence. If Chris is viewed as weak, the fear is that he will lose at least two-thirds of his fans (according to a survey of a Chris Evan’s fan club). As a result of the COVID-19 rumors, the production of his upcoming thrillers, *The Devil All The Time*, and, *Greenland*, might be stalled or even canceled. 

In an effort to support Trump's propaganda efforts, the Yellowstone Club is taking measures to keep Coronavirus victims in the shadows. Those with parallel political and financial interests are systematically silencing locals in an attempt to keep citizens from mass hysteria, such as in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. According to a local resident, Britney Howard isn't worried about the ""spread of infection. There have been literally zero Coronavirus cases in Montana. I have Trump to thank for that. He cares about the everyday lives of regular people."" Chris Evans agreed to meet with me, but when an attempt to fact check this story was made his butler couldn’t unlock the door using the retinal scanner and voice recognition module.",Montana,COVID Captain American in MT

I’ve been lurking for a while, but in the interest of getting a more realistic picture of coronavirus spread in Montana, especially since it seems that mild cases are not being tested, I wanted to go ahead and get this out:

[IthinkIhaveCOVID.com](https://www.ithinkihavecovid.com)

If you think that you have coronavirus but haven’t been able to get a test, or if you don’t plan to get a test because your symptoms are mild so far, please help me (us?) out by filing out this Google form. Please also share with friends and family in Montana!

Some considerations:

1. So far I’m only collecting data for Montana cases. Yes, I would potentially consider expanding this to look at other states as well. Just wanted to start with MT because I’m using a pretty rudimentary form.
2. I’m hoping to assemble a map and a compilation of the data for everyone to see; that will probably happen tomorrow or Tuesday (if you want to help me out with something like this, let me know.) 
3. I’m not a doctor, this form does not give any official diagnoses, and it’s not a substitute for getting an actual COVID-19 test. It’s meant to help us see how many people might actually have it so that we can make the best decisions for ourselves and our families.

PM me or comment below if you’re encountering issues with the form, or if you have any suggestions. I’ll be making edits tomorrow. Thanks all!",Montana,Do you live in MT and think you have coronavirus? Think you already had it? Know someone from MT who might have it?

If my job survives the coronavirus, my boss has mentioned a possibility of being a remote worker permanently, which means I'm no longer stuck in the absolute cesspit that is LA. If my job doesn't survive the coronavirus, I can support myself pretty equally or better with steady freelance work, which means the same. So this is still theoretical but I'm optimistic and feel like fantasizing a bit. My total income is at least 60K a year. As far as I understand that is pretty decent as far as MT goes but I'm also hoping to be able to save a lot of money by moving.
This also means that employment opportunities in a city don't affect me, so one less factor.

I do care about my surroundings looking nice, part of why LA is wearing on me so much. I like trees, mountains, and peace and quiet. So that probably points more towards western MT? I love the outdoors, hiking and driving around. Bears are scary though.

I'm not looking to go completely off the grid or live in the sticks, I do like having some infrastructure around, stores, hospitals, going out to a bar is nice occasionally. Preferably an airport within a couple hours, since I'm expecting to fly to SoCal often to see friends and family. However, I'd still like to be able to look out my window and see some trees.
I have little experience with snowy conditions but I'm willing to learn. 

In summary:
Scenery - Very important
Cost of living - important
Amenities - Moderately important
Safety - Very important
Employment opportunities - Don't care
Schools - Don't care

637,brenda_leigh_smith,1585403474,fqkjat,Nan,"I did my homework now that we have the retrospective-scope some. Long text, but hopefully an instructive read.

I put together a timeline for sentinel cases to community transmission for coronavirus in southern EU, Washington state, California and NYC.  Sources are: info I have collected from NYT, Guardian, Al Jazera and Wiki (lots, esp specific dates).  Interesting and instructive story. 

Take home messages: (A) all sentinel cases from Wuhan starting mid-late January, except NYC with sentinel case from Iran late February; (B) sentinel case in Rome was January 31 and &lt;3 weeks later, there was a soccer match in Bergamo vs Valencia (NE Coastal Spain) that involved &gt;40,000 fans and ~2,500 traveled from Spain (many thru Southern France) to the game - this is a perfect storm, later described as “The Bomb”. This event set the trajectory for northern Italy, Spain and southern France - perfect timing with virus incubation and infectious transmission (1-3 weeks) - thus absolutely overwhelming number of infections in northern Italy and, eventually, Spain and southern France (3) the sentinel case in Seattle was 10 days BEFORE the Wuhan tourists in Rome, but the exposure was sooooo much more limited, but it got into a senior home in Kirkland and they got hammered (by our standards) (4) Washington state infection was way more a hot spot than epidemic and epidemiological exposure tracing and quarantine could be done; (5) NYC sentinel case was Feb 25 (from Iran) and we are now about 4 weeks out from that......  It spread rapidly like in Northern Italy, but more due to permanent population density (25,000+ per square mile) than huge soccer gathering...... that’s the urban US model going forward 

Conclusions: (A) the situation and timing in Rome-Bergamo fit perfectly with this virus’ biology - ~2 week incubation time and asymptotic transmission - it really was “The Bomb”.  It set the stage for a humanitarian disaster - Italy and Spain are still setting record deaths/day, even now 7 weeks into the infectious process (almost 1000 deaths past 24 hr in Italy, Spain &gt;700) - those poor people got blind-sided very badly; (B) even though Seattle’s exposure was 10 days EARLIER than Italy’s, it was much more contained, but pretty quickly got into a senior home and took a toll - case follow-up etc has largely allowed for containment - we are in waiting at the med school; (c) NYC is less than 4 weeks out from their sentinel case and their population density of ~25,000 per square mile and the reality of asymptotic transmission is highly problematic in the absence of major societal constraints (lock down);(D) now, densely populated cities in US will follow NYC  - look out: New Orleans, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Detroit etc, esp if there is not lockdown; (E) social distancing works to reduce transmission (esp with the luxury of close epidemiological follow-up) and thus rural areas will be largely spared initially because they are distanced to start with, but their time will come with  sporting events, church groups, Boy Scout Troops and big families - the Mormons got religion on that right quick; (F) in the absence of a perfect testing environment (very tough in a global pandemic with a very novel virus - that’s a very big diagnostic pull, but it has been done in this, albeit delayed, and that’s very impressive) social distancing, self isolation and ridiculous degrees of hand washing are very effective. 

KEEP AT IT! 

+++++++++++++++++++++++

European Union Early Time 

Jan 31: two confirmed cases in Rome (tourists from Wuhan); Italy suspends flights from China

Feb 19: Champions League soccer match in Bergamo - Atalanta vs Valencia (NE coastal Spain) - with 40,000 Italian fans and 2,500 Valencia fans attending [later characterized as “The Bomb”] - enormous, immediate infectious spread &lt;3 weeks after sentinel cases 

Feb 20: a man in Lombardy tests positive after previously leaving hospital without testing - likely he had early exposure to the Wuhan sentinel cases - volumes will be written on him. 

France lies between Valencia and Bergamo - lots of thru travel - thus, the high # cases in France

Early March: In Spain, Valencia players, fans and sports journalists fall ill  - the beginning in Spain 

Early March: Unusually nice early spring in Spain in late Feb and early March with lots of social activity at cafes etc - the virus spreads strongly in Spain 

March 8: thousands gather for Int'l Women's Day in Madrid - many, many infectious people march together and most are not symptomatic. 

March 11: 3,000 Madrid fans flew to Liverpool for another Champions League soccer game - the virus moves to the UK - here comes Boris. ....

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Washington State Early Time Line

Jan 21: first confirmed case in WA (and FIRST CASE IN US - this is 10 days BEFORE Italy got started) in man who arrived from Wuhan Jan 15 (hospitalized the 19th and discharged Feb 3 to home isolation) 

Feb 19: resident of senior home in Kirkland (East Seattle suburb) tested positive - the beginning of community infections in US (about the same time as the community infection in Lombardy, maybe even a day earlier.....) 

Feb 26: two residents of a senior home in Kirkland die of corona - ultimately 37+ residents die

Feb 28: high school student in Everett WA (Seattle) tests positive for virus from Jan 21 case establishing community spread in Pacific NW

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

California Early Time Line

Jan 26: first case confirmed in CA (third case in US)- San Diego area {details unclear for origin}

Jan 31: Santa Clara (San Francisco area)case (7th in US) in traveler who had been in Wuhan

Feb 2: Santa Clara case (9th in US) in traveler who had been in Wuhan

Jan 29-Feb 15: 3 successive government evacuations of ~1000 from China to military bases in Southern CA (quarantine) 

Feb 19: first community transmission case admitted to UC Davis (confirmed Feb 26 after CDC initially refused to test due to lack of travel history - FIRST community case in US)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

New York City Early Time Line

March 1: first confirmed case in NYC - 39 yo health care worker in Manhattan who returned from Iran 
Feb 25 [first sentinel case in US not from Wuhan] - she died. 

March 3: New Rochelle case confirmed in lawyer who works in midtown Manhattan (recent travel to Miami and frequent visits to Israel) - establishes community transmission in NYC 

March 4: nine people linked to the New Rochelle lawyer test positive

March 5: de Blasio encourages subway use - maybe not so good an idea....  

March 6: eleven new community cases linked to lawyer

March 7: Coumo declares state of emergency (89 cases - most near New Rochelle) -",Montana,"COVID-19 update from David Sauer, MD Pathologist in Portland, OR"

&gt;In consultation with public health experts, health care providers, and emergency management professionals, I have determined that it is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the State of Montana during the ongoing state of emergency that all travelers, including Montanans, arriving in Montana from another state or country for a non-work-related purpose must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days or for the duration of the person’s presence in Montana, whichever is shorter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, in accordance with the authority vested in me under the Constitution, Article VI, Sections 4 and 13, and the laws of the State of Montana, Title 10, Chapter 3 and Title 50, Chapter 1, MCA, and other applicable provisions of the Constitution and Montana law, I hereby direct the following measures be in place in the State of Montana effective immediately:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Self-Quarantine for Persons Arriving in Montana**  
&gt;  
&gt;• Any person coming to Montana from another state or country for a non-work-related purpose must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days. If a person will be present in Montana for fewer than 14 days, that person must self-quarantine for the duration of the visit.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Any person who has already arrived in Montana from another state or country for a non-work-related purpose before the date of this Directive must immediately self-quarantine for the remainder of a 14-day period beginning on the date of their arrival in Montana, or until their departure from Montana—whichever is sooner.  
&gt;  
&gt;• The Montana Department of Commerce will advise persons listing hotels, rental properties, or other short-term rentals in Montana—including but not limited to listings on such services as Airbnb, VRBO, HomeAway, and related services—to include notice of the mandatory quarantine for travelers from another state or country.  
&gt;  
&gt;• These quarantine restrictions do not apply in the following circumstances:  
&gt;  
&gt;o to persons traveling through Montana en route to another destination; or  
&gt;  
&gt;o to public health, public safety, or healthcare workers  
&gt;  
&gt;• These quarantine restrictions shall apply to Montana residents and non-residents alike.  
&gt;  
&gt;• In addition to these restrictions, persons required to self-quarantine under this Directive shall also comply with the requirements of all other Executive Orders and Directives issued by me. This Directive shall not be construed as limiting the effect of any previously issued Directive or Executive Order.

725,Volcano98584375831,1586179337,fvynho,Nan,"Have you guys noticed that :
eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or sandwich,
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?


This model is way better",Montana,Something is wrong
