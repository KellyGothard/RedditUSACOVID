43,43,fullbloodedwhitemale,1578259852,ekjcr7,Nan,"Its main method is to call people with dissident views on race or immigration “haters,” with the intention of discrediting and marginalizing them. The center’s most notable successes, however, have been financial. Starting with a mailing list of contributors to George McGovern’s presidential campaign against Richard Nixon in 1972, it has been hugely successful at parlaying wild, direct-mail threats of “racism” and “xenophobia” into hundreds of millions of dollars in donations. It is now based in a sparkling, six-story, bomb-proof headquarters its critics call “the poverty palace.”

Many of the center’s own employees have been dismayed by its obsession with fear-mongering and money-grubbing. TSC reports that once the center’s entire legal staff resigned because Mr. Dees kept evoking alarmist threats of “racism” and would not concentrate on issues the lawyers thought were important for blacks: homelessness, voter registration, and preference programs. Another staffer who quit later said that the center was just cashing in on “black pain and white guilt.” The libertarian magazine *Reason* has written that “the Southern Poverty Law Center would paint a box of Wheaties as an extremist threat if it thought that would help it raise funds.”

In 1994, the SPLC’s hometown paper, the *Montgomery Advertiser*, was a finalist for a Pulitzer award for a series of investigative articles about the center’s deceptive fund raising. The paper also learned that 12 of 13 current and former black employees complained of “racism” at the SPCL. That same year, when Mr. Dees was asked if he needed an affirmative action program to get a little more diversity in management, he had a surprising reply: “Probably the most discriminated people in America today are white men when it comes to jobs.”

**Hate everywhere**

The SPLC spooks people into giving it money by claiming that racism is everywhere, constantly on the march, probably right in your neighborhood. For years, its favorite bogey has been the Ku Klux Klan, despite the fact that the Klan has, at most, 2,000 members, of whom 10 percent are thought to be FBI informants. Some localities in which the SPLC has detected the presence of “the Klan” have challenged its findings, pointing out that residents haven’t seen any sheets or hoods. TSC reports that Mark Potok, a frequent spokesman for the SPLC, has a ready answer: “Just because the Klan, which refers to itself as the ‘invisible army,’ can’t be seen, that doesn’t mean it isn’t there.”

One of the SPLC’s favorite scare tactics is to count the number of “hate groups” around the country — always growing, of course — and warn that only a stiff check made out to itself can quell the menace. Every mailing address, every chapter of every suspect organization ranks as “a group,” so in 2000, when the center baptized all 90 chapters of the League of the South as bigots, the list of “hate groups” surged by a terrifying 24 percent. In 1998, when the Council of Conservative Citizens and its 33 chapters were inducted into the ranks, they accounted for half the rise in the number of “hate groups.”

She has an extremely extensive family tree, and this is what they know so far:

-Jane Seneca Doe was likely born between 1948 and 1960 and would have been missing by October 1976.
-Her parents may have come from Selma, Alabama. One set of grandparents were from Selma, Alabama.
-One of her grandparent’s was likely named Calhoun. One great-grandparent may have been named Harris.
-Other possible areas her relatives reside: Dallas Co. or Wilcox Co., Alabama.
-At least one branch of the family moved to Ohio.
-She may have siblings who were unaware of her existence.


Anyone with any information, which may lead to the identity of Jane Seneca Doe, is urged to contact Deputy Chief Coroner Brandon Johnson of the Grundy County Coroner’s Office at 815-941-3359 or e-mail: bjohnson@grundyco.org",Alabama,Jane Doe with genetic ties to Selma needs your help!

* Went to get my license renewed the day before it expired. 
* Found out it was suspended. Couldn't be told why, because the DMV I went to didn't handle that kind of info.
* Went to the other DMV that did handle that. Turns out I didn't pay off a citation from two years ago.
* I paid it immediately, and will be going back to the DMV this Thursday (1/16/20) to get my license reinstated

I'm fairly certain this isn't going to be as black and white as I'd like it to be, so I'm preparing for the worse. That said, what might I need in perpetration for this? Will they know I paid off the citation by looking through their databanks, or will I have to bring a receipt? 

I want it to be known that I was never sent anything about this citation. That's why I went so long without paying it. However, I do know what it was for, which was an accident I had back in '17 of July.  


I'm trying to remember if I was given any kind of paperwork with it, but I really don't recall. I had a speeding ticket in this same year, but I was actually given a copy of the ticket, and paid that off as soon as I could. I know I personally can be a little absent minded, but I like to think I would have kept paperwork from my very first accident. You don't tend to forget stuff like that.

I'm a teacher from Ontario, Canada (the most populous province in Canada). The teachers of Ontario are currently in a battle with our provincial government, who came into office last year with a number of proposed reforms to the public education system, including a drastic increase in class sizes and mandatory e-learning courses for all secondary school students.

Recently, the government has been challenged on the educational merit of its e-learning proposal. It hasn't really been able to provide any evidence to support the claim that e-learning is ""as good"" as in-class education. The minister of education did, however, point to Alabama as an example of a district that has mandated e-learning.

I have an open mind; I'm wondering what is the experience of Alabamians, as parents, students, educators, or other invested parties as it pertains to mandatory e-learning in secondary schools in Alabama? As a teacher I don't think it's a great idea, but I'd like to hear from those who have lived it.",Alabama,Question about e-learning in Alabama education from Canadian educator

One maps shows all the states and **U.S. House of Representatives** districts with semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  You can turn that data off and turn on other data that shows semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the **U.S. Senators**.  I was surprised to see how many states have senators from different parties.

There is also one map for each state that can show the state legislature lower chamber and upper chamber.  For 15 states, including **Alabama**, the maps can display semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  (I will work on contacting the other states and request they improve their data so I can color their maps.)

All of this political district boundary data is hosted on various government GIS (Geographic Information System) servers.  The maps are displayed by **GISsurfer** which is a general purpose web map I developed.  Each map has a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with general information to help you get the most benefit from the map.

For the maps with semi-transparent fill, an intriguing thing to do is turn on more than one fill overlay.  For example, turn all overlays off then turn on state house fill, congress fill, congress black line.  **You might see that some areas get more blue, some get more red and some areas become purple.**

If you have trouble figuring out how to turns overlay layers on/off and restack them, then please read the **""Map tips""**.

If you want to know exactly where data for a particular map is coming from, then notice that each map link includes an address that points to a txt file.  Copy \*just\* that txt file address, paste it into a browser bar and hit enter.  That file has the addresses for the GIS layers the map can display.

Here is the link to the web page with the political district map links.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

It is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

This restaurant is going to serve thousands of foods over the course of time

A meal is going to be cheap

You will be able to eat thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

There should be a fair trial with the requested evidence presented and John Bolton on the stand to give his first-hand account of the quid pro quo that this reprobate demanded to force our ally to meddle in the upcoming election.  I demand Justice in what has become a defining moment in our country, and I still believe you have the capacity to do the right thing and vote as an impartial juror in the trial, as well as in the decision of whether or not to call witnesses.  I ask you to think about how you will be remembered.

Historians typically credit Rosa Parks as the matriarch of the Montgomery bus boycott.

Alabama has been mentioned frequently, and it does look much cheaper (a 3 bedroom house with a yard for $450??? we pay $1100 for a small 1 bedroom apartment &amp; that's ""cheap"").

We all tend towards liberal leaning, ranging from a rather liberal Libertarian to a full blown Bernie supporter. It's me &amp; my partner, plus my four kids (18-25) &amp; my 21 year old daughter's boyfriend. We all have a lot of experience in food service &amp; cleaning for work, as well as farm work, art, writing, computers, knife making &amp; the like.

Are rental houses/properties really super cheap? How is the job market? I've heard Montgomery is pretty liberal- we don't much care how other people vote but also don't want to get hassled for being weirdo hippie artist types.

My long term goal after finding an area I like is to buy property and have a small medicinal herb farm (no, not weed- other medicinal herbs)- what areas of the state have nearby rural areas close to town/city for the others to work in?

There is a really cool public free minecraft server thats based off the Earth. 1 block equates to 1 kilometer!  [Here is a link to the live map](http://livemap.arksearth.com/index.html?worldname=Earth&amp;mapname=flat&amp;zoom=3&amp;x=-10888&amp;y=64&amp;z=-3220).  I have claimed an area thats basically Birmingham.  Some of my friends are apart of the Town as well but I thought it would be fun to open things up.The more people we have to more territory we can claim. If any fellow Alabama-ians enjoy playing Minecraft and want to give it a whirl, let me know!  Its a moderated server as well so you don't have to worry about too much ""toxic internet"" culture.  I also made a Discord server too for those who want to stay informed within the actual Town. DM me or add me on Discord DeaconBlue#9567 if you wanna know more,

I implore Alabamans to call governor Kay Ivey's office at  (334-242-7100) as well as [your State legislators](https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/elected-official-map) to ask for a stay of execution. The governor seems set to go through with the execution, but maybe putting the pressure on can help save this man's life. Please don't let your tax dollar and the people who claim to represent you be complicit in what could be essentially state murder.",Alabama,A likely innocent man is about to be executed by the state of Alabama.

I have been watching SARS-CoV-2 closely over the past month or so and have been becoming increasingly dissatisfied with our Country's response to the rapidly growing threat that this virus presents. As a result of this, I feel that basing policies and decisions on only the information that has been made available through government sponsored sources is brash and will result in delayed response that could potentially have severe impacts on the health and general well being of Tuscaloosa's residents. Due to the lack of information and at times, point-blank disinformation, I have taken it upon myself to find and verify information that should be available to the public and those, like yourselves, making choices that will impact the lives of thousands to millions. During my research I have found a number of risk factors that are being neglected by these government sponsored sources and, if they were taken into account, could substantially lower the threshold required to take significant preventative action. 

1) There are not enough test kits to properly track the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

2) The government has continuously downplayed the severity of the outbreak, purposefully skewed statistics, and deliberately spread their apathetic outlook.

3) SARS-CoV-2 can lay dormant in the host for up to 14 days and they become a viable transmission vector even before minor symptoms become apparent.

4) SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted at distances significantly larger than the accepted safe distance, can remain in the air for 30 minutes, and can survive on surfaces for days.

5) The previous strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) left survivors with life long health complications.

6) Findings from a paper published in 2007 ""demonstrate a strong association between early, sustained, and layered application of nonpharmaceutical interventions and mitigating the consequences of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States.""

7) ""so far only one measure has been effective against the coronavirus: extreme social distancing.""

   There are no 'confirmed' cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Alabama, but in no way does that mean that the virus is not here. Dr. Matt McCarthy, author of Superbugs and Infectious disease physician said on CNBC:

""I still do not have a rapid diagnostic test available... The CDC created a test, sent the test out to 50 states and then said, 'oop, hold up, don't use it. Let us fix it.' its now March... I still have to call the department of health, make my case, plead to test people. This is not good."" (1a[1:00-1:34])
 
 ""The person who tested positive was only the 32nd test we've done in this state. That is a national scandal. They are testing 10,000 a day in some countries and we can't get this off the ground... I don't have the tools to properly care for patients today."" (1a[2:04-2:20])

   The lack of testing is one of the most important risk factors because without proper testing there is no way to really know the full extent of SARS-CoV-2's spread. The numbers we're seeing today are likely a fraction of the total cases, and there's no way to tell if the virus has spread to states beyond what is being reported by government sponsored sources, because ""the low case count is likely due to how few people have been tested."" (1b)

Q: ""It's got an incubation period of potentially a couple of weeks, so are we just always gonna be behind the 8 ball on this, where we're reacting to the news two weeks later.""
A: ""Well we have a lot of diagnosed cases, to his point right now, there are probably low thousands of cases in this country that we need to turn over the card on, so were gonna have a surge in cases before we start to catch up to the actual level of spread"" (1a[5:57-6:17])

""A week or two from now is when we are going to begin getting real information, right now, were still largely flying blind"" (1a[8:11-8:18])   

   Another important risk factor and likely the most dangerous is that the government is actively spreading misinformation about the level of risk that SARS-CoV-2 presents to The United States. In a recent statement made by Donald Trump, he said that:
""We made a good move. We closed it down. We stopped it. Otherwise, the head of the CDC said last night that you would've had thousand of more problems if we didn't shut it down very early. that was a very early shut down"" (2a)
To which, a CNN fact check reporter responded: 
""Well we clearly didn't stop it. Ya know, this virus is spreading in the United States."" (2a)
 
   This sort of misinformation is going to cause massive harm to the general population and similar statements and actions are continuing to this day. One such action that transpired yesterday was that the Trump administration postponed the release of an important intelligence report warning that the United States remains unprepared for a global pandemic.

""Rather than acting on these recurrent warnings and bolstering America’s ability to respond to an outbreak, the Trump administration has instead cut back money and personnel from pandemic preparedness. In May 2018, Trump’s aides dismissed the National Security Council’s global health security staff and moved to cut its budget. The White House also cut the budgets of the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services, and closed the federal government’s $30 million Complex Crises Fund."" (2b)

""The message today that we are hearing from this administration that 'the risk is low' and that 'things are probably going to be okay. You don't need to change your lifestyle.' That's simply not true. There are going to be thousands of cases here. We have already moved from containment to mitigation. We are trying to lessen the severity here. You are going to see widespread disruption to daily life. Do not believe the false reassurance."" (1a[3:04-3:27])

The rampant misinformation, combined with SARS-CoV-2's ability to lay dormant for up to 14 days (3) has created an extremely high risk environment where carriers that are unaware they have contracted the virus continue to go about their lives with a false sense of security while they have the potential to unknowingly infect anyone that happens to get too close or touch something the carrier had touched within the last few days. These are risk factors 3 and 4. 

""The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 can linger in the air for at least 30 minutes and travel up to 4.5 metres – further than the “safe distance” advised by health authorities around the world, according to a study by a team of Chinese government epidemiologists.
The researchers also found that it can last for days on a surface where respiratory droplets land, raising the risk of transmission if unsuspecting people touch it and then rub their face. 
The length of time it lasts on the surface depends on factors such as temperature and the type of surface, for example at around 37C (98F), it can survive for two to three days on glass, fabric, metal, plastic or paper."" (4)

Make sure to view the bus diagram from source 4 

SARS-CoV-2's ability to travel greater distances and survive longer away from a host than initially hypothesized is likely playing a large part in the rapid rate of transmission, but transmission is only one side of the coin. The other side is risk factor 5: It is also possible, if not likely, that SARS-CoV-2 will carry with it, life long health complications in addition to the the initial effects on the respiratory system like the SARS virus in 2003. 

""Patients who were infected but came through the epidemic are learning that severe acute respiratory syndrome can leave lingering physical and psychological effects, which not only don’t resolve over time but can actually get worse.
SARS, initially considered a severely acute illness that would resolve like other pneumonias, has turned out to be a chronic disease with symptoms that researchers speculate could persist for life."" (5)

Considering the lack of test kits, rampant misinformation, 2 week dormancy, greater than hypothesized transmission ability, and the possibility of life long health complications, SARS-CoV-2 is not something to be taken lightly. With so many unknowns, it would be a brash decision to be reactive rather than proactive. This is not the first time we've faced a problem like this and studies have shown that, in the past, proactive measures can significantly lessen the impact of such a threat. One such study on the influenza pandemic in 1918-1919 showed that:

""The cities that implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality (Spearman r = −0.74, P &lt; .001), lower peak mortality rates (Spearman r = 0.31, P = .02), and lower total mortality (Spearman r = 0.37, P = .008). There was a statistically significant association between increased duration of nonpharmaceutical interventions and a reduced total mortality burden (Spearman r = −0.39, P = .005)."" (6)
 
""These findings demonstrate a strong association between early, sustained, and layered application of nonpharmaceutical interventions and mitigating the consequences of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States. In planning for future severe influenza pandemics, nonpharmaceutical interventions should be considered for inclusion as companion measures to developing effective vaccines and medications for prophylaxis and treatment."" (6)
 
 ""Most pandemic influenza policy makers agree that even the most rigorous nonpharmaceutical interventions are unlikely either to prevent a pandemic or change a population's underlying biological susceptibility to the pandemic virus. However, a growing body of theoretical modeling research suggests that nonpharmaceutical interventions might play a salubrious role in delaying the temporal effect of a pandemic; reducing the overall and peak attack rate; and reducing the number of cumulative deaths.11-15 Such measures could potentially provide valuable time for production and distribution of pandemic-strain vaccine and antiviral medication. Optimally, appropriate implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions would decrease the burden on health care services and critical infrastructure."" (6)

Risk factors 6 is that those in charge of policy concerning the spread of SARS-CoV-2 can worsen the impact of the virus by neglecting to act fast enough. This is made even more problematic given the rampant misinformation concerning the virus which makes it increasingly more likely that those in charge of policy will act reactivity instead of proactively and unintentionally contribute to the infection, death, and possible long term health concerns of a large portion of those they are supposed to protect.

When the influenza epidemic of 1918 infected a quarter of the U.S. population, killing tens of millions of people, seemingly small choices made the difference between life and death. (7)
 
As the disease was spreading, Wilmer Krusen, Philadelphia’s health commissioner, allowed a huge parade to take place on September 28th; some 200,000 people marched. In the following days and weeks, the bodies piled up in the city’s morgues. By the end of the season, 12,000 residents had died. (7)
 
In St. Louis, a public health commissioner named Max Starkloff decided to shut the city down. Ignoring the objections of influential businessmen, he closed the city’s schools, bars, cinemas, and sporting events. Thanks to his bold and unpopular actions, the per capita fatality rate in St. Louis was half that of Philadelphia. (In total roughly 1,700 people died from influenza in St Louis.) (7)
 
In the coming days, thousands of people across the country will face the choice between becoming a Wilmer Krusen or a Max Starkloff. (7)
 
In the moment, it will seem easier to follow Krusen’s example. For a few days, while none of your peers are taking the same steps, moving classes online or canceling campaign events will seem profoundly odd. People are going to get angry. You will be ridiculed as an extremist or an alarmist. But it is still the right thing to do. (7)
 
 What side of history do you want to be on? If the virus really has been 'closed down' it's an over reaction and there are substantial and unnecessary economic and social impacts, but in the far more likely event that SARS-CoV-2 is as dangerous as it appears then you could be responsible for making it more likely that the impact on health care services and critical infrastructure is minimal, reducing the overall and peak attack rate, and saving the lives of and reducing the damage inflicted on the people you're meant to protect. The choice is yours.

I work in sales and visit lots of networking meetings and whatnot, so I figured it would be the responsible thing to do to get tested.

First I went to the local afterhours because I had no idea where to start. They didn't have testing available, tested me for flu (which was negative), and told me I had bronchitis. (I haven't had any coughing, chest rattling, sinus drainage, or anything like any other case of bronchitis I ever had.)

So I called my local hospital (Walker County, Walker Baptist Health). They said they didn't have test kits, but UAB did. Called UAB, and they said that they are testing IF you meet the criteria. I asked what the criteria was, and the guy on the phone asked if I had a doctor at UAB (I don't). He said they were being told to direct people to call 211 in that case to find out the criteria. I asked him what 211 was... and he says it's the number they're being directed to give out. Super helpful. &gt;.&gt;

So I call 211 and if you guys don't know what 211 is, I discovered today it's a United Way hotline to assist with paying your bills. The lady was baffled why they directed me to call there. 

So... at this point I don't know who to ask or where to go. I live pretty far from UAB so I don't really want to drive all the way there just to find out they won't test me. So... what do I do?",Alabama,Coronavirus testing seems to be nigh-impossible to get

Hey y’all, I was looking for places to volunteer/donate to for students who need food while they are not in school due to schools closing because of coronavirus. A lot of kids in this state rely on free or reduced lunches, so this sudden increase from one week off (standard spring break) to 2.5 weeks is going to be a huge shock to the system. These links were provided by other redditors but I wanted to make a big post so more people could see and add on.

Corona virus presents like the flu.  It hits you like the flu.  Treat it like the flu.  

*Quarantine yourself

*Rest

*Stay hydrated, supplement with electrolytes (watered down gatorade is probably best)

*Use favorite OTC pain reliever / fever reducer

*Practice common sense hygiene if you're healthy.  Wash your hands.  Don't lick doorknobs.

Rushing the hospital or doc in the box won't help you.  There is literally nothing they can do.  If you're reasonably healthy, you will be fine.  The exception - obviously, before the ""well ACKSHUALLY if you have XYZ"" people rush in with a flurry of downvotes because they simply cannot understand context - is old people and young kids, or if you have other underlying *serious* issues.  

Don't worry about testing.  It simply doesn't matter except for statistical purposes to be analyzed down the road.

The 8 fucking gallons of milk and 20 loaves of bread will go bad in a couple weeks.  Congrats.  You just wasted a bunch of money and deprived normal sane (and if being honest, insane) people of needed staples of food.

We only had cable in the living room, so the rest of our TVs only had channels that were on antennae broadcast, and I can remember most of the station numbers, but not all of the channel IDs.

8- WAKA/CBS

12- WSFA/NBC

20- WCOV/FOX

22- Eventually became CW, I can't remember if there was anything before

26- APT/PBS- It's possible the show aired here, but I watched a decent amount of PBS as a kid and don't remember it coming on.

32- WNCF/ABC

39- ??? So this was an odd channel where I can't remember any standardized programming. I think this might have been the channel where the show aired. I don't know if it was public access or what. I can just remember random movies and old cartoon reruns airing from time to time, also a lot of fishing shows, and one time at like 2:00 AM they had dwarf wrestling.

45- TBN

67- I think this started as a UPN station, but it turned into something else afterwards? I can't really remember. Maybe this was where the show aired.

Anyway, now that I'm older, I randomly find myself remembering that talk show and wondering what it was all about.

However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent social distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [190,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf))

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement social distancing measures.**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. **Update:** [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca). Update: [Speed trumps perfection](https://twitter.com/ConallMcD/status/1238865202868883461).

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement social distancing measures.**

* Practice [social distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing social distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) of source)

* People with weakened respiratory system due to smoking/vaping ([source 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)), ([source 2](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/Abstract/publishahead/Analysis_of_factors_associated_with_disease.99363.aspx))

* Lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function or that require home oxygen (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf), last page)

* **UPDATE:** March 18th: ""99% of Those Who Died From Virus Had Other Illness, Italy Says"" ( [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says) | [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fkq6vz/99_of_those_who_died_from_virus_had_other_illness/) )

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""**

UPDATE: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds)).

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

** March 16 Update: “This is a serious disease. Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died"" —Dr. Tedros, Director of the WHO** ([source](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1239582322044874752))

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w). March 17th update: The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2: ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" (Source [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9))

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in [Sydney](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), Australia, or the one over in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), both of which will be kept up to date (as will any of my PSA's that I posted myself, as long as they're still on the main page of that sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

949,949,Justaguyinohio123,1584579777,fl10kg,Nan,"Rule 1.Stay calm. Humans have been through much worse. This too will pass.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like, this is all part of life. This virus situation in general will change day to day.

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

The UAB spring semester will resume Wednesday, March 25, in an online/alternative format. All instruction will be delivered remotely using the most effective tools available. Students should work with their instructors to access materials and utilize resources, an online FAQ and guidance to help them succeed in this format. Faculty have been provided eLearning and IT resources, as well as peer guidance. Policies regarding clinical and research requirements, student-teacher programs and other specific professional programs will be formulated based on guidance from the state of Alabama and the appropriate academic departments and governing agencies.

Virtual/Alternative Commencement Ceremonies

We are deeply disappointed that our graduating Blazers will not experience a traditional commencement this spring, but we will do everything we can to recognize and celebrate your accomplishments. There are several commencement ceremonies each spring, and details of each virtual/alternative commencement will be communicated in the coming days and weeks. This announcement is being made now to best accommodate the logistics of graduating students and their families, as well as campus departments. Additional information about this and other opportunities will be provided.

Residence Halls

Now that we know on-campus instruction will not take place this semester, we can begin to make decisions and provide guidance to allow students to move out of their residence hall rooms. We are formulating a plan now to allow a systematic and safe way for students to retrieve their belongings and move out. This plan will be shared in a separate communication directly to residential students. Students, please DO NOT RETURN TO CAMPUS at this time. It remains vitally important to aggressively promote social distancing and “flatten the curve.” Students should email [studenthousing@uab.edu](mailto:studenthousing@uab.edu) if an extreme hardship or circumstance arises.

""Online and Alternative Teaching

The UAB spring semester will resume Wednesday, March 25, in an online/alternative format. All instruction will be delivered remotely using the most effective tools available. Students should work with their instructors to access materials and utilize resources, an online FAQ and guidance to help them succeed in this format. Faculty have been provided eLearning and IT resources, as well as peer guidance. Policies regarding clinical and research requirements, student-teacher programs and other specific professional programs will be formulated based on guidance from the state of Alabama and the appropriate academic departments and governing agencies.

Virtual/Alternative Commencement Ceremonies

We are deeply disappointed that our graduating Blazers will not experience a traditional commencement this spring, but we will do everything we can to recognize and celebrate your accomplishments. There are several commencement ceremonies each spring, and details of each virtual/alternative commencement will be communicated in the coming days and weeks. This announcement is being made now to best accommodate the logistics of graduating students and their families, as well as campus departments. Additional information about this and other opportunities will be provided.

Residence Halls

Now that we know on-campus instruction will not take place this semester, we can begin to make decisions and provide guidance to allow students to move out of their residence hall rooms. We are formulating a plan now to allow a systematic and safe way for students to retrieve their belongings and move out. This plan will be shared in a separate communication directly to residential students. Students, please DO NOT RETURN TO CAMPUS at this time. It remains vitally important to aggressively promote social distancing and “flatten the curve.” Students should email [studenthousing@uab.edu](mailto:studenthousing@uab.edu) if an extreme hardship or circumstance arises. Students are not authorized to return to campus outside of this plan, and any who show up without authorization will not be accommodated.""",Alabama,"UAB will not have students return to campus for spring semester, will have ""virtual"" graduation ceremonies"

From what I gather, this isn't an old policy that was grandfathered in. The administration actively came to this decision during the middle of this pandemic. An employee on another subreddit commented, ""I tried contacting OSHA and they said while it is immoral, it is not illegal.""

My dad is a Publix cashier in the most infected county in Florida. He is in his 70s and has severe cardiovascular disease. I've tried to get him to take time off, but he doesn't have the money to. I have begged him to let me help him out for a few months but he is adamant that he won't take ""handouts"" from his kids. I've suggested he try to get a position like stocking where he has less customer contact, but he says the manager likes him at the register.

I told him he should wear one of his medical masks to work. He has about a 100 of them that he bought a while back for a time just like this. I work as a medical provider and we're putting these same masks on both ourselves and on patients when they have a fever/cough. I, unlike him, have the luxury of medical assistants who will call and prescreen every person I interact with.

Unfortunately, Publix has made a strict policy that employees can't wear protective masks to keep themselves from getting infected. Getting infected for my dad means having a pretty substantial risk of dying. It also means breathing COVID viral particles on a hundred people a day before he becomes symptomatic. While other companies are bending over backwards to protect their employees as well as their customers, Publix's leadership has made a decision to do the exact opposite.",Alabama,XPost: Publix bans employees from wearing medical masks

Hyundai Motor Corporation exploring options to send surplus South Korean  
 test kits to Alabama

 MONTGOMERY – Hyundai Motor Corporation is in communications with the  government of the Republic of South Korea to explore the possibility of  sending surplus test kits to Alabama.  The action comes after Mayor  Steven L. Reed requested assistance to combat the Coronavirus in  Alabama.

“As the nations of the world respond to the COVID-19  pandemic, the actions of South Korean leaders have been unparalleled in  protecting their citizens and suppressing the Coronavirus infection  rate,” said Mayor Steven L. Reed.  “Our community’s strong ties with  Hyundai Motor Corporation coupled with our shortage of needed medical  supplies prompted our request for assistance.”

South Korean  Coronavirus test kits have been instrumental in reducing the spread of  the virus in that country.  Hyundai Motor Corporation leaders are  seeking to identify health supplies that have FDA approval and are  compatible with testing methodologies in the U.S.

Confirmed  COVID-19 cases in Alabama have climbed above 500.  Montgomery County has  17 confirmed cases.  The state suffered its first Coronavirus death.",Alabama,Hyundai Motor Corporation exploring options to send surplus South Korean test kits to Alabama

He also worked at East Alabama Medical Center, East Alabama Psychiatric Services, and Lee County Sheriff's Department. He was treating me for depression and other mental health struggles following adolescent sexual abuse. He sexually assaulted me multiple times and threatened my job if I ever talked about it with anyone, including any other local health care providers. He told me if I cared about him, I wouldn't tell anyone. The last time, he unexpectedly physically attacked me, threatened me with a large knife to my throat, and forced me to have sex with him. He told me no one would ever believe me because it's ""too crazy to believe."" I currently know of one other confirmed victim. He has police reports filed in Auburn and Opelika and is being investigated on multiple levels. If you know anyone who has ever been seen by him as a patient, please thoroughly investigate if he has caused any harm. If you have been affected, report it to the police. You are not alone. He is an EMERGENT risk to public safety, and I am legitimately concerned about his patients.

Tell your elected officials to start thinking outside the box. To at least have a strategy on paper for makeshift hospitals. A food distribution system using National Guard and volunteers. 

Citizens at home, that are healthy, should be working out and building their strength. Alabama could very easily by turned upside down within a few weeks. Many could be asked to help with emergency community projects.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

Not sure if this if the best place to post this but.. any advice is appreciated. 

I've been staying at my current apartment complex for months without an issue. Now fleas have taken over my apartment and it's been an entire month, 2 treatments with pest control. Every time pest control comes by, he treats my apartment and coats the floors with some sort of solution that is not helping and is extremely inconvenient since it leaves a residue. I've informed my office staff and pest control personnel of my neighbors pets. They have 3 pets and the limit for pets is 2, they still refuse to search their apartment for signs of flea infestation.. I do not own any pets of any kind. I absolutely love everything about my current place and don't wish to terminate my chances staying here in the future, but something has to be done. My legs are covered with flea bites. My peace of mind has kept me up scratching from bites. I've left soap dishes under light since I started getting bites and caught several fleas. I've taken photos of all my bites and the dishes for documentation. I work from home so a flea infestation is 100X worse because I am uncomfortable all day long and dread to get outside my home.. What can I do to actually get the issue resolved? Should I contact the health department? Call my own pest control and tell them that they are going to be responsible for the payment? I don't know where to start..",Alabama,Flea issue while renting not getting resolved

Just wanted to reach out and ask if anyone has a valuable/reliable source that may be able to shed some light on the hold up of COVID testing in Tuscaloosa. 

I’ve noticed over the previous few days that Tuscaloosa’s numbers for confirmed cases haven’t grown much. But. Big BUT, even. Having witnessed how some of the citizens of our town are failing to respect social distancing, having seen first hand the poor handling of DCH’s PPE policy for this situation, and that our adjacent neighbors in Jefferson county’s numbers are booming; I’m certain that our numbers are not being adequately represented. 

Two of my family members are awaiting testing from DCH, who has told them their results would be delayed until at least Wednesday or Thursday. Anyone know why there’s been a sudden drop off in information?",Alabama,Status of COVID-19 Testing in Tuscaloosa?

1181,1181,amr318,1585598388,fry0r8,Nan,"
I don’t post on reddit much, but some recent news regarding some virus outbreak or something has got me thinking. 

With all the talk of states and countries taking various measures to contain the spread of this disease, I’m curious about y’alls opinions on locking down the state. Or locking down cities or municipalities or what have you. Kay Ivey (and Tate Reeves, Mississippi’s governor—I’ve been a resident of both states) has taken flak for not issuing lockdowns or shelter in place orders, and I’m wondering why. 

Obviously the case can be made that social distancing is a valuable tactic for preventing (or at least mitigating) the spread of the virus. Nobody knows how many people will eventually become sick, and the issue is more about flattening the curve, rather than dictating its eventual objective height, so to speak. So in all honesty, staying home and limiting contact with people is generally a great idea for the largest amount of people, since there are only so many beds and ventilators and manpowers.

But how do we balance that with people’s freedom in this country? A lot of people want to see state-level crackdowns on movement and assembly, and I can see why, but I’m concerned that we haven’t thought through what that could mean for all of us, long term. What amount of power do we want to give the government in order to keep people from going places and doing things? How long do we want the government to enforce those powers? When, if ever, will we ask the government to give up that power, and can we expect the government to comply with our wishes?

Do we prevent people from going to church? That’s a big sticky first amendment lawsuit waiting to happen, and I’m betting politicians don’t want to see that. Do we keep people in their homes under force of law? How long before that turns into the police using deadly force to ensure compliance? Does it ever get that far?


I think smart people will stay home. I think they’ll wash their hands and avoid unnecessary contact with people. I think they’ll avoid touching their faces. If they try hard enough, I think anyone could avoid catching the disease, given they didn’t catch it before they knew how to avoid it. 

But I’m afraid that smart people don’t see what could happen after all this calms down. I worry that power will corrupt, as it always does.",Alabama,Honest questions about Lockdowns ᵀᴹ

For context, I work at a hotel and have been deemed essential. I'm being paid $9. I make around 14,000 a year. 

My parents are adamant about me 'getting fired' so I can collect unemployment because they seem to think it will be far more lucrative. 

Their math has it coming out to; $235 + $600 for $835 *a week*.

So I'd be getting $3340.00 a month on unemployment for up to 8 months!

 While Alabama was hoping to hold its annual Hangout Music Festival this May, organizers revealed that the festival’s 2020 edition has been cancelled.

According to [***WKRG News 5***](https://www.wkrg.com/health/coronavirus/breaking-hangout-music-festival-canceled/), Mayor Robert Craft and the City Council of Gulf Shores unanimously passed a resolution during a Special Council Meeting to cancel the 2020 Hangout Music Festival, which was scheduled to take place from May 15 to 17. City officials noted during the meeting that they were considering cancelling the festival some time due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

“Our decision to cancel the event wasn’t taken lightly, but we are confident we have made the right decision for the health and safety of our community,” Craft said. “We have been monitoring the situation for a number of weeks to better understand[(read more.....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/04/alabamas-hangout-festival-cancelled/)",Alabama,Alabama’s Hangout Festival Cancelled Amid Virus

Ivey needs to be held accountable for her negligence. Now is the time for action. For every day she delays, more Alabamians will die and the virus will be that much harder to contain.

Her order to ""close"" non-essential businesses is a step in the right direction, but it is not nearly enough.

I financially helped her, because I can’t stand the thought of a baby going with out. I just don’t know if I should help her out more, or just wait and see what happens. What do you guys think?",Alabama,Is everyone who qualified for unemployment no matter the amount eligible for the extra $600.

I filed for UI two weeks ago. I finally saw on the site, today, that the first two weeks have been approved and paid/sent to my bank.

The first week, before March 29, it shows the full $275 being paid.
But for last week, the first week eligible for the federal $600, it shows ONLY $600 being paid, which I (likely safely) assume is the federal addition.

Aren't we supposed to be getting that IN ADDITION to the normal amount? Does anyone know why I'm only showing that I'm getting $600, and not $275 + $600? Would it have something to do with my eligibility (it's only my second week, and we're supposed to get at least 3 for Covid claims)? Or has Alabama decided to not pay normal unemployment for those getting the $600? Or, is it possible the normal amount just isn't showing and is ""hidden"" when the $600 got posted, but I'll get it?

There has been some confusion about our Utility Board’s position regarding bills and cut offs during the pandemic. The Board has never instituted a policy to impact those that are suffering financially due to all the layoffs and shutdowns. Here is the latest from the Utility Board:

As we all continue to deal with the changes forced on us with the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), Opp Utilities will extend the suspension of disconnects for non-payment through April 30th, 2020. Late fees and extension fees will also be waived during the month of April. Opp Utilities reminds customers that payment for your utility services are still due by the due date and Opp Utilities encourages all who are not financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to pay their bills on time. This will help avoid larger bills being due on your May 2020 Utility bill that could potentially include two or more months of service.

Our lobby is closed but our drive thru can be used to pay your bill, connect, disconnect, or transfer your services. We also encourage you to utilize our Online Bill Pay at WWW.cityofopp.com It’s a free service and it allows you to pay your bill from home. If you need help signing up, please call us. (334) 493-4571 option 3 and press zero (0) for the front counter. We can help you get set up.",Alabama,The good in alabama.

If you file regular unemployment due to losing your job because of Covid-19, you are eligible for an additional $600 in the state of Alabama, AS LONG as you are collecting regular unemployment as well in Alabama from the DOL.

My question is, are we automatically entered into the federal system to receive the additional $600 by filing a regular unemployment claim, or is there another website/form/number, etc that we have to go through?

I have received many conflicting statements on this, and I am looking for a bonafide source I can trust, preferably a .gov link explaining it, but if you have something else reputable send that in the comments. 

The reason is I found another job, but I am eligible for unemployment as well, and if I take this other job, I will be making about $1000 a month less (until my benefits end) than if I took the job. And I could really use that money right now since I am in my last year of college. I worked part time (35 hours a week) last year, so I know I am eligible for regular unemployment.

His monetary benefits summary said he was ineligible due to insufficient wages ($0 for all quarters). He was employed full time the whole year, part of the year as a 1099 until he switched jobs. He just filed his taxes a few days ago so could that be why it said he made $0? Because they didn’t have his tax info? He hasn’t been able to get anyone on the phone after days of calling (solidarity with everyone else that has had the same issue). He is now saying he is going to drive 2 hours to Montgomery Monday to try and get a hold of someone in person. Has anyone had success going that route? Any advice is appreciated and thanks to everyone that has made posts related to this issue, it has been helpful reading the replies.",Alabama,Another unemployment question
