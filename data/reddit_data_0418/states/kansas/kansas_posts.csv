Had to speed it up for time, but he is sitting on the toilet and you can tell from his motions what he is doing.

Summary: Pedo is talking to an 11 year old, claims to be 17 (obviously much older). Pedo is masturbating and is asking the 11 year old about him masturbating, watching porn, and trying to convince him to fuck his friends. 11 year says he is naked, pedo tries to convince him to turn on camera so he can see. Pedo ends off with ""im horny"" but then ends the chat abruptly right after that.

Suspended Montgomery County Sheriff Bobby Dierks has been officially ousted from office following a settlement hearing. Dierks was charged with attempting to persuade sheriff deputies to not arrest his girlfriend with a DUI in January 2018 and then attempting to persuade them again from testifying in her hearing in April 2018. He was officially ousted for misconduct of office and in his agreement will not try to seek public office again for at least a year.

Living in NC, I really only get the shortened version of it all, not the details. I know there ended up being a huge deficit and taxes were raised and you’re almost normal again. 

So... a few of questions... 

How are you? 

Are you actually back on track? 

Did this change anyone’s mind on conservative tax ideology? 

Kansas is a solid red state, and I don’t expect that to change. Did it effect anyone’s relationship with the GOP? 

And if I’m way off, and the tax deficit problems were overblown in the media, let me know that. 

I’m just curious! I google articles, but, like I said, they really only touch the main points. I’m fascinated, but not obsessed. So, I figured I’d just throw the question here.",kansas,Tell me about you...

The purpose of the grant is to inform broadband policymaking and is for the public good. 

We have done a ton of work in Kansas... I have personally been to 17 different cities in the most rural counties in Kansas and have been on so many of y'all's dirt roads but I am finding myself at a loss trying to pick a county for this new project.

In the United States alone, there is approximately 1,000,000 people with MS, with ~200 people diagnosed each week, and &gt;2,500,000 worldwide. There is also no known cure.

I am currently trying to raise $4,500, this money would go to individuals with MS and would help pay for house and car modifications, medication, therapy, and other things that they need to get through day to day life. While crossing the United States I am going to be performing service projects with them such as building ramps, cleaning gutters, trimming trees, and anything else that they have a difficult time doing.

Cycling helped turn my life around, and I want to use it to help other people now. I used to be [morbidly obese](https://i.imgur.com/s2MvHp4.png), struggling to go up stairs without being out of breath, being unable to run more than 10 seconds without feeling chest pains, and was on track for diabetes. Losing this weight has changed my life so much, and I can thank cycling for it.

**I'm currently selling miles to help raise money, for every dollar donated, you will get 2 miles!** After I finish your miles, I'll tell you and can verify it on Strava!

This means the world to me and the people it helps, and every penny helps. Thank you so much for reading this, I hope to meet some of you, and I look forward to riding through your state. 

As a side note, Kansas is known for being flat, so if you hold a KOM on Strava, I will be gunning for it. &lt;3

These groups have falsely claimed that without the amendment which was shot down last week, then state and federal tax funds would be used for abortions. Talking points have been circulated by several members of the Kansas senate and house.

This appears to be a power struggle between the state Senate President, Susan Wagle and the Majority Leader, Jim Denning. Wagle is running for the opening senate seat and is working to bolster her GOP bonafides. Denning worked with Govenor Kelly in the legislative off season to come up with a bipartisan compromise bill that enjoys wide support in both houses. Wagle has used her position to halt the passage of any bills in the state senate until she has the final word on the anti-abortion amendment.

Originally, the amendment was going to a state-wide vote in August, a month known for having low voter turnout. Several proposals were made to change this to the November Presidential ballot but those were changes were kept from coming forward due to worries of it being defeated by the anti-abortion groups sponsoring the amendment.",kansas,Medicaid expansion threatened with Fake News(tm)

314,314,OTK_Crazy_Brigand,1582890318,fati68,Nan,"These are all personal sightings and encounters. I live in a small town near Iola and Burlington, I'm 21 years old with around 20 or so mountain lion sightings under my belt as I like to explore wooded areas, cemeteries, and old abandoned properties, but the most recent sighting was last night in my own yard while I was standing on my deck smoking, which explains why my outdoor cats have been riled up this last week, when I saw it I froze for a bit then ran back inside and looked for the key to the gun cabinet, by the time I got back outside with a shotgun it had disappeared. Because of that I'm having trouble sleeping so I'm gonna talk about a couple of my more terrifying experiences with them. 2 years ago one attempted to attack me outside a friends house in his driveway when I was about to leave, luckily I caught a glimpse of it and was able to hop in my truck before it got to me, but when I looked at it through my driver side window it was only about 10 feet away, staring straight at me, looking hungry. The one i saw last night could be the same exact mountain lion as that one because my friends house was only a couple miles from my house. Another story, the hiking/biking trail between Garnett and Iola has multiple mountain lions, including a black one and at least one brown one, the Iola police have been informed about them but, as far as I know, they have done nothing about it, no firearms are allowed on that trail and I worry for people's safety as the black one has shown extreme aggression towards me and my friends, we were about 5 or 6 miles into hiking the trail at 1 in the morning, I split off from my friends to take a piss, as I finished, the black one stepped into my view, luckily my group of friends that I hike with were only about 15-20 feet behind me so I locked eyes with it and backpedaled to them and we all left as a group with knives drawn while we could hear it stalking us, which would've been terrifying for anyone that might have seen us because we were a group of 5, 18 to 21 year olds carrying knives on a walking trail at 1 in the morning just staring into the brush while we made our way back to our trucks. That happened in late February of last year. Since then I have stopped hiking and exploring. There was also one in the cemetery commonly known as ""Child's Play"" but that one was kinda boring as I sensed the danger before it was 30 yards away and just shoved my friends in the truck and waited for it to come into sight so I could prove to them that I wasn't crazy, from then on my friends have never questioned my ability to sense danger. I have many more stories about my mountain lion sightings and encounters but they are much less interesting and are more along the lines of ""I saw one near an abandoned building just before I got out of my truck to explore"" or ""it ran across the road as I was driving"" or the classic ""I swear, I seen it with my own two eyes"". But as a few words of advice for everyone, if you like to hike or explore, always carry a large knife or a firearm and never go anywhere without at least 2 large friends that you know will have your back when things get bad, and listen close to movement because you never know what it could be, but better yet, stay inside at night and don't go exploring, it can be deadly.

Follow the link to read the whole thing, but here is part of it:  
    
&gt;The state of Kansas has invoked an anti-price gouging law to protect consumers buying necessary supplies during the coronavirus crisis. The law prohibits raising prices for goods and services likely to increase with demand during the virus outbreak.  
  
&gt;“A price increase is presumed unjustified if it exceeds by 25 percent or more the price at which the goods or services were available on March 11 or the price for which the same goods or services are available from other sellers in the trade area,” according to a release from Kansas State Attorney General Derek Schmidt’s office.  
  
&gt;Anyone with information about price-gouging in violation of the anti-profiteering law should file a complaint with the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division online at www.InYourCornerKansas.org or call (800) 432-2310 to request a paper complaint form be sent by mail.",kansas,Kansas invokes anti-price gouging law

I created a survey  that is inspired by Condé Nast Traveler's YouTube series of ""[50 People from 50 States](https://www.youtube.com/user/condenasttraveler/videos)"". They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results.This poll  will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

When I asked “Are we doing all that we can do?” In response to the virus the nurse cane back with “They won’t even let us test people”

I asked what that meant and the nurse stated that every person that comes in wanting to be tested has to wait while the hospital reaches out to the state and they tell them if it’s ok or not to test that individual. The nurse said that have yet to be given the ok by the state to test a single patient so far for COVID-19.

This blows my mind that the state,and not the hospital, is in charge of this. The nurse went on to say that the state is taking away all the knowledge and expertise from the doctors and putting it in the hands of people at the capitol in Topeka. 
The nurse went on to say they have one single COVID-19 test kit at their hospital and it’s been there since the beginning of the outbreak

At ICT Radio we have always been about supporting local artists! Since none of them can play live it puts a lot of their pocket books in a very bad spot! We are hosting live streams from all sorts of musicians who decide to play live for tips! We do not handle the money in any way shape or form and it goes directly to their personal cash apps, venmo's, paypals etc. You don't have to tip to watch but it is encouraged as a lot of these musicians are completely out of work for the foreseeable future.  We've hosted several live sessions and it has gone very well! If you are bored and looking for something to do tune in for some local live music streams at [www.ict-radio.com/live-streams](https://www.ict-radio.com/live-streams)

lets support these artists and get some entertainment in the process! We also stream it on our broadcast at [www.ict-radio.com/listen-live-1](https://www.ict-radio.com/listen-live-1) and it runs just like an app where you can go into other apps or shut your screen off and it will still play. It is a low bandwidth stream from mobile just like an app would be.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like, this is all part of life. This virus situation in general will change day to day.

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

Try to remember the lessons of past.

Douglas County Health Officer Dr. Thomas Marcellino has issued a “Stay at Home” order as the Douglas County community continues with efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19. Grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and healthcare facilities will remain open, as residents are ordered to remain home except for essential needs.  
  
This order matches recent ones issued in neighboring counties of the Kansas City area, including Johnson, Wyandotte and Leavenworth counties, and will take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, March 24, to give residents and employers time on Monday to make preparations. The order is effective until April 23, unless otherwise amended.  
  
“With full community cooperation, this proactive public health order can minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our Douglas County community,” Marcellino said.  
  
Vulnerable populations including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions must stay-at-home. All community members should stay at home except to perform essential duties for business continuity or government functions, to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care or perform activities related to maintaining a healthy lifestyle during this time.  
  
It is all right to go outside for walks if you are not in a group and practice proper social distancing.  
  
The order does not prevent University of Kansas students from moving out of residence halls as they work through a process with KU Housing, and it also does not prevent employees for making a quick trip to get an item from their offices, if needed.    
  
  
Section Six.  This Order is effective at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, March 24, 2020 and shall remain in effect for 30 days, until 12:01 a.m. on Thursday, April 23, 2020, unless sooner amended, superseded, or rescinded.",kansas,Douglas County stay-at-home order

Since then i have developed diarrhea, headache, shortness of breath, low-grade fever and extreme lethargy. I was only waiting for a cough to develop before I was going to try and get tested. But it never happened and i am starting to feel better. However, my boyfriend is now experiencing the same symptoms only worse, additionally he has a horrible cough and sore throat and crazy body aches. We work for walmart, so the only way for us to get paid time off for this is to have a positive test. So i called the hospital and was transferred to someone in charge of giving a questionnaire of symptoms to see if  a covid-19 test was possible. My boyfriend has all symptoms including a horrible respiratory infection with cough. body aches, sore throat, and known exposure to someone who tested positive.. but she asked what his current temp was, it was 99.8. Then proceeded to tell me that Corona virus is not infectious unless the person has a fever of 100.4. And that he is fine to go to work. She said that was the Kansas guidelines. He was fine to go to work and handle everyones essentials, and potentially infect the entire supply chain because she thinks that he is not infectious without a higher temp. How is it so infectious when people are asymptomatic then? The CDC even says its contagious when people are asymptomatic. How can this be allowed? What should i do?

I want a plot to visualize the growth of cases for my county, but I can't find historical data at the county-level - just the state.

The ""KDHE Total"" is what the KDHE reports. The ""Running Total"" is the simple cumulative sum of new cases. I'm guessing the difference might be from cases starting in KS and moving out or cases starting elsewhere and moving in. Not sure.

If you're aware of other localized data sources, let me know.

Week Claimed:March 21, 2020
No Payment Issued: 

The week claimed was your waiting week.

From what I understand the waiting week period was supposed to be waived for Kansas. Is anyone else getting the same response online?

I'm also worried about looking for work and what they expect of you. I came across [this FAQ](https://www.getkansasbenefits.gov/Files/PDF/Unemployment_Insurance_and_COVID-19_Fact_Sheet.pdf) that seems to suggest that due to COVID-19 you do not need to be actively searching employment if you have taken the necessary steps to return to work for your regular employer. I have no idea what these ""necessary steps"" are. My employer has already confirmed when they reopen that I may return, is that all that is needed? When filing my weekly claim and it asks me ""Did you look for work as directed by the Kansas Unemployment Contact Center or Internet claims system, during the week being claimed?"" should I put no?

I'm worried that I will answer something incorrectly or not provide enough information and lose my chances of receiving benefits for a week.

The locals are complete morons and have no mental concept on how to stay isolated and are just taking advantage of everything related to not having to work, And those of us who ARE working are actively being told to discuss if we show symptoms in private, and those who test positive are not allowed to mention on social media or to others that we tested positive because CDC would shut down the place.

A Message From the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism

During these unprecedented times, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism is committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of the outdoor community, residents and nonresidents alike.

As promised, Kansas state parks, state fishing lakes and wildlife areas have not closed. We are confident the outdoor community will continue to make every effort to practice safe social distancing, and refrain from gathering in groups of 10 or more, to ensure these facilities remain open for the enjoyment of all.

Spring seasons will continue as planned, including Kansas’ spring turkey season. Hunters traveling from states listed on the Kansas Department of Health and Environment’s “Travel Quarantine List,” referenced here http://www.kdheks.gov/coronavirus, must self-quarantine upon arrival for 14 days prior to hunting and/or checking into a state park cabin.

Nonresident hunters who have purchased a spring turkey permit and are no longer able to travel to Kansas may get a refund by emailing kdwp.sales@ks.gov.

Whether Kansas is your “home” or your “home away from home,” we invite you to connect with us through our website, ksoutdoors.com, and our free mobile apps, CampIt KS and HuntFish KS, where you can enjoy 24/7 online access to nearly all of our in-person services.

Stay safe and stay healthy.",kansas,"Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism keeps hunting open, including allowing out of state hunters"

Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal stated ""No student should see their GPA erode due a global pandemic"".

At the same time both he and WA Governor Inslee spoke out about the steps being taken with industry partners to connect students and teachers across the state to try to achieve a proper quality of education. 

“If there’s anyone today who does not see telecom and connectivity as an essential utility, much like water and clean air, then I would challenge them to think about our history,” Reykdal said. “Right now we must sew the seeds of complete innovation in connectivity for families. It is the way we will learn. It is the way of the future.”

I did find an email address listed on their fb page during a recent live briefing they did. I wrote an email to that address looking for guidance, though I won’t really have a lot of faith that they will be monitoring and responding there.

I tried to apply for unemployment on March 23 when I first was laid off and went to apply. I went to create a account after hours of off and on trying because the site wouldn’t load or I’d keep getting error pages I’d finally managed to get through only to find out my ssn was already linked to an acc, then remembered I’d had made it years earlier after a seasonal job told me I could file unemployment when the season was over, but I’d found a job and never used the unemployment and had completely forgotten about that (email,pw, pin). at the time they had a message on the site with an email to use to contact them instead of calling the contact center 2 days after I emailed my problem they got back to me March 25th and reset my acc. I had went that day and made my acc, filed my application, and shortly after I received in mail a letter saying how much I’d get a week. Then on March 30th the same email that had reset my acc on the 25th sent 2 duplicate emails telling me it had reset my acc so I had to go and redo everything again. When applying I just picked the card they would send you instead of just doing direct deposit, it said it would arrive within 7-10 days still haven’t received it. I’ve filed 3 claims so far and tried to make the 4th claim for this week today but every time I tried the site was still running like shit and I’d only get error pages after trying to login. When you call you either get a busy tone or it’s already closed even when I call around 2 and 3pm (didn’t call today figured Easter and all) what am I suppose to do? It’s been 18 days I already wasn’t someone with any type of money. When you do call the unemployment contact center you basically are told repeatedly to go to the site but the site is a joke I don’t get it. Are there many fellow Kansans getting shit on like this or for the most part are you guys receiving your benefit and the only problem is the site being a pain but after you apply, file and claim did you receive your card within that 7-10 days and get your claims paid?",kansas,How has your unemployment experience been?

I sent a message to both senators and my house rep regarding the issues facing the USPS and how, by all appearances, they'll be insolvent by the end of summer and the White House's complete antipathy towards the agency.  In response, Moran sent me this

""Our country is facing a pandemic, and we need to make certain that Kansans have the support they need to weather this storm.  

 

At the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, Congress passed into law the ‘Phase I’ relief bill, an $8.3 billion funding package that helped ensure our local, state, and federal governments have the necessary tools to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These funds included $6 million to bolster Kansas’ preventative measures, including test kits, additional medical staff, the establishment of quarantine facilities, and medical research to help find a vaccine. 

 

The following week, Congress passed the ‘Phase II’ relief bill, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, into law. This legislation answered the growing urgency for paid family and medical leave provisions and included flexibility for Kansas’ small businesses. The Phase II relief bill helped individuals who found themselves unable to work as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak to receive paid leave and gave employers a tax credit to cover the costs associated with losing their workers. Importantly, this bill included a provision granting the Secretary of Labor the authority to exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the Phase II paid leave requirements. 

 

As the COVID-19 outbreak continued to have a damaging effect on our nation’s health and economy, Congress came to the negotiating table and developed the ‘Phase III’ relief bill. Every single Member of Congress supported this legislation and on Saturday, March 28th, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law. The CARES Act, while far from perfect, prioritizes getting financial and technical assistance to the hospitals, small businesses, farmers, and families that are struggling as a result of the outbreak. Provisions of the bill include tax rebates to American citizens, an expansion of unemployment insurance, and a robust forgivable loan program through the Small Business Administration. I worked to ensure that a number of the provisions included in the package would help Kansas’ businesses and economy, as well as the health professionals on the frontlines of this disease. This included aid to the aviation industry and Kansas’ community banks, as well as additional resources to the Federal Communications Commission to bolster rural broadband services during these uncertain times. The CARES Act sends over $100 billion in direct assistance and payments to Critical Access Hospitals in dire need of resources. In addition to those payments, the CARES Act addresses the medical supply shortages our nation is currently facing by providing $16 billion to produce personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other critical medical supplies. 

 

While the legislation includes provisions that I would not support in ordinary circumstances, I recognize the importance of providing relief to the American people, who are struggling through no fault of their own. Over the coming weeks, I will work to ensure that the dollars included in the three relief packages are distributed appropriately and work to mitigate this pandemic. There are many challenges facing our state due to COVID-19, and Kansans are pulling together to help one another and serve others, often at risk to themselves. I want to extend my sincerest appreciation to each of you for the sacrifices you are making and the concern you are demonstrating for others. 

 

I am grateful for the opportunity Kansans have given me to serve them in the United States Senate. If you are interested in learning more about my efforts on your behalf, I encourage you to visit moran.senate.gov. Please let me know if I can be of service to you or your family in the future.


Very truly yours,

Jerry Moran ""

How is the CoL? I've looked at some appartments and was amazed at what I could get for $400 a month, is it relatively cheap for other things? (Gas, food, auto insurance etc)

What's the weather like? I grew up in SoCal and I currently live in eastern MA, so I've experienced a lot with weather, how often do most areas get tornados? Once a month? A week?

The bulk of the response was the expected ""things are messed up right now"" that is understandably at the forefront of peoples minds, but he actually had a response about my concerns about the USPS.  

""The United States Postal Service (USPS) is a self-funding enterprise that depends on postage rates and other revenue streams to pay its operating costs. Since 2006, USPS has experienced a significant decline in mail volume, while its operating costs, in terms of fuel and employee-related compensation and benefits, have increased. Last March, Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) introduced a Senate resolution expressing that USPS should remain an independent establishment of the Federal Government and not be subject to privatization (S.Res.99). I cosponsored this resolution because I believe the Post Office is critical to doing business in small towns and our way of life. Recently, the CARES Act included a provision allowing USPS to work on terms with the Treasury Department for a loan worth up to $10 billion.""

Out of curiosity, i looked up senate resolution 99.  Fucking Moran was a cosponsor too.  You'd think he'd want every opportunity to pretend he's working.  So kudos Roberts. I didn't vote for you but at least you act like you're doing your job",kansas,Apparently one senator reads
