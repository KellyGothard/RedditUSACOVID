       "'I, as well as 4 of the last 5 sublettors have all been moving here from out of state and this was our first apartment in nyc so we didn\\'t really know any better and were on a time crunch.  Shame on you for putting words in my mouth. It\\'s dishonest. \\n\\nAll I have said is that assaults are down.  So the idea that we need to arm civilians is ridiculous and alarmist.\\n\\nI\\'m deeply disturbed by the raise in hate crime and especially in my hometown and especially between blacks and Jews. \\n\\nI dont think the solution is being dishonest about crime stats or arming people.  &gt;you do have legal recourse for the overcharging\\n\\nOnly if the apartment is rent stabilized.  People don’t vote, states vote. We weight the votes so that more populous states get more representation than less populous states though, which is why it’s all but impossible to be elected by only appealing to urban states or only appealing to rural states. But people don’t vote for Senators, and people don’t vote for President. States do. \\n\\nSee the Federalist Papers for more details.  i think it’s one of the front legs of the couch that busted off  the nyc transplant got suckered.\\n\\nyou live and learn.  do your research  Honestly these are better than I could have asked for lol.  I know the Dominican accent pretty well being Dominican. I recognize her accent and can tell it\\'s a Bronx Dominican accent but I don\\'t really get how it showed up. I can\\'t even speak to my parents in English without feeling weird.  That map is misleading... it excludes the major cities.\\n\\nYou could say that Rhode Island has more people than all the unpopulated wood and swampland in the US.  They should let do shit against that unless they are trained.  Best you should do is film and get the cops/authorities.  You never know if someone got a gun or knife.  \\n\\nJust from personal experience, many years ago there were 3 little teenagers harassing a fourth kid.  Me being bigger, came in between them to stop it.  One of the teens pulled out a knife and tried to slash.  I fortunate and didn’t get hit.  After the kid missed, all three kids ran away.  If I hadn’t moved in time it would’ve been a lot worse.  Incidentally, the first apartment I signed a lease for before moving here was *actually* illegal (it didn\\'t have any windows) and I was able to successfully able to fight that and get my money back without ever moving in.  Then I found this apartment.  Lots of people taking advantage of transplants  So it\\'s an illegal sublet?    By telling the management company you have now screwed youself and the person you are renting from.      \\n\\nWhat is market rate food the apt?      Personally you didn\\'t say you were unhappy living there.    What I might have done is bargain with the person you are subletting from and NOT TELL the managing agent (maybe the person would have given you a break on the rent if they felt threatened).  Imagine delaying the train for hundreds of people.  Shut up white cuck, your President is a rapist who sexually fetishizes his daughter and we will do this to you the day your kind decide to fight one last time.  \\n\\n\\nSquad Wipe.  Link?  fuck all the bed bugs they just got  Literally wtf are you talking about?  You’re right. Except since the 17th Amendment in 1917, Senators *are* chosen by people.\\n\\nThe Federalizt Papers were written to convince states to support the new Constitution and the stronger national government. The “upper house” of Congress was expected to advocate for states because Senators were chosen by state legislatures. That extra step was intended to slow the process and prevent hyper-democracy.\\n\\nBasically, populism was never meant to be seen in the Senate and it was supposed to be entirely an insider’s Chamber. People who worked on behalf of the entire state they called home.  Could be a case of an apathetic employee. Regardless you should decide how you want to proceed and do one of these two things:\\n\\n* Document the landlord\\'s implicit permission using the standard legal means (basically sending a letter by certified mail to the landlord and probably also the leaseholder) to get formal sublessee status. \\n* Vacate the apartment.\\n * If you agreed to a specific \"lease\" duration, you\\'re in a super weird/complex legal situation since it\\'s not an actual sublease but it\\'s also not not an actual sublease and I\\'m honestly not sure what your rights/responsibilities would be.\\n * If you didn\\'t agree to a specific duration, you can almost certainly vacate by giving 30 days\\' notice since you would effectively be a month-to-month tenant. You can possibly vacate immediately if you\\'d like given the leaseholder\\'s shaky legal standing.  Are you new here?  Aaah, ok. Yeah, that makes more sense.  i would laugh yea why not  Maybe don’t dress like the Kool Aid Man when attempting a felony?  Or with brands like Admiral Television, absorbed into other companies again and again until it is a part of Whirlpool today.  thanks... quick question. How much is the entry fee for a club in nyc? is it like a 100$ minimum?  Om a Saturday night? Or like during the middle of the day?  This is really what needs to be changed.  Duh. Call 911. A lot. A public arrest or two will calm the station down significantly.  realmta.info \\n\\nReal-time info about all lines. \\n\\nAt present, only the G is functioning with good service.  there\\'s gotta be a long-ass german word for \"you right but you crazy tho\"  You\\'re high if you think those two are even remotely similair...  Pat for the course  no, but this sub is turning into the goddamned NYPost and roleplaying like it\\'s the warriors or some shit  Why?  Lol. Check my post history.  If you don\\'t understand the difference between using the term colored people when discussing black people, and using the word females to describe humans that are, wait for it, female, then I\\'m not sure anything I say will get you to understand it.  Cornball Deblasio turning this city to shit. Worst nyc mayor of all time.  These weren’t redditors lmfao , this was on insta , then twitter, then probably here and Facebook. Not everything on Reddit was seen and acted on Reddit first.  Vigilante?  I didn’t see any blood that’s a shame. Deserved every kick to the face.  realmta.info  Plus, the Q53 is pretty useful between Roosevelt Av and Woodhaven Blvd. People use it as an alternative to the subway when weekend work is being done.\\n\\nAll kinds of people use it that way. I know because I\\'m one of them.  I feel this 😅  The internet and New York teamed up to find this scumbag in less than a day.  Lol love it  Like trumps tariffs did right  \"Only cities should have say in our elections, anyone not living in a metropolitan area is irrelevant since candidates will only appeal to urban populations\"\\n\\nI\\'m sure you are not aware but look up what happened with the French Revolution and subsequent republic. It became a battle between Paris and the rest of France because the urban center held all the power.\\n\\nWhy would a candidate ever campaign anywhere other than LA, NYC, and other densely populated areas if it was purely a numbers game?  I wouldn\\'t bother rehabiliating the violent rapists. I\\'d just send them to the furthest pits of hell with the war criminals and serial killers. I know it\\'s not practical but one can dream...  Support.  Agree that he should be tackled and held, but since he was off the train, why would you pull the e-brake? Would be faster to call 911 from the platform yourself rather than wait for the conductor/TO to walk back, explain the situation, then return to the cab and radio in, then wait for dispatch to make the call for you.  A milli a year  Lock em up in a mental institution, far away from potential victims. He has proven himself to be a danger to the general public  Yeah same. Drugs, theft, even mugging is rehabilitatable. But rapists, child molesters, war criminals just cross the line and deserve whatever they get.  living wage is $18 an hour in nyc. idk which statistics u are using that say 28 is living wage. i dont mind if this was a mechanics job, or and skilled trade, skilled anything, but its a job where 0 skills are required. If a private company wants to pay $28 an hour for a sweeper, go for it, when prices go up, they will just lose customers. \\n\\nhowever, the MTA is a monopoly on public transit, meaning that this matters.  Ok so \"Things I say are okay, it\\'s things other people say that need scrutiny.\" Got it.  Even D&amp;R’s are shutting down, they also went to shit after Walgreens bought them.  Wow, you really are *that* stupid.  Is that at like MD level for IB?  they sat down on that mf’er like “yeah you see it”  no, this is dumb af of an argument.\\n\\nThey cant hire non union cleaners because they are still part of the MTA union. if there was a \"cleaners union\" separate from the skilled trades half of the union, they would be all fired on the spot. \\n\\nthe second such replaceable cleaners tried to bargain, their union would be replaced. \\n\\nSince the skilled workers are part of the same union, the cleaners get to reap the benefit without any contribution to the cause, since they aren\\'t providing any actual value to a union other than the wage % the union collects.\\n\\nUnion is meant to allow workers to collectively say \"you cant replace us all\"\\n\\nbut in the cleaner\\'s case, they can, they just cant replace all the actual employees there.  /r/circlejerknyc  Damn gotta love New York  &gt;I know the quant funds can pay anywhere from $250k-400k first year and I could probably get around $200k starting salary at a Google/FB type company. \\n\\npfffffffffhahahah  Welcome to New York bruv  Only the New Tech Trains have those intercom buttons. R62A cars don’t have them.  Why is that so funny lol  Doesn\\'t the QT63 do that same thing in the new plan?\\n\\nAlso thanks for the Q53 tip, I work at LGA often and have a bad habit of not paying attention to the day of the week before I head down to the subway, never tried the bus.  I\\'ve been taking the Q72 home a lot recently too, takes a lot longer but I can for sure get a seat at LGA and it\\'s only a few more blocks walking to Woodhaven.  Is this the wrong place to ask this lol  no offense m8, but when you are renting something, you should assess the value of it. You seemed content that it was worth $4100 a month. \\n\\nif i walk up to you with an apple and tell you i well sell you this apple for $100 bucks, and you buy it, its really no fault but your own, because when you bought it, you agreed that $100 is a fair value even though the apple is something i bought from the grocery store across the street for a dollar.  Cleaner subways like an open gangway train where the homeless shit smell flows through the whole train instead of just one car?  There was a second beating? I’d very much like to watch that as well please.  “I ain’t no rapist.” -Every non-rapist ever accused of rape  Does that mean if I’m 29 but ambitious I should stay far away? I’ve thought about it for a while, and perhaps that is a sign that I shouldn’t do it. I probably don’t have the NYC hustle though and I’m really bad at networking.  I’m going to take a guess and say that those guys kicking him in the video aren’t redditors.  Wait wait are you telling me shelters are disruptive to neighborhoods? Liberals always told me they\\'re fine and no problem.  I bet he thought she was super drunk/ high and could “help her home” once he carried her off the train. Fucking monster  LOOK ATTEM GO BABEY!  Hence the PSA.  The real estate market is more complex than an apple, especially for people just moving here.  Does not seem right to me that a fellow renter who doesn\\'t live in an apartment should exploit others with by such an egregious amount further driving up housing prices. This is not a radical idea.  In san francisco it is [already illegal.](https://flip.lease/learn/subletting-your-apartment/rent-payments-in-california)  Go to a bar like the rest of everyone else in the city  Check /r/DeuxRAMA and see the stickied video.\\n\\nI make you look like trash.

You can check Couchsurfing for events/meetups, it\\'s primarily for travelers but locals are always welcome. I go their events in other cities when I travel and sometimes here in NY. Great way to meet new people and socialize. Also check Meetup and Eventbrite.  While this is what should have happened, the fact that he got away only to get beat up. twice. THEN arrested feels like a Christmas miracle.  What would you say is NYC average for a college graduate? \\\\~150k?  One of the many things  You’re presenting your quote as from a .gov, Bureau of Justice statistics. \\n\\nIn fact it’s some other website that most likely has some political bias.  He did end up getting beat up twice, then arrested, so I’m considering this ending this shitty year on a high note. \\n\\nAt least there’s SOME justice left in the world.  thats a large poop bag  Here\\'s an idea.

What a dipshit.  https://youtu.be/MKZArCkUxE0 Original beat up vid  I don\\'t know any people of Puerto Rican ancestry in NYC who speak Spanish to their parents (well millennials and younger at least). And this seems to be the trend:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Given a choice between answering a gamut of questions about their lives in Spanish or in English, 78 percent of the Puerto Rican respondents chose English, significantly more than any other Latino group. According to the poll, only 20 percent of Puerto Ricans speak Spanish at home, less than half the percentage for respondents overall.\\n\\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/01/22/262791008/english-only-for-mainland-puerto-ricans-the-answer-is-often-yes](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/01/22/262791008/english-only-for-mainland-puerto-ricans-the-answer-is-often-yes)\\n\\nIt makes sense considering the bulk of Puerto Ricans in the NYC area arrived in the 1940s and 1950s. \\n\\nWould say the opposite for the Dominicans I know. Even many Dominicans younger than myself have Spanish influenced accents. And other people of Latin American ancestry also have much higher rates of Spanish language utilization than Puerto Ricans.  https://youtu.be/MKZArCkUxE0 kicked in the face enjoy Newyorker  No. But the woman\\'s laughter is worth a chuckle imo  https://youtu.be/MKZArCkUxE0 Beat yo video share  I\\'ve gotten busted on the SBS.

I’ve worked everywhere and you’re going to get your one or two rude passengers. I try to make my job as simple as possible. When it comes to fare evasion, because we’ve had fatalities due to operators pursuing the fare with passengers, now what they tell us is, “Don’t worry about the fare.” They tell us that from day one. Your first day of training, they tell you, “The fare box is not yours. Don’t worry about people not paying the fare.” We have a special box we press on the fare box and we just press and that’s it.\\n\\n\\n&gt;What does the button do? \\n\\n\\n&gt;When the bus pulls into the depot and they check all the money that’s inside, it pretty much tells them, “OK, during this driver’s tour \\'x\\' amount of people didn’t pay the fare.\" They [the MTA] don’t really enforce it, but now what they do is they ride the bus. They sit undercover riders to see if there’s a pattern. If there’s a pattern, if the people are not paying or sometimes the Metro Cards are no good, maybe they’re bent. They’ll sit in the front and they’ll watch us and they’ll watch the passengers. They’ll write stuff down and they’ll check and see if we need more buses on the line. They wear these New York City Traffic vests and they have a clipboard. They see a pattern, and if it’s a problem, they’ll send them out and check and see why there’s so much fare evasion, why the bus is running really late.\\n\\n\\n&gt;Is it common? Do people know that they can get away with it? \\n\\n\\n&gt;It really depends on what neighborhood you’re in. Me, like I said, I work in pretty much western Queens and the whole Queens Plaza area. I noticed that anyone that travels close to the Queensbridge Projects, the Astoria projects, people tend not to pay. When I was working up in the Bronx, Co-op City was an area where people tend not to pay.  We did it guys!  He shouldve been curbstomped  You\\'re telling me there wasn\\'t just a guy filming the two people next to him doing nothing out of the ordinary at a gas station?  I’m sorry you have to take the 7  Great to see. De Blasio can’t get the job done but the people in the video do  Leave your apartment? I feel ya.  He obviously pivoted.  So this is like that scene from the first Raimi Spiderman, right?  Gotta do what you gotta do  I fucking hate worldstar, but youtube wasn\\'t going to let me watch this muthafucker get kicked in the head, and seeing him get kicked in the head was so fucking satisfying.  Leave your mother, the fuck are you talking about.  Right? Getting it from the platform to the train is probably the easiest part of the whole affair.  Maybe the more important question is “how can we can help all the mentally ill, homeless and drug addicted people?” instead of “who can I complain to that the underprivileged and forgotten people of our society are near me?”  Or maybe you shouldn\\'t be allowed to singlehandedly govern a state you\\'ve never been to and know nothing about based off your personal lifestyle and exposure?  Underrated  Link gone son  [removed]  He just really wanted to make sure he got a seat on the train  Where was this? In the bronx?  It ain’t.  Only in NY can you furnish a whole crib off Craigslist free listings and trash day sidewalks and not have to pay to move a goddamn thing. \\n\\nLove this city.  This change does dramatically improve service for eastern queens. It makes it easier for them to get to bus to subway quick. \\n\\nBut I don’t see this as a good change for those living in western queens. Seems like they’re creating more unnecessary transfers on bus lines in western queens. Buses help you get around western queens, subway help you get to the city. This change is just furthering the efficiency of a city focused commute, given that many of the new purple lines don’t even run on weekends.  But but but... supply and demand!! This is impossible according to reddit’s favorite immutable law!  Shut the fuck up.  Don\\'t worry next year will be awesome. You\\'re going to have an awesome new president Donald j Trump  I ain\\'t even mad 🤷🏽\\u200d♀️🤷🏽\\u200d♀️  No need to get too fancy with DIY plumbing. Get a “double locking” or “double jointed” shower extension arm and a big rainfall style shower head.

Muthafuckas face had a boot print.  Oh good, I hope he’s better than the current Donald J Trump, this one seems to be going through the middle stages of dementia.

I mean, that\\'s a pretty empty car, so I really don\\'t see the problem here.  Are *you* enough of a schmuck to complain about laughter?  Yes I read it but my comment alludes to the reality that it means nothing without context. You and the OP can paint whatever narrative you want to \"warn people of violent black people\" but its already been proven the black people are incarcerated at a way higher rate and given harsher sentences than our white counterparts for the same crimes so these statistic that you like to tote really don\\'t mean anything... it just shows me that we still getting screwed over by the justice system. \\n\\nI really dont understand what the endgame is... people like you and the OP want to prove so badly that black people are inherently evil and violent. Does it make you sleep better at night? Did you get hurt by a black person and you need to warn everyone of how scary we are? Do you just hate that we\\'re economically trying to get on equal footing and you want to remind us to stay humble cause other races are \"better\"\\n\\nHonestly I dont really care..go argue with your mother I ain\\'t commenting on this again..  &gt;\"How ironic is it that a wind turbine was brought down by wind?\" -Politician in vid\\n\\nWow.

Manhattan-bound J train that apparently was running so far behind when I got on that after Broadway Junction it changed to an express train and started skipping stops left and right. Must have shaved 4-5 minutes off my morning commute, which was a pleasant surprise.  I have never seen or heard this happening to any girl I\\'ve seen or known in all my years here.

I actually found his insta and there’s a lesbian couple that likes almost all his posts I actually weirdly thought the girl in the profile pic looked like the one in the video  One hell of a pony ride, amirite?  Because when I read the article earlier today (not sure if was this one, it was on FB and can\\'t find it) it said they were yelling out slurs. I THINK this is the same article just edited. I shared it because it\\'s the article I think I read earlier. And why is it a biased source if it says nothing about it being homophobic? Like what the fuck are you just looking to have a problem?

This is the best comment I’ve seen in 6 weeks. Thank you.  Imagine advocating arrest for delaying a train  It really is.  what, you\\'ve never picked up a free craigslist couch?

Light still reaches the street and it doesn\\'t take up as much space.  YOY, shootings, felony assaults, murders, robberies and hate crimes are up. It\\'s not an isolated thing. The  drops in crime aren\\'t happening any more. Second consecutive year of an an uptick in violent crime. Saying \"crime is down\" is a nice political bluff to be able to say to instill a false sense of safety since it\\'s cherry picking stats at best/using misleading variables (e.g. \"down relative to X year\"), and a falsehood at worst.  Oh hey, I’m black I can’t be racist. Yet they would prioritize their race over others.  Just like most of the people on that train are doing, they just try to tune it out. It will pass in a short amount of time.  Holy fuck Ethan is a shitty interviewer  His friend opened the gate and muscles.  White fabric couch is very brave.  Hired a moving company.

Paying to memorialize an event of hate that led to 6 million of a specific group, and something like 12-18 million people of other groups, is considered a perk now? In what retarded world?!  Wow.

How old are the older c trains still in service?  I think I know that guy...  Let me guess...rent controlled / rent stabilized apt?

People do that in other cities too  They can get in touch with the uploader of a video to confirm details. If the uploader doesn’t reply, they can’t.\\n\\nNo media company worth anything is going to run with an unconfirmed YouTube video as a story. They’ll at least want eyewitness reports.  Kind of seems like an argument for disbanding the USA as a country more than anything else.\\n\\nMake NYC a city state. Free us from each other.  But... the urban areas want farmers to survive as well. It’s absolutely in their interest. So why would they pursue policies to destroy them?

I never said a living wage is $28 an hour. It\\'s not a job that takes 0 skill, you\\'re ignorant. Maybe you should do some more research on what the job requires and the dangers cleaners face daily before talking shit about other people\\'s careers. Yes, being a cleaner for the MTA is a career choice for some.  Theres more to it and other hazards the job comes with but I dont feel like having to explain myself every detail to the OP either.  That\\'s the electoral college, not the senate. Anyway, that\\'s also a trash system and you\\'re talking point is, again, demonstrably false. Candidates right now don\\'t campaign in New York because it\\'s entirely a \"blue\" state. If you remove the electoral college, they\\'d actually go to small towns in New York to win votes. They\\'d actually be forced to go towns in red states to win votes. If you in the big cities by the existing margins of democrats and Republicans in them (there are lots of Republicans in New York) guess what? You lose the election.  I was seven months old at the time and I too love photos like these!  I agree. I don\\'t need a fuck face senator from North Dakota determining laws for new York. Glad we agree the senate should be abolished.  What\\'s a law that a correctly proportioned senate would pass that would destroy farmers.  Non rapists usually dont get accused of rape cause they also respect boundries. \\n\\nIf you are everything \\'but\\' a rapist, you probably are awful to be around regardless. \\n\\nIt\\'s always the \\'nice\\' guy who is worried about defending himself isnt it...  The legs are a dead giveaway. Doesn\\'t match up.  Before Medicare, the federal government was in charge of providing states the funding to maintain mental health institutions for the severely mentally ill. With the passage/expansion of medicare, this funding was left out, leaving states to figure out how to pay for these mental institutions on their own. With no funding, along with poor mangament of said institutions leading to public criticism and dissaproval, states (including NY) somewhat silently started closing down these institutions. The severely mentally ill were displaced, left out to fend for themselves on the streets, packed away in prisons and squeezed into the few adult care homes which exist. [Riker\\'s Prison is now one of the largest provider of mental health services in the entire country.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/americas-largest-mental-hospital-is-a-jail/395012/)\\n\\nThe solution? Re-institutionalize mental health care for the severely mentally ill, and improve upon them so they\\'re not just shitty asylums.  So the 40% of people in small consistently red states who vote democratic nationally should get no representation or say in getting to \"live their life how they want\" seems pretty fucked up and shitty and not actually a good faith reason why people want the senate, which is actually to have outsized power in the hands of a minority party whose policies are loathed.  Go back to the_dumbass you fucking muppet.  I’d like to live in your world where there’s no trade offs or costs to policies - how’s the weather this time of year?  Lol I don’t think transplants will understand how bad nyc used to be. This Shit is a walk in the park now. You’re right.  What’s the process like for converting commercial space into residential?  basically the lowest population counties. Some of these only have 400 people in them.  What awaits you is cold, darkness and the gnashing of teeth for eternity.  &gt; I\\'m a much bigger fan of taxes on income and liquid assets than real estate.\\n\\nYes let’s tax actual work and investment rather than people free-riding off land and property values that only exist thanks to the massive government provision of infrastructure and services...surely this will discourage unproductive speculation and rent-seeking.  &gt; People are dying in the streets to protect your fragile cruel social system.\\n\\nPerhaps this is an issue for our public servants who are tasked with preventing those types of things? Feel free to tally up how much money it would take to prevent that and size it up against what the federal, state and city government spend here and every year and then see if taking “just a bit more” from taxpayers is the only possible course of action.  Gotta ride that DDT life  Or the city could leave macroeconomics to the federal government and simply provide public services as efficiently as possible; maybe they could do something really wacky like just give poor people money directly rather than creating new or larger civil service bureaucracies to “stimulate demand?”  Stay your add home.

The silence of the progressive SJWs is really amazing to witness. I guess now we know exactly where ‘intersectionality’ ends.  What are you implying?

If not, your opinion is invalid and amounts to suggesting minorities should lie back and accept a surge in hate crimes because some other unrelated crimes happen to be down. Well let me tell you something: that unrelated assaults may be down is no comfort to the Jewish people being stabbed, the Muslims being harrassed and spit on, or the black peoples being murdered by white supremacists in a fucking church. That you try to minimize the surge of hate in this country with a flippant  “shit used to be worse lol” attitude is a god damn disgrace. You are a disgusting person.  How the fuck?  People got pissed for me taking a BMX bike on the not completely full subway.  Fuck off  It isn’t all that common. But when you come across crazy you gotta keep it moving.  There\\'s a luggage store on 36 or 37 between 8th and 9th avenues that will hold your luggage for a few.

You know that juice that oozes out of the garbage bags in the summer? That\\'s what people\\'s brains turn into when they see a bike. You can bring a rabid pit bull on the subway with a baby\\'s dismembered arm chomped between its jaws and everyone will be all like \"awww, wook at the cute widdle pibble puppy, don\\'t snip those ears bro, is it a rescue, there are no bad dogs only bad owners\" even when it\\'s ripping someone\\'s face off. But 20 pounds of aluminum and rubber and people act like they just saw Jeffrey Dahmer.  Speak to Alexandra Ocasio Cortez.  Yup. I was working for a conservative Jewish client yesterday and the recent synagogue attacks were brought up (most of us on set were Jewish). He said he applied for his concealed carry license the day after the attack. Already owns a few pistols but had previously just kept them at home for defense, but now he doesn\\'t feel safe in Brooklyn.  Also she crazy.  /r/unexpectedpittbullrant  Urban areas prefer policies to support (cheaper food from) industrial farming, where people who actually live in these areas prefer policies that support small / family farms, for example.\\n\\nNot making a judgement on which side should win / which policies are correct, just pointing out one tension.  Headphones  &gt;YOY, shootings, felony assaults, murders, robberies and hate crimes are up. \\n\\nThey are up very slightly over last year and the year before which were historically low crime years. If you look at 5 year trends... 10 year... 20 year.... 30 year...  it is down.  Crime in NYC is lower than it has been since around the end of WW2\\n\\nThe drops in crime aren\\'t happening any more. \\n\\nThe only way you can make this claim is by comparing this year to two years ago which was historic.  And it is only up slightly over that. \\n\\n&gt;Second consecutive year of an an uptick in violent crime.\\n\\nVery slight uptick, yes.\\n\\n&gt;Saying \"crime is down\" is a nice political bluff to be able to say to instill a false sense of safety since it\\'s cherry picking stats at best/using misleading variables (e.g. \"down relative to X year\"), and a falsehood at worst. \\n\\nSo let\\'s us both be clear: over the last few years, crime in NYC has been lower than it has been at any point in 50-65 years.  Whenever I visit a foreign country it really makes me aware of the crazy entitlement of American drivers. In so many other places cars defer to cyclists and motorbikes and pedestrians because, you know, they\\'re people too and much more vulnerable. But drivers here act like they\\'re doing cyclists a favor by letting them share the road, but want to make it clear that they certainly won\\'t hesitate to commit manslaughter if a cyclist steps out of line.  Hard to pay attention when that guy is walking around the subway in just socks  She can\\'t be racist. She\\'s black.  Whoops, broke it on the way in!  Trump isn’t racist but I wish he was.  Yeah it\\'s weird. In developed countries, where understanding how stick shifts work is expected, drunk driving is legitimately frowned upon, and they don\\'t hand out licenses like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond 50% off coupons, motorists seem able to cope. In third world countries where perhaps things are a bit more cavalier, drivers are quite a bit more empathetic and courteous than you might expect considering the reputation of \"third world drivers\", I\\'ll leave the speculation on why that might be to somebody else.\\n\\nI\\'ve been told in Eastern Europe and Russia the drivers are equally as homicidal and hateful as American drivers, when it comes to pedestrians and cyclists. Never been and honestly I don\\'t have much interest in visiting places where people get vodka bottles bashed over their heads by random strangers for having the wrong skin color. So it\\'s obviously not *just* Americans who act this way but it seems like we could use better role models.  Bagels that fell onto the subway tracks.

I once moved all my possessions from Inwood to Washington heights, around 30 blocks on the A, by myself with just a granny cart back and forth over one weekend.\\n\\nThere was no furniture apart from one office chair, just things in boxes for the most part, but it was rough.

Can somebody please explain how we got here? When you consider that Jewish people were at the vanguard of the civil rights movement, allies with a capital A (before there was such a thing even, no one was was woke back then) actually dying for the cause of some  better future. And  here we are now. Strange days indeed.  Dammit, I love these pieces of crap. Most powerful A/C systems in the fleet. It was a refrigerator in these in the middle of summer.  1.  Punching one of those fake monks in the face. \\n\\n2.  Helping a tourist with directions. \\n\\n3.  Olive Garden in Times Square.  There are over 8.3 million people that live in the boroughs, and 1.6 million in Manhattan. If we all liked the same things, and recommended them to the 38 million tourists that come here every year, they wouldn’t be that fun would they? \\n\\nCheck the sidebar for general tips.  hahahaha. Little cuddly bugs came with it too.  Yes I\\'m very familiar with Ayn Rand\\'s work. You can get lost for a while in her trauma of living under a totalitarian state. \\n\\nNot all tax payers are hard working. That is a misdirection and you know it. \\n\\nHard work alone doesn\\'t produce anything. \\n\\nThere is a major and unnatural imbalance of our resources and it ends up killing people. The real violence comes from nature, and letting people die and starve like lower lifeforms just because they didnt have the same advantages that we have. \\n\\nThe world wont stop working if we had some more taxes on the ultra rich. I\\'ve seen enough families collecting cans to know that we are missing the forest for the trees on the real problem. \\n\\nSimple question, some hard working single tax payer becomes paralyzed (through no fault of their own) when they are 22. What does your ideal society do for them?  I would love if my city did that too, instead we only have \"passenger incident\" \"suspicious suitcase\" and \"technical issue\". \\n\\nThe only time they gave details was very funny (the train hit a boar)  No. Then they would have shot him instead of using a chair.  D\\'oh. Thanks  What silence? Cuomo and de Blasio literally announced an increase in police presence and held press conferences.  Don’t worry shall issue concealed carry legislation has been sweeping the nation and I think the state of New York could one day be forever by the S.C. to have this.  I love that statement \"WE ARE DIFFERENT\" like no you\\'re not you fucking cunt. We are all human beings and you\\'re the one acting like a crazy racist asshole...  Damn. The shitty part is all those kids look like they’re 11. So young to have this much hate in them.  Actually I *do* get it. I am 100% a city person. I’m just worried they won’t last or at least won’t be recognizable. \\n\\nLet’s take movies for example. Movie showings still sometimes sell out, but movie theaters have been closing left and right. There will always be some people who prefer going to a movie theater to watching at home. But at some point there will be so few theaters left that even people who prefer them won’t want to schlep across town to go. And they’ll get used to watching at home. And then a movie will come up that they really want to see in a theater, but there aren’t any any more. Or maybe there will still be one in Times Square showing Disney classics to tourists who want to see how people used to go to movies. \\n\\nIt feels like the same thing is happening to all ground floor retail at the moment. I prefer going to a shoe store to try on shoes before I buy them. But there are hardly any left because most people prefer the convenience of Zappos. So now I have to buy from Zappos too and more shoe stores close. Etc etc. \\n\\nMy concern is that ground floor retail is like one of those keystone species in an ecosystem. Some kind of small, numerous insect that no one really thinks about until its population crashes and all of a sudden a whole network of other species are impacted. If enough kinds of stores are outcompeted by online retail we will end up with whole streets of dark, vacant storefronts. The neighborhood looses that spark of vitality. Even the restaurants that aren’t competing directly with Amazon are impacted because people don’t want to walk down a dark, vacant street to get to them. Then we start losing the local restaurants. Sure, there would still be some big destination restaurants for special occasions and for the tourists. But at some point wouldn’t we all say “I live in a tiny apartment so that I can be close to the vital life of the city and the things I love to do. But the one concert hall left is half an hour away. And the one restaurant is half an hour in the other direction. And the only retail stores are in one big cluster and that’s forty five minutes away. And holy shit I already live in the suburbs but just in a tiny shitty apartment!”  Hey that\\'s not very inclusive of you friend.  Or you got targeted by a psycho. It’s not unheard off.  Seconded, stay home  If he\\'s innocent then he\\'s innocent, no argument there.  Why are you deferring responsibility away from yourself? We are all citizens of this fine country, do you just abandon any moral stake you have with your fellow man just because we happen to have a state? \\n\\nAre you ok with the way things are? Before we attempt to find solutions can you admit there is a problem?  \\'Not unheard of\\' is the consideration of  \\'nice guy\\' to accept the female experience in a way that is non committal and hard to be mad at. \\n\\nYou can keep it, thanks.  Imagine all the people  Or being genetically lucky with a strong mind and body. But yes almost no success has anything to do with the actual work being done. Is mostly environmental and contextual concidence.  You really don’t see anything wrong here?  Other incomes I assume. I’m thinking that they’re using it as a quick source of capital (instead of going to the bank and getting new loans or issuing bonds) rather than using it as a source of day to day income from rent.  This person being afraid to report the crime because of the new discovery law is insanely misinformed wtf. The fact that that little tidbit was included makes me think this is a fake to discredit recent criminal justice reforms.  What are you talking about? I really couldn\\'t care less about who you date - as long as both of you are happy, I\\'m happy. You look like a cute couple, have a good NYE.  True, if they were cops they would have gotten a free paid vacation and then the rape victim would agree to plead guilty to \"disorderly conduct\" so the cops could continue to do their cop shit.  This is textbook anti-semitism  Everybody does it. It’s a sort of Gell-Mann amnesia. “Fox/NYT is trash propaganda, but my news source is totally unbiased and accurate”  Nope  You\\'re delusional.  \\n\\n“You people!! Judaism is not a race so I’m not a racist.”  Cuomo first of all stop stealing MTA funds.  meanwhile there are 7 cops upstairs watching one turnstile  This is how the world is suppose to work\\n\\nWhen cops don\\'t do shit the people got to take it into their own hands  Yeah, sounds like Elon never lived in NYC and doesn’t know what he’s talking about.  The areas mentioned Bronx etc.. are areas that are high in taxes. They believe raising taxes is the way to go to solve the countries problems. So if they had the ability to push that type of policy across the board it would destroy small businesses/farms etc. that would be impacted.  The farming issues is just an example. People live different lives in the two examples in the picture. Imagine the people in all those rural red states controlling how you lived in the high populated cities. They would try and force policy that would also affect you probably negatively. Goes both ways.  How is he out of jail so fast?  Most of the non-transplants on this sub are too young to know how bad NYC used to be.  No physical evidence, sentenced 25 to life! How many other cases like this?

Is it an apartment that requires x times the monthly rent income to qualify and if you meet that criteria?\\n\\nWhile from your description that you paid more, but let’s just say if I make x times the monthly rent but the building requires more to qualify, if I still want to move in either I will need to find a guarantor for a fee or sublet from someone who is essentially taking the risk to me at a higher than market rate\\n\\nI have sold my rental so no longer am a landlord and for what it is worth because housing does not really have a set rate everyone pays a little different most of the time just like the person sit next to you on a flight might have paid more or less than you for essentially the same services\\n\\nI get it, it sucks that you find out that you have overpaid for the unit and basically it is up to you to move out in this case because if they can rent it out for $4100 why should they sublet it for less? Say someone come to you and offer 5k to rent from you would you do it and the building allows it?  Step 1) Your headphones should be in before getting onto the subway this is important.

When crazy people are talking, you don\\'t try to grab their mic.  It’s a state law.  As someone who recently left NYC for a decent sized city it is way different here. NYC is pretty unique. In NYC, You could make a decent living just getting free stuff and reselling it.  RIP Mr. Rat  You’re a fucking idiot and no one on the face of the earth cares what you think about anything. \\n\\nYour opinion means nothing to anyone with more than a 3rd grade education.  As far as I can tell bail reform wasn’t meant to apply to repeat offenders and was not meant to apply to things like simple assault/battery.  this is spot on  Based and nycpilled  Actually I just looked and there is someone claiming it below. And framing this incident as “someone standing up to their oppressor.” \\n\\nSo you’re wrong.  That’s why they usually run in packs like animals.  Indeed, and why should they? They represent people. They should, in a fair fight, be campaigning where the people are.\\n\\nPersonally I think any state with less than 3 million people can get by just fine with one Senator. CA should have 4 by comparison. NY, Texas, FL should all have 3.\\n\\nWhat we have now is a government being strangled by evangelicals in small states. It’s deeply unfair and has, with Trump, already led us to disaster.  Here\\'s an idea: 1 person = 1 vote  the holocaust is funny.  If you live in Wyoming and draw a circle that encompasses your nine million nearest neighbors, I guarantee that somewhere in that circle there is someone acting as foolish and ignorant as this person.  Which he defends and pushed for. Also it’s a city policy that will be giving away met tickets and other garbage to get people to come back.  It would be front page news all across the country. The news would be wondering “are white people the biggest threat to our safety?”\\n\\nI’m sure they’d frame this as “blacks bravely standing up to their oppressors”.  Doc review companies are a good way to get up here and get your foot in the door while you look for a more permanent gig.  This is kinda me.  Maybe rent will drop  His mannerisms? Dude got fucked up and has a concussion  There will be TONS of vendors in/around Times Square with anything you could want.  May even find them on the surrounding avenues.  When did this start?  Lmaoo step 2  This is literally front page news even outside of NYC. Maybe it’s my Jewishness getting to me, but I’m seeing posts all over social media about it too. Just my 2¢  Put this animal in a cell and throw away the key.  this is BS since you\\'re cherry picking rural counties across a dozen states. Northeast has some virtually empty counties as well  Am I the only one who finds this really disturbing?  Does anyone have any sort of explanation for this policy? How the hell did we get here?  This shit is hilarious.. Like \"Are you ready to be a good girl tiffany?\" \\n\\n\"Yesss\"\\n\\n\"We believe her.. Off you go now\"  “YOU WONT EVEN RENT TO US!”\\n\\n“I don’t even own a house!”  Look up crown heights riot. Its always been there.  Saw this once and I asked to sit on the couch. My aunt yelled at me in Spanish ... “CHINCHAS CHINCHAS” while I was on the couch. Ever since then I never sit on random people’s couches on the train.  Yep I read that idiots comment too. Just know that however stupid you thought that commenter was you’re no better. You have the same thing in common. Take some peace knowing that you’re both racist trash.  He started off by saying his a broke student so...  It\\'s not just a shitty inconvenience.  I was in and out of a pharmacy in 15-20 minutes because me having immunity means I won\\'t carry diseases to people who might be more vulnerable, or pass them around.  We also, statistically, can\\'t afford to miss work like people in the civilized world.  The only difference is that their NYC has a W call sign and LA uses a K and Sarasota is something totally different.  As a pedestrian I’ve seen cyclists make way more traffic incursions than cars, including dangerous moves like blowing through red lights as cars are coming. I guess it’s easier to maneuver when you’re smaller and can ride on sidewalks (if not legally), so some of them engage in really risky cycling behavior.\\n\\nIt’s really hard to feel sorry for them. The entitlement is from everybody*, not just drivers, and cyclists do get a pass for being better for the environment so I’d rather see more of them, but if you’re doing something dangerous and illegal and you get hit by a driver that legitimately did not see or expect you, it’s really hard to feel bad.\\n\\nI will concede that this city is not bike friendly in general, though.\\n\\n\\\\*I include my jaywalking self in this “everybody” categorization, mind you. I do try to be careful, but I’m in a rush, you know?  Imagine thinking housing discrimination is justifiable  I respect the hustle.  Okay but what could you so badly need *one* steel girder for?  Any suggestions on what might have worked here? I feel like every thought that immediately comes to mind would only add fuel to the fire.  Bitch what are you talking about Wyoming doesn’t even have 1 million people in its borders  What a couple a dicks  [I’ve had this tab open for almost a year.

Vote Republican.  Honestly, not sure. I feel like to keep her from just flipping out at you you’d have to do it in a way that partially sympathizes were her (so she doesn’t just treat you like your “on his side”). But with all the hateful shit she’s saying I don’t really see any way to meet her halfway that doesn’t involve being racist yourself. But I feel bad seeing the guy left alone to defend himself. Tricky and shitty situation all around.  Fantastic case of both-sidesism. A guy bringing a 47-inch children\\'s bike on the subway gets 10x the outrage as a guy bringing a 20 foot steel I-beam. A mode of transport that has killed, at best, 2 or 3 pedestrians citywide in the last 20 years gets 10x the outrage as a mode of transport that kills about a dozen people every month.\\n\\nBut, both sides, for sure.  Ya but you wont witness their shit. Standing shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of people a day you will :(  Hate crime is now a low level offense apparently  A while ago, I came to realize that it makes no difference what someone\\'s race, ethnicity, religion, etc. is.  All groups have racism in more or less equal amounts.  Most professional moving companies won\\'t take plants.

If it happened every day or during rush hour, that would be different.  Yes, that’s the point. The difference between NYC and elsewhere is not that the people here are different so much as that we are more aware of them.  Yuge  I think Potato Chip Guy-ing it is the only reasonable way to deal with this one.  It\\'s even better in the suburbs. We all furnished our apartments with stuff left out on the street when I was in college and many years after.  The ball drop is not a thing to do on NYE. it’s a thing to avoid.  That\\'s the thing, really. New York is super diverse and we\\'re all stacked on top of each other. Crazy shit happens. It\\'s not the number of people but rather the proximity.  All that work for a couch with a busted leg that they probably have no idea how to fix properly.  I hope you left the shrink wrap on. :)  I’d love to do the math on it, but I don’t have access to GIS at the moment.  Just get an adjustable shower head.

Some people sincerely enjoy being mad.  I forgot about potato chip guy! That\\'s a great idea.  I don\\'t disagree with you, but looking at it from his point of view this is a very scary time to be a Jew in Brooklyn. I understand why he thinks he needs to concealed carry even though I don\\'t agree with him.\\n\\nI really hope this violence isn\\'t part of a larger trend. Summer is going to make it a lot worse. Someone is going to get killed and I really don\\'t know what we can do about it.  The lady with the \"facepalm\" expression at the end...  Work smarter not harder. Kudos to them.  Is there anything you enjoy other than being a contrarian?  Imagine if some totally white dude would\\'ve stepped in and said \"chill baby, I know what you mean. I\\'m part black and I get this all the time too.\" 🤣  Well do what you think is the most fun. Have you gone before? Are you visiting?  LOL.\\n\\n&gt;\"Somehow this gets better. He transferred trains with the beam.\"  Don\\'t engage with the crazy any more than you have to ... pretend to argue, get off the train at the next stop, let her rant to someone else.  You never know what kind of weapon crazy is carrying.  Are you arguing that cyclists should be exempt from road rules or what...? I get you’re trying to r/enlightenedcentrism me on this topic and I think you should keep at it, and when there’s another surge of traffic incidents involving cyclist deaths in 2020, I’ll be sure to say “yeah sure that cyclist died but what’s important is that the cars are wrong.”  I mean, you can ride the bike, right? You can\\'t ride a 30\\' long steel beam. :)  Never engage. This is what happens when you engage. I\\'m positive some people literally go to the subway just to get people to trigger them so they can go off like this. Makes them feel big and noticed.  Phish at Madison Square Garden; good luck finding tickets though  Start singing Hava Nagila or Lo Yisa Goy el Goy Ch\\'rev.  Are you trying to deflect even more? That\\'s a rhetorical question BTW because the topic was steel I-beams vs a kid\\'s bike. But if you want to discuss traffic laws I\\'m happy to school you on that too. Twat.  No  That looks like an elephant\\'s cock.  Also, it\\'s not long enough.  DAS RITE  In NYC on the subway they aren’t drivers. Pedestrians hate cyclists too. It’s because we all aren’t taught he to coexist like the Danes or whoever.  My comment wasn’t about I-Beams though, jackass.  Once I brought my hockey bag on the train at 8pm at night and a woman started screaming at me saying she was going to call the cops on my sticks if I didn\\'t put them on the floor.  He\\'s not wrong about white women 🤮  Shhh.....that doesn\\'t fit the narrative!  Yea better than holding the train up.  He probably works for the Mayor  Sure. The sensation of putting on a freshly pressed 200-thread-count shirt right out of the dry cleaning bag, being enlightened by my own euphoria, spinning out 50x11, and eating babies (pairs great with ghemme).  [removed]  /r/BrandNewSentence/  Picture?  Cuomo and De Blasio  Orchids are petty af. Only plants I can never keep alive.  Never change E train. Otherwise known as the homeless express.

De Blasio  Shhhhh, NYC is the only place people take in free discarded furniture. It\\'s so unique and different!!  Get a handy at an amp.  &gt; The only people that think this are the racist fucking echo chamber on Reddit.\\n\\nAnd every professor and activist who is attempting to redefine racism as “prejudice + power”  Your username is strangely apt for this video.  If you want to see have the average young person believes go on Twitter. You\\'ll be kinda shocked by what your friends and acquaintances believe.  Shit. I\\'ve done that before, got a couch from Harlem to Crown Heights. Didn\\'t think it was a big deal. No one made a big deal of it.  &gt; war criminals\\n\\nYour hate on \"war criminals\" is likely misplaced, or you\\'re just an asshole.\\n\\nWhen your home is getting invaded, your family is being killed, your town is getting shelled, and you lost your kids except one daughter to enemy soldiers... and you have an opportunity to hit their fuel supply killing civilians but may stop the war, what would you do?\\n\\nLook at the Kurds as an example. They do what it takes to defend their homes and their families, international law be damned. And I respect them for it.  What fucking assholes.  Is this true?  If you see something, say something on Reddit. lol  As a frequent C train rider I have mixed feelings about these dumpsters being retired. However, I’m not seeing any other news articles confirming this.  More like black aggression against a Jew  No!  There are fucktards on all communities. You can point out the fucktard without trashing an entire group. If you do though, that would be racist. The fucktards don\\'t represent the whole group. But it also works the other way around - good people in a group doesn\\'t balance out or cover the fucktard. Meaning if the fucktard is trying to hide behind the good name of others in his group as if that gives him some weight. Meaning if a jewish landlord is racist and thinks the good name of other jews balances out his racism or something. lollll. or if angry black lady (although this lady doesn\\'t fit the profile) thinks her bad behavior is covered because she has any excuse or other.  Quoi?  Pussy pass  They\\'re represented on both ends of the spectrum. Look into the backgrounds of some of the most notable capitalists in the NYC and the U.S.  Marry rich, develop drinking/drug habits, overshare on social media, and constantly remind everyone of your influencer/socialite status.  Woke culture.  &gt; What\\'s the right thing to do as a bystander in this situation? Kinda just sit it out unless it gets violent?\\n\\nVery context dependent. \\n\\nWhat are you capable of? For most people I would advise staying out unless it\\'s either violent already and an emergency response is needed or it\\'s someone like that menacing a truly helpless person (I\\'ve intervened pre-emptively once, and it was when someone was screaming at a mother with a young child who was clearly terrified).\\n\\nKeep in mind if you step in you are now part of it. You ideally want to be trained to de-escalate, armed in case things don\\'t and fully capable and willing to use a weapon, and know how to handle this sort of thing in a way that comports with the laws on self-defense.\\n\\nIn short, you should probably be a LEO or government agent unless things go pear shaped immediately and someone\\'s life is in danger.\\n\\nThat\\'s the legal advice.\\n\\nIf I were to give you the advice one of my friends who lived in a truly fucked up and unsavory place (worse than anywhere in the US growing up) would give in this situation, assuming you had to intervene, it would be to take her down from behind with a solid blow to the head as she\\'s distracted screaming at this guy, then get the fuck out of there as quickly as possible. But he grew up in a place where gangs actually ran the show and the government was useless.  But that would be black people organizing to protest violence against black people...are you saying BLM should be protesting this too, or that there should be a Jewish group that organizes themself to protest in a similar way?  I grew up here and the only thing that stills shocks me is the early morning E train.  You forgot “carry a small, annoying dog everywhere in your Hermès bag”  Yet the R32 dumpsters keep on rolling.  Oh yeah.... I forgot.., the Illuminati..  A most excellent point!  the jews that stood with black people in the civil rights movement have almost nothing in common with orthodox jews or hasidim. these people are fairly insular and mostly disinterested in anything outside of themselves. \\n\\nnot a diss on them, i get it to a point. \\n\\non the other hand i think the african american community is mad because of how well organized the jews are at combining their efforts and goals to essentially take over a historically black community. \\n\\nif black people were as origanized the turns would be tabled  The R32s were always a better-built car. They’re more reliable than the R42s. \\n\\nRegardless, the R32s’ days are numbered as well.  Someone’s whose fashionable and well known in high society. Think Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton.  The R42s (and the similar looking R40 and R40M) always had excellent AC. The R42s were also the first fleet in which all cars were equipped with AC directly from the factory.  Uh no... it’s waspy real estate developers doing that  At least it was in his pants.  or summon the guy in the 8 ball jacket to bitch slap her.  &gt;You can\\'t ride a 30\\' long steel beam.\\n\\nnot with that attitude  I mean that’s just capitalism.  They are a group who are trying to make as much money as possible, just like every other group out there. They are just better at it.  Favorite memory might’ve been the free Dinosaur Jr. my friends and I went to down by some pier on the lower east side or all the times we spent taking bong rips by the waterfalls and lakes in Prospect Park  &gt;  Imagine the people in all those rural red states controlling how you lived in the high populated cities\\n\\nI don\\'t need to imagine it. That is the current system.  “Never argue with an idiot. They will bring you down to their level and beat you with experience”  Love this city!  Can anybody justify why this woman should be continuously let go?  doubt this woman has a job  AKA sticking one\\'s face in a fan.  Underrated comment  I noticed this too. It\\'s like if you want to include full states out west fine. But literally taking a speck here &amp; there East of the Mississippi? lol  Damn one of the kegs broke off  Kim\\'s not really New York socialite. Her dad was an attorney, not the great grandchild of the guy who invented toothpaste. New York socialites are the kids of old money and they tend to eschew reality TV-style celebrity, that way they can do all the drugs and hunt all the homeless on their private pedophile islands they want in peace  The most quintessential NYC part of the whole exchange lmao  I got a collapsible, convertible hand truck/dolly on Amazon for $55 which made moving immensely easier. The dolly in particular lets you stack boxes and push without tilting which is useful.  I’m hurt, idk why but the r32 is probably my favorite train. I take the A and C fairly often and I’m gonna miss them dearly when they’re gone  don\\'t be ridiculous. that\\'s just probably a live fish he caught that\\'s flailing around.  I was actually thinking beyond the ghetto in the ghetto (and ghetto is a word the Jews can own). We’ve of late had an attack on a place where Jews gather and in a gathering of Jews in the environs of NYC. Both perpetrated by black folks (though probably admittedly crackpots). What informed these people? It goes way back, Rev. Jackson and Hymietown come to mind....  That could be from a tv show.  1. Person off their psych meds ranting about God only knows what giving a sermon in the subway or in a park. \\n2. Pizza. Pizza is life. This is why our rats, raccoons,  pigeons (and people) all love the stuff. \\n3. Get the hell out of my way. If you\\'re going to go slow, or not walking down/up on the left on an escalator, then you are in the way. Get off to the sides. Also, DO NOT just fucking stop in the middle of a sidewalk or passageway unless it is an emergency. \\n4. Midtown blows. Especially during UN week. Fuck UN week. This also applies to \"gridlock alert days\" when all hell breaks loose between Thanksgiving and New Years.\\n5. Both Penn and Port Authority are their own special realms of hell. Bonus to Penn on all the pug fugly construction they\\'ve got up at present. \\n6. You don\\'t have to be native to be a NYer. If you can last in NYC/LI/Westchester for 15+ consecutive years on your own, you have become a NYer.\\n7. You go to another state and have snarky comments, onscene gestures, and a plethora of comments for other drivers who all seem to be \"Jersey drivers\". \\nThat is my version of a NYer. \\nFell in love with NY 1-23-99. Moved here in August 1999. Still here after all these years.  Were you wearing your Jason mask?  Some Jewish people. Some Jewish people were fighting as hard as they could against it. Because Jewish people are individuals and not an undifferentiated mass. I’m so tired of the narrative, even if it were true, that was a generation ago. We need to be focused on the ongoing civil rights struggles of today.  Hey there. You rock for preparing a detailed reply about how to document requests for change.  This is why I never sit or touch the bars on the end of train cars. I saw something like this when I was 5 and scared me for life.  Yeah only swing States should matter  the slap heard around the world  This square peg ain\\'t fitting in that round hole buddy.  So...making a sex tape makes you a socialite? BRB - looking for my camcorder.  ;)  America belongs in the trash bin of history, an utter failure of a nation.  Nah, man. That thing reeks post-game. I\\'d never pull it out on the subway, it\\'d be considered biological warfare and cause train delays  It holds its own!  I love the R32s. They’re very reliable for their age, and are structurally in excellent shape. \\nIn the hands of a good crew, they can be moved very quickly. It’s a good, resilient design. I actually like them more than the R42.  Someone told me once to put an ice cube on the plant once a week. Still died. But probably because I’m terrible at remembering what day I did it.  R32\\'s were built by Budd Co. they\\'re structurally invincible. \\n\\nif there was a company that still produced mechanical parts for 55 year old railcars, those 32\\'s could run forever and even outlast the stuff from the 80\\'s  that depends. if you are certified schedule 2 CTA, you\\'ll be qualified to hand anything that has to do with ACR. a step down from that would be BCH which means you\\'ll be tasked with HHI. most graduates take the route of GH because it\\'s a better stepping stone to get to DMS which pays like a YIN. so basically you\\'ll be making 45k.  I once saw kind of a super model carting a big fish on her back.  Just accepted it as a NYC thing. \\n\\nWas kind of a fashion statement I assumed.  Every time black people tried to organize, they were smeared and murdered (Black Panthers, Black Wall Street, Civil Rights movement, BLM). Otherwise they get co-opted and neutered.  This is awesome!  This shit has barely 50 upvotes my dude. The reddit crowd loves to ignore this. It’s so disgusting  That is disturbing.  Depends on the neighborhood.  Not at all. Those individuals who would normally vote democrat in a red state should also get to live their life how they want. Live and let live....mind your own business and all. Our government has become an organization who’s purpose is to limit people’s lives rather than support people and help them live the life they want. It should be there to help people and give them a solid foundation on which to live life their way. Doesn’t matter if you’re a lefty in a ‘red state’ or a righty in a ‘blue state’.  What does my personal moral stake have to do with the fact that people are “dying in the street,” when you’re calling for government action to fix it? I pay taxes, and people are still “dying.” Me paying more taxes isn’t going to magically fix that, and it isn’t a lack of government revenue keeping us from solving the problem. So what’s your point?  I understand her point that “Judaism isn’t a race” but also... totally not the point. Literally just semantics.  As much as I’m not a fan of the mayor, he and his policies has absolutely nothing to do with this mentally ill person being released again and again. Don’t comment just for comments sake and learn NYC history/criminal policy if you think I’m wrong.  That\\'s where all the resentment pretty much comes from  Plot twist, he escaped from Bellevue and is trying to get out of the straight jacket to jerk off.  I took a sociology class where that definition was introduced. I dunno, I kinda think it\\'s useful (or having a word that combines those two concepts is useful, whatever it might be). Plus, if anyone starts arguing that you\\'re using \"racist\" incorrectly, you can always turn around and say, \"Oh, did I say racist? I meant you\\'re a rancid bigot. I think we can agree on that.\"  I heard a convo about some rando girl\\'s custody issues and getting her baby daddy\\'s other kid from CPS becsuse the mom was unfit. I made eye contact with the driver in the rear view. He just sort if shrugged.  I like how she implicitly admits that she’s prejudiced (“You need to learn the difference between being racist and being prejudiced” or something close to that) but is willing to scream about how she’s not being “racist”. Oddly, in principle I happen to to agree with that position (i.e. prejudice against Jews is not part of an institutionalized system of discrimination based on easily observable features - at least not right now - and therefore is bigotry or prejudice but not racism) but I can’t imagine screaming it in someone’s face on the subway. Really a distinction without a difference at that point.  They transported a couch for $5.50. Good deal  In other words,\\n\\n&gt;Stay in your lane.\\n\\nsolid advice😂\\n\\n\\nOn a serious note though, people really do underestimate how vast this city is. It\\'s not Pittsburgh, there aren\\'t 5 top restaraunts, and we\\'ll all debate here which of the 5 you guys should go to. do your homework.  NYC has become way too soft on crime. Only a matter of time before this woman kills someone.  In this particular area of Brooklyn (Crown Heights) the tensions have been quite high because the orthodox Jewish community is the vanguard of real estate development and ownership.  they are from r/nycbike, don\\'t bother.  and on a A division train nonetheless  I dunno man. I agree in general but this woman sounded still reachable to me. She was speaking in complete, cogent sentences. She didn’t seem violent or unhinged. But her voice sounded like she was in a lot of pain. If LEOs got involved, I think we know how it would play out for her.  I’m not sure I’ve ever been on the R42 tbh. I don’t think I’ve been on the lines it’s been on since it’s usually running on the J, M, and Q but you’re right about the r32. Those things seem like they’d go on forever with proper maintenance  Here’s an interesting 5 minute video for you. It’s has more to do with presidential elections, but I think it’s still pertinent to our system as a whole. \\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/0Yqf-EHlTus\\n\\n\\nWhile the simplistic idea of 1 person 1 votes sounds equalizing, in reality it just takes away many peoples voice. Not to be an asshole, but you likely want it because it would benefit you. We should instead have a system that benefits us all. Our current one ain’t it, but neither is 1 person 1 vote.  YES STAND UP TO THE JEWS MY BROTHER\\n\\nYOU ARE FOOLED TO BELIEVE WHITE PEOPLE ARE OUR OPPRESSORS. JEWS CONTROLLED THE ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE AND CONTINUE TO MAKE A MOCKERY AND PROFIT OFF OF US IN THE MEDIA.  The worst system besides all the other ones  Probably a rape in the station.  No. They\\'re confusing two different things.\\n\\nWhen a twee coffee shop opens in Brownsville that\\'s white transplants from Ohio. They\\'re the ones who creating gentrification.\\n\\nWhile there are a high number of Jews in real estate, and many of them are scum. \\n\\nBut *almost everyone* in real estate is scum regardless of religion so it\\'s not like they\\'re doing anything different than anyone else. Which is not okay, but the point is to single out Jews as being particularly bad is not okay either. \\n\\nAnd it\\'s certainly not okay to go around hitting random people or yelling slurs at them in the street because your hate your landlord.  LET ME SCHOOL YOU  nope  This is exactly what the haves want: have-nots blaming each other.  I think he\\'s implying that it doesn\\'t happen because there no evidence that \"This happens all over the Bronx...\"  For sure. I meant to imply that none of this is smart with a person losing their shit.  There\\'s a new NYS law that\\'s going into effect on January 1 that prohibits cash-bail, because it is socially and economically regressive. Prosecutors and Judges have already adopted the new practice ahead of the law taking effect. That law requires that anyone not charged with a serious violent crime be allowed to be released on their own recognizance (as if they had posted bail).\\n\\nUnder the old law, the only thing that would keep this woman in jail during her pre-trail period for misdemeanor assault is poverty, which is why the law was changed. If this person had committed class A, B, or C felony assault, the prosecutor could have requested pre-trail detention. So either the prosecutor doesn\\'t think this woman committed a serious assault, or the prosecutor is intentionally charging her with a lesser crime in order to make a political statement. I don\\'t know which is true.  still sucks he got arrested and spent 4 days in prison.  Yes charges were dropped but he winded up losing his job  Fuck them — 2020 is your year to kick ass and turn shit around!  Uber surge pricing is really getting out of hand  I’m in the same position—alone and feeling poorly. I’ve had two family members in the past two years take the course you describe, however, and I miss them terribly. I hope you don’t do it.  Right, but at the same time, staying meekly silent while some crazy is being racist/anti-Semitic/hateful at you can be really bad for your own mental health. This guy shouldn’t have had to put up with that. That’s why it was great of Asma Shuweikh to jump in when that crazy was harassing a Jewish family.  This is just one example. The reality is that MTA construction projects costs 7 times as much as they do in comparable cities. The best explanation is corruption and bureaucratic waste, and it is a very serious problem.  White flight is one of the craziest sociological phenomena in the 20th Century.\\n\\nImagine having bought an apartment or house in Crown Heights in 1959. You’re mortgage would’ve even be paid off and the demographics of the neighborhood swung 40% in one direction; more if you somehow separate non-Jewish white.\\n\\nAnd it happened almost everywhere— the Bronx, Jamaica, Flatbush, Crown Heights, Detroit, etc.  Interest rates are anticorrelated with inflation.  Low interest rates encourages borrowing, which is equivalent to the printing of money.  If you’re invited to the Met Gala you are a socialite....  Da Joos TiNK dat DEY r SOOOO smaaaaht BUTTT shee JUS skooooled HIM  Is there some comment history here we\\'re missing? You level of rage here doesn\\'t line up.  Notice the little boy in the background. Listening. Learning. \\n\\nSad times.  but were those people naked while loading their furnitures on to the subway?  This. We try to understand people who act this way, as a natural tendency to try and label things.\\n\\nSee Occam\\'s Razor. No need to complicate things with *-ism motivations. She\\'s a wackjob. We can\\'t understand her behavior, because it will only ever make sense to her. That\\'s crazy for you.  72nd?  It\\'s true but more nuanced. Jewish realtors probably aren\\'t specifically trying to push minorities out of anywhere, it\\'s just that some minorities in NYC like black people tend to be much poorer, so policies which hurt poor people disproportionately hurt black people. Realtors are buying properties in poor neighborhoods, fixing those properties up (and often further subdividing them - so that a formerly 3 unit apartment becomes a 6 unit apartment for example), and then putting those properties on the market for more than people in the poor neighborhood can afford. Often those properties sit empty while landlords wait for tenants who can afford the increased rents. They are essentially betting that the neighborhood will gentrify.\\n\\nAs far as whether or not it\\'s influenced by racism, IDK. Anti-black racism is a real problem in the orthodox and hassidic Jewish communities though.  i actually think it has more to do with interests and goals. orthodox jews stick to the script, black communities undo themselves simply by not being a single issue tribe  This is why I love New York , you see things like this on the train and no one will bat an eye...\\n\\nIf this happened in Middle America, this would be front page news....  Which socialite?  Which store?  Typically means a professional rich person. Don\\'t work, live off of investment returns on your inheritance, reduce your tax liability to zero (I don\\'t work!!!), and be a general leech on society.  Left you a detailed reply in /r/asknyc  Source?  &gt; or the prosecutor is intentionally charging her with a lesser crime in order to make a political statement. I don\\'t know which is true.\\n\\nYikes, it\\'s so tough to have a humane system when professionals are acting in bad faith.  It’s a bit more subtle than that. The idea isn’t that black people can do no wrong because they’re oppressed (although obviously it’s been used in that way by people who either don’t or won’t understand). \\n\\nThe idea is that “racism” should be reserved for systematic and institutionalized repression of people based on easily observable characteristics. Other negative biases can be called “prejudice” “bigotry” or other specific names (antisemitism, misogyny, homophobia, etc). \\n\\nThe point of doing so is to highlight that (in the US) black people *are* racist *against blacks* because they have internalized the narrative of oppression from the larger society. For example, a little old black woman who crosses the street to avoid a group of young black men is racist in the exact same way that a little old white lady doing the same thing is. But there’s a qualitative difference between a black person saying “White people are the worst” and a white person saying “Black people are the worst”. The latter is “racist” because there’s power behind it (punching down). The former may be bigoted but it’s not “racist” because there’s no institutionalized power behind it (punching up). Better to have no punching at all IMHO, but I think we can understand the difference between punching up and down. \\n\\nI hope you find the above helpful for understanding even if you disagree with the premise.  How do you deal with it? Put earphones in and ignore everyone. And then move out of the city when you realize it is a dump and your quality of life will be much higher in other places.  Clear my throat so I\\'m ready to contribute my finest \"Worldstarrrrrr\"  &gt; They are just better at it.\\n\\nThey\\'re better organized, and insular. Good at making money (which is desired by almost everybody), but others can\\'t buy in. Exclusive groups are always despised by outsiders.  Love the guy at the beginning who helps just because he wants to  Step 1 - On the first Tuesday of November walk into a school,  then into a booth.\\n\\nStep 2 - Look at the options given so you choose your government leaders.\\n\\nStep 3 - Remember that anyone with a R next to their name is a racist, homophobe, sexist, misogynist, evil person because the media tells you so. Never mind that the person with the R may be the best person for the job.\\n\\nStep 4 - Fill in the circle next to all the D\\'s because if you dont and someone finds out they will label you a racist, homophobe, sexist, misogynist, evil person.\\n\\nRinse and repeat every first Tuesday in November.  Which are symptoms of single party politics and complete lack of accountability to voters. Governments run better when politicians actually have to contest real elections with the possibility of losing. These days democrat incumbents walk through primaries and general elections, and the only real contests are democrat nominations which are handled in the shadiest most nepotistic way possible. So, long story short is NY politicians are only accountable to democratic party bosses these days, which means we get screwed. I blame republicans for not putting forward any competitive candidates or providing sufficient funding to run a legitimate race, but also democrats for taking advantage of the situation to their own benefit  Very cool  Lovely  Ew think of all of the bed bugs and roaches that are in it  But they’re blocking the exits...  Based on your comment in another subreddit, I\\'m sure it was racist as hell.  Great argument.  The original video doesn’t seem to indicate any sort of mental disability, though. He was very deliberate in waiting to kidnap the girl he was after and feigning innocence after he failed. There’s a difference between malicious intent and mental disability that impairs perception, and using this as a reason to separate/criminalize all of the mentally disabled is a symptom of a larger hatred towards mentally disabled people in general.  Good points  Apparently stand around nodding and saying “she’s right”\\n\\nAlso for anybody that doesn’t know Judaism is not a race but Ashkenazi Jews are a race. Sephardic Jews are a race. I don’t know the name of the Ethiopian Jews but they are certainly a race. Because of seclusion Judaism IS A RACE  Ok here is the list of crimes that REQUIRE no bail, tell me this makes any sense. \\n\\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/WEezqZa\\n\\nHate crimes, crimes against children, arson, money laundering in support of terrorism?\\n\\nThe fact that she is unable to get out of jail for economic reasons is why we use economic reasons to keep people in jail. If you’re concerned that rich people get out when poor people are forced to stay, I agree with you, so let’s have a scale that makes it harder for rich people to get out on bail. But to require no bail? When public safety cannot be used as a factor in ny? This clearly is not the answer  That is a wild and inappropriate speculation  The religion isn’t a race but he is an Ashkenazi Jew and that is a race. I guess she means chasidim but as a secular Jew this is still a terrifying thing to happen in my city  But she pinky promised! You can’t break those.  Well now you\\'re being rational.  That\\'s not allowed on reddit, sorry.  I mean when you move your clothing is in boxes.. so obviously you\\'re going to be naked until you unpack.  Black far right wingers.\\n\\nThese are the black Isrealites  If he was white, people wouldn\\'t be blaming every white person in America and \"the white community\" for his actions.  It\\'s too bad the MTA will only purpose more buses which will only get stuck in traffic.  This video is old. I think this is from 2017 or thereabouts.  LOL no  I agree with you completely. Yesterday in a subreddit I had a man ask me if I attended an antisemitic black church after revealing I am black, despite me being a proud Agnostic everywhere.\\n\\nStuff like this isn\\'t going to help anyone.  Really depends on how well you budget, and what neighborhood you want to live in.\\n\\nYour best bet - Come visit, explore the city, and see if you would like living here.  I hate to say it, but the only way that these stupid anti-bail laws have a chance of getting repealed is if someone like this woman kills someone.  Why the fuck do you think this is acceptable?  At the risk of sounding rude, that mix is pretty common where I am (MA) as well.  Landlords generally require 40x the monthly rent in salary.  So you could qualify for 1,875 rent.  You could afford to live alone in queens , central brooklyn or upper Manhattan in something nice.   Possible to find something in a primo area but it would be very very small\\n\\n\\nWill likely need around 8k cash Upfront to secure and move into an apartment conservatively (first and last months rent , one month security , broker fee ).  I would urge you to browse subreddits that allow you to meet up with nearby redditors. I’m sorry you’re feeling this way, but taking your life is something that’s going to prevent you from enjoying everything past New Years and leave those who do care about you stricken with grief. You’re worth so much, and if you can make it past tonight there’s no doubt you can make it in 2020. Happy New Years Eve.  Thank you for your service.  You have mistaken my cynicism for acceptance...\\n\\nIf you grew up in NYC, you would understand what I was saying......  Did you apply for this position without doing any sort of research? NYC is much more expensive than living in Chicago (which is also a terrific city).  For $75k you will have a better overall quality of life living with roommates, as you won\\'t be able to get a place on your own for more than $1875 given the 40x rule.  It’s fine to disagree with how she approached it but what both of y’all said right there - that’s some racist shit  I don’t know what the actual percentage of commercial vacancies is in my neighborhood but let’s just say that it feels like way more than business as usual. Smith street, which used to be bustling, now has entire blocks of empty storefronts and many new businesses struggle for a few months and then shutter. There’s a very real trend here and it’s keeping businesses out.  Well, with an attitude like that you are sure going to make the world a better place.  You\\'re lovely.  &gt;  understand her point that “Judaism isn’t a race” but also... totally not the point. Literally just semantics.\\n\\nHistorically, it\\'s been treated as a race. Further, it\\'s technically ethnoreligious (like Sikhs). Like, technically anyone can be Sikh. But in actuality, if you are Sikh, you tend to be Punjabi.  Hi. I don\\'t treat anyone like dogshit unless they do it to me first. But I guess you\\'ve already made up your mind.  She’s obviously anti-semantic  The city is full of ghetto trash.  Are you a troll or an idiot?  she might vote democrat?  Wouldn’t this mean that anyone who assaults her would also be let loose? I wonder if this is what cops are secretly hoping for.  That man has *no* rhythm. 0/10.  Wow. Bold of him  meh  This is obviously due to white nationalism in Trump\\'s America tho.  Three or four generations, actually. Both sides of my family emigrated between 1910-1920 and lived primarily in ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Newark, NJ. Regardless, it\\'s incredibly insensitive to reduce everyone with a similar complexion to a monolithic group despite no shared history, culture or ties of any kind other than living in America. Sicilians have a history full of invading conquerors raping and pillaging at every turn and had their cultural identity stamped out centuries ago. We had our own language, religion, culture, etc. and have more in common with the African-American experience than the the \"white\" experience in this country yet I\\'m constantly told by people like you, the media, textbooks, etc how I\\'m responsible for the sins of someone else\\'s father.  We weren\\'t here for that shit and I refuse to be cowed into some sort of white guilt.  when I first came to the USA in the 80\\'s, the figure I\\'ve heard for new businesses failing was over 90% in the first few years  https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/ei45vd/just_some_guy_jacking_off_on_my_morning_commute/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf  Pulling the brake would force the conductor to come back there, rather than just keep hitting the close door buttons over and over.

Happy New Year.  Sure  In America, people are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  That\\'s because this whole video was staged. Why else would he have already been recording before the \"kidnapping\" happened?  Hipsters can’t be black??  Spot on  And they did it seemingly very quickly. Plus, like you said, tons of space in the train car.\\n\\nI don\\'t see too much problems with this, other than them leaving it right at the train doors.  That\\'s probably what killed it tbh. The ice cube marketing gimmick was made to make orchids seem like less work, even though they\\'re really not much more maintenance. Just water it with room temp tap water  Saw two girls(likely roommates) do the same thing couple of months back on J train. They seemed a little nervous when getting in, but the whole car just started laughing as if in on an inside joke, the girls relaxed right then. They got off after a couple stops. It felt nice to have been there.  I\\'ve seen this so often it doesn\\'t surprise me anymore. I\\'ve seen people move mattresses, tables, and more through the subway. What surprised me is the amount of passerbys actually help out each time.  **TOP DEFINITION**\\n\\n[**jerkstore**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jerkstore)1) a [**fictitious**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fictitious) retailer that sells \"[**jerks**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jerks).\" 2) a line that one [**imagines**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=imagines) to be the perfect comeback*1)* [***REILLY***](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=REILLY)*: The ocean called.

LET\\'S GO METS. LET\\'S GO METS.  But did they have to use all the racial slurs? Trump\\'s America is thriving.  You can do it, highly recommend a roommate  Anyone want to put odds on the number of days it takes her to get arrested again?  Group of future scientists right there no doubt about it. Thanks Drumpfs!  Bonus points for when there\\'s no room to even duck your head down and you close your eyes and imagine big open spaces until you get out of your stop.\\n\\n(fuck you E train)  Anyone who works retail will hate this. People who buy those 32 packs of water bottles flip out over the $1.60 charge, it’s ridiculous.  THE GOAT. HIP HOP in the flesh.  What’s the source for this list? How do we know this is legitimate?  Congratulations  And probably accurate. It wouldn\\'t surprise me if this is an attempt to kill the anti-bail bull.  I was with you right up until you called her ghetto trash. Yeah she is acting completely out of line and is being super racist. But it is probably because of a lifetime of tough lived experiences reaching a boiling point. That doesn\\'t excuse it, but it explains it. \\n\\nThis kinda shit happens because we keep treating people like they are trash. She was probably treated like trash her whole life and now she treats other people that way. Rise above. Break the cycle.  Weapons of any kind carried by civilians on the MTA are illegal.\\n\\nBased on what\\'s shown in this video, there was no call for violent intervention from a 3rd party.\\n\\nIt\\'s just a very stupid person, raised on bad ideas, repeating them in a loud voice.  The RNC would be throwing money down the toilet the way things are in NY these days, though.  How much are you comfortable spending on housing?   I would think of it as $80,000. and any bonus is plus but don\\'t include that in your salary unless you have it in the bank now.    \\n\\nFor $80,000 you can afford a studio in Manhattan--maybe a non-dreamy 1 bedroom (walk up etc).    You really shouldn\\'t pay more than half you salary on rent (although plenty of people do).    What is your take-home pay (ie after health insurance and whatever else you get taken out).  bail that scales with a persons income was struck down in court a long time ago.  Are you denying that? I also think the Hasidic community needs to.  So far as I can tell, all the offenses in the document you linked are either misdemeanors or non-violent felonies. So these are all crimes where bail should be offered anyway.\\n\\nRegarding the use of bail for public safety: I disagree. The original intent of bail was to ensure a defendant appears at trial. To use it to keep people off the street based on a the whim of a prosecutor or court is an abuse of power. I agree that people who pose a risk to the community should not be released, but this law doesn\\'t change that. At the end of the day, this woman slapped some people, and punched another, causing no serious physical harm. She doesn\\'t pose a risk to the community in the same way that the Hanukkah party attacker does.\\n\\nLast year, there were more than 43,000 arrests in NYC for similar misdemeanor assault.  Every time somebody\\'s leg gets tapped on the subway, your instinct is to pull out a video camera? I\\'m not buying it, the whole video looks staged.  Both are good; unless you\\'re Jewish then being in public is no longer safe, because since black people are the perpetrators nobody does jack fucking shit about it.  Guarantee whoever did would be charged with a federal hate crime law.  R32 forever!  She had 20 priors, admitted she did it and yelled \"f\\\\*\\\\*k you, Jew\" or something like that at the time of the attack.  .....and then they just let him walk away to rape another day......  Whole team should be locked up and never let out  Nope  Doesn’t have to be great if it’s true.  If she\\'s so crazy, why are there others silently nodding along with her statements?  Blow wind blow!!  Yeah but they didn’t have Netflix so I get it  Despite your sarcasm, you\\'re unintentionally right. Trump has led to increased racial tension and hate crimes. That means more attacks from people who feel empowered by him, and more from the people who are pushed to extremism by the first group.  Can someone explain the city’s assault laws to me? I do believe this woman deserves to be locked up, but my history in NYC (and a google search confirms), tells me that assault in New York requires physical injury.\\n\\nEven a punch to the face, if there’s no visible injury, won’t result in the police doing anything. I’ve always found this ridiculous, but if that’s true then I also don’t understand why this woman slapping people is getting charged under those standards. Is the hate crime aspect enough to change it?  Absolutely disgusting.  That woman should be ashamed of herself.  If this is correct, look at how far down your comment is.  At how we all want to engage and debate over something that, potentially, is years old and predates recent incidents that this is clearly trying to fit the narrative on.  Doesn’t make the actions in the video right in any way, but talk about not doing our research.  Just dreadful.  I hope Trump personally apologizes for each of the recent anti-semitic attacks in the city.  The list is posted on an unofficial Queen\\'s DA website:\\n\\n [http://www.queensda.org/ror\\\\_maps/New%20Bail%20Laws%202020.pdf](http://www.queensda.org/ror_maps/New%20Bail%20Laws%202020.pdf) \\n\\nI don\\'t trust the source either, but the list does appear to be non-violent felonies and misdemeanors (violent or otherwise), which is consistent with the new law.

Tickets here: [https://www.musicinnlive.com/tour](https://www.musicinnlive.com/tour)  That lady needs to get laid.  I get the academic distinction between racism and prejudice, but in arguments like this people use the distinction as if it makes them correct or makes their prejudice not as bad.  It\\'s just stupid.  Arson and money laundering for terrorists...petty crimes in my book!!!  Why is this about the \"black community\"? Was the Pittsburgh shooting about the \"white community\"?

Obviously I’m speaking re the New York black community  I can\\'t help but think that you\\'re under the impression that your sarcasm throughout this thread is clever. \\n\\nIt\\'s really not.  Elon’s billionaire-worshipping cult is weird.  Boots does not seem too concerned  Do you want to live in NYC? I say if you have no mouths to feed, go4it. If you hate it move back.

You might even be able to afford to grab some advacado toast here and there.\\n\\nI moved out here 10 years and had no idea what I was doing. I still don\\'t. The smartest thing I have done is deliberately stay blissfully ignorant of that fact.  Totally agree. And I think she almost admits she’s being prejudiced in her rant.  thanks. I actually get many of them — the order of the list seems to put the benign ones on the bottom which biases the list — but I’m a little surprised burglaries are included.  Yeah, plus you’re then into a conversation similar to the wealth tax—an heir could get arrested and let go w/o bail bc their “income” is practically zero, but they’re actual wealth is enormous.  I have issues with that article as well, because it doesn\\'t really do a good job looking at the big picture of construction in NYC or agency construction in general. \\n\\nSecond Avenue Subway, East Side Access and the 7 train expansion all started in 2007. Simultaneously, the city has been digging a tunnel deep under Manhattan for decades (Water Tunnel #3 - still not done, but soon). This lead to a drastic labor shortage since the market for sandhogs isn\\'t that big typically and all of a sudden, it expanded DRASTICALLY. \\n\\nOn top of that, at least with East Side Access, whole years of construction were wasted as territorial disputes between Amtrak and MTA bogged things down. Amtrak not allowing MTA access to rails or allowing disruptions of service are all increasing costs and construction time. \\n\\nAdditionally, the article fails to take any consideration of geology and execution of work and the resulting costs of those. London sits on a clay soil known as London clay which is noted for being capable of holding shape very well during excavations (not necessitating the use of constant shoring as you go) as well as being naturally waterproof. Paris, similarly, has geology very conducive to boring and drilling since a lot of the city sits on top of limestone (ergo, Plaster of Paris). NYC, on the other hand is on top of hard ass metamorphic rock that while being hard is also supremely riddled with discontinuities, preventing fast drilling and necessitating the use of copious and frequent shoring in order to prevent cave ins. \\n\\n\\nIt would be ridiculous to claim that there\\'s no corruption, no graft or no systemic problems with the MTA and the way they do business but to compare the construction between NYC and other cities without examining the full picture is not going to produce an accurate result and NYC is going to look terrible by comparison. \\n\\nAlso, and finally,  until the funding for the agency is set up in a way that they don\\'t have to spend their own money and issue bonds before state and city contributions come in, the total actual cost of construction is going to be much higher than anywhere else in the world by a large margin. \\n\\n\\nI\\'ll give you an example: as per the article you linked, the east side project came out to cost 12 billion dollars as of the writing of the article in 2017.  The first phase of SAS started in 2007, completed in 2017 and cost 4.45 billion. 7 Train extension started in 2007 and opened in 2015 at a cost of 3.15 billion dollars.\\n\\nSo, in the span of 10 years, MTA spent 19.6 billion dollars on those three projects from their capital budget and had outlays of 22.881 billion dollars in debt service from their operating budget to fund the capital budget. That\\'s crazy. MTA\\'s construction costs are high, for a number of reasons, but their lending costs are even more absurd, and they\\'re there getting bigger and bigger, every year, as part of the operation of the agency, all thanks to how the funding for the agency is set up.  Really wish there was some commentary to this or at least wish he made some silly noises while doing it.  Black/Jewish tensions are not new: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown\\\\_Heights\\\\_riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Heights_riot)  Totally.  The clever comments are clearly those who blame anti-semitic attacks by black youths on the current administration.  **That\\'s** real insight!  Republicans dug their own hole. Don\\'t blame the media.  Except they do since he pushed for them. HIS policies are the ones giving these lowlifes Mets tickets to return. Don’t bother commenting if you’re not going to learn.  If I thought of an actual helpful solution, and then I did my very best to think of the exact opposite of that, I might come up with this article.  it\\'s definitely mostly overly PC white people who say this. It\\'s a belief based on one specific definition, which is used to win this specific argument. Essentially you can\\'t be racist as the oppressed toward the oppressor. I do understand this, but in reality there are many definitions of racism and determining whether or not a situation or remark is racist largely depends on the context.\\n\\nThe reality is, while historically these facts can be argued, who suffered the more recent atrocities, genocide etc... currently black people have it much worse off than white presenting Jewish people, and I would say that\\'s mainly due to the color of their skin. \\n\\nThis woman yelling on the train is frustrated that this clearly white man is bringing up racism against him. She really shouldn\\'t have brought Judaism into the argument. That is what makes her statements prejudice imo. If she had stuck with the color of their skin I would tend to agree with her, although not with her approach but I can\\'t begin to understand the frustrations of black people so i\\'ll reserve judgement without more context.  I’m with you here.  This city has done next-to-nothing to help the people who actually contribute to the city’s well-being; I.E. paying taxes to support our incredible police force, firefighters, and supporting our local economy, but when it comes to *criminals* who have committed crimes against innocent people, we should spend money to rehabilitate them?  How about, forget them, and focus on the people who make a difference to the wellbeing of our community?  So many forget that not all disenfranchised people are criminals.  It is a choice, or it is mental illness.  We shouldn’t reward a choice, and we shouldn’t have people with such an illness on the street.  Crimes like kidnapping and rape don’t need rehabilitation.  And, hell, crimes like\\ndrugs and theft don’t need lesser penalties, they need more.  So people will actually not want to indulge in them.  What you mean like having mayors who wore blackface or maybe a klu klux klan outfit (he couldn\\'t remember which) and still being the governor of virginia?  She was just trying to come off as intelligent, but instead came across like a fucking idiot.  exactly why \"if this was a white person\" statements make 0 sense  I wonder why around NYU. Is it because students who move out from their dorms just trash their furniture instead if bringing it cross country to their home?  When is Donald Drumph going to apologize for his black supporters attacking random jewish people in NYC?  If you were simply to plot historical inflation rates and historical interest rates, you would see that they are in fact highly correlated. Like, insanely well correlated.\\n\\nThe reason is as I gave above: a bank won\\'t make loans at a rate below inflation, and people won\\'t borrow from banks if the interest rate is too far out of line with inflation (plus the return they expect to earn on their investment). \\n\\nYou are right that there is also an anticorrelation effect, but (1) this is causal and has a lag, (2) it is not a direct correspondence as you imply, and (3) getting interest rates and inflation out of sync for policy purposes has to be a temporary measure or you will crash your economy. Paul Volker deliberately raised interest rates in order to lower inflation, but by doing so deliberately caused a recession and he knew he had to bring back the interest rate down to something in line with inflation once the beast was tamed, or it would keep damaging the economy. You can\\'t sustain the divergence of the two, and it only happens at all when government initiates a major fiscal policy change.\\n\\nYes, lowering interest rates does increase borrowing, and it in-effect increases the money supply, but it does not necessarily increase prices. We\\'ve had far more growth in the money supply than we have had growth in prices, and there is not a 1:1 correlation between the two. Just look at Japan, with negative interest rates. By your logic, it should have runaway inflation. Low inflation causes low interest rates (positive correlation). Sometimes, governments force even lower interest rates than the market would require in an attempt to create economic growth, and sometimes this results in higher inflation too over time, but not always.\\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart\\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/2497/historical-inflation-rate-by-year  It helps when you don\\'t think in shitty memes and shittier sarcasm.  doordash  Not suggesting this, but I have seen people physically stand between 2 people having a confrontation to diffuse the situation. Not doing or saying anything, simply standing in the way.  It\\'s all about whether or not the crime is violent. Burglaries are by definition nonviolent. Robberies are usually violent and are definitely felonies, but the specific instances of robbery listed on that sheet appear to be the non-violent variety. I\\'m not a lawyer--I\\'m just reading the definitions here:   [http://nyscriminallaws.com/penal.law/article160.htm?zoom\\\\_highlight=160.10](http://nyscriminallaws.com/penal.law/article160.htm?zoom_highlight=160.10)  100% agree always ignore  Pedestrians are pretty much exempt from the road rules and cyclists pose nearly as little risk as jaywalkers so yeah I don\\'t think they should be a priority for the NYPD either. Unless you want the city to step up jaywalking enforcement too?  Of course. Now that someone has called you out you change what you said. How convenient.  Forcibly convert them, easy! \\n\\n/s  The media  They are a steadier ride than any of the r68s and most of the 160s, it\\'s nice to not feel like youre wobbling.  Who said those were his supporters? I certainly didn\\'t.  Nothing? What else would you do with a stranger fight. Ignore let them sort it out  Unsure, article is not clear about it.  \\n\\n&gt;Scallan said. “Some of them are making that much every day.”  &gt;\"...it has nothing to do with the fact that she\\'s Jewish, I just helped a lady,\" Khalifa said.\\n\\nDecent people don\\'t focus on labeling people just to divide them up for profit, unlike ABC7.  You\\'re attacking a foundational principle of intersectionality, an academic movement championed primarily by white feminists and gender studies professors. \\n\\nThey will tell you that racism = prejudice + power. \\n\\nIntersectional Feminists believe that blacks are an oppressed group and therefore lack the power component of racism, making it merely prejudice.\\n\\nThat\\'s also why Jews have been thrown out of the intersectional coalition, because they have been deemed to be too powerful to be victims.\\n\\nIt\\'s all pretty fucked up, yet you see this entire philosophy being acted out on the 4 train.  I respect the author and his contributions to the city as a NYPD official.  That’s a brave job with more exposure to crime than any of us see, and I don’t know that there’s value in disagreeing with his perspective.\\n\\nIn practicality, are these crimes growing in frequency, or is the media coverage growing in frequency?  And is there a growing pattern of crimes being committed by certain types of people (serious question) against Jewish people?  I’d think there’s value in even helping to understand WTF is going on before our solution is to jump to blame the court system or De Blah.  Best I’ve heard is that people are mad that Jewish people were outpriced out of communities like Williamsburg, and they moved to other neighborhoods where they have outpriced the very people committing crimes against them.  If that’s the case, that’s not an overnight thing.  That’s been happening for a decade.  Why are people up in arms *now*?  Been alone in holiday for 10+ years, I just stay in my apartment and cook something watch movie and youtube crap on my pc. Hey at least you don’t have to work  Clearly, they are fans of Broad City [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/k9luzcq.png) [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AAE5h8z.png) [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/o9q7rxE.png)  This guy new yorks  i hate the semantics of \"it\\'s not racist. that isn\\'t a race\", like there\\'s anything substantively different about hating someone of a different race vs. hating someone of a different ethnicity  The debt service thing is also atrocious for sure, I\\'m not defending that.\\n\\nI agree with you in parts, but I am really sick of the \"NYC is just different!\" excuse from politicians. The high costs are really not justified, especially for ESA. Why did we have to build an entire new station cavern beneath a station that is way under capacity instead of connecting the LIRR tracks to the GCT lower level?\\n\\nI don\\'t think most of the corruption is in the MTA itself btw, but I think their bid system encourages corruption within their private contractors. When the private contractors negotiate with their unions, the MTA is not in the room, even though it ultimately pays the bill.  I\\'m just really curious how your brain works that you can link Donald Trump to a gang of black teenagers beating the shit out of Jewish people in NYC. It\\'s incredible, really.  The other day I was on a two-way street in Brooklyn and these two drivers both double-parked at the exact same spot in the street, completely blocking the flow of traffic. They were both sitting there for like 5 mins being like \"I\\'ll just be a minute!\" while everyone else waited. They couldn\\'t be bothered to stop 10 ft further from their destinations which would\\'ve allowed traffic to keep moving.\\n\\nDrivers in this city/country really feel like they are entitled to stop wherever is convenient for them, no matter what... \\n\\nThere\\'s a big bike lane near my apartment that\\'s on a fairly busy commercial street and cars will just drive down the bike lane and completely block it so they don\\'t have to, god forbid, park around the corner and walk a few extra feet. Cyclists have been killed on that street too after being forced out into traffic. But the NYPD never tickets any of these assholes...  I agree if the situation were that she was harassing an individual or focusing her comments towards anyone specific but she wasn\\'t. This person involving themself in the situation, is not always the safest approach. If someone is looking to start a fight, I wouldn\\'t suggest giving into it. People are crazy and you don\\'t know if they will get violent or have a weapon.  This is an old video. Flame fanning to post it now considering the recent news stories.  Take my upvote.  Yea, I get that’s how they decided to draw the line, and I guess if you want to make this reform you have to choose a clear standard.\\n\\nBut home invasions are inherently dangerous and easily lead to violence (one of the reasons some states permit occupants to repel a burglar violently).\\n\\nAssault in third degree is on there, which still requires causing injury to someone. Just because injuries are minor and no weapon was used doesn’t seem to count as non-violent, although jts certainly less violent.  I grew up here and I have never seen a person jerking off on the subway.  I’ve seen some weird stuff, but not that.  Now can we please get back to blaming the mayor and his lax policies that are allowing homelessness to run rampant in the subway?  He’s been mayor for years; what happened in the early years of his tenure where this wasn’t happening?  Trying to put the blame on the Trump Administration is both lazy and simplifying what’s happenings. Please grow up and realize things are more complicated then what you see on TV.  No, I’m saying that if the roles were reversed (white/Jewish violence against blacks) there would be protests and riots.  Why not both?  Why are you people obsessed with TV? You realize that mostly only applies to Fox News viewers, right?  Where\\'d you get those clothes from, the jerk off store?  God damn black people are racist as fuck  damn on the 3 train they better not be going into the city  Haha  Trump empowers white supremacists. Black teenagers say \"America hates us and we need to protect ourselves\" and join gangs with more fervor than before. Then they say \"hey look, a rich white guy who probably voted for the guy who inspires white supremacists, let\\'s get him.\"  Perhaps this is why the USA has a bicameral legislature.  &gt; Assault in third degree is on there, which still requires causing injury to someone. Just because injuries are minor and no weapon was used doesn’t seem to count as non-violent, although jts certainly less violent.\\n\\nIndeed. As you said, you have to draw the line somewhere. Third degree assault is a misdemeanor. It does include harm in the definition. The definition for second degree assault includes the phrase \"serious physical injury\". Second degree assault is a felony.  Also helps if your argument isn\\'t batshit insane.  Shut the fuck up  Damn - last of the St Louis car co railcars\\n\\nI like the r40 and r40m more (maybe because motormen got them up to speed on the B) - but I\\'ll def miss the giant windows and those flatish seats\\n\\nR32s are great - they\\'re just really tired at this point  Because before Trump was president, black people never joined gangs. \\n\\nAre you listening to yourself right now?  Yeah home invasions are incredibly dangerous. First thing I’m going for is anything I can use to protect myself  and it’s just me, imagine if your child was in the next room sleeping.  Definitely not daily  $400K is poverty wages, you’ll barely be able to afford a closet in some rando’s basement in Queens let alone an actual apartment. If you can’t make at least $750k out of college here you might as well stay in Ohio or wherever you are.  Such rationalism, such coherence, such matchless introspection and logic.\\n\\nIf only you were an all powerful dictator able to rule us all, I\\'m sure the planet would be in perfect peace and prosperity.  hmmm.., THE NARRATIVE...  Saving this one for my next subway argument  Yes. Between blacks and Jews.  Is this not between blacks and Jews?  Context is important. The OP should have mentioned that this video is old. It\\'s quite possible that they know that, but decided not to disclose that for their own reasons. \\n\\nI agree that it doesn\\'t make the actions right. If anything, it shows that the attitudes that have exploded this month have been bubbling under the surface for a while.  &gt; Only cities should have say in our elections\\n\\nAmazing how you managed to spin the idea that votes should be equal regardless of where you live as \"only cities have a say\".  I\\'d upvote this twice if I could.  People can’t accept the truth, SAD  That all have the same 7 logo, I think Detroit might have an ABC7 as well.  If we enforced turnstile jumping this guy would have to jack off in the cold.  Weirdly enough, there\\'s actually some dispute on that point:\\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/12/19/is-judaism-an-ethnicity-race-nationality-trump-signs-an-order-provokes-an-identity-crisis/  Fair enough  Presumably, that is all evidence that can be used against her in a court of law.\\n\\nMeanwhile, were you there?  Did you hear her say that stuff?  Or are you taking the word of law enforcement and the news media that that’s what happened?  Due process exists to prevent a police officer from making up a story about you and putting you in prison.  If the case against her really is as strong as it seems, it should be an easy conviction, at which point she will be proven guilty.  Get a 6 pack and play Civilization 5 for 9 hours in a row.  She did happen to offer to *take him to school* several times.  It\\'s blacks on Jews, if you want to ascribe it to entire groups.  If you don\\'t want to attribute the attacks to an entire group of people, \"attacks on Jews\" would suffice.  One thing it\\'s *not* is some kind of bi-lateral dispute, where both sides are perpetrating hate crimes.  Then she\\'ll be found guilty in court, and until she\\'s found guilty, she should have her liberty.  I’m in my 40s and have a standard American accent. My family is zero percent assimilated and I can’t speak to my parents in English without feeling weird.\\n\\n I’m mainland Chinese and this is true of most South and East Asians in the nyc area, I’ve never spent time outside of nyc for protracted periods.  Having the President tell minorites to go back to where they came from want that helpful.  I feel stepping in dog shit on the way to work is in there too.  Judging by the red outfit he is mentally retarded.  \\nEasy as that.  I did not notice. I think that was the intent.  Yes, they are.  But in every other state, they’re still held to bail limitations before going back on the street.\\n\\nWhy couldn’t this be sensible?  Like, if you commit a crime that doesn’t impact other people, you would fall in this new bail-less law?  If you’re in possession of heroin, that’s not really my problem, and impacts you.  If you’re vaping pot in your apartment, that’s not really my problem.  If you’re smoking pot in a park with children around, that impacts me and my children, and that’s a choice that deserves punishment.  If you scream an offensive slur, that impacts the person you yelled it at, and you shouldn’t be out on the street.  Nah she’s probably just a piece of shit  That\\'s not remotely what I said. But since you were clearly incapable of reading my comment before, I won\\'t waste my time repeating myself.  &gt; But I don’t see this as a good change for those living in western queens. Seems like they’re creating more unnecessary transfers on bus lines in western queens.\\n\\nExactly! I really don\\'t like how they cut off the Q52/Q53 bus route between Roosevelt Ave and Woodhaven Blvd.  KFC obviously  Fios 100%  That steering wheel will smell like gasoline for years from here on. \\n\\nMaybe this explains why every car in the hood, old or new has a $7 steering cover.    PI associate level or ng?  What a generic reply. I could have said literally anything whatsoever and your comment would have been just as relevant (or not). It\\'s functionally the same as if you didn\\'t respond at all.  Bail is about pretrial detention. No one who is held on bail has been convicted of a crime. Bail reform does not mean that there\\'s no consequence for crime, it just means that you can\\'t be deprived of liberty until the trial (which can mean months of pretrial detention). \\n\\nPretrial detention fuels coercive plea bargaining, a major source of wrongful convictions:  [https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/prisons-are-packed-because-prosecutors-are-coercing-plea-deals-yes-ncna1034201](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/prisons-are-packed-because-prosecutors-are-coercing-plea-deals-yes-ncna1034201)  Yeah, none of my Dominican friends talk like that. It’s either a foreign accent or standard English- and I’m in my 40s.  Glad to see there is some attempt at feel good news. All the rest of r/nyc is foaming at the mouth with anti-black sentiment over the recent anti-Semitic attacks... seems like the agenda is designed to fight hate with hate rather than unite against anti-semitism and hate crimes  Whereas your responses have been **so** full of substance, right?\\n\\n&gt; It helps when you don\\'t think in shitty memes and shittier sarcasm.\\n\\nWhat is it like being a disgusting hypocrite?  Agreed.  Or, potentially, being molded to fit a certain narrative.  I don’t know if these crimes are increasing in frequency, or if the frequency has always been there and being covered a certain way in the media.  But context is totally important.  Agree on Fios.  I never had any issues with Time Warner/Spectrum, but fiber optic has its advantages as in infrastructure over anything else.  But for what reason?  Scroll up and look at the comment you\\'re replying to. Someone asked a question and I gave an answer. Your inability to read is not my problem.  &gt;It\\'s blacks on Jews, if you want to ascribe it to entire groups.\\n\\nBoth are true. And my sentiment was that I am especially sorry to see both black people and Jewish people involved \\n\\n&gt;One thing it\\'s not is some kind of bi-lateral dispute, where both sides are perpetrating hate crimes. \\n\\nFor sure. I never suggested it was.  It is not the Federal government\\'s responsibility to get a state\\'s transit system running. It is the state\\'s responsibility to get its own affairs in order. If NYC needs a better transit system, that is the city and state\\'s responsibility. Not D.C.\\'s.  Not sure why everyone in this thread is acting like New Years Eve is end of days stuff. Obviously don\\'t do the ball drop. Just try your hand at a bunch of dive bars (and go relatively early because of your ID situation) and hope for the best. Worst comes to worst you get shut out.  Any statistics on what the percentage of wrongful convictions are?  I wonder how many people are being held “unfairly” because they can’t afford bail versus how many people are being held and then committed of a crime?  Three-year-old story.  What you don\\'t understand is that this guy literally loves watching guys jack off on the subway, and he takes a smug satisfaction in looking down on people from functional, sustainable societies.  While I have my issues with the Post, this editorial lays out clearly where NY pols have failed to address systemic issues that have resulted in a surge in anti-Semitic violence in the city. I wear my Judaism as a badge of pride, but lately, I\\'ve felt increasingly aware of attitudes of resentment and discrimination toward Jews across the country. New York City should be at the forefront of combating antisemitism, not stuck grasping for words in the aftermath of such attacks  You directly drew a correlation between black gang membership and Donald Trump. That is exactly what you implied, that black gangs were some kind of neighborhood watch organization to protect them against white Trump supporters.  So your disgusting hypocrisy is in response to what someone ELSE posted.\\n\\nOh that makes it perfectly OK then!  Are the mentally ill a huge voting block for democrats?  If this shit keeps happening I\\'m going to start voting Republican.  There are very few conviction integrity units in prosecutor offices, so we don\\'t know. People take the plea and serve out their sentences.\\n\\nIf you\\'re in jail for months, and you are offered a plea of time served, and you take that plea, then it\\'s going to look (in the statistics) like you were guilty of the crime that you were charged of.

You can go from bar to bar till you find the place that you like.  I think that would be the cheapest.  He actually didn\\'t. He has repeatedly stated that appropriate bail reform requires a dangerousness consideration for judges. He has asked for that repeatedly.  Control narrative, much like the rest of this site.  Republcians: \"Sure, we keep voting for inherently racist policies, but  why does that mean we\\'re racist?! hur dur libtards.\"  i dont know, the original video after he tried to grab the girl he just sat there like in a bewildered state.I would assume most failed kidnappers would\\'ve ran but  I get the vibe off him that he\\'s fucked in the head. Not excusing this behavior I dont think that fucker belongs on the street but whether its in a prison cell or a padded room is another debate.  Poor attempt at back-pedaling. Your comments make no sense, but I think you probably know that already. Because now that you\\'ve embarrassed yourself, your only strategy is to say absurd things until I give up on you. \\n\\nWell, I think I\\'ll follow your parents\\' lead and give up on you early. Seems like the prudent choice.  Let\\'s be real here - he told people who are in this country **illegally** to go back where they came from. He is not telling **legal** minorities to do this.  I said \"with more fervor than before\". \\n\\nReading is hard, huh?  Like many topics, it’s obviously complicated.  I’d just think, in the current state of affairs in NYC, we should err on the side of stricter punishments, not lesser.  We need to go into 2020 in clean-up and not tip-toeing because we’re afraid of offending people.  If NYC sees drops in tourism because of safety concerns, that creates a rippling economic impact that hurts the people who live here.  The safety of the people who contribute to the city should be paramount.  &gt; dystopian hellscape \\n\\nLOL, can you be any more melodramatic?  Maybe a showtime kid will kick him in the nuts.

Lol no it’s not  Just like with The Night Stalker!  that\\'s not how freedom of speech works  Respectfully, and I appreciate you having the decency to have a strong source to support your claims, would you genuinely trust one report from the court system who falls under the jurisdiction of the state that passed the law as the definitive claim that that’s the case?  If it hasn’t caused a crime spike, it also hasn’t caused a reduction in crime, so what value has it provided?  I don\\'t really have a preference for anything to be completely honest. I was an associate doing PI for a little bit, so I\\'d be happy to go back and do that or find a different field.  I\\'ve always been perplexed by how trusting people are of reported crime trends.\\n\\nCrime reports are generated by police and are also used as a performance metric for evaluating police brass. That is like letting a kid grade their own exams, or an hourly employee fill out their own timecard no questions asked. Reclassifying violent crimes as misdemeanors, routine undercharging or frank underreporting of violent crimes, are all now status-quo in large cities. While it is admittedly more difficult to fudge the numbers on homicides, this is arguably true of all other violent crimes. However, even homicide numbers must be taken in the light of factors such as advances in life-saving trauma care over the decades.  I think she plays it up for her image.

It’s just better for networking and you waste less time commuting to work.  First, make sure you have a bag of potato chips  My biggest gripe with R32\\'s is the lack of hand holds at some places in the car.  Dividing people against themselves only benefits politicians and the media.  Let’s see. People who are released on bail are just as likely to commit a crime as those released without bail, ok. \\n\\nDid you account for the fact that a lot of them don’t post bail so now you’ve gone from 0% chance of additional crime to the same odds as before?  We have an extra ticket to olive gardens NYE party tonight.. 8-1 with an open bar. It was originally $400 but we would sell for $200  You know it’s not their job to stop any criminal activity. They are they to assist actual patrons. It’s in their Union contract. Would you want to get stab for $25/hr?  Well looks like someone’s celebrating the new year early  Dude just hit the bars. \\n\\nMingling with strangers on NYe is what NyC is all about.  Class act, this guy.  I can\\'t speak for them, but she\\'s crazy for engaging in a screaming fit on the subway, which those people are not doing.

Don\\'t use the link post, just add the link to a text post.  Yeah, absolutely. It\\'s not like it\\'s a report from an advocacy group that pushed for bail reform, it\\'s the court system. If anything, courts tend to oppose these sorts of reforms.\\n\\nThe value it provided? People who are legally innocent are not incarcerated. That\\'s an enormous value. Incarceration is extremely disruptive - it can make people lose jobs and damage family bonds. Stability is a huge  part of what keeps communities free from crime in the first place - social bonds and employment prevent recidivism. Incarceration is criminogenic and should be avoided whenever possible. \\n\\nOne in 5 incarcerated Americans has not been convicted of a crime.

And of course the dominant NYC area influences.\\n\\nLooking it up it\\'s called New York Latino English. Which is another dying accent variant.  \\\\&gt;  True, but now there is a clear pattern of escalating violence \\n\\nTwo misdemeanor assaults is not an escalation. I agree we need to find a way to deal with repeat offenders, but the problems suggest to me that we need to work on rehabilitation, not pre-trial incarceration.  WE DID IT REDDIT  Lol. Ask whichever mod is active. \\n\\nI’m curious too but I think I already know why they’re removing NY Post articles.  Did she get her free Mets tickets?  It\\'s every developer, regardless of race \\n\\nBlack owners and developers don\\'t charge low rents either  1. Are you saying that all people that commit crimes are mentally ill?\\n2. That’s the goal of these new laws. They give incentives to people to vote for the promoters of these laws (Democrats).  It\\'s increased coverage, not increased incidents.  No. Far too broad a generalization  How many misdemeanor assaults would be considered an escalation in your opinion?  No that was Corey Johnson. BDB was all for this law  Ok so you agree it\\'s bad that people are dying in the streets. I dont really believe much in government either. What alternative fixes can you see? Obviously what we have now is not working. Or do you not care? \\n\\nTrying to understand. I don\\'t know the best answers either so I\\'m open to other options. I just dont know who else in society can help.  An escalation, by definition, would be committing a more serious crime--second degree assault instead of third.  Obviously the police don\\'t give a \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* about homeless people all over the place. (Or rather, De Blasio has ordered the police to stand down.)\\n\\nIf you witness an assault happening, you can call 911.  I realize, but that\\'s just stupid. I don\\'t understand why nypost started to get this treatment while other news sites don\\'t.  DING DING DING  I believe that\\'s either Mark Train or possibly even Ben Franklin.\\n\\nPossibly even Vonnegut, but I rather think he enjoys talking to idiots and tries to outdo them.   not... professors!!!

No, I’m saying there’s a problem with our legal system that’s letting these mentally ill people off for violent crimes. \\n\\nWait, were you just being racist?  yes.  then after your promo price expires, threaten to switch to spectrum for a discount.

Glad I left that dump, and my taxes with it. Now I got more money then I ever could have expected. Thank god for Montana. YEEE HAW  The amount of people jumping at the chance to let their racism show is sickening.

To be fair they are excluding Maricopia county, AZ which is like the 4th largest county in the country. Same with Rural Texas splitting Senators with Dallas and Houston \\n\\n\\nDumb title  Believe it or not, reality is a lot more nuanced than you seem to believe: it’s entirely possible (indeed, probable) that tRump’s hateful and divisive rhetoric would increase hate crimes between all groups of people — even those who both are frequent targets of tRump’s hate. As stirring up hatred and division among one group will in turn cause other groups of people to respond in kind. Which is exactly what tRump wants, as his voters are above all driven by fear of “the other”. So the more divided and fearful the electorate, the less they will be thinking about issues like healthcare, the middle class, climate change, LGBTTQQIAAP rights and a host of other issues which are winners for the Democrats.  It’s a religion and a people. Yeah, someone can convert but it doesn’t make them ethnically Jewish. And at the same time, a Jewish person in 1944 wouldn’t have been released if they “converted to Christianity”.  She proved to society that she isn’t responsible enough to not get into trouble between court dates, I think it’s fair to say that she shouldn’t be released or should be sent for a psych evaluation.  If you go to the middle class non-Hispanic white areas of NYC, or the same in the burbs, the young people, at least millennials have maintained the traditional NYC accent. It\\'s most dominant among Italian Americans, Irish Americans, Jewish (Eastern European) Americans and heavily assimilated Puerto Ricans (usually white or mixed but mostly white)\\n\\nCardi B and Nicki Minaj have similarities but are also distinct. \\n\\nCardi B has some Spanish pronunciations of words when she speaks, which makes sense considering her dominant Dominican background (grew up in heavily Dominican areas). She grew up speaking English around people whose first language was Spanish, but there was also a fare amount of non-Hispanic blacks and of course the dominant NYC accent influences for English.\\n\\nNicki Minaj doesn\\'t have any Spanish influences in her pronunciation. She grew up in South Jamaica Queens. Both have strong African-American Vernacular English influences and both have dominant African ancestry, both genetically and culturally.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUaxVQPohlU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUaxVQPohlU)  &gt; Railways have federal oversight as well genius.\\n\\nYes - because of the interstate commerce clause. The key word being \"Interstate\" - meaning between two or more states. The NYC Subway is \"Intrastate\" - and the federal government does not have oversight or control over commerce within one singular state. \\n\\n&gt; Why are you explaining the Constitution to me?\\n\\nBecause I know more about it. My focus in law school was Constitutional Law. For a short period of time in law school, I interned for a federal judge who presided over jurisdictional cases. \\n\\n&gt; We\\'re talking about the MTA. Are you still unaware that this is not a city agency? It is a state agency serving state functions \\n\\nIrrespective of who controls the MTA, it is not a federal problem. The Federal government should not be funding city or state programs. \\n\\n&gt; Montgomery Alabama\\'s transit system is roads, which the feds subsidize\\n\\nThe Federal government doesn\\'t subsidize city or state roads. It subsidizes Interstate Highways. Hey, there\\'s that word \"Interstate\" again.  The \"academic\" redefinition is garbage.  What\\'s that about camels now?  Way too white for me.  Nice job trying to deflect the question with an ad hominem. I didn’t even bring up race and yet you call me racist. Try getting a new tactic without calling someone racist.  \"Grandma, Grandpa, Donald Duck. Grandma, Grandpa, Donald Duck. Grandma, Grandpa, Donald Duck.\"  look the guy was shrouded by his jacket and was trying to be discreet about it. by homeless standards the man is a real gentleman.  Isn\\'t NYC seeing record numbers fleeing the city??  No, I’m asking you. If you didn’t think this discussion was about the system releasing mentally ill violent offenders, then what were you talking about?  We have an extra ticket to the Olive Garden party in Times Square!  My position is simple: it is not the federal government\\'s responsibility to pay for our city and state run systems. Stop looking to DC for money - because it isn\\'t coming. Nor should it. \\n\\nIf a city/state wants to offer its citizens free healthcare, mass transit, etc - that\\'s fine. States are given that latitude in the Constitution. But that funding needs to come from the city/state. The Federal government was not created to prop up the states and give them cash. It was created to defend the Union. Expecting D.C. to give cash to all cities and all states to improve city/state run programs is ridiculous, and would lead to chaos. \\n\\nThis should bring us to this question: why doesn\\'t NY have money for a better mass transit system? The answer is simple - a large swath of MTA funding is used to subsidize fares. Your $2.75 fare has a real world value of ~$4. (And you know the new ferry lines everyone loves for $2.75? [The real world fare is close to $11](https://cbcny.org/research/swimming-subsidies)) If the MTA were a private company, it would be out of business. The only reason the entity has a pulse is because it is government run. \\n\\nWant to fix the MTA? End subsidies and charge a real world fare.**^1** In 5 years time, you\\'d have enough money to upgrade all switches, upgrade all cars, and improve service. Heck, you may even be able to afford the construction of a new line. But we will never charge a real world fare - because the MTA is a political tool. [It has been since its inception](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/nyregion/mta-subway-cuomo.html). Any pol that comes in and says the rate is going up will be laughed out of office.\\n\\nDo we really want a toxic symbiotic relationship between politicians and the MTA? Better yet - can we continue to afford such a relationship?\\n\\n**1.** People who earn less than $40k per year should be permitted write off their mas transit expenses on their taxes.

How are the kids in this video pushed to extremism by Trump supporters?  You’re putting words in their mouth; obv people joined gangs before. But there is no denying that racial hostility among ALL groups has skyrocketed as a result of tRump’s hateful rhetoric. So it’s not surprising that in an environment of hate, fear and division — an environment tRump has played a huge role in creating — we see people acting on said fear.

After white flight the only people left in the neighborhood were blacks and religious Jews and they decided they didn\\'t like each other, and that was that. But it\\'s only black kids going around knocking the hats off Jewish men\\'s heads, and not the other way around. \\n\\n&gt;WTF is going on\\n\\nIn general: A perfect storm of anti-Semitism from the right *and* the left.

Using a completely hypothetical example where there is a brown person that experiences two acts of prejudism - one from a white person and one from a black person: Neither individual is an institution, but the white person has the heft of institutional racism to support them, if, say, cops get involved. To me, I\\'d think the racism coming from the white person is scarier because of that implicit threat. Having a different word for prejudiced people when they\\'ve got extra heft by virtue of their identity makes it a bit easier to explain that, while they both suck, one is just more dangerous than the other. \\n\\nI dunno, honestly - I see the value in an extra word that can be used neatly at an individual level, but if it changes the conversation from how much someone sucks to the syntax we\\'re using to have the discussion, it\\'s not worth it.  https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2019/S1509C\\nThat’s the point, she won’t be serving the 15 years or whatever sentence she would normally receive  Never been out to Jamaica.

That does not entitle NY to all of that money back. It also doesn’t entitle NY to have DC fund it’s pet projects. \\n\\nThe subway system is a local issue that should be dealt with locally. Looking for federal funding is a waste of time and resources.  So did you read that? \\n\\nThey’re released on parole if they served 15 years OR they’re over 55. \\n\\nSo unless you think this woman somehow served 15 years already, they released her, under the bill, for being over the age of 55. \\n\\nDo you think they’re just releasing all criminals indiscriminately?  Are you implying that men jerking off magically appear on trains when women are present?  In 34 years, no, I never once saw a person jerk off on a subway.  But I’ve seen plenty of other disturbing things.  I didn’t imply I’ve never seen sick actions on the train, just not jerking off.  yet they won\\'t ban coolyertits the asshole who keeps posting nypost articles disguised as twitter external links.  I\\'m sorry but someone who went to law school shouldn\\'t have this much trouble with the following facts:\\n\\n1. The MTA is a state (not local) organization engaging in interstate travel.\\n\\n2. Federal highway funds are used to build local roads (not exclusively interstate highways)\\n\\n3. The ICC\\'s jurisdiction extends to activities that occur entirely in one state. Have you not read Wickard or Gonzales? These are required reading for someone with a \"focus\" on con law.\\n\\n&gt;Because I know more about it. \\n\\n\\nLololol. Thank you I needed a laugh.  Let me get this straight, you’re so concerned about some random nobody you think ought to be in jail, you’re going to vote for a president whose a Russian controlled stooge that colluded with Ukraine to attack his political opponents and breaking laws on a level never see before from president?  Great resource and information.  Thanks for all of this.  Lots of think about and consider in these discussions.  That’s my thought, too.  But does the increased coverage inspired copy-cat incidents, you think?  You rationalize it to be OK?  The problem is the loudest 10 percent control the narrative in the Democratic Party. I’m 99 percent sure that 90 percent of Democrats don’t think people like her should be immediately released on bail after assaulting someone, or people that launder money for  terrorism, or people that hurt children. But now they have to be immediately let out of jail and cannot be held on bail. It’s shit like this that causes people to vote for Trump/republicans because there is no “middle ground” alternative.  Smoke \\'em if you got \\'em.  There\\'s a small \"gang\" of men who stand in front of the turnstiles that they\\'ve jammed. They tell tourists that they\\'ll swipe them through and that they need their metro cards. There are multiple variations and the men are there every single day. MTA police/workers don\\'t care.  Better than those guys with the sofa on the subway.  I don’t agree.  What do you think would happen if I genuinely sued Reddit/its parent company for censoring speech, with a basis of proof that liberal-leaning publications serve as fair submission to start posts, but conservative-leaning publications do not?  Would I be laughed by a judge?  Oh I missed that. Oops. Thanks.  You\\'re confusing bail reform w/ policy to stem non-appearance after supervised release. DeBlasio has repeatedly stated his concerns about bail reform.  &gt;Every time black people tried to organize, they were smeared and murdered  Absurd strawman. I’m an Orthodox Jew, doesn’t mean I cannot sympathize with the black people that get tatted by the actions of a loud minority.  That’s just not true. Repeating a lie doesn’t make it true.  Everyone else: I just want to get home from work  I mean as long as his son is speaking true from his heart I feel for him, Imagine a sick fuck like that giving you life and now his sins parting onto you because of association. Hopefully his son has his shit together better then his crazy ass pops.  I am not a lawyer . And I’m sure that a qualified person can provide a more in depth explanation,  but the First Amendment applies only to the government censoring speech. Reddit is a private enterprise and can basically do what they want.\\n\\nAnd here is that explanation in comic form ! Which is the preferred way on reddit \\n\\nhttps://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png  Thanks.  Because Trump\\'s \"hateful rhetoric\" makes black people punch out jewish people in NYC. Or makes all the Jussie\\'s make up fake attacks. Or makes another black person shoot up a Jewish store. \\n\\nSure. Of course.  No, it\\'s just seeing less people move TO the city, especially from abroad.  The ironic part about this whole situation is the Hasidic community is one of the only groups willing to move into and live in minority neighborhoods.  The Jews just want to be left alone the their religion amongst themselves. Not sure why there is so much hate directed at the jews lately, especially from minorities.  if police want to have a better reputation with the community they got to stop circling the wagons around fuckups like this guy.  Hope you weren\\'t hear to witness the absolute shitshow of a thread after the murder in Harlem a few weeks ago. I got downvoted into Oblivion while non-New Yorkers who said \"profiling is good because black people commit disproportionately more crimes than whites do\" were getting brigaded with upvotes. As if most mass shooters aren\\'t white men.\\n\\nAnd you\\'re absolutely right-- Imagine if the Tree Of Life shooter was black or Muslim. You\\'d never heard the end of it. White nationalists are the most severe threat to Jews, and yet they continue to get overshadowed by racist narratives about PoC being antsemitic. It\\'s very dangerous.  The loss of Spanish among Puerto Ricans is probably attributed to several things.\\n\\n\\\\-Discrimination, PRs were the first large wave in NYC. So speaking Spanish = Puerto Rican for a long time and other groups pushed against it. My mother for example was told by a teacher when she was young to just say she was white and things would be better for her (1960s time period).\\n\\n\\\\-Americanization of the island. USA tried to prioritize English for a time, and general English influences to the language among people on the island due to being a territory of the USA. Today more than half the population is at least conversational in English and English media is having a big influence.\\n\\n\\\\-Time, the big waves were in the 40s and 50s. So people who only spoke Spanish are mostly dead in NYC.\\n\\nAs for Cardi B, she is also half Trinidadian so that has influenced her as well. Trinidadians in NYC tend to bond most with African Americans and people from non-Hispanic West Indian islands  Like a pendulum  Black people are allowed to be blatantly racist against whites and the majority of people are just cool with it. It\\'s disgusting.  She shouldn’t be offered bail at all. She has 13 prior arrests including assaults. And yes I think she’d have less of a chance to repeat if she had a significant amount of money at stack.  You need to summon Captain Chancleta...she\\'ll save the day  &gt;Some pay more than others, but all pay.\\n\\nOn net, very few states pay. Most get back more than they pay, subsidized by a few blue states.\\n\\n&gt;Wait - so it is ok to “redistribute” a millionaire’s/billionaire’s wealth to the less fortunate, but it isn’t ok to redistribute NY’s wealth to less fortunate states? \\n\\nYou lost me chief. Where did I say this way ok?\\n\\n&gt;Am I understanding you correctly?\\n\\nThere\\'s no point in even asking this anymore. I\\'m not sure you\\'ve understood a single thing correctly yet.\\n\\n\\n&gt;The subway system is a local issue that should be dealt with locally\\n\\nMTA is not local. It\\'s a state agency engaging in travel between multiple states (ie \"interstate travel\"). How are you still having trouble with this?\\n\\n&gt;Looking for federal funding is a waste of time and resources.\\n\\nThis is just nonsensical. What is the purpose of the FTA grant program? Are you just pretending like it doesn\\'t exist? The MTA has gotten billions from the FTA. Are you saying we should give these back?  Unless you’re a republican  He\\'s implying that certain people jack off on the train BECAUSE women are present.  punishing him would\\'ve brought down the rest or the racists\\' morale...  Speculative, yes, but I certainly wouldn\\'t put it past any of the prosecutors I\\'ve met.  maybe if it was sbarro...  What the hell lol  your problem is with the list of crimes that are bailable then, not any recent changes to bail. unless you just want to come out and say that you think poor people should be in jail longer, because that’s all the bail reform changes.  Yeah most of Latin America is motorbike heavy and between them and taxis, cycling is like a fucking death race. Cars hate motos, both hate cyclists  No excuse for this dipstick.  My grandparents escaped the holocaust and were very liberal in a lot of ways, but still had weird issues with black people and Muslims. Like this lady, I think a lot of pain and trauma behind it.  His IG-songod_immortal. Apparently he got hacked but put up another account. On his story- “For All you N***** talking shit. I didn’t try to rape her I was only trying to help her because she was sleeping and almost passed her station so stop sending me messages about how I’m a CowWard, n**** Fuck you.” And “So suck of you tired bitch as n*****. If you watch the video I was having a conversation with her dad at first which means they was not bad intentions there. I do t support rape/trafficking and f*cked up that the public wants to label me a rapist/human trafficker just so they can be internet thugs.”  Not really. Sikhism takes a lot from the time and place it was created. For example, the ceremonial  dagger they have around their neck.  Olive Garden ???  \\nI’m 40.  Am I too young for this or am I missing out on some bdsm swinger party .  That’s what the bill says! Did you read it? \\n\\nOr are you just making up a fake bill that lets everyone out no matter what?  If you really believe that then your a fucking idiot.  But *almost everyone* in real estate is scum regardless of religion so it\\'s not like they\\'re doing anything different than anyone else.\\n\\nLmao. Spoken like a true Marxist/Communist.  Who\\'s homeless when you got the E?  There really is no winner in a subway argument.  I\\'d like to shake his hand and thank him personally.  As a secular Jew, I would like to disown the Hasidim. I don\\'t relate to them, their values, or the way they run their communities at all, and I think they use our real historical oppression as a smokescreen for what\\'s essentially a large scale cult and to get preferential treatment (school districts, etc). But the rest of the Jewish community at large is afraid to say anything against them because of the specter of antisemitism. \\n\\nThat lady\\'s still totally crazy, though.  Curious, do you think she should be offered bail again?  I\\'m not sure, and it doesn\\'t affect me either way, so I\\'ll leave that up to those whom it does affect.  Incorrect.  &gt;Under the new law, judges will no longer be able to set bail for a long list of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, including stalking, assault without serious injury, burglary, many drug offenses, and even some kinds of arson and robbery.\\n\\nThis will mostly effect victimless crimes and there will be fewer people clogging up jails. Thank goodness.  Words like that are popular everywhere now in the USA among Millennials and GenZers due to Hip Hop being dominant in the media. African American Vernacular has become more dominant.  No problem. \\n\\nAnd yeah, frankly, the vast majority of people without released bail return to court for their trial; vast majority do not commit a serious crime between arrest and trial. We have to go with the data on policy change, not just single instances. And we know that bail reform in other jurisdictions hasn\\'t made it any more dangerous. \\n\\nThis may also be useful to folks reading into this topic for the first time:  [https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/Justice-Denied-Evidence-Brief.pdf](https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/Justice-Denied-Evidence-Brief.pdf) \\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that Vera isn\\'t even a radical voice in this debate. They support a risk assessment tool to replace cash bail, which is opposed by many more radical activists. (I have mixed feelings about risk assessment.)  You left out the second part of Trumps comment:\\n\\n“Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” he added. “Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can’t leave fast enough. I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!”  That\\'s a meaningless fear mongering statement. People die because of almost anything.  Seatbelts have killed people.  Should we repeal seatbelt laws?\\n\\nIncarcerating people who can\\'t afford bail kills people, directly and indirectly. \\n\\nThe real question is will this do more harm than good in the long term. It seems to be working ok in NJ so it\\'ll probably be fine here too.  Not cool to repeat lies. Remember lies don’t become truth even after the 100th time.  I’m legitimately asking you: what do you think the bill has been changed to allow?  Hahaha, I\\'m not even talking economically. I mean how they engage in outright lying, underhanded deceiving, pressure tactics, and generally not behaving in a way that shows they understand that a lease is a two-way legal agreement: I pay my rent and you are required to provide certain services. It\\'s more like: You pay your rent and I\\'ll do what I want and if you don\\'t like it not having heat or hot water, tough luck, you can move.  This guy must know some important people.....  Wow , I didn’t know spending NYE at Olive Garden was a big thing....  Lmao, yeah keep letting out criminals until they do some really really really bad. Not kinda bad. Not Sorta bad. Pretty bad is mehhhh.  So if this woman hypothetically commits an assault every day and is rearrested and re-released in perpetuity, do you think that\\'s a good way to run a society and a good way to use limited police and court resources?\\n\\nAlso, an escalation need not be committing a more serious crime. You misunderstandv the definition. An increase in frequency or severity would, by definition, also be an escalation?  Damn. If I ever go out there should I just walk to the Sutphin Blvd stop then?  giving away tickets to the Mets is actually part of the punishment.  *Attire is business casual please. Too fancy for t-shirts and sneakers.*  \\n\\nlol  I see you haven\\'t spoken to a dedicated cyclist before. The instant you mention that \"hey lots of bike riders ride like fucking assholes in this city\" this is roughly the response you get.  I\\'m in my 30s, a woman, and have seen it 4 times in my lifetime of riding the subway here. It\\'s been a while (knocks on wood) since the last time. \\n\\nAnd for a bonus, about 6 years while sitting on the D train I almost got poked in the face with a guy\\'s erect penis as he was standing it front of me. Thank GOD the train was just pulling into the station so I was able to run out. In hindsight I wish I said something to alert the people around me but I was in pure fight or flight mode. \\n\\nSo yeah consider yourself lucky you\\'ve never seen it. Cause that shit is traumatizing.  Break Bar is cool, you drink and then there is a room in the back to throw your glass at a wall and break it. It’s on 10th in the mid 30s. Drinks are reasonable and you can buy a bucket of glasses if you want. They also have a bigger wrecking room for an additional cost.  The Baha Men might be relevant again soon...  I’m always wary of basing my opinions on criminal law on specific incidents. No broad law is going to feel just for every situation. I would certainly personally like her to be behind bars. I don’t think that should mean bail reform was a bad idea, especially since it wouldn’t fix this problem if she happened to have money to make bail.  This is why I don’t want my girlfriend wife or sister to live in nyc, and definitely don’t want to raise kids in nyc.  Kids especially don’t deserve to see this kind of shit.  Do you think those awaiting trail out on bail should be allowed to keep weapons and firearms if they own them?  How do you misinterpret \\'to serve and protect\\'?  as a guy from alabama whos dream is to come to nyc one day, thie page is so awesome  A judge would laugh at you because, for starters, you clearly don\\'t understand how Reddit works. Reddit as a company has nothing to do with what you\\'re describing. The person who made that decision is some random unpaid moderator who is not affiliated with Reddit in any way. \\n\\nSecondly, both the moderators and Reddit can censor or allow whatever they want (aside from illegal content) and there isn\\'t jack shit you or anyone else can do about it.  Just cool it with the Russophobic remarks.  I\\'ve heard about this before - apparently the food is catered (it\\'s not typical olive garden food) and you get the enjoy the view from indoors. Is this true?   \\n\\n\\nNot for me, though.  No, I\\'m not saying that. \\n\\nChrist, you\\'re thick.  r/wholesomecomments  I\\'m glad to hear that DERs such as solar are being deployed at a quicker pace, however, there is going to be a lot of need on the distribution side of things (i.e. ConEd) to support all of these renewables.  Battery storage projects like the one they are doing at Ravenswood should help, but if the projected offshore wind project actually reaches the target capacity, expect significantly higher electrical costs for consumers.  I think its worth it, but it needs to be explained to the public and either subsidized by the state or considered part of doing business.  I am glad the state is doing what it can to help with energy efficiency projects on commercial buildings much as they have been doing on government buildings.  Its not as exciting as new generation sources, but reducing our dependency on natural gas and steam heat is crucial for NY to meet its energy goals.  Now now, San Francisco is runner-up...\\n\\nAnd yes, I\\'ve lived well over a decade in each.  Criminals are people convicted of a crime. These people are defendants awaiting trial—unless you want to overturn some of our most fundamental constitutional rights, the presumption of innocence, the right to a trial and due process.  It’s called the New York bail reform law, you’re inaccurate.  Islam also takes a lot from the time and place it was created, but this doesn\\'t tie it to peninsular Arab ethnicity.  You don\\'t see this shit in Tokyo or Hong Kong. It\\'s not a 9 million people thing, it\\'s a NYC thing.  I did but for my family small business. All i know is I see 5 mta workers watching 1 mta worker change the lights in my station. 5 of them were doing nothing but chanting and watch.  Bro, almost\\n\\nSecond to the two train  I mean, you\\'re posting a pic of Times Square/Theatre District.  Most New Yorkers avoid this area on any given day, why would you want to be here on NYE?  So if a defendant legally owned a firearm, can they retain possession of it during this time?  Stop avoiding the question. What do you think it says? “Everyone is free”? “Anyone who promises to vote democrat is free”? \\n\\nWhat do you, mshark3 think this bill allows?  /r/boomershumor  ninja new york is fun  God, this just triggered my ptsd.  Used to be NYPD, standing in a wind tunnel in full uniform for 17 hours.  Not fun.  r/oddlyspecific  To be clear she is a convicted felon.  Yeah I agree that Fox news is utter garbage that actively distorts reality. \\n\\nBut even if the Post tries to do the same thing, it\\'s usually much more transparent (and thus less harmful) and also there is something about the context of its being just city news that makes it not worth censoring, to me, for some reason. Like, we have the Post and the Daily News as the major sources of NYC news. We can allow both on this sub.  Must be going to Futon St Station  They will keep him employed until he secures a job with the Nassau or Suffolk police department. Then he will just resign and start his new job, no harm no foul.  Yeah, wearing adult diapers and standing for hours in a crowd of tourists is exactly how nobody should be spending New year\\'s Eve.  It would be no better for a boyfriend, husband, or brother. Wretches are wretches.  &gt; I don’t agree.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a matter of opinion. The 1st Amendment doesn\\'t bind a corporation. You would have no colorable claim EVEN IF there was a conscious decision on the part of Reddit\\'s corporate board or w/e to censor or disadvantage conservative news. Add on top of that that the decisions here are made by unpaid mods, as the other poster said, and the fact that people are allowed to fuck off and go form their own, differently moderated, communities, and it amounts to a preposterous lawsuit.  That one is good, but the one with the [guy on the motorcycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTC5KPbdwtM) wins for me.\\n\\nYou can see the disgust in that lady\\'s expression, plus she calls the guy a jackass, and he responds to go to another door.  All in 11 seconds.  Just a perfect little insight into the wonders of the NYC subway lol.  Painting a group of people with a broad brush? Ok Hitler.  The MTA is a local organization - [run wholly within the state of New York](https://new.mta.info/transparency/leadership). Connecticut has no say in how the MTA is run. In fact, Connecticut has conceded operations of the CT side of the lines to the MTA for convenience purposes. Simply stated - the MTA is a NY agency. \\n\\nThe fact that you would bring up the FTA tells me, quite clearly, that you do not understand how Federal funding works. The fact that funding exists *does not mean* that the Federal government is Constitutionally obligated to provide those funds. [Mass transit systems have to qualify for those funds](https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/regulations-and-guidance) - which are considered grants. Grants are applied for annually, and are always subject to change or cancellation. The fact that you have to apply for funding, and prove need, means that the government is not responsible to provide funds to you. Money happens to be earmarked for mass transit systems. That does not create a obligation for the federal government to fund all mass transit systems. \\n\\nI\\'ll also go one step further: the FTA has $13B in total funding. The MTA had a $16B budget in 2017.  My favorite part is the woman sliding over one seat  Dear Mr./Ms. Grumpus,\\n\\nUnfortunately my office is in this area and I had to work today.  Plus it’s fun to take a run in the middle of the streets when they are blocked off.  Thanks for your comment! Saved me typing out exactly how I feel  How is assault considered non-violent?  If you love Mizrahim and Sephardim but hate Ashkenazim, you\\'re a racist but not an anti-semite. One can choose Judaism, but one can\\'t choose those other categories.  Can\\'t you just Google \"moving sofa problem\" when you want to read it again?  This makes me proud to be a new yorker.  Urologists just give their entire family catheters. That’s my working theory. Don’t know why in the name of Dog anyone would go here tonight.  At least he’s covering himself. Pretty classy by subway standards.  You have a girlfriend and a wife?  the main thing that passes me off is the driving. i drive on the BQE a lot and if there’s one thing i don’t even bat an eye at anymore is a toyota sienna or honda odyssey or lately a large GMC suv breaking at least 5 traffic laws to get 1 inch ahead of everyone else. the hasidic driver is just casually curling his payos as he barrels forward like a bat out of hell. \\n\\nall fucking day. i just don’t get it. they’re so aggressive and such dangerous drivers and then you talk to a hasidic dude and he’s a sweetheart. i think in certain situations they just fall into a [privilege hole](https://forward.com/life/faith/395902/why-so-many-hasidic-men-are-such-aggressive-drivers/) \\n\\nand yea agreed that lady is crazy. the dude could be poor as dirt and she still lumps him into a stereotype  It puts criminals back on the streets  \"Here\\'s your $50 in metro cards AGAIN. Here\\'s your second burner phone. OH! And here\\'s another pair of tickets to the Mets next season!! Do you have a drivers license? We\\'re giving those to just about anyone these days too. Would you like to move to New Jersey for a few months because we\\'ll pay for that as well. Enjoyyyyyyy!\"  If we were to just agree that all group-based prejudice based on involuntary attributes is equally bad, then being racist, sexist, or just prejudiced wouldn\\'t imply any greater or lesser evil.  But the concepts she’s expressing are explicitly agreed with in the video. Anti-semitism is normalized.  Maybe she’s crazy because she’s willing to initiate the hate speech, but her views are commonplace in society.  Who is encouraging Black people to attack Jews?  might be hard for you to believe but there are people who actually work around times square  I lost two maybe ten fights in my life  But I wanna watch  Crown Heights is not a historically black community and it was not \"taken over\" by jews.  In fact, many neighborhoods in new york that are predominantly black were at one point populated by Jews, Italians, and Eastern Europeans. Most of those neighborhoods didn\\'t start seeing large black populations until after the Great Depression, during which many African Americans migrated from the rural south in search of jobs and communities that were less bigoted against blacks. To frame it as the jews invading and taking over black neighborhoods is historically inaccurate and also in my opinion racist.  The other issue is that adding more electric vehicles, and moving away from gas/oil heating in buildings is going to cause demand to rise up to new levels. The government has to help and create large subsidies because achieving the goals by 2030 and 2040 will require a lot of effort especially considering we are not a nuclear friendly state. Base power from hydro likely won\\'t be enough but with large government support (many billions of dollars or more) we can achieve our goals of becoming a 100% clean state  Not just yarmulke. My family member got called a “fucking Jew cunt” in a parking lot earlier this month and I feel like they made that assessment based on her appearance (I.e. nose).  People can be ethnically Jewish and posses stereotypical features that someone might try to identify them by.  I love NYC, but no way this tourist would EVER visit during this madness.  it feels so great to not be there  I just can’t see why we wouldn’t refurbish them again or give them just a bit of a touch up to milk them for a couple more decades. I’m not opposed to all the new trains but I’m all for using the old ones until they’re completely obsolete. I hope the newcomers are up to snuff  Safe travels home.  Idk how someone sees this and doesn’t move to another car- and the guy sitting on the opposite side is unfazed  His hands would be nice and warm  The culture is so awesome!  Im curious, are there any systems that would benefit individuals more than the current one (democratic republic) and 1person1vote (pure democracy)?  &gt;It’s shit like this that causes people to vote for Trump/republicans because there is no “middle ground” alternative.\\n\\nAnd then they act surprised when they lose elections and think the way to win is by doing the same exact thing and criticizing people when they still don\\'t like it.  try and find out  About to do that.  One can hold different attitudes towards Ashkenazim, Mizrahim, Sephardim, etc. Those are closer to \\'races\\' although they\\'re more like ethnicities. If I were to just convert to Judaism one day (more like one month or more), any attack on me for my religion would be equally anti-Semitic by definition.  Protect? Fuck them. They stopped traffic the other day. Literally parked in the middle of the street so that all of their cars could run read lights. They’re disrespectful and they need to go somewhere else with this bullshit.  &gt;The MTA is a local organization \\n\\nState. Not local. It appears you are now conceding this but are equivocating on terminology so you don\\'t have to admit you\\'re wrong.\\nThe MTA is absolutely not a local agency.\\n\\n&gt;the MTA is a NY agency.\\n\\nSo you\\'re now just parroting my points back to me. I literally have been trying to convince you of this for most of our conversation. \\n\\nIt\\'s a state agency engaged in interstate travel.\\n\\n&gt;The fact that funding exists does not mean that the Federal government is Constitutionally obligated to provide those funds\\n\\nWtf? Is anyone here except you talking about constitutional obligations to fund anything? Where are you getting that?\\n\\n&gt;That does not create a obligation for the federal government to fund all mass transit systems.\\n\\nYou\\'re arguing against something no one said. You\\'re really bad at this.\\n\\nYour claim was\\n\\n&gt;Looking for federal funding is a waste of time and resources.\\n\\nWhy is it a waste of time and resources to pursue federal funds. The MTA got nearly $1B in federal funds last year alone. I can\\'t think of a better use of time and resources that trying to pursue these grants. \\n\\nIs there a reason you rarely answer my actual questions and instead argue (usually incorrectly) about irrelevant points and straw men that no one gives a shit about?  that guy seems pretty cool. \\n\\n——\\n\\nside note: out of all the various languages and accents you hear in NYC.. only this one sounds weird or out of place ;-)  Don\\'t go to Times Sq on NY  Does that mean she no longer has rights?  &gt;The only people that think this are the racist fucking echo chamber on Reddit. \\n\\nGonna stop you right there.  December 29, 2016  Yep because all of these petty conflicts ultimately come from the fact that a few people are hoarding the world’s resources and power and feeding everyone else scraps... and it’s in their best interest to have people getting into screaming matches with their own neighbors with the same pitiable living conditions as them rather than looking up to see the true cause of their suffering  &gt;\\tSome states, like New Jersey, that have abolished or curtailed the use of cash bail have established a system for assessing the risk that a defendant might commit another crime, and allow judges to hold people to protect public safety. But New York simply abolished the use of bail for most nonviolent crimes without establishing a such a method.  \"To protect and serve\" is a slogan, it has no legal force. Read the article the person above you posted. The supreme court says police have no duty to protect us.  nobody is alone in NYC tonight - go out and enjoy  Who moves their entire body like that? Have I been doing it wrong the entire time?  All criminals? Random criminals? \\n\\nDo you think the bill just says “let out criminals”?  Normally I would pose a strong semantic disagreement, but instead, I\\'ll just say that whatever -ism she has is equally bad.  &gt; The MTA is a state (not local) organization\\n\\n1. I have no idea why you\\'re hung up on my saying \"local\" as opposed to \"state.\" For purposes of federal funding - anything conducted within one state is \"intrastate\", and not subject to federal oversight. \\n\\n2. Just because funds are available does not mean that it is the federal government\\'s responsibility to pay for it. The expenses you\\'re outlining are grant programs - which mean that the local project must apply for funding. The federal government gets something in exchange: roads are built to the specs of the federal government, not the local laws. Most local roads were built with federal funding under the proviso that the state raise the drinking age, or lower the speed limit. It is a negotiated deal - not an federal obligation. \\n\\n3. The question in Wickard actually dealt with true *commerce*. In addition, there was also a compelling state interest to limit wheat production (for price protection in a volatile market.) I do not necessarily agree with the conclusion, but the fact remains that limiting wheat production to protect market prices was of national interest. \\n\\n4. As far as Gonzales is concerned, we can look to Scalia\\'s concurrence for direction: \"the Court affirms today, **Congress may regulate noneconomic intrastate activities only where the failure to do so \"could … undercut\" its regulation of interstate commerce.** ...

When I did my research and priced out the trip...I decided to go for 2 weeks starting on Jan 2nd instead of 1 week over New Years Eve for the same hotel cost. Almost 3x on NYE and New Years Day. \\n\\nAfter hearing how the ball drop is in person I didn’t feel I missed out on anything besides a horrible time. And I got to see soooo much more of the city in tha extra week after the main touristy stuff.  That would really depend on whether she hated him for his religious beliefs, his askhenaz blood and phenotype, or both.  And if you do, don\\'t forget your diaper.

Is there a cutoff date or span?  And yet somehow law enforcement is not on edge about people who can\\'t afford bail languishing in jails.  She\\'s not wrong...  I will never understand why people go to Times Sq ~~at all~~ on NYE.  So we should allow the state remove the constitutional rights  of those  who are not guilty of any crime?  They should take a page from the Amish book and find a nice rural piece of land where they can be happily isolated and live as they wish to the fullest extent.  I guess a lot of regulars in this sub would be glad if people brought back lynching.  \\\\&gt; So if this woman hypothetically commits an assault every day and is rearrested and re-released in perpetuity, do you think that\\'s a good way to run a society and a good way to use limited police and court resources?\\n\\nWell, it\\'s better than locking her up without a trial, but I don\\'t think either option is acceptable. A good way to run a society, and use limited police and court resources, is to make sure people never end up in the system to begin with--and to make sure that those that do never return. That would require us to focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment. But we don\\'t do that. There are many reasons why the U.S. has more prisoners than any other nation, and a high recidivism rate is one of them.\\n\\n\\\\&gt; Also, an escalation need not be committing a more serious crime. You misunderstand the definition. An increase in frequency or severity would, by definition, also be an escalation.\\n\\nAs I stated, an increase in severity would be an escalation, so we agree on that. Frequency? Can you really claim an escalation with a data set of 2? At any rate, as I\\'ve said over and over, I\\'m not a lawyer. I was using the dictionary definition of escalation. Can you link the NYS legal definition of \"escalation\"?  All good, Happy New Years. One thing tho, I sometimes  think about all the valuables dropped on the ground by all those poor bastards in Times Square during NYE. They eventually clear them all out to clean.

While you’re having a papaya dog and a juice trying to figure out where to go next, get out of the way cause someone is late for work or running a time sensitive task.”\\n\\nAnother good one was if you need directions, ask someone standing around having a smoke cause they’re not going anywhere at the moment and probably know the area.  Contact your City Council person, and if you can get others to come in with you, the more the better.  This new wave is of their own doing—no one pulling strings behind the scenes egging it on, except maybe the mainstream media.  Criminals that commute listed crimes in link I sent.

The consequences of blaming it on the jews aren\\'t nearly as severe, and it\\'s a win-win for those aforementioned controlling interests and police.  Yeah its rather annoying to still be in a grey zone age with rights in some places but not in others... one more year.  Uh no... It\\'s Han Chinese real estate developers.

I don’t even put my bags down on the subway floor let alone a couch.  Uh, when did trump tell \"minorities\" to \"go back to where they came from\"? Do you mean illegal aliens? As in people who purposefully violate our immigration and employment laws and have zero right to be here let alone work here? The people who send $25 billion in remittances to Mexico alone every year? The people who traffic women and children across the border and into the sex trade? Last time I checked, illegal immigrant is not a race, but an action people choose.  Yes it was similar to a Discover Channel episode of Lions attacking packs of fat antelopes wearing ponchos.  FIOS is great. Recommend buying the router instead of renting it. You can buy it from Verizon.

In fact, pretty much every non-black community seems to have some kind of anti-black racism.  how many crimes did you commit under color of law? not implying anything, just curious.

I guess some forms of xenophobia are Kosher now? Ohio doesn\\'t have the same opportunities to succeed as NYC does, which is why they immigrate there to start a better life for themselves. This should be encouraged—this is the NYC spirit!  I’m certainly not educated enough on the topic to be any kind of authority, but from what I’ve seen, there aren’t any flawless versions of it. Systems tend to get corrupted or have obvious major faults even if they originally have good intentions. For instance, our system was designed under the idea that all men are created equally, which is admirable. But as I’m sure you’re aware, all men was really white men. So while the idea was pretty cool and pure, the application of it was horrible.  Probably 0 like the vast majority of cops  where did you go peepee?  &gt;That would require us to focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment. But we don\\'t do that. There are many reasons why the U.S. has more prisoners than any other nation, and a high recidivism rate is one of them\\n\\nThis is naive. Most criminals aren\\'t criminals because of a lack of state spending on rehab. You could spend an infinite amount of resources on rehab and you would still have recidivism.\\n\\n&gt;As I stated, an increase in severity would be an escalation\\n\\nNope. You started a \"more serious crime--second degree assault instead of third.\"\\n\\nYou can escalate the severity of a crime without changing the legal degree.\\n\\n&gt;Can you link the NYS legal definition of \"escalation\"?\\n\\nNo. Why is that relevant. We\\'re just speaking as people not lawyers.  i think as long as a few generation of one ethnic group occupies the neighborhood for a period of time you can label it historically x. remember chinatown wasn’t always chinese, the lower east side wasn’t always jewish, bay ridge want always italians and brighton wasn’t always russians  this is exactly how i feel, this along with all the rush and havoc makes it feel like at least times square isnt worth any time of the year. rather head down to a park like brooklyn bridge park and hangout there and just appreciate the views for new years  hows alabamy doin?

FTP  Prospect Park: Go to Grand Army Plaza\\nCentral Park: Go to Bethesda Fountain  I’m a reformed Jew living in Crown Heights and have to say she does have a point...for the most part the Orthodox Jews living here treat every one else who isn’t them differently, especially the Black community. \\n\\nLiterally once a day I have to go out of my way to walk OFF the sidewalk because a group of Orthodox men refuse to move even the slightest when we’re walking past each other. I’m Jewish and they won’t even look me in the eye let alone acknowledge me.\\n\\nIt’s a shame that we’re all living in the same small community but are so divided!  That one dude had an ebike. Aren\\'t those very illigal?  Why the hell should anyone relinquish a seat to people physically and reasonably able to stand?  No one is hating on Russian people. It\\'s the Russian government that\\'s the problem. Are you saying that criticizing the Russian government is equal to being Russophobic?  I need to get from Midtown East back to the West side, where can I cross over by walking? Do I have to walk up to 59th street and cut over?  It\\'s never anybody\\'s fault but white people\\'s!\\n\\nYou do the opposite of what you\\'re trying to accomplish. Everyone has personal agency...you can\\'t just blame Republican boogeymen for the culture and lack of parenting that leads to attacks like this.  slap some wheels on that couch and they could ride it home  Oink oink  Seriously. Most of the modern cars are way under powered especially when crowded. It just makes everything worse when it\\'s warm and uncomfortable.  I mean, I agree, at least with the psyche evaluation part, but on principle, the other person is absolutely right.  But this is likely only feasible for tall people. If I tried to stand between two people having an altercation I would probably just be picked up and tossed out of the way like a gym towel  so under that definition a black person calling an asian person an asian stereotype would not be considered racist because there’s no institutionalized backing behind it?\\n\\njust trying to get educated here  Subway, 59th street, those barricade are leaky so I just crossed wherever  &gt;Ms. Halliburton said that her two eldest sons, who were 17 and 20 at the time, tried to stop him from coming any farther into the house.

It\\'s not \"violent\" because no one got physically hurt. Stalking is \"non-violent\" too until the person being stalked gets stabbed and killed. Hey because letting someone out for stalking is ok. Remember\\nArson from 2nd to 4th degree is also a no-bail offense, along with rioting and resisting arrest. Bail jumping is also a no-bail offense.  &gt;I have no idea why you\\'re hung up on my saying \"local\" as opposed to \"state.\" For purposes of federal funding - anything conducted within one state is \"intrastate\", and not subject to federal oversight.\\n\\nNope. Read Wickard v Filburn. \\n\\n&gt;Just because funds are available does not mean that it is the federal government\\'s responsibility to pay for it. The expenses you\\'re outlining are grant programs - which mean that the local project must apply for funding. The federal government gets something in exchange: roads are built to the specs of the federal government, not the local laws. Most local roads were built with federal funding under the proviso that the state raise the drinking age, or lower the speed limit. It is a negotiated deal - not an federal obligation.\\n\\nWhy are you so caught up on this. Did someone say it is a federal obligation. Who are you arguing against? The argument is that the feds should return some in NY\\'s money to NY.  I don\\'t see anyone saying that\\'s an obligation.\\n\\n&gt;The question in Wickard actually dealt with true commerce. In addition, there was also a compelling state interest to limit wheat production (for price protection in a volatile market.) I do not necessarily agree with the conclusion, but the fact remains that limiting wheat production to protect market prices was of national interest.\\n\\nAs you know con law doesn\\'t care about your opinion. You think that running one of the country\\'s biggest enterprises in one of it\\'s biggest states to provude critical infrastructure to one the the world\\'s largest metro economies is not in the national interest but some yahoo growing crops in his back yard was?\\n\\n\\n&gt;As far as Gonzales is concerned, we can look to Scalia\\'s concurrence for direction: \"the Court affirms today, Congress may regulate noneconomic intrastate activities only where the failure to do so \"could … undercut\" its regulation of interstate commerce. ... This is not a power that threatens to obliterate the line between \"what is truly national and what is truly local.\"\\n\\nScalia is dead. If concurrences had a majority they wouldn\\'t be concurrences. They\\'d be the Court\\'s opinion.  Go crawl back under a rock  You gotta both or you get fucked lol. No leverage.  &gt; This is naive. Most criminals aren\\'t criminals because of a lack of state spending on rehab. You could spend an infinite amount of resources on rehab and you would still have recidivism.\\n\\nAnd yet other developed nations do far better with recidivism. We\\'re clearly doing something wrong.\\n\\n&gt; No. Why is that relevant. We\\'re just speaking as people not lawyers.\\n\\nIt\\'s relevant because we disagree about what constitutes escalation. An official legal definition would settle the question. I care about what constitutes an escalation in the framework of the law, which is why I referred to moving from third to second degree. You seem to argue that being accused of multiple misdemeanors should earn you harsher treatment under the law. I\\'m looking for a legal justification for your argument.  They should’ve killed him. Castle law. Put that pig down.  &gt;In practicality, are these crimes growing in frequency, or is the media coverage growing in frequency?\\n\\nStrange that no one was asking this question when the media was still pretending it was mostly trump supporters committing these hate crimes...  \"I\\'M BEING LOUD SO I\\'M RIGHT!\"  Okay, and in that spirit, the historically XYZ neighbourhoods will soon be historically \\'something-other-than-or-in-addition-to-XYZ\\' neighbourhoods. The circle of city life—musical chairs.  So you’re saying tRump’s hateful rhetoric has nothing to do with the major increase in hate crimes since he was elected? Like, you’re actually claiming it’s just a coincidence or something?  Lol you guys just don\\'t get what I\\'m saying.. The days of Lars and limewire are no more. There is no content safety anymore. If it is digital, or can be made digital, then it is free somewhere online. PERIOD. Deal with it. I\\'m not saying it\\'s right. Also, anyone can republish any video online, legally, by putting it inside a tv frame or inside a window. That\\'s how its done.  Youtube may still flag you, but there is hundreds of other sites, in other Countries that don\\'t have copyright laws, nor do they have to abide by U.S. laws. So yeah, its not cool, but in 2020 you can\\'t stop the free flow of information. I watch cable tv on [https://watchnewslive.tv/](https://watchnewslive.tv/)  it\\'s free, stable, and they have most channels.  Somehow this still seems less obnoxious than a couch. Actually I\\'d probably just laugh if I saw a guy with a steel girder. Couch people annoy me though.  I absolutely would have went to town myself, but these guys might be smart enough to know that sometimes it doesn\\'t work out well for young black  men to hit a white man even when justified.  It also sounds like there were cameras, so they would have gotten locked up if they got carried away.  &gt; brooklyn turned into one giant Mosque\\n\\nWhat?  Ty :)  Going to a party two blocks from my apt. No subway, hopefully not a lot of vomit in the streets. Should be a good NYE! Hope all of you have a safe and fun night!  Don\\'t have much to add...just want to say I love all the train knowledge dropped here.  Yeah it’s a shame. More people need to exercise their right to self defense and waste cops who are committing crimes against them.  Most places in this country you don\\'t have any right to resist a totally illegal arrest.  This clown was off duty though, so not applicable.  No that guys jacket is clearly on.  That\\'s absolutely true. However, Orthodox Jews (from whichever sect) are more likely to be attacked in the street (v.s. their place of worship) because they have a \\'uniform\\' so to speak.\\n\\nSecular Jews are also targeted, but it\\'s harder to identify a stranger in the street as a secular Jew. So synagogues are targeted, because they are identifiable.  Nope. Did I say that?\\n\\nShe is, however a criminal.  You really should. If police knew they could be summarily judged for violating someone’s rights then they’d behave better. Like when the panthers would watch them.  Lol, the statistics do not back you up.  Well let\\'s get our talking points straight then: almost everybody who votes Democrat also believes that criticizing the Israeli government is not equal to being anti-Semitic. The vast majority of people making the opposite argument are people on the right who want to entrap people on the left with a bad faith interpretation of their criticisms of Israeli policy. and the same is true when criticizing the Russian government.   \\nAnd secondly, when people say \"Russia\" or \"China\" or \"North Korea\" or whatever, it\\'s implied and commonly understood that they\\'re talking about the governments, not the people.  What does guilt have to do with anything?  If you\\'re reading the constitution literally then a convicted murderer should be able to go out and buy a functioning howitzer the day he\\'s let out of jail.  \\n\\nYes, I think the state should limit or take away people\\'s rights sometimes. I would support adding amendments to the constitution that strictly define the circumstances and limitations of what the state can take away.  Since that will never happen, I am ok with local and state laws that technically violate the constitution.  Seriously, this is mob justice plain and simple. These guys in the video are saying \"call the cops\" while beating the shit out of someone who may or may not have been the person in the original video.  If they have they\\'ve been very discrete about it. I have however seen someone shit on a Harlem side walk in plain daylight  What\\'s the connection with the Mets here?  what made you quit?  I don\\'t know that confiscating someone\\'s gun until a case is resolved would amount to infringing on someone\\'s constitutional rights any more than pre-trial detention would. I\\'m not a lawyer--you should ask one. In general, I would say if a judge is able to release someone on their own recognizance, there would be no reason to take their gun.  Cops or the DA\\'s office are encouraging black people to attack Jews?\\n\\nThis is a tenuous causal chain at best. But really, I think it\\'s ridiculous. And it certainly doesn\\'t benefit anyone in the government do have Orthodox Jews victimized like this.  Thanks, unions.  Far better than anyone in Times Square right now.  Welcome to our shitty criminal justice system. This is a good example of how fucked up it is  So why bring it up? Once a criminal, always a criminal?  &gt;We\\'re clearly doing something wrong.\\n\\nThis ignores that different nations may have different criminal proclivities. And some bureaucratic nightmare state run rehab isn\\'t likely to fix this.\\n\\n&gt;An official legal definition would settle the question.\\n\\nNo, it wouldn\\'t. We\\'re discussing this as concerned citizens. \\n\\nIf someone lightly flicks you and then gives you a hard full hand slap, that is an escalation regardless of what the law says. \\n\\n&gt;You seem to argue that being accused of multiple misdemeanors should earn you harsher treatment under the law.\\n\\nCmiiw don\\'t think I said anything like this.

I\\'m sure it\\'s just getting caught in the spam filter.  crime pays  &gt; this woman slapped some people, and punched another, causing no serious physical harm\\n\\nIf someone did that to my elderly mother, she could really hurt her. I don\\'t want anyone on the street who randomly attacks people, no matter how *minor* the attacks are.  Id probably say that was a smarter move then just running, as people would know that something was immediately wrong and the train would start moving anyways. He started leaving once it was clear that she was going to block the train until something was done.  isn\\'t there a cold weather hat?  Yup that’s my speed and totally fine for all that.  Haven’t had a streaming video buffer for years.  Apparently.  Times square in the 80\\'s and now are completely different.  I feel like it’s extra pointless now that it’s broadcasted on literally every channel imaginable. \\n\\nI could imagine it being a fairly remarkable time back in the 40’s when that was the only thing to do.  &gt; Black people have been repeatedly taught that unified, cross-cultural working class movements are a good way to get shot in the head while you\\'re sleeping.\\n\\ncan you give me an example of what you mean  yup  \"Assault without injury\" is a violent misdemeanor.  Felony assault is not on the list.\\n\\nThe precise terms &amp; categories are here:  [http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article120.htm](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article120.htm)  No, just that stupid cap. I used to wear a beanie under it though.  Most important thing is to cover your ears.  Doesn’t matter- why would you torture yourself by not moving  And somehow the trolls aren\\'t on edge about people TODAY getting bailed out for the exact same crimes (and worse ones, too).  You sure about that? I’ve heard horror stories about the subways in Japan. Don’t forget the sarin attacks in 1995 that killed 14 and injured over a thousand. Also, you can’t compare our society with theirs; these are two totally different cultures.  Y’all laugh, but it it is a know scam in Germany to ship NYC tourists off to Jersey.  its not torture when you don\\'t care  I\\'m not conceding anything - you kept repeating\" MTA IS STATE NOT LOCAL\" - and that is a distinction without difference. Interstae commerce regulation doesn\\'t care if you\\'re a state agency or a city agency. But, it seemed to be an insurmountable issue for you, for reasons still unknown. \\n\\n&gt; Wtf? Is anyone here except you talking about constitutional obligations to fund anything? Where are you getting that?\\n\\nI have been saying it all along. You\\'re insisting that the federal government should be paying for our transit system. I have been saying it should not. It is under no obligation to do so. Our problems are our own. The best way to sort them out is to get our own budget under control - and to charge real world fares. \\n\\n&gt; Why is it a waste of time?\\n\\nBecause it is creating a reliance on federal funding (which is always subject to change/fluctuate), rather than getting our own house in order. Setting a budget shouldn\\'t be \"We\\'re going to deficit spend forever, and hope that the federal government can cover the rest.\" \\n\\nThis brings us full circle: I have stated numerous times that the MTA should be privatized. This is where the conversation started. A private organization would charge a real world price, and would improve service. More importantly, it would reduce graft. There wouldn\\'t be tens of thousands of hours of fraudulent overtime, there wouldn\\'t be no-show jobs, and there would be actual accountability. The only reason we don\\'t have a private MTA is because the MTA was turned into a political weapon in the 1960s. The Governor assumed control of the agency - and promised people in NYC that he - and he alone - would keep the fares low. \\n\\nSomething as vital as the city\\'s mass transit should not be a political weapon. Put it into the private realm with heavy oversight and regulation.  No thank you for your disservice and harassment of the good people of New York.  *mostly.\\n\\nI believe the theory is that if they\\'ve committed a violent act, they must be put behind bars for a bit instead of being able to pay their way out.  How many women in Uggs were there though?!  I forgot the city and state fell apart the last time it was run by republicans right?  Washington Heights .... :D  That\\'s what I mean NYC issues are cultural, it has little to do with the number of people.  \\n\\nAs for Japanese transit, you don\\'t say anything on the train, it\\'s passive aggressive to an extreme degree.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton#1969_raid_and_death  Glad you found a real job that doesn\\'t involve making the public miserable on what should be a fun night.  You’re right. She should be free on the streets till the trial. If she commits a 3rd crime this week she can continue waiting on the streets until that trial happens.  Also Coney Island!  1312 ✊🏼  My understanding is that the people fleeing the city tend to have more money, but the people coming in (often new immigrants) tend to be poorer.  I am sympathetic towards the thesis of this article (supervised release makes more sense than bail as 88% of those charged return to court and it saves the money a ton), but I\\'m not understanding the Mets angle.  How are incentives implemented? Are Mets tickets part of the incentive?  It means she was convicted of a crime. For her most recent felony conviction, she did not serve any time. She was released immediately so she could resume hey violent behavior.  The only domestic stuff I was aware in my precinct was by a female cop.  She was nuts, every boyfriend she had she wound up getting into fights with and neighbors calling the cops on them.  Police no longer make arrests for anything but the most egregious of crimes. I don\\'t need fudged statistics to tell me what I\\'ve seen unfold with my own two eyes. This once great city has become a mix of degenerates, deluded transplants who leave after their 20s, and wealthy part-time residents.\\n\\nPolice used to respond to crime complaints within minutes. Now they don\\'t respond at all. This place is fucking disgusting and I can\\'t wait to GTFO.  &gt; punishing them if they do anything more productive than attacking jews, sure.\\n\\nThe cops and the DA\\'s office punish Black people who get jobs and obtain degrees?  Fuck right the fuck off.  Goddamn can you pussies find a way to ruin everything.  The side that wants to lock up poor people who are alleged to have committed misdemeanor assault.\\n\\nOr do you support locking people up before trial regardless of net worth?  If that\\'s the case I\\'m sure this is something you care strongly about and have shown your support for previously, and could link to such postings?  It certainly wouldn\\'t be the case that you only care now because a law was passed that makes the system less harsh on poor people.  Just on an NYPD sidenote, I saw two cars get towed today by my jobsite... Had to send a guy down for parking duty to move cars if he saw a traffic cop coming... Crazy today  I was even into it when I thought I could come and go like at a festival or concert. Ya know, go for a pee and a beer run. Grab a hotdog or something.\\n\\nBut when I found out that you are literally corralled into a quadrant with a set amount of people, with 1 entrance and 1 exit. and if you left you couldnt come back because they filled your spot with someone else...I was out. \\n\\nI planned to be drinking, so would need drinks and a bathroom and food. Needing to have all 3 on me when I left the hotel in the morning....a flask, a diaper, and a bag of sandwiches... nope.\\n\\nI remember when I was looking up the best place to watch the ball drop in NYC was...and the answer across the board was \"at home or at a bar with friends.\" Not a single person recommended Times Square.  So good lmao  Ew you can move to the countries that let you drink on the street then. Shit is gross. \\n\\nAlso the ERs in countries with permissive fireworks laws are filled with handless in people on New Year\\'s Day. You can go enjoy that in your chosen countries as well  Heh.  Just finished up style wars, this looks good.  pretty hilarious joke there bud  Can you link anything regarding her previous conviction?  If she *allegedly* commits a 3rd crime.  So far, she is legally innocent of both crimes in question.\\n\\nBut the other relevant factor is that she has only been charged with misdemeanors so far.  If she had been charged with a violent felony, she would not have been released.  From that link, https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2019/S1509C, it basically starts at page 111.\\n\\nLink to misdemeanors in NY penal code:\\n\\nhttp://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/a_misdemeanor.htm\\n\\nhttp://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/b_misdemeanor.htm\\n\\nYou guys can have fun trying to see where slapping someone falls into.  Look at the fireworks!  Look at you with your big heart. I think we should lock people up regardless of wealth. \\nYou hurt people on a regular basis, you should wait for trial in jail where people punch back.  I\\'m saying this specific attack has absolutely nothing to do with Trump  Most of Europe has a lower crime rate and better health outcomes than this country -- a permissive society is generally a healthier, lower-stress society.  You’re right. Only violent misdemeanors. And just to get it straight 3 alleged crimes is where we draw the line? But 2 is fine to roam the streets while waiting for trial.  Link to interview?  Yeah? You don\\'t find [this](https://i.imgur.com/M2foQN8.png) to be a distortion of reality?  She doesn\\'t strike me as a crazy though, just racist. Engage with that shit. Hate wins when ignored. It grows in darkness. Let\\'s take responsibility for what happens in our city  I don\\'t think letting people drink and throw explosives in the street is the reason Europe has less crime and better health.  Permissiveness = lower stress.  Lower stress = better mental and physical health.  Yeah. What\\'s even scarier is the general response on this sub is comfortably salivating over this display of militant fascist overreach.  My wife’s sisters were visiting from Japan around New Years ‘17 and we were seeing the fireworks from our apartment in TriBeCa. They really wanted to see Times Square after New Years and I advised against it because I knew it’d be a clusterfuck, but we went anyway. \\n\\nThe place looked like a war zone after the ball dropped. So much trash. It was disheartening. We went to go past the barricade and my wife and her sisters played the “I don’t speak English” role as if they were staying at a hotel inside and that got us in. Why people can’t pick up after themselves is beyond me.  I’m not going to bat for this woman in particular so much so I am going to bat for due process and the presumption of innocence, which has been an institution in free societies for centuries.  The idea of a government that can put me behind bars because I’ve been accused of a crime, without the opportunity to first defend myself against that accusation in a fair and open trial, is terrifying to me.  It should scare you too.  &gt; Would I be laughed by a judge?\\n\\nNo, they\\'d be pissed off you were wasting their time with a frivolous pro se lawsuit. \\n\\n(Good luck finding a lawyer willing to risk their license to file that one for you)  I\\'ve watched a fair number of women\\'s prison documentaries. They don\\'t hit very hard. This slap happy moron would probably run the place.\\n\\nI think the intention of the law is to reduce incarceration without increasing crime (OVERALL crime, this bitch is not statistically significant).  I think it will be modestly successful, like it is in NJ.  \\n\\nHow about we revisit in 2 years.  If in 2022 every hassid in crown heights is walking around nursing a reddened cheek from this menace, I\\'ll buy you a coke.  sounds like war with casualties on both sides and not cross cultural unification efforts. it also sounds like homeboy got sold out, drugged and murdered by his own confidant \\n\\nthese efforts have nothing in common with the on-message unified financial, cultural, social and political front presented by the orthodox jewish communities  You:\\n\\n&gt;and that is a distinction without difference.\\n\\n\\nAlso you:\\n&gt;We\\'re talking about the New York CITY\\'s transit system. That is how CITIES are relevant. So, please tell me why the Federal government should be funding New York CITY\\'s transit system, and not Montgomery Alabama\\'s.\\n\\nWhy are you emphasizing city? Does the distinction matter or not?\\n\\n\\n&gt;I have been saying it all along. You\\'re insisting that the federal government should be paying for our transit system.\\n\\nI\\'m arguing the federal government should return some of the large amount of tax revenues it gets from the state to help pay for a transit system that many of those state taxpayers use. I\\'m not arguing and no one is, that the feds should pay for the system entirely.\\n\\n&gt;I have been saying it should not.\\n\\nYou haven\\'t convincingly argued why not.\\n\\n&gt;It is under no obligation to do so. \\n\\nThis is absolutely irrelevant. We\\'re discussing whether it should.\\n\\n&gt;Our problems are our own. \\n\\nAgreed. Why are South Carolina\\'s problem also ours to solve with enormous infusions of cash. Why should New York subsidize sister fucker states that can\\'t part for their own shit?\\n\\n&gt;The best way to sort them out is to get our own budget under control - and to charge real world fares.\\n\\nIDGAF about whether we do this or not. I\\'m just confused why you would rather have NY money go to sister fucker states than be used in NY.\\n\\n&gt;Because it is creating a reliance on federal funding (which is always subject to change/fluctuate), \\n\\nWhy are you okay with the feds relying on tax money from NY, which is subject to change?\\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s a stupid fucking reason to not accept free money. The feds well try to take money from NY. My state government better be fighting like hell to get it back.\\n\\nI don\\'t feel the need to subsidize sister fuckers.\\n\\n&gt;rather than getting our own house in order. \\n\\nThe instant the sister fucker states stop being net recipients, I\\'ll agree with you.\\n\\nUntil they get their house in order, I don\\'t see a reason to subsidize these big spending states. They need to learn to balance their budgets internally.\\n\\n\\nSetting a budget shouldn\\'t be \"We\\'re going to deficit spend forever, and hope that the federal government can cover the rest.\"\\n\\n&gt;A private organization would charge a real world price, and would improve service.\\n\\nCitation needed. Privatized utilities are often a complete cluster fuck. Look at PG&amp;E. Now add in NY corruption. This would not be an improvement. \\n\\n&gt;Something as vital as the city\\'s mass transit should not be a political weapon. \\n\\nNor should it be privitized and operated by some garbage private equity company.\\n\\n&gt;Put it into the private realm with heavy oversight and regulation.\\n\\nNo. This would accomplish fuck all. It would still be a political football like PG&amp;E only less accountable and more likely to offshore public funds like PG&amp;E.  He\\'s a russian controlled asset who happened to put sanctions on Russia? And also colluded with Ukraine, who Russia doesn\\'t like?  And increased domestic oil production which further weakens Russia?  Magnum sized of course.  a  a  That\\'s a good gang member. Snitches get stitches  Do you accuse me of lying, sir???1?!1?!1one  Really? That\\'s what scares you? There are hundreds of thousands of extra people there right now at one of the most well known public spaces in the world.  Along with usual riff raff in midtown.  The NYPD aren\\'t saints,  but jeez, I love seeing an organized force for a night like tonight.  Especially live in midtown.  Why can’t you just quote what you think it means.\\n\\nAre you talking about the entire process of bail? Are you against bail?  Implying as if Republicans don\\'t run for office in New York. But sure. If you could show me Democrats that are against the current legislation on bail bonds, then sure. You changed my mind.  “Why won’t these fucking doors close?”\\n\\n*dead body is blocking the doorway*  Nah, I’m retired.  I don’t give a fuck.  This is what hell looks like  It’s almost as if a gullible, senile, stupid old man like tRump can be taken advantage of by multiple groups of people each manipulating him to advance their own interests.  I can\\'t stress this enough and always tell my family members who come to NYC for New Years Eve. Unless you\\'re trying to see all the performances around Time Square (most people wait a little before New Years Eve or 1-3 am in the freezing cold weather for those good spots) you\\'ll have a better time watching the fireworks from Central Park or Prospect Park. These days you can stream those events in Time Square on your phone from a less crowded area. \\n\\nAs someone who came to NYC from London, my family waited in Time Square for most of New Years Eve during our first year in NYC. It simply wasn\\'t worth it. The things you see on TV only shows the good side of the event and the conditions for attending the event itself are terrible.  Hm. Interesting question. And I can’t claim to speak on behalf of everyone who promotes this theory. But my own perspective is that it may well be that there are some institutions of prejudice against Asian people in the US (although nothing like the ones against blacks people) and that therefore a black person participating in those forms of prejudice and discrimination would fairly be called racist.  Oh sure. And *Kristallnacht* had nothing to do with Hitler. /s 🙄  &gt;Permissiveness = lower stress\\n\\n&gt;shame they weren\\'t burnt at the stake or hanged  I abuse someone’s rights at least once a day. I don’t get paid for that day if I don’t abuse my power at least once  [removed]  NYPD wearing the same gear for basically 20 years now, they’re just standing around having a briefing for a super busy event. Calm down.  https://dailycaller.com/2019/12/30/new-york-anti-semitic-bail-reform-tiffany-harris/\\n\\nSearch felony  That police presence is what gets the job done. If there is a mass chaos break out, these guys would handle may be ten percent of the situation.  I can smell that much douche from here.  Well obviously. It\\'s the only size they come in!  Maybe one day people will stop doing this on NYE. I’m not sure how much money it would take for me to do this. Probably a lot. More than $10K  Yeah, I’m not sure when they made it that strict. I’m assuming it was after 9/11 and a result of Bloomberg’s obsession with orderliness. \\n\\nI’d have to ask around but I’m fairly certain it was something that you could drop in and do as part of an overall night rather than *the* thing for your night.\\n\\nNYE in New York has gotten brutal. It used to be a thing that you could bar hop and just enjoy the evening. Now, every single place, even the shittiest neighborhood bar, wants to do a champagne cheers and charge $75.  The rent will remain too damn high.  The degree of MTA suckage will continue to inch up or down depending on the whims of Albany.  Showtime will continue to be the time that it is.  In March there will be a kerfuffle about plastic bags being banned and then everyone will calm down and move on.  People will continue to protest homeless shelters but not homelessness and NYCHA will continue to crumble.  Fabulous outfits will be spotted.  Chase Bank of America will continue its Borg-like assault on brick and mortar real estate, Amazon will move in anyway.  Bloomberg will continue to Bloomberg.  The ocean will swallow up a few more inches of city.  I’ve done it zero times. I’m good for life too  it seems like you don\\'t understand how bail works  we\\'re not looking for excuses, just results  Honestly I would do it for 5K  You couldn\\'t pay me to go there tonight...well ok I\\'d do it for a few grand  Or hell, stay home  You tryin\\' to say I look jewish?  The people who attacked Jews on Kristallnacht were fierce supporters of Hitler....what do you know about the attackers in this video (or the perpetrators of any of the attacks on Jews we\\'ve seen in nyc over the past few months) that makes you think they\\'re Trump supporters at all?  Smart move  &gt; pussies\\n\\nLol you sure showed me.  Why does anyone give a shit about this ball in the first place?  When did it become such a big deal and why?  That\\'s only $200 a ticket tonight  I did NYE in (near) Times Square twice in the before times. (Basically, the 80s, but before 9/11 it was different)\\n\\nWe didn\\'t stand out all day. Once it was a group at a restaurant on Broadway, with a window facing the ball. (they had done this for a few years, it was my first time with them)\\n\\nThe next year, my girlfriend &amp; I had dinner nearby and tried to get there. A crowd was walking up 6th Avenue because 49th street was the first street open. Got onto Broadway as the ball was dropping.\\n\\nAnd then we retired from that. I don\\'t think I could do it now, even if I were 25 again.  Where is the outrage?  Agreed. Nothing else to prove.  London murders in 2018: 132\\n\\nNYC murders in 2018: 289\\n\\nThe two metro areas are roughly the same size.  I think she’s doing this just to get some movie passes or Mets tickets, the more court appearances she has the more she gets  You posted an easy target.  But everyone on this thread is acting like we wouldn\\'t scarf several dozen breadsticks and a trough of rotating pasta dishes and have the best NYE ever the second no one was looking  What gets me is that it you look in a dictionary you\\'ll see multiple definitions of \"race\", and at least one of those will absolutely encompass \"ethnicity\". If you say Jews aren\\'t a race, there\\'s a sense in which that\\'s true, but there\\'s a more commonly accepted sense in which it\\'s false. If you actually have a point to make, you\\'re not doing yourself any favors by using this language and pretending your favorite definition is the only one that exists. (Academics do this all the time, too.)\\n\\nBut I don\\'t think there\\'s really that much nuance in this woman\\'s position. \\n\\nYou can make an argument that prejudice based on someone\\'s choices (like religious practice) is different than prejudice based on things outside of their control (like birthplace or skin color). But, like, I don\\'t think you\\'re going to win many hearts with the \"Jews would be fine if they\\'d just drop that whole Judaism thing\" sentiment, either, so...  Don\\'t think so. Link me a recent post that has a direct link to a nypost article to prove me wrong.  All the \"she\\'s right\" comments in the background\\n\\nYikes \\n\\nEarly 20th century here come agaiiin  &gt;\"Antisocial behavior\" is just a Puritanical nannyfucker\\'s code word for \"people having fun.\"\\n\\nI disagree. I think antisocial behavior I was imagining in this case as drunk idiots starting fights, breaking things and relieving themselves in the street. Are you familiar with what the average British high street looks like at 2 in the morning?  It’s a *comparison*: that means, it has many things in common (i.e., “comparable”), NOT that it is identical event. In this case, the relevant commonality that in Kristallnacht you had people egged on by Hitler’s hateful rhetoric and here we have people similarity encouraged to give in to hate as a result of tRump’s hate.  Yes, and I don\\'t mind it -- it actually sounds far more fun than the graveyards that many US cities become at 2 am.  im trying to figure out which bar to go to with a significant other. any suggestions?  I bring home a paycheck.  She is satisfied.  OK, well as I said in the beginning you can go live in a place where that behavior is tolerated and I\\'ll continue to live in a place where society has deemed that unacceptable.\\n\\nI disagree that British people have better health outcomes because they have a culture that promotes excessive drinking.  If you\\'re being sarcastic, you should add an /s because it\\'s not obvious.  Why are you lying, that list literally has manslaughter and aggravated vehicular manslaughter on it....  Hey now. Reddit might hate cops but not as much as they love redditors. None of their own can possibly be bad.  Yeah, they did that... look up Kiryas Joel... [shudder]  Well, fuck you and people like you for ruining everything that\\'s fun about living in the US.  In the 80s, it used to be legal to drink in the street in NYC, and no one cared about fireworks.  People like you are the problem -- hope you get some slow, painful, degenerative disease despite your \"healthy\" lifestyle and your support of ramming this shit down other people\\'s throats.  Sure, I wish harm on you too buddy. Happy new year.  Uh, you can do that. You could easily do that in America. Even in the NYC, tonight. Just not in Times Square, and I wouldn\\'t want to anyway. Come to my neighborhood - every holiday is a street party with fireworks.  smh, they let the worlds biggest gang just gather around like that to intimidate people.  Ah, Washington Heights\\n\\nThe NYC neighborhood that is the epitome of class, civility and way above city-wide average crime rates  agree!!!  What area is this -- I\\'m seriously up for a fun night out tonight.  this isn\\'t a conversation about agency. it\\'s perfectly fine to point out shitty priorities  If they are stealing purses and shitting in public they are criminals and should be put in jail  9/11 def changed it and 4th of July. I\\'m glad I went to Times Sq as a kid to see the ball drop in 2000 but after 9/11, overcrowding due to all the security checkpoints was so crazy that my family stopped going to the city for NYE &amp; Macy\\'s fireworks altogether.  How many years experience do you have? Send me a DM.  Seriously some one needs to smack her upside the head  This just about confirms it.  I\\'m ordering in Chinese and watching a movie.\\n\\nGoing to bars in that area isn\\'t going to be much fun either.  https://old.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/ehwq3i/homeless_man_turns_manhattan_whole_foods_into_his/  I remember you could drive your car on the staten island ferry.  You know how there\\'s some people who have it on their bucket list to go to NYE in Times Square at least once?\\n\\nI have it on my bucket list that it\\'s a win if I make it through my entire life without ever doing that. Even once. I\\'m afraid some day, maybe next year, maybe decades from now, one of my family members or close visiting friend is going to rope me into doing it \"just this one time\" and I\\'ll have failed in my goal.  Diapers. Nah dog. Commando  I’m still waiting for the first brave soul to say that they are attending NYE in Times Square today and excited about it.  Really?  You can dislike bullshit like this and still be ok with the grime of NYC. Do you play your music on your cellphone speaker too?  yeah f that wind with exposed ears  But let\\'s circle back to that \"don\\'t go at all\" idea, I feel like it had a lot of steam.  You misunderstand how cash bail is supposed to work. It is NOT supposed to be, we require you to post money that you don’t have, so we get to keep you in jail. Rather, the idea is that you are required to post money in order to guarantee that you show up back in court.\\n\\nIf you don’t think people should be released, then advocate for just not releasing them. Being denied bail is an option. But if you are making bail high with the express purpose of keeping someone in jail rather than ensuring they return for trial, you are misusing the bail system.  Filters the News too. And I agree that it\\'s a garbage rag, but it\\'s one of the only sources of local news left in this city and sometimes you got to post a link to it  That is  A+ New Yorking, sir. Well done  He got his shit rocked first, like he deserves.  Used to live in Times Square (last old tenement shitty walk up building), did NYE a number of times, was awesome each and every time. If you can swing a hotel, just to do it once I think is a great bucket list thing to do...energy is amazing, positivity is infectious and  really it\\'s not as bad as it looks.  as a kid my poster was filled with nyc posters, l thought the early 90s knicks were best thing ever  And don\\'t forget Asians are sometimes in or out of the \"coalition\" depending on who needs to use them to beat on another group.  Well he is a Post reader so no surprise there  &gt; Hey look at the bill.

New York and California are lost to us. We barely try to win those states. Furthermore, there is disdain for the leaders of these states because the Impeachment campaign tactic for 2020 is led by reps from (CA: Adam Schiff, Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters. NY: Jerry Nadler, Eliot Engel, Carolyn Maloney). So, we should build a wall around these states.

Thanks for sharing &amp; happy new year  Just be like me and have nobody to hang out with and stay home drinking and thinking about how you’ll always be alone and this is all your life will ever amount to  on my way home there was a ring of cops standing the top of the subway entrance at 35th and broadway, I got to let out a great \"Excuse me sir\" lol  For drunk drivers?

I’m sorry but why would we want police NOT to catch drunk drivers..?

So what exactly is injury? You need to be hospitalized for that? It’s so fucked up.  [removed]  Glad to do it.  You\\'re welcome.  I wanna say it was before 9/11 but I don\\'t remember for sure. I went once, never again. I think it was in the 90s. \\n\\nCops are always useless in those damn things (like marathons) too, they don\\'t tell you how you can get across or into the subway entrance or whatever.  Not being able to drink on NYE is my personal definition of Hell, though others\\' may vary.  Ok. Done  I\\'d love seeing people free to have fun, lighting sparklers, popping corks on champagne bottles on the street without a bunch of spoilsports in blue ruining their good time.  Because the man is keeping us down from running over more new yorkers  There have been Blacks victimizing Jews in Brooklyn for decades.\\n\\n&gt;tRump\\n\\nWhat do you get out of spelling it like that?  This sub is also full of brigaders from Teh_Ronald and similar places.  Wish I could defend this on account of the bootlicking, but, sadly, I cannot.  Working around the corner from this shit  times square is named after time itself and so the nye celebrations actually go back to year one! nyc is so cool  I\\'ve heard stories \\n\\nWhat\\'s worse, NYE or West Indian parade? \\n\\nI\\'ve heard the latter **was** a popular form of informal CD?  I just read the entire Wikipedia article. It\\'s, in practice, a theocratic ethno-state. Something interesting is that it has extreme poverty yet no homelessness or random crime.  https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2019/S1509C\\n\\nRead the source, lier. Stop lying, you’re wrong.  Yes and the JFK is still the best boat in the fleet.  What accountability do those groups have for these problems? Perhaps you could pitch a rough percentage?  De Blasio will leave office...NYC will ne better for it.  If I were you I\\'d just take the 7 train across to Hudson Yards and avoid all the mess at street level  You can disguise your booze, the cops really don\\'t give you a hard time if you\\'re respectful and aren\\'t flaunting it (or messy), especially after 11pm, everyone is pretty much settled in and having a good time.  Inside or outside?  Kill him.  You literally have no rebuttal to your casual abuse of the English language other than epik MEME insults. \\n\\nOkay, gotcha. Nice talking to you, Mr. Strawman.  Street justice  &gt; nor random crime\\n\\nNot that they report to the state, anyway.  I did that  There definitely a resurgence in the spats. Seems  like the powder keg has blown its lid.  This is nothing new. Ever heard of the crown heights riots?  Most of the 1% are Jewish.  Prob was at its height in the 80s.  These seem to be isolated.  I feel for you, I was at work by 7am this morning and it was empty. The asshat population began doubling by the hour.  &gt; What do you get out of spelling it like that?\\n\\nWhy not? Donnie made his own spin on it with “Trump” (actual name of his grandparents was “Drumph”) so if he’s not gonna use his own name neither am I.  Oooh dem motherfucking bootleg fireworks, shit!  [black hebrew Israelites](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/nyregion/black-hebrew-israelites-jersey-city-suspects.html)  Yeah, I love fucking with them by posting radical shit. They\\'re like trained dogs, esp when they get all aroused by gang-downvoting. Fuck those miserable losers. Come on boys, let your impotence shine!  No matter where you are in the car vs bike vs pedestrian battle we can all agree that drunk driving is 100% unacceptable.  Just to clarify the OP video is way old but foreshadows the increase in publicized attacks of the last months.  Not reporting it is itself a crime.  No, some outlets are worse than others, it ain\\'t an equal problem across all newspapers. There are very bad culprits who do it an espcially large amount. Don\\'t dismiss blame when it\\'s given by saying all are to blame. Some in particular are to blame.  Is spending the night there an option? Seriously. Or at least hiding out until well after midnight.  Here\\'s a long comment I wrote in another thread.\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/ei5cux/opinion_how_to_protect_new_yorks_jews/fcnrtsp/  https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/11/14/tabloid-fuels-collective-anxiety-attack-over-bail-ban pretty good explanation. short version is that some defendants are placed under supervised release, where non profits work closely to ensure they show up to court and also help get them into programs such as group therapy, etc, and there are occasionally rewards that come through donors to the non profits, which, in one instance of a group of juveniles, was a trip to a mets game.  Hasidic Jews and mostly black neighborhoods over lap each other, and i just feels sometimes Hasidic Jews are non-inclusive. I mean i know it\\'s probably due to their religion. But i feel the tension rises because they really don\\'t participate in each other communities. They each keep to themselves and that causes some anger and mistrust. It\\'s been that way for years going all the way back to the Crown Heights riots.  There’s nothing ghetto about this at all. She’s “informed”, woke, aware, and lucid. Her criticisms come from a place of education about her community’s issues, not trash.\\n\\nHer actions are obviously trashy. But don’t try to feign that she’s coming from ignorance. This attack was driven by “knowledge.”  No. All are to blame. Some are more to blame. \\n\\nGuess you don’t realize they all do it because your biases prevent you from seeing it on your side.  haha whenever people ask \"WhY don\\'T yoU gO\" i\\'m always like \"I don\\'t like going there normally, why would I want to go when it\\'s 5x more packed\"  So how many more replies before you realize you\\'ve been responding to someone else? Also having read all 266 pages page 90 is about advertising.  That’s exactly how I’m advocating for it to be. It should be insurmountably detrimental for me to not return to court. You and I may see differently on the amount, but do you agree this is the wrong way to go about it?  just DM\\'d you!  You mean the bad old days?  You can get some good shit if you drive to Pennsylvania. 500 gram show cakes and 5” mortars.  Weird. This is exactly how my klansman grandfather talks about black people, although he doesn\\'t call them black people.  Well just make your point then.  Because Jews study in school.  If I did half the things she did to jews I would be in jail because she\\'s black and I\\'m white but somehow this isn\\'t a hate crime?  I hope someone fucks her up.  No I think we\\'re agreeing, if you say some are more to blame. You can realize all are to blame, to some amount, and still also realize saying that saying that doesn\\'t excuse it. So not sure why you would even say that.\\n\\nPointing out the major culprits isn\\'t dismissed by saying all are to blame, cause they aren\\'t all to blame equally.  Gulianni is a shitty person but crime went down greatly under his tenue.  Why are people acting like she has schizophrenia. These are mainstream opinions from her neighborhood wrapped up in a loud, curse filled rant. She’s clearly an educated and employed woman.  Antidotal facts make your argument irrelevant when presented with a counter antidotal fact:\\n\\nI’ve lived here 17 years and my life is a 100% better than it was 10 years ago.  I actually managed to get home and the trains weren’t even packed! Got to leave at 4 and only annoying thing was people blowing those little horn things in my face. New year resolution is definitely finding a job away from that hell!  Neo-nazi, Neocon, or Neolib? Because the latter two are actually very fond of Jews.  Please take as much video as you can. We cannot continue allowing our city to slide back towards the 80s. \\n\\nBut be careful, who knows what could set them off. Be discreet.  I was at a pizza show at 3am on 3rd and 58th when a drunk dude started going crazy. I called the cops.  \\n\\nThey were there in 30 seconds. \\n\\nI think you drank too much hateraide and are now puking bullshit.  I feel that for sure. I worked in The Paramount building in \\'15 and it was hellish. Glad you escaped safely.  &gt; So far as I can tell, all the offenses in the document you linked are either misdemeanors or non-violent felonies.\\n\\nThe actual full list also includes strangulation in the 2nd degree. Assault of a police officer. I made another comment about this. So no it\\'s not just \"non-violent felonies\". 2nd degree rape is also on the list as an aside.  Nah, they don\\'t really harass you if you ignore them. If you have bags and you\\'re headed to JFK you can just say you\\'re a New Yorker and they know the scam won\\'t work. There\\'s always people around and I\\'ve confronted them multiple times with no issues outside of them raising their voices.  When was this video taken? I feel like it makes a difference if it was this morning vs. 2017. [u/Cumzilla-420](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cumzilla-420/) any insight?  This is the way.  Oh yeah for sure.  And yet it’s the political context for what’s happening right now. Don’t act like this isn’t a searingly relevant video right now.  Crime went down everywhere in the US during that time -- one theory is less lead in the environment due to leaded gas being banned.  Also, I\\'d rather be somewhere fun than 100% safe.  I\\'m not a coward who wants Big Brother to protect him from everything.  Everyone talks about Jews being awful landlords, but no one wants to bring up African-Americans being terrible tenants.  You try scrubbing human shit off a bathroom wall, patch bullet holes in dry wall, or having to pay a hazmat crew to clean out a meth lab, and see how long you last. Not all of them are awful, but let\\'s not ignore the elephant in the room. How do you compensate for this? You jack up rent prices for the occasions where you have to repair the damage, and everybody gets mad because you\\'re charging too much for an awful apartment. It\\'s a vicious cycle.  Historical context is not flame fanning. Murder and assaults don’t happen in a vacuum, they happen sandwiches between years of alterations just like this one.  You\\'re a fucking idiot.  Of course you can disguise it -- my point is, you shouldn\\'t have to ... in many cities that aren\\'t run by authoritarian asshats, you can pop a cork in public on NYE and not have to drink furtively like you\\'re living in Saudi Arabia.  r/geopolitics is a good a place to learn about geopolitics as r/science is to learn about science.  Ramapo.  Humans are remarkably bad at evaluating risks.  The sarcasm was pretty obvious to me  or, better yet, look up an organization who\\'s willing to drag him to court. There are literally dozens.  get that gun out of my face, Mando.  That\\'s a theory though not fact.  The funniest thing to me was when people called \"Al Sharpton one of our greatest leaders\". If Al Sharpton is the best America has, then I\\'m moving to a log cabin in Alaska.  It makes much more sense than \"King Rudy is our Saviour\", since crime decreased even in cities that didn\\'t enact his Draconian measures.  Come in March-May, or Oct-Nov.  Do not come in summer. I know, AL knows it’s heat. Doesn’t matter. \\n\\nSummers here are 100+ in the shade in Manhattan due to the urban heat island effect. Basically, all the cars and AC units are blowing heat into the air and it has nowhere to go. So a 90 deg day becomes a 100 deg day. Every day for weeks on end. Nights are pegged in the 80s in the city because of the residual heat emanating from the concrete and black top. \\n\\nThe subways are definitely up around 105-110. Bums get heat stroke and are wearing weeks of poop in their pants. \\n\\nWinters are super variable. You can wind up with 10F and howling winds. That’s a lot of money to spend to wind up with miserable walking conditions. Or it could be relatively gentle, like good enough to play outdoor basketball on 12/31, like today. \\n\\nSo - come in the shoulder seasons. Hedge your bets.  No. They\\'re both crazy, but they\\'re two distinct flavors of crazy.  Inwood. I mean, it\\'s much more of an outdoor party during the summer holidays. But people are definitely setting off their own fireworks and getting drunk outside. If you don\\'t know anyone though, I\\'m not sure how fun it would be.  Idk, calm down?\\n\\nActual point is slapping people on the streets doesn\\'t seem to be a big of enough deal to require bail. It is also at the courts own discretion to do so and none of the articles give enough detail to say whether or not she won\\'t show up to court.\\n\\n&gt; In cases other than as described in subdivision four of this     7  section the court shall release the principal pending trial on the prin-     8  cipal\\'s own recognizance, unless the court finds on the record or in     9  writing that release on the principal\\'s own recognizance will not    10  reasonably assure the principal\\'s return to court.\\n\\nI\\'m not quoting subdivision 4 because the line numbers suck.  The Black Hebrew Israelites are less Jewish than the Messianic Jews.  I should move back uptown, unfortunately, my GF wants to move to some fossilized part of Queens that\\'s full of old people and breeders with kids.  Troll smarter, not harder.  Disagree.   Complete, cogent sentences does not imply reachable.\\n\\nI have a cousin who is a successful lawyer.  Doesn\\'t seem to be racist.  Has two kids in university whom he loves more than anything else.  Very smart guy.  Jewish.   And yet, he\\'s a Trump supporter.\\n\\nI\\'ve had endless discussions with him that I thought were iron-clad, but he sticks to his guns.  Unreachable.\\n\\nLike I believe this woman to be.  So what does that have to do in a debate about a bill that allowed “democrats to release prisoners because they vote for them”?  There’s no trash cans, not nearly enough to accommodate that crowd. First: security risk (bombs) so they get rid of all hiding spaces. Second: you’re jammed in there. No way to move to the can even if you wanted to be polite and use the trash can. \\n\\nAn army of cleaners move in on 1/1. By 1/2, there nothing left but bits of confetti. It’s pretty amazing how fast they clean up that mess. Winds up looking better on 1/3 than on any given day at a normal time of year.  Replace \"Jews\" with \"Blacks\" and you have the NIMBY motto.  Most of the groups doing this hate Trump as well.  Why does a picture of counties have a comment about senators?  I mean, when you have a million people in a half mile radius you gotta have some rules... I was in Times Square before and after 9/11 when they started cracking down on the booze and I gotta say, don\\'t mind the restrictions so much, it is way less of a shitshow–the vomiting and fights and stuff are almost non-existent, so it\\'s really a trade off, but I can def understand that it\\'s not for everyone.  Because they\\'re jealous of Jewish success and achievement?  \"No thanks.. I won\\'t be needing the card.. I\\'ll be the one evading fares... On second thought ill take the metro cards.. Yea I umm.. Might need them\"  It’s the only piece of uniform equipment that looks better on women than men. I always used to think, I’m sitting here all toasty and I look, if not cute, at least not ridiculous.  Vomiting and fights make it fun ... not everything needs to be sanitized and safe for suburbanite whelps.  What are you talking about? Republicans love Jews and non-Chinese Asians. They\\'re wealthy, hardworking, literate, not allied to a hostile power and don\\'t commit a disproportionately large amount of crime.  Look up Ramapo, and all the other countless undocumented stories like it littered throughout Brooklyn for the last 10 years.\\n\\nPeople are acting like this came out of nowhere when they just been living in the dark about it. This violence has been there the entire time but was never recognized as a pattern until now.  I recall walking through Times Square without much issue in the early afternoon of Dec 31 1999.  I also had dinner with coworkers at Virgil\\'s not far from Times Square, and don\\'t remember any hassle.  We were a bunch of sysadmins watching the Y2K countdown with beer and chain restaurant BBQ.  The stock exchange itself or the technologies divisions at 100/110 wall st?  &gt; “democrats to release prisoners because they vote for them”?\\n\\nNothing and thats my point, its just some nutter from td saying that.  2021  what\\'s with the german on the bottom of the poster?  No NYC politician voted on this legislation.  Hey Hoboken.. do you know how state laws get passed?  They would just end up shooting 10 ten innocent people and then claim they saved the day.  Surrounded by pigs too  125 Street Station  It\\'s a fine idea but if my insurance is with doctors who are at say Columbia and there is a doctor at NYC who does the same procedure for 10k less I\\'m stuck paying more. Fix the insurance scam please.  I fucking hate that station.  Well, yeah... Republicans were in charge on 9/11. Republican mayor of NYC, Republican governor...\\n\\nAnd yes, this is as disingenuous as all of your other comments here today.  You have Trump Derangement Syndrome  Most annoying instrument  Either to be honest - am curious about the following:\\n\\n1. Is there a cohesive/broad corporate culture or is it more tribal by department? \\n\\n2. Can you actually make career moves I.e. get promoted for strong performance or is more of a tread water type of place?\\n\\n3. How old-school or new school is it? Does the company randomly drug test employees? Is it an investment bank type of vibe or more of a tech company environment  No but I dont get all bent out of shape when people do. It\\'s a city; there are assholes. Live with it.  Will the real Ray please stand up.  Hey Astoria. Do you? It typically takes people at all levels supporting. Astoria do you know who’s giving out the Mets tickets? The city.  There\\'s just not a whole lot of communication between the two groups even if they live side by side. There\\'s claims that the Jewish people are racist on some of the extreme, that the Black people are dangerous on the other extreme. But overall, they just never talk. When some shit happens, first response is to get pissed.  It’s a trap!  Galaxy brain take here. Rudy and George caused 9/11.  Fun is against the law.  mirror?  wut  No one said that tho.  I love that this simple fact is downvoted so highly. \\n\\nThankfully we don\\'t live in a system of mob rule (yet), and everyone that downvoted you just has to deal with it.  I was an intern a few years ago as a disclaimer.\\n\\n1. I personally felt it was a bit more tribal unless you were a higher level only then would you see more cross team type tasks. Weekly meetings with just the department and everyone just went around to say what they are working on and any roadblocks they are facing.\\n\\n2. You can make career moves but you’ll have to get known and this really depends on your manager delegating after you express interest in helping with more cross functional stuff. Being a strong performer in just your departments work may warn you a promotion in 2 yrs but the real level growth seemed to depend on cross functional value. \\n\\n3. Definitely old school where I was. You got drug tested to get employed but not sure if there is ever any follow up. Depending on what you do you could spend hours in silence as the office by the cubicles was truly work space.  Banter was reserved for meetings or coffee/kitchen breaks. Tools were also archaic so definitely not a tech startup type feel.  The night before Weat Indian Day Parade.  Ah sorry for the miscommunication then, that’s on me. I saw the M user name and link and made a stupid assumption. My bad!  Always inside, get warm.  &gt; Im hella agnostic\\n\\num \\'kay\\n\\n&gt; and it\\'s so fucking clear to see how awesomely bad diversity really is.\\n\\nWhat does your being agnostic have to do with your views on diversity?\\n\\n&gt; Mentally Ill people out on the streets\\n\\nApparently some of them are in their mom\\'s basement trolling Reddit  So basically a classic New York power company vibe? Not necessarily a bad thing, has its pros and cons...\\n\\nThank you so much for the information - really appreciate you taking the time sir  Everything looks better on woman.  Real hip hop.  Not this mumble shit.  What’s your point? Why are we talking about how hardworking or literate someone is? Are you also saying they like them because they’re wealthy. Would republicans not like them if they were not wealthy? \\n\\nLove is a strong word too. A word that creates something opposed to love. So I’m wondering who don’t republicans like?\\n\\nLike I never mentioned Republicans. I mentioned conservatives but they are not the same thing although I recognize the equivalence.  I downvoted you because lots of people haven’t been to nyc, and you posted a picture that’s on the internet a 1,000 times over.  They do it so they can say they did it.  That and for online “likes”.  You couldn’t pay me $1,000 to go sit there all day just to watch a ball slowly slide down a pole.  I guess you don\\'t know how state laws get passed. \\n\\nHey Hoboken... you know what sucks? Hoboken.  LOL, Nah, had enough of that shit in High School. Have a happy and fun New Year...  Let’s put him in steel cage with the anto-semitic black woman and let things settle themselves.  Yeah true if you get the rockstar return offer which can be 270k first year but drops to like 180k the next. For Google, you’d have to get approved for an L4 offer to aim that high as the highest they give to new grad L3 offers are 220k amortized.  Yep basically. This question resonated with me because I made the same assessment. I left finance entirely after that internship and pivoted to media tech instead. It’s the total opposite with more chill work environments (casual dress, more modern startup office vibe etc.)\\n\\nI heard from someone who stayed that Promotion’s there required manager submission plus feedback assessments from 2 people (one at and one above your level who isn’t your manager). So knowing people matters.  I’m claustrophobic I’ll die in that crowd.  The punishment for not showing up to court should be additional charges, not financial ruin.\\n\\nIt\\'s not the 1700s anymore.  Back then if you rode your horse 50 miles and slightly altered your facial hair you could live an entirely new life.  You can\\'t hide from the police forever.\\n\\nAlso, the punishment aspect of cash bail ignores the fact that often the people putting up the money aren\\'t the accused, it is their family.  If I\\'m a shithead, what do I care that my grandma put up her house to get me out?  I\\'m not going back to jail  To the surprise of no one who has actually been there.  As someone who lived in Astoria likely longer then. I can tell you’ve never been to Hoboken.  The Jews marched with blacks in the 60s during the MLK civil rights marches, etc.  The same crowd turned to Farakhan and NOI. They are staunchly antimsemitic. Jews actually died on busrides but the recompense took a while.  Now, here it is.  It\\'s not a smart community. It\\'s ladies with no husbands, usually nurses, those types, but their kids have guns and like rap music and gang culture. There is no solution.  People like \\nSharpton aka Tawana Brawley Al, poisoned things for good.  De Blasio has gone further and is giving gift bags and Mets tickets to released criminals  I really can\\'t help but cringe at these.\\n\\nThe nice, normal person in me wants to tell you guys to have a fun trip! I\\'ve never been on the observation deck, and I can imagine how insane it must be to explore the city when you\\'ve never been.\\n\\nBut as a complete asshole who\\'s always lived here? Man I wish I lived this life man. Your biggest issue in NYC is going down the wrong set of stairs lol. Other cities have to feel this too. I can imagine if I go to Venice to ogle the gondolas some Venetian guy is slowly getting pissed at the guy who comes to his marvelous city to look at boats.\\n\\nBut I\\'m just a bad person. Go explore more! You should reserve a day to just walking! My favorite walk is the 3 bridges walk, along with strolling up or down Broadway anywhere from Battery to 34th. Do the whole thing if you\\'d like, it\\'s fun to see stuff.  Yea it\\'s an ad I saw in berlin  just don\\'t! :)  We need police in the Subway  De Blasio  just don\\'t buy stuff! :)  Really been that long, huh?  Because the New York Post is trash. \\n\\n*This message and subreddit are sponsored by the New York Daily News!*  How do the transfers work when u pay with ur card/phone at the OMNY turnstiles?  Came here to see if people were whining about tourists having fun. Yup, they are.  Yep. The place was madness.  Kaskade is playing at Marquee tonight, and Above &amp; Beyond at NY Expo Center. \\n\\nI’ll list concert venues as well as clubs, but try Webster Hall, Terminal 5, Playstation Theater, Marquee, and Lavo in Manhattan. In Brooklyn there’s Avant Gardner, Brooklyn Steel, Schimanski, and Elsewhere. There’s more but these are the ones I frequent the most. \\n\\nKeep in mind that Marquee and Lavo have pretty strict dress codes and sometimes enforce an even guy/girl ratio in your party (not ideal if you’re a lone guy). \\n\\nSchimanski and Elsewhere also cater to the more techno/deep house crowd, where the other venues cater to a wider variety/more “mainstream”. \\n\\nAlso if you try and go anywhere tonight it’ll be stupidly overpriced. For a more comprehensive list, check edmtrain.com.  National Guard  The union can’t let him get fired until the investigation is over. People in this thread clearly have no clue how this works. The department is not allowed to just fire anyone. Despite this obviously being a good reason.  Is this a joke or is it serious? If it\\'s serious, that\\'s fucking fascinating. Have any sources/links?  Lmao this is almost parody  Appreciate it! Hope media tech is going well for you, it’s a good industry  I live in alphabet City and I don\\'t think any roof in this area is tall enough to see the ball drop. It\\'s also pretty damn far away. Did you use binoculars?  :/ any good alternatives now that this one\\'s kicked the bucket?  thx so much for the info, l would be content seeing the knicks at msg  Let’s set up a turret system.  Used to be that stupid Russian hat, but now they allow knit caps.  Thank you for putting it succinctly!  Same.  Because the media says so....This is nothing new.  You could stay on the SI ferry for hours and just drink beers enjoying the view. Now you have to get off.  Half the people on LinkedIn has that title. CEO and founder of some bullshit organization or company.  https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/a-ball-of-a-time-a-history-of-the-new-years-eve-ball-drop?verso=true&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_brand=tny&amp;utm_social-type=owned  man your city is a shithole lmao  Damn this is bad. Violent criminals are more valued in NY than Trump supporters. \\n\\nThe Soviets put the violent criminals in charge of the political dissidents in the gulags.\\n\\nRIP NY.  &gt;refuse to be cowed into some sort of white guilt\\n\\nGood. White guilt doesn\\'t fix anything. Fixing the problems caused by systemic racism is everyone\\'s responsibility. You shouldn\\'t feel guilty for something you aren\\'t responsible for. You should feel empowered seeing injustice that you have the power to identify and change.  Please tell me there\\'s a video. The one I watched cuts off early after he starts walking away.  Thanks for the response. How about in Long Island?  Thank you.  I mean his plan was the most ridiculous &amp; absurd thing I have ever seen. Usually when someone does something really idiotic it’s because they have poor/no impulse control, but his was a deliberate &amp; premeditated act that would never work except to see him caught.  Smoke a bunch of weed and watch drunk people get loaded into NYPD vans  You tried for a semantic argument and failed miserably by (probably deliberately) misinterpreting what I said. That\\'s pretty pathetic. \\n\\nAnd to top it off, you don\\'t even know what \"strawman\" means.  Black peoples are hella racist and never get called out for it. As you see in this thread, Reddit trying to rationalize their behavior when they’re simply anti Semitic  You forgot the /s  '"
