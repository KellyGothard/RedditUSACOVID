&amp;#x200B;

I’ll summarize some points from the article. The author shared how New York accomplished this goal through much different means than other states. Rather than massive utility-scale solar projects, NY has become a national leader through distributed generation, such as community solar. You can learn more about this here, which is where I work. Community solar projects are bigger than what you see on rooftops, but smaller than 5 megawatts in NY.

&amp;#x200B;

The author also talks about how this is an exciting accomplishment, and he does a good job making it clear that there’s still a lot of work to be done. For example, there’s a statewide target to hit 6 GW by 2025, yet SEIA estimates we’re only going to install 3.6 GW. However, a 2011 study by CUNY estimates that 2/3 of all NYC rooftops are eligible for solar. As the price continues to come down, this is an exciting prospect as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m looking forward to how we can continue to shape the electric grid and bring more distributed energy projects online across New York and the country. Happy New Year!",newyork,NY is now a top solar state! Great way to start the next decade! Great way to start the new decade

Trying to spread awareness so that other women do not go through this due to work with him like many others have. Over the last few years many women, often junior staff, newer social media influencers or younger models working or interacting with him otherwise, due to his line of work, have experienced this inappropriate behavior by him. His sexual misconduct has ranged from making sexually graphic remarks, inappropriate jokes, commenting on the appearances, attractiveness, clothes and bodies to unwanted touching under the pretext of being friendly and is passed off as that by some of his male colleagues and friends; it is anything but. 

Work travel for him is meetings during the day but evenings filled with invites to women from work and at times even female escorts from certain services for elaborate dinners, drinks and partying at nightclubs with him getting completely drunk and trying to get too physically close for comfort with the women present. 

Telling HR or anyone else doesn't really work when up against the power and wealth of such individuals. Whether workplace or his social circle interests, to ignore or reject his attention only leads to being blacklisted- no jobs, no business opportunities  no friends/contacts from that field of work or those circles and cities due to his influence which keeps the women quiet.",newyork,"Sexual misconduct by founder, Silicon valley"

Never been to NYC. Hoping to go in March for doctor's appointmentz There are so many airports there!! I can't fly non-stop so does it make a difference if I land at JFK, EWR or LGA?? Appointment is in Manhatten on Park Avenue so looking at google maps it appears to make more sense to fly into LGA?? I was think about renting a car at the airport. Thoughts?

We are a regular middle income family, was hoping to make Manhatten sort of home base as we need to see doctor twice while we are there for 6-7 days, and then sight see the other days. I’m 23 and just looking for something clean, not fancy. Would I find any hotels I could afford in Manhatten? A fridge/microwave in room would be nice but not necessity.

Lastly, considering the main big things people want to see, would staying in Manhatten sound okay or should we stay in another area of the city and plan to travel more to doctor's appointment?

Thanks so much in advance. All the options seem very overwhelming,",newyork,"Canadian staying in town for an operation, need advice!!"

(1) STEP ONE: DMV RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS

* Make sure your residential address is up to date with the DMV.  Don't worry, to update your residential address, you do NOT need to get a new driver's license.  In fact, you can update the address on DMV.org today, and change it back to the old address tomorrow **so long as** when you update it tomorrow you note that you do not want your voter address to be updated. 

* To update your address with the DMV, go to https://dmv.ny.gov/mydmv/mydmv - the update takes place effective immediately and it takes 2-3 minutes, tops.

(2) STEP TWO: REGISTER TO VOTE ONLINE

* Registering online is simple - just go to https://www.ny.gov/services/register-vote

* The entire process takes 4-5 minutes, but be sure to have updated your residential address with the DMV first because your residential address with the DMV determines the location where you will be required to vote

* What you need to register is simple: (a) the last four of your social security #, (b) your driver's license ID #, and (c) your driver's license document number.

* Don't know where the ID# and document # is located on the driver's license - look here: https://dmv.ny.gov/id-card/sample-photo-documents

The most important thing to note is that registration must take place on or before February 14.  However, this deadline is only available to those who want to register **IN PERSON**.  In order to register online, you must register **ON OR BEFORE FEBRUARY 13.**  In fact, when you click through to register with New York State using the link above, the following notice is plastered on top of the page after you provide your social security and drivers license:

* ""February 14 is the deadline for a Board of Elections to RECEIVE a voter's request to change their party enrollment for this year's primaries. THEREFORE, ANY CHANGE OF ENROLLMENT VIA THIS DMV SITE MUST BE FILED BY FEBRUARY 13TH IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR THIS YEARS PRIMARY ELECTIONS.

They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results.This poll  will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

6. [Necklace and earring found with the victim’s child](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/151UFNY2_LARGE.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

* The victim was found by a hiker on a wooded area of Hempstead Lake State Park, Lakeview, New York.
* She had a 6 inch horizontal old surgical scar in the lower abdomen, possibly from a caesarean section.
* She had a small tattoo on the left upper chest area of a peach with a bite taken out of it and small green leaves and tiny droplets at the lower margin tattoo.
* She was inside a plastic Rubbermaid container along with a red towel and a floral pillowcase, covered by plastic garbage bags.
* The torso was found on the west side of Lake Drive, about two-hundred yards north of Peninsula Boulevard.
* Since police had no leads to her identity, they published a picture of the approximately two-inch wide tattoo in a national tattoo magazine, in the hopes of finding the artist who did the work. They received a call from a man in Connecticut who claimed he remembered giving the tattoo to a woman. The artist said he remembered the customer as a young black woman, about 18 or 19 years old, who was accompanied by two women, an aunt and a cousin. During the session, he also claimed she told him she was from either the Bronx or Long Island and that she was in Connecticut because having trouble with her boyfriend at the time. It is possible the woman had other tattoos on her arms or lower legs that the killer did not want found.
* Both arms, head, and legs below the knee were severed and have not been located.
* Her case could be related to that of ""Cherries"" from 2007, who was found in a suitcase in Harbor Island Park in Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York, also dismembered. She also had a tattoo, this time of two red cherries on a green stem located on her right breast.  
* In April 2011, police in Nassau County discovered dismembered skeletal human remains inside a plastic bag near Jones Beach State Park, and nicknamed the victim ""Jane Doe No. 3"", one of the five victims killed between 1996 and 2003, all dismembered. Her extremities were found with two gold bracelets were associated to this case via DNA. 
* In December 2016 it was confirmed that her case is connected to the Long Island Serial Killer, and ""Peaches"" was the mother of an [unidentified toddler](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1323ufny.html) whose skeletal remains were found near to Cedar Beach in 2011. As a result of these findings, Peaches has now been linked to the Long Island serial killer as a potential early victim.

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to the following shows will be getting a refund. 

CT - Manchester

MA - Boston

MI - Westland

NH - Manchester

NJ - Atlantic City, Point Pleasant

NY - Albany, NYC, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Syracuse, White Plains

OH - Cleveland, Perrysburg

ON - Kingston, London

PA - Philly

QC - Montreal

RI - East Greenwich

VT - Burlington

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Poughkeepsie, Manchester NH, and Cleveland have already been rescheduled for October). Meanwhile, I will be hosting free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.). Some are Q&amp;As with famous people, others are stand-up shows with my comedy buddies from our houses. If you wanna watch, they're free at [YouTube.com/thehofstetter](https://YouTube.com/thehofstetter) every day at 2PM and 8PM ET. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see. 

I'm not sure what to do with all this time at home. Maybe I'll go on a vacation. I hear Italy is nice this time of year.

I was curious what travel would be like to upstate NY?

My brother is in the military and on a travel restriction, so he’s stuck around Saratoga and isn’t allowed to leave the state.

Before shit hit the fan, he ordered car parts and now has some mail he needs to tend to- here at our home in NH.

I was told travel into NY would be impossible by my coworkers, yet my brother hasn’t seen or heard anything in regards to that, so I thought I’d ask you guys.

If I was to drive over this weekend to drop off his stuff, would I even be allowed to do that or is there a travel restriction in and out of NY?

Thanks so much!",newyork,Hopefully this isn’t a silly question... but traveling into NY?
874,874,Austaph,1585115150,fol29n,Nan,"My wife’s nursing college is sending their students out into the community for clinical lab hours starting next week. They say they got “the OK” to do this but from whom and what does that even mean? We’re supposed to stay in our homes!

I’m not a lawyer but doesn’t this directly oppose the PAUSE order? They’re students performing class labs, not essential workers saving lives or keeping the country running.

I ask this because I’m a vulnerable population with an autoimmune disease that (conveniently enough) fucked up my respiratory system. We’ve been LOCKED DOWN with months of bunker food to stay safe because if I get this shit I’m probably dead.

I thought Matilda’s Law was supposed to protect me. This puts me directly at risk. I already emailed the dean very politely asking her to consider an exemption for my wife, but beneath it all I’M VERY PISSED OFF and feel like punting this to regional news outlets.

Not only does this directly fuck our life up but it also puts our entire local community at risk since she has to commute across county lines to visit the college’s hospital.

Am I overreacting or is this not ok?",newyork,Schools forcing students out into the community?

I was laid off from my job and my last work day was 3/14. I applied for UI benefits on 3/21. I have not received any payments whatsoever and the website just kept telling me my claim is pending. I checked the mail a couple days ago and received a notice that I am ineligible for UI because I did not make more than $2100 in two quarters.

Now, I had just gotten this job in August, so yes, I made less than $2600 in the quarter of 7/1-9/31. However, I made plenty enough money in the quarter of 10/1-12/31, and I definitely did in 1/1-3/31, except for the fact that on the paperwork, that quarter was not accounted for whatsoever (i'm assuming it's because I received this notice on 3/26 and they just didn't count the income i made in that quarter?)

I'm now at a total loss as to what to do. I'm running out of money. I know about the PUA, and at this point I'm thinking about saying fuck it and applying for that even though I should really be getting the UI benefits I deserve, but I don't know if I'd be making substantially less money through the PUA than if I were to get my UI situation cleared up, but even if I wanted to do that, it doesn't really seem like there's an avenue for me to speak to a representative about it because the hotline seems to be essentially shut down at this point and the website remains garbage.

Any help at all would be so appreciated. I'm so stressed out man.",newyork,At my wit's end regarding Unemployment Benefits. Need some serious help.

Otherwise, there is a box to check that says I do not have a license. My question is if it's really necessary for me to have NYS license. Can't I just use my CT one? Plenty of people live in a different state than they work. I'd rather put in complete information if possible rather than just say I have no license.

Edit: perhaps I should elaborate. I'm not actually unemployed. I'm trying to sign up for the NYS work share program, but I have to file in order to do that. Filing in CT is not an option. It has to be NY. My research says that if I've worked primarily in NY then I can file in NY. This has been the case for the past year. My company has already put me in the work share system, but I still need to file.",newyork,I have a question about filing for unemployment in NY

I understand if there's no provision to make up for that, but I figured that since they made some changes to how their system works (like not making you wait 7 days, etc etc) that I should make sure if it still applies that you don't qualify if you work more than 4 days a week.
