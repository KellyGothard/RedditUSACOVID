Currently, internet services are probably the most problematic culprit. As the costs to offer these services has actually decreased, the costs have consistently risen. The trend has been for these services to compete for customers only at the front end of the sale via low introductory rates that they can raise dramatically later on. 

By forcing these services to offer the same rates to all customers, they would effectively have to advertise at their true rates and that would create more pressure to actually price their plans competitively.

Join us for our regular chapter meeting. Each meeting includes pledges, a speaker, and a business meeting. All are welcome to join us. We meet in Room 108 of Information Commons West at Ozarks Technical Community College.

The Ozark Mountain Chapter is one of the more than 500 local chapters of The Sons of the American Revolution, the largest male lineage organization in the U.S. At our chapter's founding in 1981, we had just nineteen charter members. Today, we have grown to over seventy-five members, and are one of the most active chapters in the state. Together, we work to organize and host over twenty-four unique events each year. We are also proud to have members who have served as officers both at the state and national levels. We hope you will take the time to learn more about our chapter, and will consider joining us in our work to preserve American history, foster true patriotism, and engage our community.

AMA = Ask Me Anything; commenters ask questions and you answer what you want to.

**Do not request an AMA through an account you know you have said something potentially career-threatening in** i.e. anything potentially offensive; use a separate account. You post at your own risk and r/missouri moderators are not responsible for any outcomes. 

If you are or can talk to **Nicole Galloway, Mike Parson, Roy Blunt, or Josh Hawley,** please especially get them to **comment here or contact me directly.** The Missouri Mod Team especially wants Major Missourians like them to do an AMA.

# Who Do We Want and How Does an AMA Work

If you are a high-profile member of Missouri i.e. major candidate, business owner, governor, senator, congress member, or are really important in Missouri, please comment in this thread saying who you are and that you want to do an AMA. This is a great way to let people know who you are while providing them useful or interesting information; however, comments are free speech and we won't delete them just because they are offensive, so be warned. You can always choose to skip a question though people can still upvote that question.

I will personally ensure a Major Missourian is not ignored just because they are offensive or of an ""offensive"" political leaning. Major Missourians will be heard if reasonably possible; there is only some discretion if the Missourian has breached a major law.

# The r/Missouri AMA Process

If chosen for the next pinned AMA, you will be contacted in a private message for further information. Once we contact you, we will request some form of solid verification, and will request that you tell us a date and time you want to do the AMA. That time will be advertised by us mods via a pinned message at the top of this subreddit in advance . You will then around that time you chose make a post that you are doing an AMA, and us mods will pin your post. We will reschedule 1 time if requested.

Commenters in that post will ask questions, and you the 'Major Missourian' may answer as much as you want, when you want to, over a span of time you prefer. Your AMA is pinned for a maximum of 1 week unless you would prefer it pinned for a shorter period of time; that maximum time will double if the AMA gets notable news coverage, unless you prefer otherwise. 

Alternatively, if you don't care about being pinned or being advertised in advance by mods via pinned messages, you can always forego this and run the AMA without commenting here; fully understand if you prefer it that way though you will gain less traction that way.",missouri,Open Request for Missouri AMAs from Major Missourians

You would think that this law had something to do with books, but many libraries, including SLPL\[2\], have juvenile cards for juvenile materials.  However, books could be restricted, and librarians could be jailed if the law is passed.

HR 2044 is about drag queen story hours.  Ben Baker told the Kansas City Star ‚ÄúIn some places ‚Äì St. Louis, Kansas City and I think St. \[Joseph\] ‚Äì they‚Äôve had these drag queen story hours and that‚Äôs something that I take objection to and I think a lot of parents do. That‚Äôs where in a public space, our kids could be exposed to something that‚Äôs age-inappropriate. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to tackle""\[3\].

Baker speculates that roaming kids are just walking into drag queen story hours without parental supervision.  When kids can go to the library by themselves, I really doubt they would want to go to story hour.  They are likely to be too cool for that.

With that fear neutralized, we are looking specifically at the restriction of drag in public libraries, something that should be against the 1st amendment. The passing of this law could allow the censoring of public library programming and materials for people who were already censoring material for their own children.

I have spent a lot of time in libraries personally and professionally.  I have looked into the meeting rooms when I visit.  The library does not discriminate on who gets to rent space for events.  I have attended corporate training in libraries.  I have attended book club meetings.  I have seen bible study meetings and even mass.  The library is a public good.  The fear that ""kids could be exposed to something that's age-inappropriate"" is overblown and a way to rally Baker's base, not a law addressing a serious concern.

Contact Ben Baker and your congressperson about this issue so that intellectual freedom is available to those who need the library.

98,98,JackMVentimigliaIII,1579337335,eqe2vg,Nan,"# Key Info

AMA = Ask Me Anything; commenters ask questions and you answer what you want to.

**Do not request an AMA through an account you know you have said something potentially career-threatening in** i.e. anything potentially offensive; use a separate account. You post at your own risk and r/missouri moderators are not responsible for any outcomes.

If you are or can talk to **Nicole Galloway, Mike Parson, Roy Blunt, or Josh Hawley,** please especially get them to **comment here or contact me directly.** The Missouri Mod Team especially wants Major Missourians like them to do an AMA.

# Who Do We Want and How Does an AMA Work

If you are a high-profile member of Missouri i.e. major candidate, business owner, governor, senator, congress member, or are really important in Missouri, or know someone of similar importance, please comment in this thread saying who you are and that you want to do an AMA, or convince them to do so. This is a great way to let people know who you are while providing them useful or interesting information; however, comments are free speech and we won't delete them just because they are offensive, so be warned. You can always choose to skip a question though people can still upvote that question.

I will personally ensure a Major Missourian is not ignored just because they are offensive or of an ""offensive"" political leaning. Major Missourians will be heard if reasonably possible. There is mod discretion in allowing an AMA if the Missourian has breached a law or does not appear Major enough.

# The r/Missouri AMA Process

If chosen for the next pinned AMA, you will be contacted in a private message for further information. Once we contact you, we will request some form of solid verification, and will request that you tell us a date and time you want to do the AMA. That time will be advertised by us mods via a pinned message at the top of this subreddit in advance . You will then around that time you chose make a post that you are doing an AMA, and us mods will pin your post. We will reschedule 1 time if requested and you can cancel doing an AMA at any time.

Commenters in that post will ask questions, and you the 'Major Missourian' may answer as much as you want, when you want to, over a span of time you prefer. Your AMA is pinned for a maximum of 1 week unless you would prefer it pinned for a shorter period of time; that maximum time will double if the AMA gets notable news coverage, unless you prefer otherwise.

Alternatively, if you don't care about being pinned or being advertised in advance by mods via pinned messages, you can always forego this and run the AMA without commenting here; fully understand if you prefer it that way though you will gain less traction that way.",missouri,Open Request for Missouri AMAs from Major Missourians

In the United States alone, there is approximately 1,000,000 people with MS, with ~200 people diagnosed each week, and &gt;2,500,000 worldwide. There is also no known cure.

I am currently trying to raise $4,500, this money would go to individuals with MS and would help pay for house and car modifications, medication, therapy, and other things that they need to get through day to day life. While crossing the United States I am going to be performing service projects with them such as building ramps, cleaning gutters, trimming trees, and anything else that they have a difficult time doing.

Cycling helped turn my life around, and I want to use it to help other people now. I used to be [morbidly obese](https://i.imgur.com/s2MvHp4.png), struggling to go up stairs without being out of breath, being unable to run more than 10 seconds without feeling chest pains, and was on track for diabetes. Losing this weight has changed my life so much, and I can thank cycling for it.

**I'm currently selling miles to help raise money, for every dollar donated, you will get 2 miles!** After I finish your miles, I'll tell you and can verify it on Strava!

208,208,blessed_Momma5,1581010571,ezvrov,Unsolved Murder of Missourian Native,"SALLY ANN ADAMS DANE (now, Wood)

Welcome back. In Part 2, (if you haven't read Part 1, I've linked it below and encourage you to read it), I'll be explaining about the Murder of Matthew Lee Dane - Sep 1986 - Mt Charleston, NV, the crime scene, former wife's statements and an eventual arrest and indictment for open murder charges, of person the family, friends and myself absolutely believe is responsible for Matthew's murder. I will be revealing her name as she was and remains the only suspect in Matthew Lee Dane's murder. Per Detective Hefner with LVPD, as of 30 Jan 2020.
(Even though a news article mis reported that she was acquitted of the charges or found innocent) AFAIK, a grand jury's responsibility and scope of authority is **not to acquit or convict a person** , rather decide If there is, in their collective majority opinion , enough evidence of probable cause to support criminal charges.

Matthew and his wife had 2 vehicles, until labor day weekend 1986.  Matthew had just sold his truck back to his father. It‚Äôs the reason they were home in Missouri the weekend before the killing on Labor Day. They drove the truck back to Missouri and sold it back to his father. Then Mr. Dane Sr. flew the couple back to Las Vegas on 2 Sep 1986.

Matthew wanted to be with his family to celebrate Labor Day and to wish his parents a happy 23rd wedding anniversary, that was upcoming on 7 Sep 1986. Matthew assumed his wife would visit her family as they were local as well, however she never left the presence of the Dane family.

So at the time of Matthew's murder they only had one car. It was an **older light blue Monte Carlo, alleged to be a 1979.**

**Two of Matthew's Wife's Statement** 

**LVPD Homicide Report:**

**Sally Ann ""Adams"" Dane**  (SAAD) told detectives that she and Matthew woke up on Sunday, 7 Sep 1986 and attended church at the Trinity Temple Center for 11:00 service. Upon leaving church they proceeded home to **change clothes.**  Afterwards they went to Long John Silvers on Charleston Blvd. Then proceeded to Mt. Charleston Ski Area arriving at approximately 1:30-2:00pm. 

SAAD stated they stayed an hour, an hour and a half. Departing Mt. Charleston Ski Area 3:30 would put them back in Las Vegas at 4:45-5:00pm

SAAD stated they arrived at the 7-11 at the intersection of Nellis Blvd and Charleston Blvd at 4:00pm.  SAAD stated Matthew entered the 7-11 to pay for his gas. 

Upon returning to their vehicle from the 7-11 SAAD stated Matthew was going target shooting with someone he met in the store.  SAAD further stated, Matthew retrieved his weapons from the trunk of their vehicle placing them into the vehicle of an another person, unknown to her.

SAAD told detectives Matthew departed the 7-11 with an unknown person but she couldn't recall the color or make of the vehicle Matthew entered. Sally continued that she did not see the other individual Matthew was going target shooting with. Stating it was ""common practice"" for Matthew to often go out shooting.  SAAD reported she last saw her husband at 4:00pm

**Air Force Office of Special Investigations
(AF OSI) Report**

SAAD stated she and Matthew woke up on Sunday, 7 Sep 1986, departed Las Vegas at 6:45am to the Mt. Charleston area. They had breakfast at 8:00am. They departed 11:45. Arrived 7-11 at Charlotte and Nellis Blvd at 1:00pm. SAAD stated she last saw her husband at **1:00pm.**

In LVPD report: SAAD stated she last saw her husband at 4:00pm

In AF OSI report: SAAD stated she last saw her husband at 1:00pm


**Crime Scene**

LVPD received a phone call at 1400 (2pm) stating two civilian hikers had found a deceased body of a white male on Champion Road, in the Mt View area.

Matthew Lee Dane's body was found on a mountain road, Champion Rd, by two hikers on Monday, 8 Sep 1986. Matthew had been shot 6 times. IMHO, Matthew was ambushed by his killer. He was shot 3 times in the chest (heart area) on the back and side. He was initially, tentatively identified by AF2, Active Duty Identification Card. A later comparison of Matthew's dental records from, Military records confirmed his identity 

7 days later on, Sunday, 14 Sep 1986, 2 weapons were discovered by hikers, 1.9 miles from the crime scene. Checks with NCIC system determine the weapons belong to Matthew.  

On 3 Oct 1986, LVPD criminal laboratory conducted an analysis between the weapons discovered belonging to Matthew and the projectiles received from the M.E. conclude a **postive** match and determine Matthew's **.22 Caliber (Rifle) to be the murder weapon.**

On 13 Oct 1986, laboratory analysis (fingerprint comparisons) had been completed.  The LVPD detectives stated two sets of fingerprints had been identified on the .22 Caliber (Rifle) belonging to Matthew (murder weapon) One belong to Matthew and the other to his wife, Sally Ann ""Adams"" Dane.

On 7 January 1987, Sally Ann Adams Dane was arrested on open murder charges for the murder of her husband Matthew Lee Dane.  She was given a 100,000 bond, posted shortly afterwards. Continuances would delay the trial. From January 1987  29 Sep 1988. When the 2d grand jury failed to return an indictment. 

**Additional notes of interest:**

SAAD immediately filed claim on Matthew's life insurance policy. **UNBELIEVABLY** The death benefit was paid out on 22 Oct 1986, over $50,000. 6 weeks after a man is murdered,  it's Unsolved, she's the ONLY suspect and the Department of the Air Force paid **her** his life insurance policy?? 

SAAD stated repeatedly that typically Matthew went to the desert for target shooting.  Why would she call Mt Charleston rangers on the morning of 9/8 to see if any accidents had been reported?

**Unfortunately for SAAD, detectives acquired phone records from the Dane apartment in Las Vegas.**  On 7 Sep 1986, a phone call placed at **1:05pm to the Dane family home in Viburnum, MO,**  duration of 14 minutes. Matthew's family would later collaborate they spoke with Matthew at that time. This simple phone call destroys SAAD timeline or statement of events. **They couldn't have been at Mt. Charleston at 11:45 am or 2:30pm due to this simple 14 minute phone call.  Several of Matthew's family verified Matthew called them and verified he definitely attended church at 11:00am at Trinity Temple Church.**

Additionally, on 8 Sep 1986, a phone call was placed to Mt. Charleston Forest Park Ranger emergency line at 6:46am by a white female. Ranger advised woman to call back on business line, which she did at exactly 6:47am.

According to SAAD, Matthew Lee Dane was murdered on 7 Sep 1986, Matthew's parents 23rd wedding anniversary.

SAAD order Matthew's grave Headstone with Date of death: 7 Sep 1986. How would she know when he died? The M.E. couldn't even determine.

I was told I couldn't even get a title in my name for a vehicle I bought, with a valid title signed to me by the prev owner plus a signed and dated bill of sale, and that I'd need to go to a specific county to get it.  
(1) Shouldn't that just be for registration?  
A tax waiver is for the next tax year, isn't it?  Legally, a vehicle isn't owned in the state until the TITLE is processed, so how can I even have a tax liability or lack thereof without being on file as the owner?  


(2)  I was turned away and told to go to the far corner of the state where the address on my driver's license is.  I'm seldom actually there because of travel for (1) work and (2) school.  It's just insane to go that far for something that could easily be mailed or faxed.  


Am I really expected to go almost 600 miles round trip IN PERSON to a county office for a slip of paper that anyone should be able to issue based on the title and BoS, especially since the sale date is on the bill of sale?  The title wasn't even in the prev. owner's name until 2019, so even HE wouldn't have had tax liability for it (from another state no less, let alone me.  


On top of that, I'm actually physically unable to drive that far, and in order to make the trip during business hours/days, I'd need to lose my job and forfeit this semester of courses taking an F in them and going into loan repayment.  Yes, seriously.

But I‚Äôm posting here because it‚Äôs a fun, harmless video intended to display an odd feat with no particular purpose and willingness to follow through on a project that makes many scratch their heads. I think we can all appreciate and poke fun at that.


(Not so) Fun facts: The coldest day for any capitol visit was in Missouri. The temperature reached at 12 degrees on that particular day. Also, this was the only dome that was completely covered due to renovations (many capitol buildings were under construction), making it the most hideous of my visits. Maybe my next visit will be more pleasant! 

Enjoy!",missouri,I juggled at every State Capitol building in the lower 48 states...just because. Missouri was my 35th state.

My sister-in-law is finding people from all 50 U.S. states and all over the world and having them write a note and take a photo, then compiling them all into a photo book for her husband as a 30th birthday present. She has taken care of many states already, but we don't know anybody from your state to reach out to. The notes say something along the lines of ""Mark, Courtney's love for you is so big it has reached (location).""

Here are some examples:

So what I am asking of you, /r/missouri, is to create a similar note and take it to a location that is iconic, recognizably from your state, or just somewhere that is special to you. It could be at a National Park or just off your back porch. Feel free to get creative with it. All I am trying to do is compile as many of these as possible so I massively appreciate anyone who contributes.

I‚Äôm moving to Missouri - specifically Columbia, Boone county - for grad school aka minimum wave income if that matters. I‚Äôm an international student with no residency anywhere else so I can‚Äôt use another address. 

I googled to figure out the percentage of property tax for cars but all I could find was based on estimated price bla bla bla. 

Could someone explain to me what percentage I should expect to pay for an average used car based on your experience? I study in Illinois right now and I‚Äôm planning to buy a car before I move to MO. I‚Äôm aiming for 7-8K. What are the chances that they would estimate my car‚Äôs value higher than the sale price? I heard from people in IL that happens quite often in property tax for houses but obviously IDK if that‚Äôs true in MO. Also, should I wait to buy a car until I move there? Would I have to pay anything double if I buy it before? I know these might be very obvious questions but again I don‚Äôt understand the US tax system as I‚Äôm not from here.

Notes:

* The unidentified girl was found by two man who entered an abandoned Victorian house in search of a pipe wrench to fix their broken down vehicle. The men noticed the body after lighting a cigarette, which illuminated it; her body was naked except for a yellow sweater, and had been left lying on her stomach, with the hands bound behind her back with red and white nylon rope.
* She was wearing a yellow, long sleeved V-Neck sweater and two coats of red and purple nail polish. The child's sweater had previously been sent by law enforcement to a psychic in Florida in 2013 who wanted to touch it to receive a psychic impression; however, the sweater was never returned, and presumed to have been lost in the mail.
* There were evidence that she suffered from spina bifida occulta but it is believed she showed no outward symptoms.
* She had not been killed at the house as no traces of blood were found by the body. This led to law enforcement to believe blood had been drained from her body elsewhere; her stomach was also empty at the time of her death.
* She had been raped and decapitated, but the cause of death is believed to be strangulation.
* The Missouri Botanical Garden performed mold tests on her body which determined she had been killed within five days of her discovery.
* The head of the Jane Doe has never been located, preventing dental examination and the possibility of a traditional facial reconstruction.
* Authorities believe she was probably from out of state as they checked school records around Missouri very thoroughly. They conducted a nationwide search, including running ads in every African-American newspaper and magazine in the country and corresponded with every state police agency.
* She was also presumed to have been a victim of Vernon Brown, who had murdered young girls in a similar manner. Brown was executed in 2005 and never confessed to murdering the Jane Doe, despite efforts made by investigators.
* She has also been nicknamed ""Hope"" and the ""Little Jane Doe.""
* Her body was exhumed in 2013. Isotope tests on samples of her bones determined she lived her entire life in one of ten southeastern states: Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Tennessee, or North or South Carolina. However, the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children catalogue entry alternately lists the midwestern‚Äìmidatlantic states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, or West Virginia.
* Bryan Alaspa wrote a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Story-St-Louis-Jane-ebook/dp/B07FC49HM6) about her called Hope: The Story of the St. Louis Jane Doe. You can read the first chapter and a bit of the second one on the website above.

&amp;#x200B;

Ruled out: Northampton County Jane Doe (ruled out to be the remaining parts of the body), Sharaun Taree Cole, Sherri Truesdale, Beverly Ward, Yohanna Cyr, Telethia Good, Sherise Magee, Toya Hill, Sheila Quinn, Shaunda Green.

342,342,sAndS93,1583173798,fcghwi,Nan,"I want to start off by saying I am not a lawyer, but there are a couple of laws in Missouri that make it easier to vote than people think it is.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest reasons people do not vote is that they do not have time. One way to make it easier is that if you work hours such that you do not have THREE consecutive hours off when the polls are open, you have the right to tell your employer to give you three hours off PAID. In order for this to apply, you must give your employer advanced notice. So do not show up on Tuesday morning stating you have the right to leave for three hours. You may tell them on Monday. They also get to assign the hours that you will be off. Your employer may not retaliate in any way for exercising  this right. [Here is the law](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=115.639&amp;bid=6261&amp;hl=) so you may read it, it is pretty straightforward. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are also forms of voting that have been modified to fit people with disabilities. This includes absentee ballots, having accessible polling places and voting machines, and curbside voting. [This page](https://www.sos.mo.gov/elections/goVoteMissouri/howtovote) is a rundown of how to take advantage of these services.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason is lack of ID, and due to the recent Voter ID law that was passed. Despite what many people believe, you DO NOT NEED A PHOTO ID TO VOTE IN MISSOURI. You do need AN ID. The Secretary of State's website lists [appropriate IDs](https://www.sos.mo.gov/showit2vote) that will allow you to vote, but the list is:

* Identification issued by the state of Missouri, an agency of the state, or a local election authority of the state;
* Identification issued by the United States government or agency thereof;
* Identification issued by an institution of higher education,  including a university, college, vocational and technical school,  located within the state of Missouri; or
* A copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck,  government check or other government document that contains the name and  address of the voter.

If you do not have a photo ID, but want one, the state will give you a nondriver's license for free by following [this link](https://www.sos.mo.gov/showit2vote).

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, if for any reason you go to a polling place and are not allowed to vote (whether because of improper ID, or because you believed you were registered at a polling place but they do not have you listed) REQUEST A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. These are votes that do not count, yet, but the polling place workers should be able to help you figure out how to make your vote count. It may be as easy as making sure your signature matches the voter roll (in the case of lack of ID).",missouri,You Have the Right to Vote

Hello! Currently, public Missouri colleges get to pick what scores they will accept from Advanced Placement tests for credit at their school. This is unfair because students work very hard in order to pass these tests. A 3 is a passing score, which means that if you were taking the college course, you would be passing. Some public colleges are able to say you need a higher score in order to get credit which is not fair. If this bill would pass, it would mean that if a student were to achieve a 3 on an AP test, public colleges would have to give some type of credit. Almost all of Missouri‚Äôs neighboring states has this type of bill put into place. Not to mention, this would increase the amount of money tax dollars that Missouri families could get back. Please spread the word about this bill! Anything helps!

I'm going to try and not make this a long post but i would like to explain a bit. So the other day I ended up at Target in Fenton and was approached while loading up my car by a young man petitioning for legalization of recreational marijuana in MO. I was more than happy to sign knowing that this will generate revenue and the guy even explained how some of the money was going to go to treat opiate addicts which honestly (as a former addict) i think is a wonderful idea. 

I and my family are totally pro marijuana seeing as i deal with chronic back pain and other ailments it has helped me in the past. 

Well today my husband was at Wal-Mart in DeSoto where there were other petitioners working on getting signatures as well as a church our in front begging for donations for something or another. My husband was approached and signed and was told he had to hurry because the manager had called the cops and they were about to be escorted off the premises.  I just really wanted to ask why? I know things are different down here in the 'sticks', but seriously? It pisses me off more than anything that they were forced to leave while the church people were allowed to stay.

387,387,momehap,1583644516,ff7zbk,Nan,"So I recently moved to STL area and I am interested in leasing a vehicle. I am trying to finalize the lease deal with dealership, but apparently I have no ideas of how leased vehicles are taxed.

I know that owners (in my case Toyota) are required to pay personal property taxes, but generally, during lease term, I also know that I will have to sign that I am responsible to pay property taxes to the owner so that owner pays the taxes to STL County. 

 Like everything else, when it comes to specifics, it gets fuzzy and murky, but as you know, I am leasing a vehicle that I am responsible to pay for ""depreciation charges (=selling price - MSRP\*residual value)/lease duration)"", not the full amounts of selling price because I am only leasing.

But without understanding how leasing vehicle taxation works, I dont want to go to dealership and get ripped off, and the personal property tax website in state of MO does not give details of how taxation will be assessed other than using 

My gut feeling is state of MO won't care about depreciation charges, but they probably tax on selling price per whatever data they have to tax on each vehicle, but I wanted to double check here. 

Personally, I think it would be unfair if I am even responsible for selling price's property tax since I am only leasing, but I feel much comfortable if I have secondary source of information other than dealership.

To this end, anything on-topic to the Coronavirus is encouraged for discussion here and may be inserted into this post. Things such as Coronavirus/Missouri memes are fine and we hope they lead to more good ideas and useful info. Mainly, we want useful information, news, links, discussion, advice, and anything that might help in handling and understanding everything pertaining to COVID-19.

At this time, the worst is ahead of us. Definitely be prepared -buying toilet paper in excess and similar excess-buying tactics is stupid and has no relation with preparing against the virus.

* Came from Wuhan, China, near the Wuhan Institute of Virology
   * This has lead to questionable conspiracies the virus was manufactured by China, but most agree those theories are untrue, debunked, or lack sufficient evidence
* Names used for the virus include Coronavirus and COVID-19. It has been also called the Wuhan virus, and the China virus, though those names are viewed as offensive.

Some colleges are switching to online classes and keeping campuses closed for multiple weeks. This has makes it impossible for students who have on campus jobs through Federal Work Study to do their jobs. (And unfortunately a majority of jobs are not hiring due to coronavirus.) 
I was curious if anyone knew how I could find out if student workers would still be eligible to get paid. Whether it be through the government or state or school.

545,545,JackMVentimigliaIII,1584959299,fnhqua,Nan,"We are doing relatively nothing about the virus that is about to slaughter much of our people. In my honest opinion, yes, Missouri is screwed. Statistically this may lead to approximately 1.7% of Missouri's infected dying, if we follow the national average. And with how easily this spreads... that may be a very large percentage of our population. 

Our citizens are not taking physical distancing seriously, are hoarding stupid things, are grouping together in groups far larger than 10 such as for rushing into Walmarts, and Missouri's government has failed to order any serious actions that have made any form of difference beyond bare minimum minor tweaks. And our general hygiene and cleaning traditions and choices, compared to other countries, has been a joke.

On all counts, Missouri is for the most part not doing anything, and waiting too long to do anything, both on the governmental and citizen level. The only saving grace is all the school districts unanimously decided to close without having to be ordered to.

Most of our bureaucrats and politicians are no doubt definitely trying their best -and it is just not good enough by any stretch. We should have been doing our best even when there wasn't a crisis, and for us to have not been prepared for such an obvious form of crisis -just shows we, collectively, don't seem to be taking the value of each other seriously.

I know my words are not pleasant to hear, but I believe at least one person should state it truthfully rather than lie or bend the truth: Missouri is screwed and we in large part let it happen. Through total lack of preparation legally and bureaucratically, and a cultural failure to take basic hygiene and protocols seriously even in crisis, Missouri and the United States have on all levels failed in this crisis. 

**When this is over, we as people need to seriously reevaluate our society and government in order to prevent this mass impending death and suffering, from ever having the chance to happen again.**

Let me be clear -this is not to point fingers at any single person, and we all know the state-level and national-level pair of leaders I imply -though it is apparent to me we as a state cannot handle insulting said people, as it results in us then insulting each other. That too needs to change -if we cannot with objective, polite, calm honesty point out now and then when 'our guy' makes an error in judgement, for fear the people on the 'other side' will use it against us ... If that is the case, then maybe we need to rethink the mentality that lead to that insane fear and hatred. 

We all know errors were made, and we are holding our tongue for fear it costs us elections and votes and victories. But if we are risking lives in holding our tongues, maybe those victories just aren't worth it and maybe we just change the kind of people we became that lead to this madness.

Missouri is screwed and we let it happen. We cannot continue existing as a society in this manner -for some of us quite literally. We must aggressively push for tolerance, honest polite criticism including of 'our guy', public hygiene on-par with how Japan and South Korea have been doing it, and change our government and culture so this can NEVER happen again. And if we can't do that -we need to get rid of whatever mental blockage is in the way.

Data for the map comes directly from the same GIS (Geographic Information System) server that feeds the map produced by Johns Hopkins University.  The team at Johns Hopkins updates the data multiple times during the day.  Each time you open the map or click on a symbol, you will see the most recent data that is hosted on the GIS server.

The map has **multiple GIS overlays** that you can turn on/off/restack.  For the USA there is one overlay that shows **cases** by county and a different overlay that shows **deaths** by county.  Other overlays show cases and deaths in the USA by state, for Canada by province and for the rest of the world by country.

When the map opens, the overlay layer showing COVID-19 cases by county is displayed.  If you zoom in several steps then you should see county boundary lines.  If those lines do not appear then the federal GIS server hosting that data is likely too busy.

Looking for the legend?  Need help?  Please read the **""Map tips""** \- link in upper left corner. 

If you take a moment to read the ""Map tips"" then you can learn (1) how to make your own custom map links, (2) how to make any overlay clickable and (3) learn more about the data the map can display.

There are people working on developing a GIS layer that will have authoritative data on the state/county/city ‚Äústay home‚Äù orders that have been issued.  When that GIS layer becomes available, then I will add it to this map.

Finally, by using a small yellow dot to show counties with 1 case and a small magenta dot to show counties with 2-9 cases, the map shows counties where the virus is just starting to get a toehold.  Hopefully extra  care can be taken in those areas to help prevent a fast increase in the number of cases.  Doing so will help to flatten the curve.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

Because of some legal and health trouble last year I wouldn't normally meet the regular requirements for unemployment-but it looks like the CARE/PUA program allows employees who through no fault of their own lost their job/ability to earn a living. What I can't find is if this covers people who didn't get enough hours worked for the last quarter to six month period. So would the PUA/CARE program work for me? It would really help as I have back and neck problems and finding work in this area can be tricky/take sometimes-especially now.

Question 25: If an individual leaves work to care for children due to school/daycare closures as a result of COVID-19, are they eligible to receive unemployment benefits?
Answer:¬†In most cases, no. Unemployment benefits are available to individuals who are totally or partially unemployed due to no fault of their own. In this example, the individual is not available for work due to caring for children and would be ineligible.

One that was the original from two years ago and the second was from 7 years ago 2013. all of the research I did on the case after that either led me to dead ends or rabbit holes that would send me spiraling down a never ending hole if I looked to deep. I will continue my case but I now turn to the internet to help me find out more information regarding this.

95,95,CharacterClassroom,1586963666,g1tu30,Nan,Im laid off from COVID-19 and am being denied benefits. I‚Äôm not gonna lie. I‚Äôm scared. Scared for my family and scared for myself. Death crosses the mind often and I‚Äôm not looking for someone to blame. But this is rediculous. On 3/29 I filed for unemployment in the state of Missouri. Since then I have 900+ calls to our unemployment offices and 4 emails to them along with an exchange of words with one of our state reps assistants who never helped me the way they said they would. I feel betrayed because of the way this is being handled.   I was approved and then told them I didn‚Äôt do any work search. I was denied the first week. Couldn‚Äôt figure out why. It was because of work search and a ‚Äúprotest‚Äù. I worked for Dollar General pretty much all of 2019 and I worked me ass off and even got a couple raises. My boss was terrible and she had screamed and yelled in the faces of employees who later quit because of that. She remained at the top and even got ‚ÄúManager Of The Year‚Äùbut I couldn‚Äôt handle her as a boss. Just too much and overwhelming. She eventually bumped me down from $250 a week to $40-50 a week for what seemed like no reason besides she was forced to hire new people per District Manager. I stuck around while I looked for a new job. I have a wife and son and we have bills and I need to provide for my family. I put in my 2 week notice at the beginning of January. She scheduled me one day after that and then I was off of the schedule. I then went to work at a family owned restaurant (wife‚Äôs side) where I was being paid a LOT more and what I felt was being paid what I was truly worth. They unfortunately are closed due to COVID-19. I was laid off. I filed this second week with hopes of everything working out due to COVID. Bills were coming up. My wife doesn‚Äôt make much. We needed food and other essentials. (We got them but it was very hard to do so) Another denial. ANOTHER. I have called DG HR and was told that I had quit. I quit with a proper TWO WEEK NOTICE. So because my current employer has laid me off and my former employer is protesting my benefits I am unable to provide the way im supposed to. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I shouldn‚Äôt be denied benefits during this time of need when it‚Äôs my former employer stopping this. I‚Äôm so scared to lose power or even worse our phones or water. Where is my government when I need them? I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way.,missouri,Denied COVID-19 unemployment because of a dispute from my last employer.!
