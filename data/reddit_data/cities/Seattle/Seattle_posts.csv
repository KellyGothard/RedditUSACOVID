Hi everyone! 

I plan on traveling to Seattle in late may and Im honestly just looks for some overall advice and what to expect.

What‚Äôs the cheapest way to get around the city? 
What neighborhood should I stay in? 
Is there a location(s) that I should avoid? 
Restaurant recommendations? 
What clothing items do you wish you packed?
How long were you/have you been in Seattle?
If I‚Äôm leaving anything else out, please feel free to let me know. 

Anything will help! Thanks. 

Btw, I‚Äôm planning on going to The space needs, zoo, aquarium, Chihuly garden and glass, harbor tour, Pike place, the pier, and a couple beaches. Any other location recommendation would be great.

23,Winscler,1577823933,ei8bm7,Nan,"Historically, Seattle has had two major train stations, both of which directly touch each other: King Street Station and Union Station. The former historically served the Great Northern and Northern Pacific (and later Burlington Northern) whilst the latter served the Union Pacific and Milwaukee Road. After 1971, Union Station was closed as Amtrak consolidated to King Street Station (King Street has through-running tracks to up north whilst Union Station does not). The station building still stands but the tracks have been removed to make way for redevelopment. Link Light rail and Sound Transit Express have a station right next to it (International District/Chinatown).  


With all the talks of a Cascade high speed rail line, there's a possibility that a new station could be built using the historical Union Station as a base. This reactivated Union Station would initially be used for high speed rail and Sounder commuter trains (this will also give Sounder incentive to electrify).  


Currently King Street is space-constrained, and the Great Northern Tunnel leads to the winding historical route. This would require building a new station. Such a new station would be deep underground to avoid conflicting with Link light rail. Upon completion, all Sounder services will be redirected to this new ROW. Eventually, King Street will only be used for the Empire Builder and Coast Starlight trains, although should Amtrak buy battery locomotives (Neo-Union Station is going to prohibit diesels) then those would be relocated to the reactivated Union Station as well.",Seattle,Seattle Union Station Revival

I'm fairly new around here and love a lot about Seattle and the PNW so far. Ask me about that separately, because right now, I want to talk about breakfast. A breakfast sandwich, more specifically. A humble bacon egg and cheese. 

Forgive me for being another transplant, if you will. I am coming from Brooklyn where I can roll out of bed and within 5 minutes walking in any direction, hand over my $5 in exchange for two eggs, a few strips of bacon, and a slice of cheese on a roll. I know, I know - Brooklyn and Seattle are different places, and have different things going for them. Like I said, I love it here so far! Different is cool. But, this is not hard - we're not talking about being limited by availability of resources or a particular ingredient or cost or demand (come on, you know you want one) or any of that - why does such a sandwich not exist seemingly anywhere around here? 

Please prove me wrong and direct me to the closest thing I'll find. Ideally in NW Seattle but I am happy to go exploring. Oh, and, before you say Eltana (where the bagels are, I'd have to say, above average!): there is an important difference between what I've described above (fry the eggs, slip the bacon inside, whack a slice of cheese on it, and sell it to me for $5), and what Eltana offers (more like $10 IIRC, for a pre-formed egg patty and some limp bacon).

I received a ticket to an upcoming show this summer. This isn't a ""please plan my trip for me"" post...I have been doing research and hope anybody can fill in the holes for me. Any information is greatly appreciated.

I plan to take the Sounder South from Seattle to Auburn Station, then Ubering to White River. Is it easy to walk to the amphitheater from a drop off spot or are all cars allowed in the parking lot? In other words, will the car be able to drop me off close to the theater or will it have to be at the gate?


After the show, I plan on Ubering back to my hotel in Auburn (The Hampton Inn). Will this be possible? Is it too chaotic after the show to find an Uber? If not, where should I go to catch it -- the theater or at the gate? Will it be extremely expensive because I will be sitting in the concert traffic with everyone else?


The next morning I can take transit from my hotel, back to Auburn Station, then North to Seattle.

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Optimism doesn't serve food, but they allow food from outside and a food truck out back.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

All varieties of people are welcome! We welcome everyone who wants to enjoy gaming in good company, regardless of gender, race, or level of gaming experience! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

Most of the answers were ""literally any bar with a TV"" but I was hoping to find some place with decent food and a really energetic crowd with lots of drunken sports-fan people watching.

Where is a good place to watch the game? Here is what I was able to find - can anyone tell me if there are any other places I should consider or if my research is even accurate?

Our AirBNB is in North Beacon Hill but we have a designated driver so possibilities are endless.

Bills off Broadway: Good food, but gets super packed during games

95 Slide: closed according to yelp?

Kesslers: seems like a Green Bay Packers bar, decent food and drink, will probably be packed

She has made me her Maid of Honor, but there have been changes to the bridal party since she asked me! My bestie is a sweetheart, which unfortunately means that she wants make EVERYBODY happy despite it being HER wedding, so when people have asked to be involved, she has granted it!

So now there are several extra bridesmaids, terrible bridesmaid dress decisions, and then another friend is organising a bachorlette party next month, when I will not be there. So I will only have the bride-to-be to myself for two weeks just before her wedding.

I am pissed that somebody would have the nerve to ask to organise a bachelorette party when they are simply a guest. I am threatened by it also, not gonna lie. But what I need your help with is to make sure that I can give my bestie a night or two that will be amazing, and show up this other bitch. I know that sounds spiteful but I was REALLY looking forward to being involved in an American wedding and that part has been stolen from me. It was the only real responsibility I was given and was so touched that she asked me given the ocean between us! And also I was counting on this to actually get to know some of the other guests before the wedding so that I wouldn't be sat awkwardly at the table (I ONLY know the bride and obviously on their wedding they have to speak with all their guests, and have better things to think about than if one particular person is socialising effectively)

So if you know of anything, ANYTHING at all that will be going on between May 5th - May 15th that is quirky or interesting please let me know! I'm looking for anything obscure and different. I want to be able to give her at least one night  completely different to her usual routine that will be a treasured memory of us!",Seattle,Seattleites I need your help! Maid of Honor in crisis!
301,ThatSteveBrown,1578356212,el30mq,Nan,"Hey there Seattle, 

I‚Äôve moved here recently (to Ballard) and have been longing to play music with some fun/chill people. 

I mostly play drums and I have a strong background in bass guitar. I also play the piano somewhat. 

As far as the type of music, Ill play anything that isn‚Äôt too abstract. 

My personal favorites are but in now way limited to:

Rush, Pink Floyd, Boston, system of a down, animals as leaders, fleetwood mac, frank sinitra, ella fitzgerald, chet baker, miles davis, david brubeck, pretty lights, phantogram, the doors, gorillaz, heart, joe walsh etc. 


I am familiar with the basics of music theory but I don‚Äôt focus on the technicalities of terminology, however I feel competent in translating emotion into sound and believe I have a good ear.   

I am hopping to find a few likeminded people who find tranquility in jamming, playing covers and creating original music whilst promoting a learning environment and contributing to a safehaven. 

I also smoke a lot of weed and prefer to stay away from alcohol at band gatherings, a beer or two is fine but the music sessions should never be an excuse to get drunk. 

I currently have a flexible schedule but I would prefer times between 12 PM - 5 PM.

The sidebar of this sub is very outdated and limited on neighborhood descriptions for 2019. Seattle is constantly changing and for a person like me who's about to move to town, it would be greatly advantageous if anyone could provide an updated ""honest neighborhood map"" of Seattle.   


I don't even need a neighborhood by neighborhood description. I just humbly ask which neighborhood I should live in for a married 33yr old childless professional who spends free time eating good food, drinking good drinks and socializing with everyone I can. Work is in South Lake Union (guess where), and my budget on housing is extensive.   


I'm familiar with South Lake Union and Capital Hill. I've been to Ballard once. I like the chill urban vibe where people socialize and relax together. Is there a neighborhood I should consider?  


To the mods: If you remove this, please at least point me in the right direction and saying ""see sidebar"" isn't sufficient due to lack of resources.

I am leaving the state to move to nevada. I have a place to live, a few good friends down there and some good potential for jobs lined up and I can say I have never felt happier my life.

Seattle, for me growing up was always something really special to go visit for the day, hang out on the piers, swimming in the ballard locks, beers at the rhinehaus, you name it. But in the last 10 years the area has changed so much and it has become a disgusting area full of depression and filth. it honestly hurts my heart to know that what used to be fun, artsy, PNW community has now become an egotistical, pompous, face in phone, no common courtesy, get out of my way, no time for anyone but ME, let me follow you so close in bumper to bumper traffic that i can seriously read the nasty tweet youre typing while swirving in and out of traffic causing accidents. Unless you plan on spending your ""day trip"" to downtown in the car trying to find parking to pay for, its not worth the headache. the cost to live here is outrageous - and before anyone that decides to go off about finding a better paying job or going back to school or whatever your opinion on that is, you can keep it to yourself. If you make great money and can afford it seriously thats awesome! i dont even give a flying fuck if youre a 21 year old in a Ferrari doing programming or something with computers, thats your goals and dreams so cool, Id rather kurt cobain myself spending that much time behind a screen. I am not moving because of the cost to be clear, i have just had enough of this place. i am making roughly 60,000 (believe it or not, pretty good for a carpenter) a year, 72000 makes you low income for a fam of 4 in this place. so seriously people from other states, if you are ok with that (which im sure you all are, you would have to do your research right?) then more power to you. 

And honestly I really am not telling anybody not to move here or anything like that, i just really miss this place, all of the greater seattle area used to be great and now its just teslas, apple, starbucks..oh and murders, drugs, money. money for drugs. bored privileged kids that get hooked and destroy families. MINE INCLUDED. I feel like i need to put up defenses before i can even speak my opinion or share my experiences because you all dont know me, i dont know you, i have been through a lot and its just time to move on. i said i didnt know why i had to write this down but i just did. 

in a way its like being in a toxic relationship and i needed to rant a little and just kind of say goodbye without telling everyone my decision to leave. 

last thing, im not blaming the city in anyway, its perfect. its the cancers that are spreading and killing it. i know i know i know, every situation can be changed, theres options, hope and good out there, but those things are not there.

I can spend either:

3 full days in vancouver  BC

3 full days in Seattle

or:

3 full days in vancouver BC

4 full days in Seattle

or:

4 full days in vancouver BC

3 full days in Seattle

I think im going to do the 3x3 days in each, because it's winter and there doesnt seem to be much to do.

Unfortunately, I wouldve liked to see mount rainier in seattle, but its gonna be all snowy and im not about skiing and snowshoeing. I wouldve liked to just walk around and see the scenery or do short trails, but in snow its gonna be hard.

So that kind of takes out the mount rainer part, since it's not for me in winter time.

That leaves me with:

1st day: explore downtown seattle

2nd day: Leavenworth 

3rd day: please help, wouldve been mt. rainier but its winter so im probably not gonna enjoy it. Do you have any suggestions?

Also, how's the road from seattle to Leavenworth? Snowy as hell? Does the city shovel the roads? Im thinking of doing a group bus tour simply for the transportation.",Seattle,Vancouver BC 3 full days - train - Seattle 3 full days. How to spend time in Seattle in January?

377,Brills21,1578509216,elwwnh,Nan,"These are some tips I put together based on my experience riding the bus here in Seattle, and living in Japan where people have very good public transportation etiquette. 

1. **Where all door boarding is available, use it.** This is available on [third ave](https://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/news/release/2019/March/14-metro-all-boarding.aspx) and other locations where there are card scanners at the bus stop. This helps speed up the boarding process, which allows buses to complete their route faster which reduces congestion. 

*2.* **Let people off the bus before you get on***.* Don‚Äôt just jump on the bus right when the door opens, take a look around at the inside of the bus to see if people are trying to get off before you start to get on. 

*3.* **Take off your bag before getting on the bus, if standing on the bus keep it at your feet.** Nobody does this. When you keep your bag on your back and the bus is crowded, it will knock into people and you won‚Äôt realize it (because it‚Äôs not easy to sense, as opposed to when your arm touches someone). This also allows for more people to get on the bus ‚Äì people need to give you more space if your bag is on your back as opposed to if it‚Äôs at your feet.

*4.* **If you know the bus is going to get crowded, when you get on walk all the way to the back of the bus.** I admit, it can be a weird feeling to get on the bus and walk all the way to the back when the seats are full. Most people stop by the rear door ‚Äì but what this does it then leaves a ton of space at the back of the bus that often doesn‚Äôt get used. When the bus starts to get crowded, keep moving back to make more room. 

*5.* **If you are standing by the rear door, when the bus stops and the door opens, step off the bus to let people off.** Even if it doesn‚Äôt seem like it, standing by the rear door slows down off-boarding (especially if you have your giant backpack on). Step off the bus and move a little to the side ‚Äì the bus isn‚Äôt going to leave without you.

*6.* **Do not sit in the aisle seat if the window seat is open.** This is the ultimate, passive-aggressive, ‚ÄúYea I‚Äôll sit next to someone if I have to, but you‚Äôre going to have to ask me to move over first.‚Äù When you sit down, slide over to the window seat. This goes with putting your bag on the seat ‚Äì just don‚Äôt do it, put it at your feet right when you sit down. 

*7.* **If you are standing and have headphones in, when the bus starts approaches at stop look over your shoulder to see if anyone behind you is getting off.** If you have your headphones on, you can‚Äôt hear someone moving to get up out of their seat or them saying ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù. They then have to tap you on the shoulder which nobody wants to do and slows things down. 

*8.* **Exit at the rear when possible.** Sometimes this is hard if the bus is crowded, but exiting at the rear should be the default so it doesn‚Äôt slow down people boarding the bus at the front. 

*9.* **Don‚Äôt talk on the phone.** A quick ‚Äì ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm on the bus, I‚Äôll call you right back‚Äù is totally fine. But don‚Äôt sit there and talk to your girlfriend or boyfriend on your commute. Just imagine if everyone on the bus did this ‚Äì how annoying would that be?

*10.* **Say thanks or acknowledge the bus driver when you leave if possible.** Obviously when the bus is jammed not everyone is going to shout ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù on their way off. But when the bus is less crowded, or if exiting at the front either say thanks or acknowledge with a wave. Driving a bus is not an easy job and those drivers deal with more crap than you can imagine. Plus, friendliness is contagious.",Seattle,"Riding the bus ‚Äì ten tips to make everybody‚Äôs commute easier, faster and more pleasant."

Like just about everyone who has a managed medicaid plan, I work a full time schedule for a well known company. I am just exploited by the system as more employers figure out legal loopholes to get around wage laws (‚Äúpart time,‚Äù where you have to work full time anyway, contractors, etc.)

1. Clinics lie. I go a to referred provider and they turn me away saying they don‚Äôt accept my plan (UW). My insurance continues to tell me they are contracted with medicaid. I am forced to go to the ER for basic treatment, where they think I am crazy for wasting their time.

2. I schedule an appointment for a dental cleaning only to be told they will do a check up and i have to return for the cleaning (so they can double bill). The fact that i have to take time off from work multiple days is unimportant.

3. I tell a specialist i am experiencing chronic pain and discrimination in the workplace due to my condition and they give me a fact sheet and send me on my way. Other doctors ask why surgery wasn‚Äôt suggested as a treatment. (Swedish) 

4. The treatments themselves are the most painful i have ever felt. When i said i am experiencing pain from the way they shove things into my mouth at a dental visit, they just get annoyed.

393,UnkleRinkus,1578527176,em143w,Nan,"I have suffered from depression for 50 years.  Varying in intensity, sometimes there, sometimes not.  In 2001, it got really severe; I sought medical help.  My doctor placed me on Prozac.  It didn't work very well, and had severe sexual side effects.  We tried Wellbutrin.  It just didn't work.  We tried Effexor, which worked, but put me in a fog, and shut down my urinary tract, so that I couldn't pee.  Finally, we tried a combination of citalopram(Celexa) and Abilify.  It provided blessed relief, and I used it for at over ten years.  My life got better, and I weaned myself off if about three years ago.  

This year, the dark fog has returned.  After fighting it for some weeks, I tried to get meds today, to ward off the emotional pain and self hatred. I got an appointment with the first doctor available at Kaiser.  I go in, I tell her my story, and tell her what has worked in the past.  I have changed jobs and healthcare, my old doctor has retired.  She doesn't have access to those old records.  She wouldn't put me back on the plan that works, insisting that we start from scratch.  In case you don't know, most drugs for depression take some number of days or weeks to build up and be effective. It took a year and a half to figure out what worked last time. 

You see, citalopram is off patent, and is cheap.  Abilify is not. It cost $500/month when I last bought it, after insurance.   Neither of these drugs is a drug of abuse.   Kaiser won't pay for the treatment plan that has been proven to work for me, without trying other cheap options for weeks.   During which every day I try to decide why I should not kill myself to make this pain stop 

I could barely get myself to go to the doctor as it is.  I don't have the strength to fight them.  So I will sit here, and contemplate exactly how else to make the pain stop. But Kaiser didn't have to pay for Abilify, so yay.

It was my refuge from the same shitty assembly-line ""classic rock"" stations like KZOK and KISW where Bob Rivers would play an endless repeat of overplayed songs.  I did not want to fucking hear Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd or fucking Santana, even if they were groundbreaking musicians or great songs.  I just don't want to hear the same artist or song over and over and over. There's so much good NEW music out there.  
And John in the Morning was one of my heroes.  KEXP played stuff I'd never heard before, anywhere else in the country. They'd actively avoid good songs that were overplayed because they knew you could find that music elsewhere if you wanted to.  
But I can't take the Morning Show or even Cheryl Waters any more.  It's become a classic rock station.  I'm fucking sick of David Bowie, even if he's good. I don't give a shit about how influential the Clash was. I don't care about hearing a rare B-side Johnny Cash song or yet another cover.  And I especially don't need to hear it EVERY. FUCKING. MORNING.  I go to KEXP because it's better than a ""you might like this"" algorithm on Spotify or Pandora.  The genre changes from song to song sometimes, you can hear foreign artists that don't get airplay here or local bands that aren't in the top 1000 artists.  
I don't need International Clash Day. And godforbid another member of Queen or the Ramones dies and we get a full week of replays and tribute songs.

* Transport-wise: can you buy like a week pass for the bus and light rail like in London?

* This trip is very much going to be a cultural enrichment one rather than a rush to fit in all of the top tourist sites. I would love to meet some locals and have some people to show me around. How would I go about this? Do you guys use Meetup in the U.S.?

* I'm single so would also be interested in the hook-up scene. What is that like in Seattle? Heard it's a tech town so lots of guys. I have Tinder which could help. Would being an average-looking, modestly handsome Brit (with a Hugh Grant accent included) help? Or would the Seattle Freeze hurt this?

* I love U.S. sports (Go Hawks, especially for today!). Which teams would be playing around early July. I know the NFL won't be on but baseball? Even minor league would be cool. I would also love to do a stadium tour of Centurylink so that's on my to do list.",Seattle,Brit visiting Seattle for the first time and first solo trip

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Optimism doesn't serve food, but they allow food from outside and a food truck out back.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

All varieties of people are welcome! We welcome everyone who wants to enjoy gaming in good company, regardless of gender, race, or level of gaming experience! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

This would be all fine and well, except they were predicting 1-3 inches of snow every day next week until yesterday, but they had been predicting that for a solid week. 

Now were only supposed to get one inch instead of 1-3 inches, the temperatures have also been all over the place. Original low on Tuesday was 16, then 18, then 22, now it's at 26. I have never lived any where with SUCH unreliable weather forecasting. 

Now I know when a Seattlite says not trust any snow forecast whatsoever, they mean it. These meteorologists are completely full of shit lol. I have a suspicion it's all for as revenue so you'll keep checking the weather.

Somewhat later after that, I started to notice a couple different strange noises coming from the front passenger side wheel. Had a mechanic check it out and confirmed the wheel bearing is going out and possibly a bad strut bearing too. The estimated repair bill is in excess of $700 parts and labor. 

Now, as a do-it-yourself mechanic, I'll be doing this myself (I don't cost much in labor honestly) and curious if the city would even pay out for pot hole damage to begin with (yes, I also reported them  because that was garbage to run over) let alone reimburse someone that did it themselves for obvious fraud concerns. 

Anyone have insights to offer? I'll trade insights for some of my bananas and/or a plantain.",Seattle,Question About City Reimbursement For Pot Hole Damage

A short while later she started talking about how the traffic is so bad because of Amazon, how they should stop selling crap from China, how they should've never ever opened their offices in Seattle because a lot of small businesses could have flourished in its place and how all the people coming here are taking the place of Native-Seatillites.

As someone who works for Amazon, I get all of these arguments and I somewhat agree with some of them too. I try to do my best to reduce packaging waste in my own personal life. I didnt let her know that I work for Amazon obviously because I hate confrontation and would absolutely do my best to avoid it. 

But at the end of the day I'm just a 23 year old who's working in her first job out of college. That conversation made me feel a bit guilty and it made me feel like I was doing something wrong.

Comparing to LA/NYC is a little unfair, but there are so many cheap eats, from Korean BBQ, pizza, Jewish delis, shwarmas, even fast food is cheaper in those cities.

In Seattle everything is more expensive and lower quality. I try and go to every new restaurant that opens up in Seattle and disappointed in most and decide to just make it at home. Seafood/duck and fancier options tend to be overcooked at dinners end up being $40+ without drinks.

Even smaller cities like Portland have a more vibrant restaurant scene where the owner seems to genuinely care about the food they are serving (e.g. finding fusions that actually work, reasonable prices for what you get)

When I walk into a Seattle restaurant, I look at the menu and it always looks like ""I need the customer to buy something that cost $1.50-$5 to make for $15-35"".

Is it rent prices, lower expectations, or are other people just stopping going to restaurants after seeing the quality and just making food at home, or something else?",Seattle,What is holding back the Seattle restaurant scene?

As a family of two nurses, one of us a psychiatric nurse who is looking to go onto my Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner Doctorate, are we utilized out there? 

Here in the south, I believe all of the states are not independent practice and as such there are very few psych NP's here.  It's a psychiatrist or nothing, and many of them have had full practices not taking patients for years.  I know Washington is very progressive on NP's and it's possible to have your own practice.

For some context, I am a recent graduate from upstate NY who moved to Seattle \~4mo ago to work for Amazon (*surprise, surprise*). I looked at some housing options and made the (hasty) choice to lease in a high-raised building with a crazy view. However, four months in, the thrill of the view has worn off, and I have a long list of complaints with my current living situation. The highlights among that list are   
1. it is wayyy overpriced for a place that has no closets to put my clothes in  
2. I have a fridge too small to hold a standard medium-sized pizza box, and an oven too small to hold a regular sized baking tray. My kitchen is tiny and I can only cut one vegetable at a time.   
3. The above are not too bad by themselves, but when I consider I've gone above my max budget for a place that's so suboptimal that I complain every day - I shouldn't feel poor as a single woman earning roughly twice the US average median income and this is therefore an *expensive* mistake.  


So, I'd like to move out ASAP, but the problem is I ended up signing an 18-month lease and I'm barely four months in (argh, I feel stupider about this choice while typing this in retrospect). I started reading the lease agreement and scanned it thoroughly for any mention of the process of lease transfer or breakage penalty, but found nothing in there, and I'm really confused as to how to go about this - it seems like the property management group probably handles these situations on a case-by-case basis and I don't want to make the wrong move (pun absolutely not intended). 

If anyone has any advice on how to start this conversation with my leasing office, mistakes to avoid making, rights to know and things to expect, I would be immensely grateful since you will be enabling me to live in a place where abundant pizza boxes can fit in my fridge and I could cut three vegetables at the same time with plenty of space for my beer.

So I start looking around for the owner. Eventually the dog comes up to a young man riding his bike and jogs along side him. When the guy comes up next to me, I asked ""Hey, how is it you get a pass at the dog-leash laws and nobody else does?"" I asked this clearly and loudly (without menace).

No answer -- he didn't even look at me. I looked for ear buds as he passed and saw none, so he was clearly just ignoring me. My guess is that he gets this a lot and ignores everyone, probably every single day if this is how he walks / exercises his dog.

""But a dog should run free!!""

Fine. Move to the country. Or to some suburb where his is okay. It's a bad idea in the city for numerous reasons.

**MY QUESTION**: what can we do about this. Should I keep the Seattle Animal Control on speed dial? Will that do any good? Should I call the non-emergency Police line? Anything at all?

**My thoughts now:** I should always mention to this guy ""I am calling Animal Control now"" (whether that does any good or not) and if we all do this, he may finally start being uncomfortable with his ""I don't have to follow the rules because my dog is good"" thinking and stop doing this (probably not).

Note: I've seen this elsewhere. A few months back it was at Kerry Park, with tourists and all. Same scenario: a young man on a bike, believing the rules don't apply to him.

I work with a number of other people with the same schedule, but I can‚Äôt get them to go out after work. I like to explore. They take Lyfts, where I walk and take the mass transit, they stay in and I want to go out, they have umbrellas and I wear a raincoat. My Seattle based coworkers warned me that an umbrella would mark me as out of towner üòâ

What are the ‚Äúmust see‚Äù and ‚Äúmust do‚Äù things I should try while I‚Äôm here that can be done after work? I‚Äôm usually done by 4PM and I try to get to bed by 11PM, so I have a lot of available time.

I‚Äôve made some local friends, so my evenings are often catching a movie or going out to dinner with them. However it seems like whenever I try to do the tourist thing everything closes around the time I finish working.

During the summer I often spent a couple hours walking and taking in the surroundings. Plus it was great exercise. That‚Äôs not as easy right now.

I have stayed through for a long weekend and hit some of the big ones like the Space Needle, the Underground City tour, Pike Place Market,

My biggest issue is I‚Äôm pretty introverted, so it can be tough to get myself to go to an event like a concert or gathering alone, although I might be able to convince a local friend to go to something like that. For example I‚Äôve been trying to go to a Seattle Gaymers event on Monday evenings in Capitol Hill, but I haven‚Äôt gotten over the ‚Äúcrowd of new people ‚Äú hump yet.

The recent article from their editorial board cites vague concern troll talking points about security, and says the republican secretary of state should be trusted when she says she wants to block people from voting.

The article titled, ""Resist push for ballot box"" is nothing more than republican scaremongering about people having the right to vote, trying to taint the perceptions of voting in general, and using online voting as a method to scare voters over security.

If Washington pursues online voting, republicans would be at a significant disadvantage because the GOP couldn't stop it and they would probably lose elections by even greater margins than they already do.

Never mind the most secure transactions are already done online like paying taxes and applying for passports, we certainly cant have people being able to vote from home like they do everything else.

Shots were fired in front of a McDonalds on 3rd and Pine. Every soul who has been to downtown Seattle knows that 3rd and pine is a literal shit hole. There is no place in the state of Washington that has more blatant in your face crime than this intersection.

I saw #seattleshooting was trending on twitter. People are calling for gun control. I immediately clicked the X button to avoid losing brain cells. Criminals don't care about gun control. As a matter of fact the suspect who did this probably bought his gun from the bum on 3rd and Pike. 

Anyways.

Seattle has a problem and it ain't the police department. The problem is the people who run the city. I don't give a shit what your views are on police (oink oink), but you should know they are at the mercy of the city council. The reason 3rd and Pine is the way it is, is because criminals know that they can commit crimes there and get away with it. Gang activity, drug activity, prostitution, assaults, human trafficking. 3rd and Pine has it all.

Now, you can stand at 3rd and Pine for 30 minutes to wait for a bus and see multiple instances of criminal activity happening. So why don't police officers do anything? Because they purposely avoid being proactive at 3rd and Pine. No top brass, politician, or prosecutor will support you. Drugs bring a lot of issues to downtown Seattle but it is considered petty (even though its literally a felony) and a waste of resources. Now that a shooting has happened right on that shit street where an innocent bystander was killed all of a sudden people come out of their caves. But wait....they're blaming...gun control????

This isn't a Washington problem this is a Seattle problem. If you tell other police officers you work for SPD they point and laugh at you. Its literally a meme. Everyone knows (even those that work for SPD) that SPD isn't a real law enforcement agency whose mission is to protect the public. The city council needs to schedule a meeting and talk about what they want out of their police agency. Because this is what they get.

She's a Caucasian lady, perhaps in her mid 40s, early 50s. Easy to recognize by her typical attire which is a very long black coat and a black fur hat. Encounters started in December, they're not frequent.

The first encounter he had with her was when he was in the parking lot of QFC. She just opens the passenger door and sits down. She seemed confused and she ended up leaving, no issues. A different time, she did the same and was just talking to him, asking what kind of music he liked, how he was. He thought it was a little strange but kind of accepted it. At this point he thought she was in his head because she wore the same thing and it was just strange. Around and after Christmas he was receiving gifts on top of his car and we suspect it was her... She left this clothespin with a mini jingle bell in it? The day before that she left a ribbon. The last gift she left these reindeer ears.

TONIGHT. He came home for lunch and then called me when he was heading back to work to tell me she was there AGAIN. I immediately go outside and see her myself! She was standing next to his car door and he just sped off... I was watching her and she was just kind of walking in the parking lot and watching people get into cars? Now I don't see her thought and I'm kind of nervous lol. If I see her, I'm just going to report to local police. From the sounds of it she just seems like a confused, older lady but I don't want her to just be wandering outside? And also... trying peoples car doors.

If you're in the Richmond Beach area, have you encountered her? Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I would typically confront her and I was about to but she seems unstable to me... Lemme know! Thanks.",Seattle,Mysterious lady... Can anyone identify her???

At the beginning of 2019 I got an extremely severe infection that ended up putting me in the hospital for 3 months. That threw a whole lot into dissarray, and I have been working at getting things stabilized. The company I worked at was purchased while I was on medical leave, and a couple of months after returning to work I was layed off. Money had already been tight and that didn't help any. 

All of this is to provide background as to why I'm posting. i was evicted from my apartment on Monday, and have been staying at a Motel 6.  I start a new job next week, and family had told me they would help out to keep myself and my cat at the hotel until then. I'm not sure of the reasons but that has now fallen through. 

my dilemma is my cat I can most likely handle having to be homeless for a while, but there is no way I can take him with me. I've called all the shelters I can find locally, and none accept pets that are not service animals. I don't even want to think about having to take him to an animal shelter. The furball saved my life at least twice, and I don't want to reward that kind of love with the only options I have available.

I have reached out to everyone I know to see if they can house him for a bit, but am not having any luck at all.  

I have requests in to all the local housing assistance / financial aid programs, and have appointment scheduled with North Height services on Monday, but that leaves me getting booted from motel 6 today at 11.

We currently have a Chinese temple near our area which is roughly 4 or 5 blocks away from us. While the temple is interesting for the culture it brings to the area, it's providing some huge frustrations for me recently. 


The biggest of which is fireworks that go on after 10 PM. The Chinese New year has allowed them a fireworks display in the middle of a residential area that isn't Chinatown for a while. And at midnight when people are asleep on a Friday (yes I'm old). Why is this allowed in Seattle? Are we a suburb of China? The fireworks are extremely loud and continue for half an hour. Unless your house is made of steel, you're going to be awake for this.

I'm wondering what people's experience is with cost of living and affordability in Seattle. I'm consider moving but obviously worried about going broke on rent alone. 

My job will be near Lynnwood and my salary would be right around the Seattle median income (based on Google). I've done a lot of research, but I'd like more personal opinions and experiences. It's hard to tell what's correct with all the info out there. There are many websites that say you have to make six figures to be able to live and there are some that say you need 60k-70k to live. I'm not too picky on living location, but for reference I'm in my 20s and not really looking to live in suburbia if I can avoid it. I'm also not looking to live lavishly but I'd like to be able to have some savings. Eventually I will have a significant other moving out with me to get a job so a 2nd income will help, but ETA on that is looking to be at least 6 months.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

All varieties of people are welcome! We welcome everyone who wants to enjoy gaming in good company, regardless of gender, race, or level of gaming experience! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

At the end of the day, it's my decision to fly out, but I'd like opinions on whether it would be safe to fly out in the next couple of days.

Thats right, we are all going to get together and play Cards Against Humanity - Friday February 14th at 6:00PM, at the Oddfellows Hall at 1706 Market Street, Ballard, WA, 98107.  It's about 1 block west of 15th on the North side of the street inbetween a tea shop, and a bookstore, and the sign at the door says I.O.O.F.   If you have problems locating the place, you can call Steve at (347) 879-5953)  When you enter the building come up the stairs, and then turn to the left.

First: The location:  The Oddfellows have decided that they want to host more social events for the betterment of society, and they have decided to allow me to host this event there to bring people together, and share some fun and laughs.  It's a reasonably large space that we will have exclusive use of for playing with no loud music playing.   We will be playing on 8-top tables, and I will request some help getting tables as people get there, and then putting them away as people leave (we very much want to be good guests.)  This not a catered event, so you are free to bring a few snacks or a bottle to share (we will have a side room with a separate table set up - this is also the right place to have conversations).   Because this is a private space we can invite EVERYONE regardless of age to this event.

The game we choose to play?  Cards Against Humanity!  This is a game that has become a phenomenon.  It has been the top selling game on Amazon for the last two years running.   For those that don't know, it's like Apples To Apples but with all the cards replaced with dirty, politically incorrect, racist, sexist, religiously heretical cards that are guaranteed to offend everyone.  It is possibly the most offensive game ever created, and yet EVERYONE laughs their ass off while playing it.  I think this event taps into a deep seated need to stop being politically correct all the time.  All in all, it's an amazingly fun time, and it serves as a great ice breaker for all the people you will meet that are pretty much - not uptight.


I have hosted these events in the past, and I have some additional house rules that we will be using:
1: If you own a copy of the game: BRING IT.  Every time I have done this, we have needed, almost EVERY copy of the game that showed up.

2: These are NOT your cards! Don't set them in the drink sweat from your glass, treat them as the precious source of laughter that they are.  We want people to bring their games again, not to have ruined cards meaning that game owners go home unhappy.

2: When you are the judge read the card as loudly as possible.  You WANT the next table over to hear the fun you are having.

4: When someone wins three black cards, they are deemed to have ruthlessly crushed the pathetic competitors at the table they are at, and they MUST change tables (to meet and crush some new competitors!).  Everyone at the table is encouraged to make sure they tell that person just how horrible they are as they are leaving.

5 When a card calls for multiple blanks: The first card to be read from your entry will be the bottom one.

6: There will be a donation jar that is completely voluntary, the money raised will be split between me (I recently shelled out for some expansion packs), and the Oddfellows hall (I'm trying to get them to buy some 10 top tables).

One additional note:  This event is crossposted and it will not be a small event, (I expect to have about 60-75 people, but broken into groups of 8 per game) so please feel free to come, and bring all the friends you want, and take off the social mask and let everyone see just how damaged, freaky, crazy, honest and fun you really are.",Seattle,Valentines Day Cards Against Humanity

Seattle offers many more job opportunities for a much higher salary. The PNW is also the kind of environment that I see myself living in long-term. 

I'm 26 and struggling to decide whether to put roots down in Berlin or Seattle.

Berlin has its perks. It's young, full of green spaces, has a great nightlife, excellent public transportation, and an overall low cost of living. It's well-connected to the rest Europe, and I've already taken full advantage of this and traveled as much as possible. The amount of sunshine seems comparable to that of Seattle. But it's flat, overall ugly, the people are generally grumpy and passive, the artistic hipster population is not as creative as it seems, and it lacks the mountains, ocean, and giant trees that I long for. 

I've dreamed of Seattle since I hiked around the Cascades and Rainier as a teen. I know that the city has transformed over the past 10 years, but I'm still dreaming of living there. 

Should I leave behind my friends, my 30 days' vacation, and my overall chill lifestyle for the Seattle tech scene and great outdoors?",Seattle,Seattle or Berlin?

The main reason I'm asking is because I made a mistake in the past of booking an airbnb in a not-so-great neighborhood of San Francisco, which made her not want to come back to the city again for a few year.  It turns out, first impressions are important ;-)

Background: we are from Northern California, not very much into nature/scenery and more into a bustling city atmosphere - restaurants, nice streets to walk around, etc.

I went through the FAQs but they seem to be focused around ""what to do when I'm in area XYZ"". I'm sort of looking for: ""if you could choose to live anywhere in the city, where would that be"".

1493,Roxtar5,1580585683,exbbdy,Nan,"Hi everyone. I'm not great at sharing this information eloquently like some of my co-workers, but I felt like I should help spread the word. 

I work at the front desk at a PT clinic, and do a lot of verifying benefits, requesting authorizations, etc. This year Regence UMP plans are adopting EviCore starting March 1st. 

EviCore is a 3rd party company that many other Regence and Premera plans have used. EviCore exists to block your access to your benefits that you pay for. Basically they determine if your treatment is ""medically necessary"", and they are awful. WA state garuntees you 6 visits of PT for treatment of a new body part, and after that it's up to EviCore if your treatment is approved or denied.

We fight them on behalf of our patients frequently. I had to fight them for my own care recently, and it was hell.

So, if you have this plan (which a TON of people in Seattle do) starting March 1st, your plan says 60 rehab visits per year, but that's not actually the case. And as far as we understand it right now, you won't get those initial 6 visits I mentioned on March 1st if you were already seeing a therapist prior to that for the same area of the body. We're pretty worried that our current UMP patients could be denied care on 3/01.

My supervisor told me that this happened with another plan in the past before I was there, and members complaining to their HR department enough got the change dropped. So if you have this plan, please talk to HR. 

I'm happy to clarify anything I can, or at least help provide the language to use so that someone else can more easily help with questions you have.",Seattle,PSA for those w/ UW UMP Regence insurance plan

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Optimism doesn't serve food, but they allow food from outside and a food truck out back.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

All varieties of people are welcome! We welcome everyone who wants to enjoy gaming in good company, regardless of gender, race, or level of gaming experience! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

Are there certain neighborhoods of Seattle that people know of or are familiar with outside of western Washington? I‚Äôm not talking about suburbs or satellite cities (i.e. Woodinville or Tacoma) but about actual geopolitically informal communities within the city proper (i.e. Lake City or the Central District).

For instance, I‚Äôm born and raised here in Seattle but if I hear of the Castro, the Haight, or the Tenderloin I instantly know it‚Äôs in San Francisco and I‚Äôm roughly familiar with those places and if I hear of Venice the first thing I ask is if it‚Äôs referencing the neighborhood in Los Angeles or the city in Italy. I‚Äôm curious if any neighborhoods in Seattle of similar local importance (Capitol Hill, Fremont, Ballard, Pioneer Square, the Ave/UDistrict) have any of the same nationwide or worldwide meaning or familiarity as their counterparts in comparable US port cities whose international status is older and more established than ours is yet.

Hello r/Seattle,

I am pleased to tell you all that I have enabled the Seattle area on the Plan Together Platform. Seattle was chosen due to a growing urban renewal and community improvement movement.

Plan Together is a website which allows citizens to freely collaboratively discuss and plan the future of their communities. Users are able to post items to a map, each tagged as a suggestion, news, criticism or praise. Other users can comment on these items; leading to ideas, understanding and unique viewpoints to surface. To better understand how this works, please visit the site.

I am very excited about this project. It is my hope that by empowering users to talk about the world around them it can change their attitude towards their communities. Most people believe their voice and input end with their house or apartment; I want the scope of their belief to include their streets, parks, communities, and cities. As Plan Together grows and municipal officials and planners begin to use the platform's information gathering and analysis tools, a new continuous, iterative, relationship-based urban planning paradigm will hopefully emerge.

Feedback is appreciated and have fun on Plan Together!

Thanks,
David",Seattle,Seattle Area is now Enabled on Plan Together (Map-based Community Planning Discussion Platform)

As part of a group project, I'm doing research on healthcare affordability in the Seattle area as well as general public knowledge of free medical clinics. I'd really appreciate it if you guys could take a minute or so to fill out this easy survey to help me with the project!

More info about the project:

Seattle has an extremely large population that faces a variety of struggles, including finding access to affordable healthcare. This includes homeless, refugees, immigrants, individuals in between jobs, etc. To support this population, a number of free medical clinics have sprung up in the area, working to provide free/affordable healthcare to individuals regardless of whether or not they have insurance. These free clinics are extremely important for individuals that for one reason or another can‚Äôt afford quality healthcare. However, this system of free clinics is not without problems. One of the most challenging problems facing the target users of these clinics is how to find them, know what they offer, and their hours of operations.

Our project is focused on finding a solution to this problem, with the goal of connecting underinsured and undocumented populations in the Seattle area to affordable healthcare resources. The following questions will be used to gain understanding on the average Seattleite's healthcare experience.

I was at the U district Farmer's market yesterday and there was a vendor giving samples of free apple cider. They also sold wine infused apple cider. My GF really loved it and seemed interested, I played it off like I didn't like it that much, but in the back of my head I was thinking ""I'm going to get her this for Valentines Day"". She is always getting me presents that I didn't explicitly ask for, she just notices that I like it or that I need something and it's so incredibly thoughtful of her. Like an idiot, I didn't note the vendor's name, my plan was to just go get some early next Saturday and surprise her. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I'd love to get her a couple bottles before V-day, that way the surprise would line up better with the holiday and save me an early Saturday trip to the U-district.",Seattle,Help finding an apple cider maker at U district Farmer's market for valentine's day gift!

1866,ccchristinaaa,1581279585,f1eeka,Nan,"Hi! I have the opportunity to move into a 2-bedroom apartment on Madison, in between 13th and 14th (right where Madison &amp; Union meet) for a really reasonable price. It's a top-floor (third floor) unit on the corner, with most of the windows facing that tiny sliver of 13th ave between Madison and Union across from Pony. 

I know this place will be loud (it is fully surrounded by bars--Chop Suey, Bar Sue, Pony, etc.), but ...... how loud? It's an old brick building so I'm hoping it will be a little better insulated from sound. The second bedroom faces the building's courtyard so I'm thinking if the bigger bedroom that is Madison-facing is just too much to handle I can reconfigure the space to sleep in the smaller bedroom. I've experienced city living in the past‚ÄîI used to live right next to a freeway exit with constant motorcycle revving, police pulling people over under my bedroom window, and a sizable population of people without homes having arguments outside my window as well. Normal city traffic and sirens isn't really my concern, my top concern is hoards of loud drunk people screaming in the wee hours of the morning. I've visited the building at around midnight on both Friday and Saturday night and you can't really hear a ton of music from the various bars around, but people definitely are walking by the building and speaking loudly. 

I know this is not a great neighborhood if I'm looking for anything quiet... but this apartment is my \*DREAM\* apartment physically. And the location, while surrounded by bars, feels riiiiiiight on the edge of the noisiest part, about a block away from the area people really say to avoid. It also feels like a really walkable spot to things I care about: workplace, restaurants, cafes, and quieter bars I go to on weekdays. Should I be willing to make a noise compromise for the opportunity? 

I'm leaning toward taking the risk and trying it for the 12 month lease and then moving on if I really can't handle it, but I'd love to hear about anyone's personal experience living in this area. How did you cope with loud partiers on the weekend? Should I actually just avoid this area like the plague if I'm not a big partier/concerned about dealing with drunk bros alllllllll the time???",Seattle,Exactly ***how*** loud will an apartment on Madison at the edge of Pike/Pine be??

&amp;#x200B;

so basically. I borrowed my boyfriends car early yesterday morning to go to my jobs boot camp workout and as i'm leaving I get pulled over for expired tabs. (I was unaware) and to put icing on that cake, I didn't have my wallet on me because I was rushing that morning and thought it was already in the car - it wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I luckily had some mail in said car with my name and address on it. so they looked me up (and this is where things turn bad) - I moved here from LA and have never changed over my license, big mistake on my part clearly. so the cop goes on to say that I have received a ticket during my time in WA and didn't pay (???) and that my license was expired. I know the exact date of exp on my LA license and it's not expired and she tells me that since I got a ticket and did not pay that WA state ""created"" an ID for me and that is what is expired. she also threw the word ""suspended"" around so i'm not sure if this unknown ID is expired or suspended. 

&amp;#x200B;

to sum it up, they impounded the car and said my citations would be mailed to me. after doing research online - a 1st offense for a suspended license is a MINIMUM OF 9 DAYS IN JAIL. I just don't understand why I could potentially go to jail for something I was completely unaware of for a ticket I was also unaware of. Basically, anyone who is familiar with WA law, am I going to jail or freaking out over nothing because I CANNOT go to jail - not even for 9 days.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks for any light shed on this subject :(

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Optimism doesn't serve food, but they allow food from outside and a food truck out back.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

All varieties of people are welcome! We welcome everyone who wants to enjoy gaming in good company, regardless of gender, race, or level of gaming experience! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

In the few years I have lived here and all the years I had lived in California never had I seen such blatant discrimination displayed back to back in such a few short days. 

From being told our backpacks weren't allowed after seeing other, whiter folks go through with backpacks the same size as ours to being asked if we were in the right place or part of town and even having families stare and whisper about us asking about things on the menu or fixing an incorrect order - I'm disgusted and angry.

The worst experience was having someone go out of their way to make the comment that I (a lighter skin Hispanic) look nothing like my mother and that he would have never expected me to be with such a crowd. All that after clearly being bothered while taking our orders and making faces at the items we picked out. 

I didnt really know where to vent all this since I got the short end of the racism stick here and it feels wrong to complain to my family who had it much worse.

My mother will be moving with us and has good income but not great credit. Total household income is around 120k annually, but neither mine or my wife's credit score is near some of the minimum numbers we are seeing (mine is around 650, hers 680) and like I mentioned, my mother doesn't have great credit. Do these ""minimum requirements"" mean that we shouldn't consider applying at all or simply just that landlords set the bar high to weed out potentially unfit tenants, but are still willing to rent to others that don't meet them? Basically I'm wondering, if we don't meet ""minimum requirements"" should I still apply or just not waste my time, application fee, and hard credit pull.

Apologies in advance for yet another post asking for advice on where to stay in the Seattle area. In the day and age we live in, I figured it would be nice to get some input from Seattleites to aid in my decision.   
   
Background: Taking a trip to Seattle for about a week in mid-March with my girlfriend and brother. Have stayed in Airbnbs before so I know my personal preferences and what to look for. Typically if I'm staying in a large city with decent public transit, I will solely rely on public transit to get around.   
   
Dilemma: Undecided between staying in Mt. Baker which is near light rail; versus staying in Greenwood which is more walkable and seems like it would have a more exciting vacation vibe to it due to its walkability. Mt. Baker seems like a solid choice due to the convenience of its light rail station. However, having to bus in and out of Greenwood doesn't seem like it would be too bad either.   
   
Airbnb Links: https://abnb.me/rHlRk3up13 (Mt. Baker)   
   
https://abnb.me/K25On9zp13 (Greenwood)   
   
As of right now leaning towards the Greenwood Airbnb due to the convenience of Fred Meyer being so close.

2028,FakeJamesWestbrook,1581568000,f34cag,Nan,"I've noticed, since being here, when I talk to locals (raised here at least since high school, or 10 years or more of life here) they're insanely just 'jealous or bitter' about anything.

When they hear a former so-called 'friends' name, it's never a, ""Oh yeah, I know James he's cool"" it's always a snide remark or a way to 'sink' the person, which is so... well, weird. I can understand if you 'hate a person' but to be a friend with a person for 15+ year or since high school, but bad mouth them, say bitter things about them, and not help them, is strange... Where I'm from if we don't like someone we just 'don't hang out with them' but I get it, it's hard for many people here to make 'any friends', it's always some weird they 'like you' but something happens an old friend or spouse finds out and they 'can't be friends with you' (which is insanely weird for adults just sayin')

&amp;#x200B;

Then it's such like, jealousy? For instance, someone could be in finance, not even in medicine and their so-called 'friend' could get into 'medical school' and they're angry as if that person 'took their spot' and this isn't just college kids, this is well into their 30's +40's, it's so strange...

Then like the UW people(There are some cool ones, but most of those are transplants to the college) but those from Seattle or the are, so 'sharmy' or arrogant just for attending the school, they treat it like it's going to Harvard until someone like I comes around (Cal Graduate) then they kiss my butt, or 'hate me' since I guess as one told me, ""you beat me"", though I never even knew the person in high school or in college... I mean, can people here just be happy for someone?

But, there is a glimmer of hope, all the computer people from CA or NY have made parts of Seattle bearable. I feel like, there are people that just 'hate' anyone they did not grow up with it, and they're stuck in these 'groups of friends' from high school, whom they hate, complain about, but it's so hard to make friends here, you just 'hang on' to whatever person you can, no matter how horrible they are... It's just strange that's all. I don't like it.

It's just strange(I've lived in 5 different states and 2 different countries, so, I'm not making up conjecture, and I've talked to others whom notice it.) Do you guys see this? Why is it like this? What happened to you guys that grew up in Washington in high school or growing up? Also, calm down on the overt and covert racism, for loving Russell Wilson so much, many hear seem to loathe minorities, which is odd as well...

I have never been able to thank them. Car was a Toyota Prius, and it was upside down when you, dear stranger, came upon it. 

I know this is a total long-shot and it was 13 years ago BUT I was in a rollover MVA on Southbound I-5 in August 2007, early in the morning, and someone pulled me out of the car (or maybe I crawled out and this person came upon me? Hard to say because I was in shock and had a head injury). I have never been able to found out who this person was or is, I have very limited memory of them, I'm 90% sure it was a woman but I can't be positive. I was the driver, my mother was the passenger, and she was still buckled into her seatbelt in the car (upside down) and had to be removed by EMT's/troopers. I think someone may have sat with her as well? Again, my memory is very limited. I was completely freaking out because I did not know if my mother was ok, and I just remember repeating over and over that my mom would be so mad because I had ""ruined our vacation"". Adrenaline is weird. I honestly think I might have endangered myself further if you had not been there to talk to me and reassure me that my mother and I were going to be ok and I needed to sit still and try and breathe while I waited for first responders.

I was about 20 at the time although probably looked younger, I'm a white female with light skin, blue eyes, light brown hair. My head was banged up and swelling, I looked like a barbie doll someone had squeezed, so I'm not sure if you'd recognize me from a photo, but I could probably find one from around that time if I dug into my social media. 

Also FYI both my mother and I are FINE, miraculously, and were discharged from the ER later that day (!!) albeit I was stuck rehabing for months after but still. Can't believe I basically walked away from that (seatbelts, amirite??) I'm 34 now, thriving, and getting married in the fall!

[https://www.zapenergyinc.com/](https://www.zapenergyinc.com/)  
This company is doing research into nuclear fusion for the production of electricity, and is a spin-off of research from the University of Washington's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics in collaboration with the DOE and ARPA-E, which is outlined here-[https://www.aa.washington.edu/research/ZaP/](https://www.aa.washington.edu/research/ZaP/).  (You can see where they got the name of the company from)  
This has been discussed before here-[https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/38bsko/uw\_researchers\_scaling\_up\_fusion\_hopes\_with\_doe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/38bsko/uw_researchers_scaling_up_fusion_hopes_with_doe/)  


That project-to scale up a sheared flow stabilized Z-pinch in a new machine called FuZE- was a roaring success-it met and exceeded all goals set by ARPA-E, which is a government agency that gives a good bit of funding to bleeding edge technological research.  As a result of these positive results, the lead scientist Professor Uri Shumlak formed a private company and is trying to create a prototype mahine to demonstrate net energy gain.  This video is a bit dry, but helps lay out where the research was in May of last year-[https://youtu.be/b21pxLKnQ30?t=381](https://youtu.be/b21pxLKnQ30?t=381)  


Any of you in college for engineering or physics should look into this-if this pans out, and I think at this point that's a genuine possibility, it's going to turn Seattle into the center of an energy revolution and accordingly create lots of very good jobs relating to plasma and engineering.  It's easy to be cynical with fusion, but the good thing about this approach is, if it doesn't work, we will know very soon-the next iteration of the machine will probably be up within a year or two at most.

So the **TL;DR** is that basically, someone approached me while I was in the Cascade neighborhood and eventually the whole thing left me feeling shaken like I've never felt before. I live north of Seattle, but have visited several times in the past. I'm aware that Seattle does have its problems with crime and homelessness, but every time I've visited I've never had an issue with any sort of harassment. I used to live near a city before living in Washington, and thought I had developed at least a basic level of street smarts, but perhaps I may need some more education. To give you a description, I'm a fairly twiggy 20-something male. At the time, I was wearing one of those cheap nylon drawstring bags on my back which just so happens to look exactly like [this](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1lXWMMXXXXXa5XVXXq6xXFXXX1/39-33CM-Waterproof-font-b-Nylon-b-font-Storage-Bags-font-b-Drawstring-b-font-font.jpg) (now I know where my school got their student apparel from... ^(\*cough\* AliExpress \*cough\*)) It was bulging with medications, magazines, charging cords, and other miscellaneous things that in retrospect I probably shouldn't have been carrying around on my person in a city. I'm posting on a throwaway because I'd like to give as much detail as possible without tying all of this to my main reddit account.

**Here's the story if you don't mind settling down for a read:**

The other day I had a doctor's appointment in town, so it was going to be a day trip. I need a lot support due to this illness, and my Mom (bless her heart) would be the one accompanying me. We see the doctor in the late morning, then treat ourselves to a lunch at the Lunchbox Laboratory on Pontius and Thomas in the Cascade neighborhood. We parked at the REI on Yale, so my Mom was going back to look around in the store (what an amazing REI!) while I had to use the restroom. I couldn't make it to the camping store, and had to fallback to the multipurpose commercial building across the street, with the Espresso Vivace.

I eventually made my way out and started heading south on Yale looking for our car, since I thought my Mom had since parked on the street (turned out she was still parked in the garage). Just as I left the door from the cafe, I distinctly remember walking past someone who seemed... off. I didn't get a good look at them in the moment, but I remember noticing that their body language made it seem like they had suddenly changed directions. As I was walking, I pulled out my phone to regroup with my Mom. Just then, that same person I passed earlier stopped me to ask me something. They casually asked me how my day was going. I responded *Good, thank you* and immediately said I needed to make a call. At this point I was able to get a good look at them; they were a few inches taller than me, white, blonde hair (blue eyes iirc) and wearing a faded red sweatshirt. They didn't seem much older than me. What really got my attention was that the arms of his sweater weren't filled. He appeared to wrapping his arms around his body. He said *OK* and continued in the same (opposite) direction he was going before. I stared walking south down Yale looking for our car and making my call at the same time. I looked over my shoulder a few times before reaching the corner of the street, but could not spot my mysterious sweatered stranger at all.

I crossed the street over to the REI side, and noticed my Mom walking out from the garage exit towards me. I meet her and we start walking back to the garage (she is a fast walker). We go down the outside flights of stairs to the bottom level, and continue making our way to the structure. At some point I look over my shoulder again, and to my horror, I see the same sweatshirted man keeping pace about 10 feet behind us. I had no idea where he had come from. I'm definitely not the confrontational type, so I try to subtly grab my Mom's attention but have no success. We pass the threshold of the garage, and I finally tell her that we need to get in the car and lock the doors. As we're hustling down the aisle to our car, I noticed that the sweatshirt guy is no longer in view. We dive in our car and lock the doors. As I'm catching my breath, I scan the garage and once again cannot see this guy. After a minute we start the car and make our way to the exit. We find it and start driving south to the nearest I-5 entrance ramp, and the entire time we're driving down the street, I again cannot see this person.

I have to wonder if we both came very close to being mugged, or worse. I have no idea if he was carrying anything underneath his sweater. Maybe I am just overreacting, and maybe this post is going to look like a giant nothingburger (compared to some of the other things that have happened in Seattle recently, especially). Personally though, I've never felt so close to having something bad like this happen. I felt like I was in a safe area, which is maybe also why I was caught so off-guard. Can you guys offer some insight on the area/my experience? Does this sort of thing happen a lot?",Seattle,"Really shaken from an experience in Cascade neighborhood, has anyone else had this?"

I'll be working downtown at Metropolitan Park West Tower. I've heard Seattle is fairly hilly and it's a big city. I'm fine with traffic, but would like to avoid hills as I drive a manual transmission with a not so great clutch.  


My preferences are:  
\- Under $1900 (1b/1b or studio's are fine) - I am also okay with a roommate situation if it throws me under the $1400 range.  
\- 6 month lease  
\- Not hilly ! for reasons I mentioned above..... (I know this is kind of dumb)

\- Maximum 30-40 minute commute by subway/bus. And if I need to commute, no more than a 5min walk or drive to a subway.

\- Within 5-10 min drive of a climbing gym. 

\- Must be safe, I often work late and I'm a female in my early 20s.

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Optimism doesn't serve food, but they allow food from outside and a food truck out back.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

All varieties of people are welcome! We welcome everyone who wants to enjoy gaming in good company, regardless of gender, race, or level of gaming experience! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

For example, someone told me crossroads on the Eastside was ghetto and I actually thought it looked like a pretty nice neighborhood.

We moved into Bellevue from NYC last June and while the commute to work is excellent and the neighborhood feels very safe, the prices here are just too high to buy so I‚Äôm looking for something in Seattle.

February's monthly meetup will be held at The Ballroom in Fremont - they'll have pizza and pool, and weather permitting possibly some outdoor seating around a fireplace. Our last few meetups were around Belltown / Capitol Hill / Queen Anne - so this time we're headed to our northern territories to be a little more inclusive of our arctic friends.

This meetup is also a little special - /r/Seattle was created on February 29th, 2008 - which means this meetup is our 12th (or 3rd, if we're getting technical) anniversary celebration! 

Anyway, enough talk, here are the details:

Where: **The Ballroom** (Fremont)

 **456 N 36th St, Seattle, WA 98103** 

When: 7:00pm until...

Notes:

* **This venue is a bar, so unfortunately this meetup is restricted to the 21+ crowd.**
* We may move around after a bit, I'll make sure to update this post and discord if we do (Likely to Add-A-Ball nearby for some gaming afterwards)
* Please remember to tip your bartender / server.
* Chat about this event (or find out about and help us plan future events) [on discord](http://discord.gg/invite/fBu3Qn5)

I'm in the slow lane, and there's 2 other cars around me. A Jetta infront of me, and a Prius in the the left lane slightly up a head. Light turns green, and away we go. Jetta speeds up and I notice I'm in the Prius's blind spot. So To get out of it, I switch the lane position 3(Farthest Right lane position, for no moto people), and twist the throttle and pull up about level to the prius driver's postion so that I can make sure he sees me if he shoulder checks.

And then this damn prius driver does exactly what I'm trying to make sure he wont do.

I do a quick check on him because I'm suspicious of his actions, and sure enough. He start's to lane change into me, No signals, doesn't even look over. He just starts to lane change.

I was obviously prepared for this, expecting it, so I grab the brake, slow down and he sees me and returns back to his lane.

Crash avoided. Good maybe he learned something?

Nope. Next light he guns it, and lane changes in front of me, no signal, taking up my following distance.

Almost every single incident I have had with cars, either avoiding them, or the 1st accident I ever got into, Prius.

Almost every fucking time. They never use their signals, they try to street Dale Earnheart their way around, and they are by far the most dangerous drivers on the road I have seen here in Seattle area.

We usually have 15-30 people, and end by 10 or 11. Optimism doesn't serve food, but they allow food from outside and a food truck out back.

Start time is actually more like 7:15, people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. *Note: there may not be games visible at this time. Do not be alarmed.* Also if you have a particular game you want to make sure gets played, especially a long game, it's best to show up then and acquire players.

All varieties of people are welcome! We welcome everyone who wants to enjoy gaming in good company, regardless of gender, race, or level of gaming experience! We play strategic games and social/party games, and everything in between. I bring some games, which you are free to use, or bring other games you want to play.

*Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ

Q: *Does this happen every week?*  

A: Yes, except for some major holidays, or when Optimism is closed. I will make a cancellation post in either of those cases.

Q: *Do I have to bring games?*  

A: Nope! You're welcome to, but feel free to play the games that others and I have brought.

Q: *Will I be welcome there?*

*Day 1 (Saturday) - Arriving by light rail from the airport (around 1PM) and dropping our bags at the hotel. Our hotel is right near the Westlake light rail stop. If the weather is nice and depending on the schedule I thought it would be cool to hop on the ferry to West Seattle and take in the cheap views. Grab some drinks and something to eat from Marination Ma Kai. Come back for the cheap happy hours at The Athenian or Ivar's Acres of Clams. I also see that cloudburst and old stove brewing are nearby. If were not completely worn out, might check out some of the bars in Belltown (Shorty's and Screwdriver both caught my eye).

*Day 2 (Sunday) - Checking out Pikes Place Market in the early morning (eyeing Mini Donuts, Mee Sum Pastry, Piroshky Piroshky and Pike Place Chowder). When we're done with that I thought we could spend the afternoon in Freemont  to check out the Sunday Market, Theo's Chocolate, Lenin and Troll Statue, Freemont Brewing, Brouwer's Cafe and Gas Works Park (if nice weather). 

*Day 3 (Monday) - Sleep in a little and check out the view from 40th Floor Starbucks at Columbia Tower and then walk the area by the Space Needle. Visit an Amazon Go Store. Late lunch and drinks before getting back to the airport for 7PM flight. 


I'd love to hear your thoughts on these plans and if there is anything you recommend I skip, add, etc. Whats your go to restaurant and/or bar recommendation for a visitor? 


Re: Starbucks - While i'm not a big Starbucks fan myself, my dad is a collector of the city cups and I thought it would be cool to get him the original logo cup from the first store. Would I be better off going around opening or around closing? I want to avoid the crowds. Also, is Starbucks Reserve Roastery worth a visit? 


Thanks for your help! Looking forward to my visit.",Seattle,Weekend in Seattle - Any tips with Itinerary? Where the beer at?

Like a good city dweller I take the bus to and from work but am considering spending $400 a month on parking, not to mention the cost of gas. Better transit would be a great thing, but I just can't support it right now. Not because I don't care about the environment or hate riding with poor people, I am increasingly made to feel afraid and physically intimidated by random gross men. I think this probably affects a lot of women in this city but I don't ever hear it talked about and when it has happened to me and I have raised my voice on the bus, fellow riders passively observe rather than do anything. I know there are a few bus drivers on reddit but after seeing how they're repeatedly abused on the bus, I don't know who would have any advice.

I'm a shorter woman. In the past few months I can think of at least two times that someone made me feel uneasy by touching me or blocking me from exiting the window seat. The first one flat out refused to move when I needed to get out. I missed my stop. I told him to move and he moved closer to me and touched my leg. I yelled *DON'T TOUCH ME* and jumped over the seat barrier. Instead of helping or doing anything, everyone around me just stared. No one did anything. As I got off the bus this guy yelled ""White bitch"" after me.

The second was a few days ago. I was sitting near the window and some guy sat down. I see him look me up and down. I have my headphones on and he keeps talking to me. I try to ignore him but he gets more aggressive. I move one ear and he says, ""What time is it please?"" I tell him the time and then look out the window. He slowly starts touching me, pushing his shoulder against mine and then his leg with every little bump the bus takes so there's this plausible deniability, of course. His hand moves so it will graze my thigh for the next bump, I stand up and tell him to stop. He acts oblivious to what I'm talking about. I stay standing in the seat. It's my stop and I tell him I want to get out. He stays seated but slides. I ask him to stand up and he won't. I say it louder and he finally does. That's another thing I've noticed that perverted men do. They always make you slide past them so your butt is right in their face rather than stand up.

This makes me feel so gross and dread public transit. I never know when it's going to happen. Whenever it's rush hour it's like these perverts know that people are vulnerable and take full advantage of it. I've thought about bringing pepper spray on the bus but I'm not sure if that's a good idea.

If anyone has any good ideas of how to protect yourself against perverts on public transportation I would love tips.",Seattle,Perverts on the bus

Saw the (bodychecking)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/f9ir9s/bodychecked_into_a_fence_on_alaskan_way/] post so I figured I would add my less violent but still worrisome experience from two days ago.

Got off work around 4:30pm, went to Chung Chun for a Korean Hot Dog (pretty damn good). Finished at 5pm and called an Uber pool, which told me to wait 10 minutes at 6th Ave S &amp; S Jackson St. I already had a bad feeling when Uber decided to have me wait there. 

I walk the block over to my pick up spot, and look at the nearby shops while waiting (Osami's, Kobo, ... etc). I was just appreciating the old architecture while waiting, since it was clearly an older part of town. 

About 7 min into my wait a guy sneaks up behind me and asks in a hushed tone if I wanted anything, took me by surprise. This guy was dressed in pure black, black shoes, black jeans, black hoodie pulled above his head, black coat, and a black scarf covering his face... only his eyes were visible. They weren't shitty clothes either, they looked like almost all new clothing, way too nice to be crazy or homeless. I couldn't really understand him so I said no thank you and looked back to my phone to check the Uber time. 

I'm guessed he was a drug dealer and when he realized I wasn't there for a transaction he must have thought my presence would cause his business trouble. He instantly gets in my face while making fist gestures asking why I was following him for so long, who am I, and why am I here. I tell him I have no issues with him and to have a good day and I try to walk back towards S Jackson where it was more public. He makes several threats and gets more aggressive over time, all while following me to S Jackson. Luckily my Uber appeared and he walked away very fast once other people were finally around.

I normally don't view myself as a target, I'm a pretty big guy (6'3"", 230lb), and I dress in older clothes (e.g. a ratty 12 year old Carhartt coat, and mostly ripped up hoodies). I also don't wear pricey accessories or electronics that would make me stick out. If crazy rando's are willing to just walk up to me and start assaulting me I could only imagine how often other more vulnerable or richer looking people get harassed.

I know this was a lot to read for a minor situation, but I just want to make sure everyone stays safe out there.

tl;dr - Got Assaulted by a masked man wearing nice looking pure-black clothing on 6th ave S &amp; S Jackson St. He did not seem crazy or homeless, it just seems like I walked somewhere I shouldn't have at the wrong time and was lucky my uber showed up when it did.",Seattle,Weird/Dangerous activity near 6th ave S &amp; S Jackson st. - International District

I am coming to Seattle for a conference mid-April and thinking about visiting the National Parks afterward... so late April. Thinking about a 4 full days road trip around.

I heard that the Cascade Loop is amazing, but not sure if the North Cascade Highway is open yet. I also thought about just doing the National Parks: North Casacde / Olympic / Raineer... but again I read online about bad weather condition around that time of year. So I am a bit hesitant on booking my rooms.

So I want to see if you guys have any recommendations, thanks!

Girlfriend and I may move to the area soon for a job. She would be splitting her time between the Puget Sound VA just north of Beacon Hill and the VA just south of Tacoma near Lakewood (2 days a week at each location). We are looking for somewhere that would best suit this situation. We don't want to live in the middle of nowhere so either living in South Seattle area or Tacoma seems to make the most sense and then commuting to whichever location she's not close to just those 2 days out of the week. She doesn't mind an hour drive each way if that's roughly how long it would be with traffic. I did read about that bus that goes from Seattle area to Tacoma. Is that a realistic option?

We enjoy the typical mid 20-year-old things such as good food, beer, music, outdoors, etc. Our budget is probably up to $2200 for a 1 bedroom. If it came down to it we would rather live near where there's more things to do and then worry about that longer commute those 2 days out of the week.

I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/f9oxse/incredibly_loud_jet_noiserumble_just_now_over/) about it, and it was also referenced in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/f9pbwi/loud_jet_engine_noise_near_boeing_field/). I submitted a complaint to the airport and this morning received this reply (emphasis mine):

&gt; Good Morning,

 

&gt;I want to provide information learned during my investigation yesterday regarding the serious noise event on Tuesday night. Also, I have tried my best to include all of the individuals who have contacted me personally and also through the airports noise complaint system, but please feel free to share the information below to the appropriate groups and communities. Thank you.

 

&gt;What we know;

&gt;**Tuesday February 25th at approximately 9:30 pm Boeing began conducting an engine run-up test of their newest aircraft, the Boeing 777X. Boeing received approval from the Airport to do this testing earlier in the day, only on the understanding/agreement that the hours of the testing would occur between 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm. After multiple delays, the run-up testing did not begin until 9:30 pm and went on until the Airport authority on shift made contact with a representative from Boeing at 12:30 am, to shut the testing down.** I can assure you that this is not the policy nor the proper protocols that are in place for any engine run-up testing at Boeing Field and the Airport is taking the necessary steps to ensure that this never happens again. The airport has a noise abatement program/policy for restrictions and limitations on when engine run-up testing can occur and the curfew is between the hours of 10:00 pm and 7:00 am. The event that occurred last night was in direct violation of this policy and has been addressed. This engine run-up testing of the 777X will be paused until further notice.

 

&gt;The Airports plan of action moving forward;

&gt;Boeing has been reminded by the appropriate Airport authorities of the noise abatement procedures and the times approved for engine run-up testing and has assured us that this will never happen again. The Airport is currently working on better communication tools for community outreach. We are exploring a notification system that will send emails, calls, and/or SMS messaging in real time of ALL engine run-ups in the future. The airport is also in the early stages of discussing a possible ‚Äúafter-action‚Äù community outreach meeting regarding this incident. If this is something that you would be interested in attending, please let me know.

 
&gt;Please look for a follow-up email from me later today with a response to this incident from Boeing, and any other information that I receive.

 

&gt;Thank you all again for your patience, and please let me know if I can assist with any other concerns moving forward.



&gt;Very Respectfully,

Usually I don't care but an hour of so ago a cop ran a red light while I was driving on Madison, was super blatant about it, and it just irked me. I get that sometimes cops will blip their lights to pass a red light if they're in a hurry but don't want to stir up too much attention, but this police officer slows down for the red light, blips his lights and just rolls through, and then comes to the following stop light and decides they need to wait at that one. It's in everyone's interest to obey traffic laws, even the police. Come on police car number 32670, and /u/Seattle_PD, do better.

There's a weird jump in the video at second 9. Not sure why but my dash cam split the clip up into two files and missed a second or two of footage. You can see the officer still in the left lane waiting for the following light.",Seattle,Seattle PD Blatantly Runs Red Light on Madison

2843,sgy0003,1583037007,fbowpa,Question,"Hello,

So as many of you seen the news, First death regarding Coronavirus was reported right here in the US. While I give my condolences to the friends and families affected by this tragedy, I am worried about racism in the near future.

A quick background about me: I'm a Korean who's been living in Seattle for 16 years. I got my citizenship last year, and haven't been back in Korea in years. Growing up, I realized Seattle is very accepting of many different races, and felt really comfortable living in this PNW area.

Buth with this recent news, I am worried for my friends, family, and all my fellow Koreans living around Seattle. I am worried about sudden change of hearts in many, holding prejudice against us. I am worried that by simply being a Korean, people of other races with automatically shun us out because they think we carry the virus. I am worried that all the connections and relationships I've established here will get sodomized because of supersition.

Am I right to be worried, or am I being a bit too paranoid?",Seattle,"[Serious] I'm Korean. After the recent death involving the Coronavirus, should I be worried about racism?"

* Several great suggestions to not go broke with parking (Swedish Medical Center lot was less than half the price of the hotel lot and significantly less expensive than every other option we looked for; a parking miracle!)
* There were many very helpful suggestions for where to print a last-minute poster without rectally intrusive costs. In fact, one user PMed me an offer to use their *personal* 3-foot-wide printer for the poster. The only reason we didn't do that was because my buddy didn't have his stuff ready in time to reply to the PM with any degree of courtesy. We ended up going with another person's suggestion: FedEx. We got quotes over $100 from a couple of places, then a much lower quote from a FedEx location. By stupid accident we drove to the wrong one (a few blocks from Seattle Center, in a plaza with a Bartell Drug) and the people there did it for even cheaper! It ended up being about $30. 

In addition, the ongoing discussions in this sub about traffic on I-5, favorite restaurants, what (not) to do at the Market or down on the waterfront, and the thorny issues of the increased homeless population and potential personal safety issues in parts of town were invaluable. For one thing, we didn't walk around thinking we were going to be mugged all the time. I am from up north of Everett, and the traffic (and sprawl) discussions over the past year or so were really useful for planning my jaunts up there to see old friends on a tight schedule.

So basically just thanks. I loved Seattle and Western WA when I rolled into town in 1985, and I have kept on loving it even though I haven't lived there since the early '90s.

Some of the main points from the article:

*The coronavirus seems to be more deadly than the flu ‚Äî so far.

*On average, seasonal flu strains kill about 0.1% of people who become infected...Early estimates of the coronavirus death rate from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, have been around 2%. But a new report on 1,099 cases from many parts of China, published Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine, finds a lower rate: 1.4%.
The coronavirus death rate may be even lower, if ‚Äî as most experts suspect ‚Äî there are many mild or symptom-free cases that have not been detected.
The true death rate could turn out to be similar to that of a severe seasonal flu, below 1%

*So far, the new coronavirus seems to be more contagious than most strains of the flu...
Each person with the coronavirus appears to infect 2.2 other people, on average. But the figure is skewed by the fact that the epidemic was not managed well in the beginning
By comparison, the figure for the seasonal flu is roughly 1.3

*The flu appears far more dangerous to children, particularly very young ones, who can become severely ill. Children infected with the new coronavirus tend to have mild or no symptoms.

*As of Feb. 22, in the current season there were at least **32 million** cases of flu in the United States, 310,000 hospitalizations and **18,000 flu deaths**, according to the CDC

*Most cases of coronavirus infection are not severe, but some people do become quite sick. Data from the largest study of patients to date, conducted in China, suggests that of coronavirus patients receiving medical attention, 80% had mild infections, about 15% had severe illnesses, and 5% were critical.",Seattle,How does the novel coronavirus compare to the flu?

2883,Illustrious-Cap,1583094522,fc02z1,Question,"I am 16, have lived by Seattle all my life. None of my family will let my guardian and I stay with them, not because we have any sort of issue but literally because they just don't really care or have no room. We've been going back and forth between motels and sleeping in the car for a year.  My guardian has no drug problem, they're not a terrible person at all, our family is just dysfunctional horseshit and I'd cut them off but quite frankly I don't need to considering they never talk to us anyway. My grandparents probably would have helped but they're 90 now and sold their house this year to live in an assisted living home. 

We've been on this waiting list for pierce county housing since 2018, and I already know theres like a 5 or more year waitlist for most housing here (not just Seattle but the entire area from seattle to tacoma). We have a lot of money from a tax refund we could use for an apartment, but there are barely any that we could actually afford with my guardian making 2,600 a month. 

And by the time we could find an apartment willing to take us due to not being able to pay the last month's rent (when we lost our place), we would not have any money from the tax refund left more than likely. I really have no clue what to do. We even tried to get into a shelter a while back but they're so full, it's basically impossible. We called every day to stay on the wait list for some time and nothing. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? It's getting depressing and I'm starting to lose hope. We aren't able to just leave either and we have next to no support. Resources either don't respond, or can't help. I don't even think there is anything we can do at this point. But it's worth a shot asking I guess. Is there any places further out in particular that might be easier to find something? Or resources, or something. I'm kind of fed up because we could probably rent a room but my guardian is afraid of it considering people can be pretty strange here.

\- Being in China, it really pains to see how people Wuhan/Province of Hubei are fighting this. A lot of sacrifices, a lot of tragedies, a lot of heroic efforts, and also a lot of idiotic shit. I'm not here to judge anything, but it just hurts. Being a human is about being empathetic, and the people in Wuhan/Hubei just lost a long period of their life in horror and pain. Not to mention the lives lost. Wuhan is a big city and an important one - imagine shutting a major metropolis for three months and having a lot of lives lost suddenly. The emotional and economical burden is unfathomable. 

\- As of now, 80k ppl in China infected, which means 99.9%+ of Chinese are NOT infected. However, 1.4bn ppl's regular life is HEAVILY disturbed. ALL businesses except essential supplies were shut down. A lot of SME suffered loss. Most of ""Service Sector"" just lost very important revenue during Chinese New Year festival. For example, Restaurants ($600bn industry/year in China) , movie industry ($10bn industry), manufacturing industries (must be $trillion+) all took a very heavy punch. Chinese people are taking the loss, and very eager to get back to their jobs and normal life. I praise how normal ppl in China all sacrificed precious time and important income to help prevent spreading the virus. Normal social and business orders are just slowly getting back to normal. 

\- However, from what we have learnt about the virus, it is serious but not unbeatable. It should not break our faith and calmness. The last thing the society needs in such case is panic, distrust, misinformation, and even discrimination. Unusual times often bring out the worst of human (remember how all the zombie movies turn out to be about horror of humanity ?). As a society and community, I hope we can just stay calm and alert. Keep good personal hygiene, avoid large crowds, and you will 99.9% chance be fine. Stay strong guys, and don't worry too much.

\- I have lived the past over a month in my apartment in Beijing, which is the longest time I have ever stayed home. I work from home, go out to buy groceries sometimes, take walks with my fiancee about once a week, and cook every mea for us. Personally I think it's already safe to just get back to normal in Beijing, but the city is still taking extra caution. It is a very special experience. Although I do get to have a lot of rest, I don't want to do this ever again. 

Anyways, Seattle, I just want to wish the best of luck for you all, I don't want to see anywhere to suffer from this stupid virus again. Also, I want my parents and grandparents to be safe and free from living in fear too. 

Wash your hands! Stay away from large crowds! Eat well, sleep well, keep a strong immune system! And 99.9% you will be just fine! :)",Seattle,Best wishes from Beijing - Hope Seattle is okay!

Not making this post to scare anyone, but this is an issue and needs to be approached with proper precaution. People should be prepared, this is not just the flu

Local governments and UW should be paying attention to this video as well, as it contains important information about containment. I highly recommend watching it to get a good idea of what's going on.

Dr. Bruce Aylward (renowned expert who led the team of experts on the ground in China)

[https://youtu.be/-o0q1XMRKYM?t=3058](https://youtu.be/-o0q1XMRKYM?t=3058))

&gt;The bottom line is this virus kills people... it kills our elderly and vulnerable... but this is not always the case - young people do die of this disease even in industrialized countries. **People are looking at this saying that but in China they don't have this, they don't have that, etc. If I had COVID-19, I'd want to be treated in China.** We'd go into these hospitals, how many ventilators do you have? 50-60. A scale we aren't used to seeing. How many ECMO systems do you have? 5. We don't have that in Europe. When we look at how dangerous this disease is, we have to be careful looking at the China data. **China know how to keep people alive from COVID - they are super committed to it and they are making a massive investment in it. That is not going to be the case everywhere in the world.... It is a serious disease and I worry that people are going to look at the China numbers and get a false sense of security.**

EDIT:

The report by WHO has more specific data on this:

&gt;Most people infected with COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease (dyspnea, respiratory frequency ‚â•30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ‚â§93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours) and 6.1% are critical

Since then,  remdesivir has been in trials in China, and is now being used at a  medical center in Omaha where some of the patients from that Japanese  cruise ship were taken. Don't trust me; do a Google search using the  term remdesivir trials, and you'll find very positive reports about that  and a couple of other drugs. I think we'll see expedited approvals by  the end of April or thereabouts.

COVID-19  is serious in about 20% of the cases, most of those being in the  elderly with other health problems. The treatment is no day at the  beach, so all the standard procotols are definitely in order. But not  the panic. People are being manipulated, and people need to apply a dose  of skepticism when confronted by the latest breathless fear mongering.  This is a classic case of ""bad news sells.""",Seattle,"COVID-19: Caution, Yes. Panic, No. Good News Is On The Way"

Now you may be thinking, ""no big deal, they've got it under control, and if it was too dangerous they would cancel comicon."" This is unfortunately untrue. Washington state is essentially not testing anyone for the virus, and there are little to no precautions being taken to stop the virus from spreading. Additionally, you can have the virus and be spreading it for up to two weeks before you show any symptoms. If you go to comicon, you WILL get COVID-19 it is almost garunteed.

Someplace where I can park my car at a hotel would be great too.

This morning, the WHO [officially](https://mobile.twitter.com/WHO/status/1234872254883909642) declared global mortality for Covid-19 to be 3.4%, declaring, ""By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected."" 

You may have to read the following a few times to absorb the information.

#**Psychology**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). 

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) is real and you must therefore be careful who you pay attention to. You will hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to get too concerned about"". These sorts of people have ether not been paying attention or could be in denial, a natural reaction to a looming threat. 

* It is better to overreact than to be in denial, as the former gets you prepared while the latter puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial will not take precautions, and they may do things like attend events with large crowds in the middle of an active global outbreak that is showing [no signs of slowing](https://i.imgur.com/GM2gQJQ.png). 

* Remember that people in authority are human and can be susceptible to denial. For the sake of everyone, [we must take the risk of scaring people](https://virologydownunder.com/past-time-to-tell-the-public-it-will-probably-go-pandemic-and-we-should-all-prepare-now/).

* Now is not the time to listen to denial. Now is the time to listen to caution.

#**Critical to know:**

* **Up to 1 in 5 people of all ages will require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) [source2 ](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of Covid-19, **the danger is not the mortality rate but overwhelming the health infrastructure**, which in turn causes unnecessary death.

* In the USA there are only 2.77 beds for every 1000 people, and 2.58 in Canada. [Check where your country ranks here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds). Why is this important? In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it).

* Because it's still flu season, hospitals are already busy with flu patients. This means it's extra important for the next month or so that we do our part to avoid spreading the new virus.

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for at least another year, if not more.

* Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease and 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure).

#**Preventative measures**

* Practice social distancing

* Do not touch your face

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). Carry disinfectant with you.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places. 

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). Especially stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, touch things in public with your knuckle, do not shake hands, wear latex gloves if you can. 

* Pass along facts to your colleagues and family while avoiding alarmism (feel free to share this post). 

* Consider pressing your boss to work from home. Many transmissions happen at work.

* It's goofy, yeah, but consider wearing goggles when expecting to be in big crowds.

* If you have extra face masks, please consider donating them to senior care facilities and hospitals, as there is a global shortage and they will desperately need them in the coming months.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine.

#**Typical symptoms:**

People with COVID-19 generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days).

Fever (87.9%)

Dry cough (67.7%)

Fatigue (38.1%)

Sputum production (33.4%) (a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract)

Shortness of breath (18.6%)

Sore throat (13.9%)

Headache (13.6%)

Joint pain (14.8%)

Chills (11.4%)

Nausea or vomiting (5.0%)

Nasal congestion (4.8%)

Diarrhea (3.7%)

Hemoptysis (0.9%) (coughing up of blood or blood-stained mucus from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs)

Conjunctival congestion (0.8%) 

#**Comorbidities**

Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include people aged over 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer. Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. Avery small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%)

#**Mortality rate:**

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0 as of now
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | 3.6%
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | 8.0%
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | 14.8%

#**From WHO report:**

* COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed.. COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences, and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the pangolin ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)).

**For countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks of COVID-19:**

1. Immediately activate the highest level of national Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures.

2. Prioritize active, exhaustive case finding and immediate testing and isolation, painstaking contact tracing and rigorous quarantine of close contacts.

3. Fully educate the general public on the seriousness of COVID-19 and their role in preventing its spread.

4. Immediately expand surveillance to detect COVID-19 transmission chains, by testing all patients with atypical pneumonias, conducting screening in some patients with upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent COVID-19 exposure, and adding testing for the COVID-19 virus to existing surveillance systems (e.g. systems for influenza-like-illness and SARS).

5. Conduct multi-sector scenario planning and simulations for the deployment of even more stringent measures to interrupt transmission chains as needed (e.g. the suspension of large-scale gatherings and the closure of schools and workplaces).

Taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.  During a black swan event, knowledge is power. Arm yourself and [read the full WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).

Currently I'm in the midst of selling a property in Mediterranean coast of Spain and my intention is to later relocate in the US. The reason I've been looking in that are is because of family reasons; my father is clinically blind and my older sister live in Pasco with her family (also for work, hopefully something regarding graphic design or tech sales, etc)
Anywho, I'm inquiring you redditers for advice on what I should do to get the best investment possible. We don't have unlimited resources, as everyone in the world who isn't Jeff Beezos. Most likely, due to market prices that I've slimmed through on sites like Zillow, we will have to figure out how to finance a small portion of whatever we end up buying. 
Though I'm a US citizen, I grew up in Latin America most of my life and in all honesty, I am completely ignorant in the known unknowns of real estate investment in the country; what kind of financial aid could I apply for through what federal department, what financial institutions would be open to financing such purchase for a 30 yr old with non US University degree and/or a visually impaired retired 70 yr old man.

My workplace is open for business as usual and they have not quarantined any of the multiple other employees who are sick and showing flu like symptoms. And the workplace has not been disinfected.

There are multiple people working there showing symptoms and they are in close contact with hundreds of unsuspecting customers throughout the day. One of these people wanted to leave work and get tested, but he was discouraged to leave work. 

First, the managers tried to hide it by not letting anyone know about this confirmed case.  And, later the vice president of the company met few people to let them know there was a case and that they should keep washing their hands.

9. Jade District.

12. Mississippi
13. Clinton

What I'm looking for?

30s male who works in tech (prospective employer in Redmond area) and have grown out of the party scene awhile ago.  Like green spaces, quiet, walk/bike-ability, and lots of restaurants to eat at.  No pets, don't do drugs, actively dating, no kids, go out to bars once in awhile, and athletic.  

If move to Seattle, could do rents between $1500 - $2000ish depending, and don't need much space than say 500-800 sq ft.  Don't like the ""strip mall"" vibe of something like Bellevue, but would consider it.  Don't think can afford a home just yet in Seattle proper, so fine with renting for a couple of years.

EDIT: I've already gotten some comments about how some of the neighborhoods have gotten impacted with more and more homelessness over the years, so the vibes changing.

I am registered to vote as an Independent.  

In order to vote in the primary, you have to declare a political affiliation, either Democratic or Republican.  This makes sense to me, as parties don't want random people voting for candidates that they don't actually support, in order to sabotage the electoral process.  

If I declare a party on the ballot and vote, will my registration change from Independent to the party that I have ticked on the ballot?  

In the general election, I will absolutely vote for whoever the Democrats are running - but I do have a preference between the two major Democratic contenders, and would like to be able to vote to increase his chances.  

Conversely, I would also like to tick the ""Republican"" box and write in Bill Weld, so that the current president doesn't just run completely unopposed.

3348,aneffingrobot,1583477462,fe9opz,Community,"**One of the sales people overheard the phone call** from the infected person's hospital and decided to break it to a few other sales people next morning.  

A handful of employees immediately contact the General Manager of the dealership, who does not respond to any of their concerns.  This makes those employees suspicious and they tell other salesmen working in the showroom. 

By noon, the vice president of the company Jim Rose and the general manager Kevin have a quite meeting with the managers only.  

After the meeting Jim Rose meets 4 people individually and tell them there was a person infected.  Jim tells them that he had the dealership disinfected last night.  

No body believes that Jim actually had the dealership cleaned a night before because all of the sales staff had the items on desks untouched.  

Jim's claim having the facility disinfected on Tuesday night was a BLATANT SHAMEFUL LIE!

This whole situation made a salesperson who was already sick with similar symptoms more concerned.  He was discouraged to leave when he wanted to leave and get tested for the virus.  A manager named Po said, I NEED YOU TO WORK ALL DAY. 

The sick sales person tells Po that he has made 3 other people sick in his household including a couple of old age people and he has to leave to get tested.  That is when Po lets him go.

Till the late afternoon on Wednesday, there is still no company wide memo and no public announcement to alert the public and employees.  So a small group of salesmen decide to take matter in their own hands to protect their coworkers and customers.  These 4 men know they are risking their jobs. 

The whistle-blowers reach out to Gov Jay Inslee's office, Dept of Public Health, King 5, Komo 4, Kiro 7, and City of Kirkland PD.  NONE OF THEM AGREE TO HELP.  After many phone calls back and forth and hours wasted, the news channels refuse to help amid having difficulty confirming there is actually someone infected at Toyota of Kirkland. 

Meanwhile, Toyota of Kirkland is open for business as usual putting hundred of customers and workers at grave risk. 

Frustrated and out of options but motivated to protect their co-workers and community, one of them drafts a note and another one posts it on reddit. 

The post spreads like fire.  Public outcry grows fast.  Concerned customers and others send angry emails and facebook comments to the management.   

And then Toyota of Kirkland admits on facebook for the first time that one of their employees was infected.  

Now it is confirmed that there is an infected employee at Toyota of Kirkland, but the dealership is still not taking any action to protect other employees.  One of the whistle-blowers reaches out to Kiro 7 again and asks them to help send the word out in order to push the dealership to do the right thing.  Again, NO HELP. 

It is Wednesday night and there is still no mass email or any sort of direct message to alert employees. (Not everyone has facebook.)

The reddit post and Facebook shares spread and reach thousands of people overnight.  

The dealership opens for business as usual on Thursday.   All departments of the dealership are open.  

There is an overwhelming amount of angry emails, phone calls, and social media posts directed towards the management, asking them to close the dealership.  

Toyota corporate sends out an email to all dealerships in the region, putting more pressure on Toyota of Kirkland to take some action since the public anger on social media is growing. 

2 days after the confirmed case of and infected employee, Toyota of Kirkland sends out the very first company wide email around 10:30AM announcing closing the dealership for 4 days to disinfect.  

**There was no apology** in the email for making the sick people working, keeping the news undercover for a day, and keeping the dealership open for 2 days without disinfecting the workplace. 

One of the whistle-blowers once again reached out the his contact at Kiro 7 news, but to no avail.  Toyota of Kirkland was on a NYC based news site Thursday morning, but this news is non-existent on local news.  Komo 4, King 5, and Kiro 7 have failed to protect their local community at home while they are publishing news of an infected person on a cruise ship in California.",Seattle,Coronavirus at Toyota of Kirkland - How did the news leak?

My son is graduating from college in a few months and accepted a position at AWS starting in August. We are from Dallas Texas and  I grew up idolizing Ken Griffey Jr. Aside from that. I know very little about the city though. I have a few questions I could use some help with.

For a 22 year old, what would be a nice area for him to rent from if his office  is located near downtown? I assume he would rent an apartment. He will be making a good salary but is very smart with his finances. I have seen documentaries about the cascadia subduction zone and the potential issues. Are there any factors related to that he should take into consideration when choosing a location?

Also he will be purchasing his first new car there. Him and I are both car people meaning we are not really into SUV's and trucks. He would consider a compact SUV though. In Dallas we get snow once every few years and the weather tends to just be very easy to drive in (the drivers on the other hand..). I know it rains a lot in Seattle. Should he focus on getting AWD / FWD or is RWD ok out there? We both like the Accord 2.0 Turbo sport and the Civic touring sport hatchback. I would like for him to get a car that looks nice, reliable and that he can go enjoy the scenic attractions that Washington, Oregon and California have to offer. 

We are very excited for him as he' our oldest and worked very hard for his degree and would like to help him get started in the right situation in Seattle. Thank you for your help.",Seattle,Son is moving to Seattle in August could use advice

&gt;I was surprised to learn that major stadium sporting events have not been cancelled to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  Due to the extremely infectious nature of this pathogen events where thousands of people are gathered accelerates the spread of the disease, akin to throwing gasoline on a fire.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please cancel all sporting events, conventions, conferences, etc. in Seattle.  I understand these actions will create a significant economic impact, but not as much of an impact as an out of control epidemic.  These actions will protect the public and, while they may be unpopular in the short term, will pay off handsomely in the long term.  
&gt;  
&gt;You have shown great leadership as **ELECTED OFFICE**.  Now is the time to lead decisively, Seattle is the epicenter of the infection in the USA.  Acting now not only protects Washington state residents.  By slowing the spread these decisive actions will protect all Americans.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Respectfully,  
&gt;  
&gt;**MY NAME**  
&gt;  
&gt;**MY ADDRESS**  
&gt;  
&gt;**MY PHONE NUMBER**

&amp;#x200B;

I don't post much, but I believe that the only way for our elected representative to know how we want them to act is to tell them.

Respectfully,

Paul",Seattle,Please help slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Your action can make a difference!

My sister's friend is in town for the weekend, she was walking from the airport to the light rail stop and stopped to take her coat out of her luggage and her small bag fell out. She didn't notice until she was across the city on the light rail.

It is a small yellow bag with blue flowers in it. There was some cash, her headphones, and her phone charger inside.

This was all of her spending money for the weekend, she is really upset because she doesn't get to see my sister very often and is worried they won't be able to have fun over the weekend.

If anyone came across the bag and would be kind enough to return it you could save her weekend! We could pick it up from wherever if someone has it.

We should not be having elective public gathering events where people are withing close proximity (within 6 feet of each other) for prolonged periods of time. I just read that officials beleive local cases are doubling every 6 days. We need to do as much as possible to slow this sucker down. Read what Wuhan did, there are some pretty extreme measures, and they're still not at a point where they aren't reporting new cases and deaths each day.

It's true most health young people will have mild symptoms, but on average each infected person will give the virus to 2-3 other people (R nought value), who will in turn pass it to 2-3 additional people, etc. If we don't slow it down, alot of old people and those with underlying medical conditions like asthma, copd, diabetes, weakness immune systems etc will be hospitalized, require icu admission and even die.

We need to try to slow spread as much as possible until someone can work out a vaccine / anti viral treatment or were lucky enough that it naturally gets better in the spring.",Seattle,Disappointed in the Sounders for not delaying their game or playing behind closed doors

- I have so much time for projects! I've re-organized closets and taken care of a bunch of chores I've been putting off. I'm going to start building model spaceships next week.

&gt;**Guidance for people at higher risk for severe COVID-19 Illness**  
**Public Health recommends that people at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible**, \[emphasis mine\] including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. This includes concert venues, conventions, sporting events, and crowded social gatherings.  
**People at higher risk include people:**  
**Over 60 years of age** \[emphasis mine\]  
With underlying health conditions including include heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes  
With weakened immune systems  
Who are pregnant

The Public Health advisory also says:

&gt;We understand these actions will have a tremendous impact on the lives of people in our community. Public Health is making these recommendations in consultation with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) based on the best information we have to protect the public‚Äôs health. This is a critical moment in the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in King County when such measures can potentially impact the spread of the disease.  
**How the decision to issue these recommendations were made**  
**We recognize that we are the first in the nation to issue such recommendations, and the decision was not made lightly.** \[emphasis mine\] Health officials weighed the potential benefits for community health along with the significant impacts that these recommendations could have on our community. In consultation with the CDC, we developed these recommendations based on the rising number of cases in our community and the importance of taking these actions now to reduce further transmission.

But so many organizations are not mentioning the part of these recommendations regarding members of the public who may be over 60 or have risk factors, and that those people have been advised to stay at home.

The whole reason Public Health issued those recommendations was to protect people, and to prevent or at least slow the progression of the epidemic, but how many people know to look on the Public Health website? I have the info, and I‚Äôve written several emails to various organizations, yet the recommendations these organizations post still don‚Äôt mention anything about special risks or staying at home. 

So, I'm turning to you, Seattle redditors. Can you help getting the word out about this to people you may know in a decision making position who can ensure that their organizations are disseminating the latest information? Or to people who may know people...

- **Keep my nails trimmed**. For some reason when my nails where too long I'd touch my face more, trimming them more frequently helped.

- **Wear gloves**. I wore fabric gloves (the kind you'd use to handle antiques or jewelry). They breath so hands don't get sweaty and they're washable. They may shrink in the wash so consider a size up.

- **Carry tissue or a cloth**. Sometimes you're going to really want to (even when you're consciously holding back). If you have a sterile cloth then use that.

- **Wash your face**. If you want to touch your face why not wash it at that moment. Wash your hands, first, and before shutting off the water give your face a rinse.

3494,Fauster,1583604342,feytxe,Nan,"Covid-19 is [endemic in the Seattle area](https://www.evergreenhealth.com/community-message-3520), and genetic analysis indicates that it has been spreading and mutating for weeks, with some doctors estimating that there are already thousands of infected people. Even if the number of infected people is highly limited and only 80 out of 3 million people are sick, the [The Birthday Problem/Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) tells us that it is unlikely that every one out of 40,000 sounders fans is not infected, and that there is a 2/3 chance that one person is infected. 

However, due to a lack of test kids and testing lab capacity, testing for Covid-19 among the very sick and contacts of the positive has been extremely limited (with 5-7% positive tests) and the 80% of people don't require hospitalization are unlikely to even seek testing. This means that far more than 80 people have Covid-19 in the Seattle metro area, and that far more than one sick person is likely to attend the Sounders game. 

Covid-19 is NOT like the flu because it has a reproductive number around 3, which is twice that of the flu, which means that it spreads much, much more easily. Also, Covid-19 is 5-20 times more deadly than the flu, meaning that the 50,000-80,000 flu deaths in the U.S. every year could pale in comparison to the potential millions of yearly U.S. deaths of the endemic and mutating novel coronavirus. Also, the Chinese are reporting that Covid has mutated into two strains, and the more infectious strain is also the most deadly, so we don't yet know the death rate of the Seattle strain. 

It was a terrible and historical lapse of judgement of federal, state and city government officials to allow this game to continue. In Italy, football games are now played in empty stadiums. In Wuhan China, a Chinese New Years celebration was allowed to proceed when they only had a few cases, and two weeks later, hospitals were overwhelmed with the sick, dead, and dying. 

This is not a game. The city and state should promise economic relief to the Sounders in exchange for cancelling attendance at games. The best defense against this virus is to practice historically extreme social distancing, and to ban large gatherings until random testing and sampling of supposedly healthy people indicates that the outbreak is under control. 

tl;dr: Don't go to the game. If infected, you are likely to survive after a miserable couple of weeks, but many of the elderly, sick and immunocompromised will not.",Seattle,"For the sake of the elderly, please don't go to today's Sounders game! Contagious people (sick or not) will be certainly there, and many healthy fans will become new Covid-19 spreaders."

This is a large, densely populated area, which is urbanizing every moment, not to mention its attractions like the Falls, Little &amp; Big Si, and historic sights that result in heavy tourism.

There is no public transportation. Snoqualmie Valley is one of the larger commuter cities/areas in King County, and it has no public transportation on Sundays.

The only way to travel without a car on Sundays in the 6 mile radius valley is via rideshare. 

I just took an uber from Mt.Si High School to Issaquah High School (14 miles, 15 minute drive, off peak hour, 0 traffic).

That cost me $35 with no tip. By no means is that realistic.

I don't understand why King County Metro doesn't just limit the services on Sunday in the Valley if they don't see it as worthwhile, but with how populus the Valley is and how far it is from non-commuter/suburb cities, having NO public transportation shouldn't be an option.

I'm a Canadian from Toronto, Canada, who is thinking of moving to Seattle for a software engineering job. I'm trying to estimate the cost of living in Seattle.

My question is: what quality of life can I have in Seattle if I **spend $50,000/year USD**? This includes the necessities of life like rent, utilities, food, phone/internet, transport, etc. but excludes discretionary spending on stuff, clothes, fun, trips, etc.

I estimated the 50k number by taking my Mint spending data in Toronto and increasing it for the higher cost of living in Seattle. I accept that a realistic Seattle number could be higher or lower.

I wish to rent a 1-bedroom apartment in downtown Seattle or the surrounding area for \~$2000/month USD, or 24k/year, which leaves 26k/year for the other categories.

I had just finished lunch/dinner at A+ Hong Kong Kitchen. As I was waiting to cross the street a guy came up to me to tell me I was beautiful. I just looked at him and nodded then began to cross the street. Something I would normally do if someone starts cat calling me. However he took it a step forward and followed me onto the middle of the street and grabbed a hold of my arm. I quickly pulled away and yelled at him to not fucking touch me. At this point I saw the pink gorilla shop sign so I ran towards it. I did see that he had followed me down 6th but turned back once I got inside the shop. I told the woman at the register what had happened since I was looking over her to the street to see where he had gone. He was over at Hing Hay Park just walking around. 

I was planning on going the opposite way and get on the light rail. Luckily a group of women had heard me talk to the worker at the register. And offered to walk with me. Thank you so much ladies.

My family and I are looking at moving up in June, after school ends for work (transfer in the works) for my wife, health for me, and hopefully better schools for our kids.

She will likely work directly downtown (like less than a mile from Mariner stadium). So we've been looking at suburbs we can afford out to the West so her drive time isn't an hour+.

We want to rent for a year when we move here because we won't have a lot of time to really explore the area before we have to move. And then buy after that year. We have a good nest egg and more when we sell, enough to buy a modest house up there (we searched zillow a ton).

Our big sticking point is schools. Our oldest will be going to college in the fall, and that's fine, that's handled, but our youngest will be in 5th grade and we don't want to move up there and then a year later move schools again. We're moving up from the Phoenix area and the area we live has moderate schools that could be much better.

Are there any teachers out there or highly involved parents who absolutely love their kids' public schools and/or school district, and don't live in 7 figure homes?

I spent 7 months in Seattle last year and I'll be moving back here from Toronto Canada to start a full-time in August. 

I'd like to have some advice on how to go about securing an apartment lease and furnishing an apartment. I'll be looking for a studio/1br apartment in Capital Hill or Bellevue for around $1700-2100 a month. My company relocation stipend is about 25k, but I'd prefer to keep the total cost down to 6k max and use the rest as emergency funds. 

So far, my moving strategy boils down to: 

\- Arrive in mid July. 

\- Rent an Airbnb for about a month while apartment hunting for August. 

\- Hopefully, if I manage to find an apartment for August, the overlap will help me have sufficient time to furnish my new apartment and get my utilities set up. If not, I'll extend my Airbnb stay by 3 weeks while looking for a September lease instead. 

\- Once I have an apartment, I'll furnish it with IKEA same day delivery and hire someone to help me assemble everything the next day.

3614,Lyra1425,1583731437,ffpucl,Nan,"My fiance and I have been planning a trip to Seattle for next week, and I'm seeing conflicting things about how concerned travelers should be about visiting right now. We would be staying with his brother at his apartment, but would like to do touristy things and just generally be out and about seeing the city, as we have never been to Seattle before.

I've seen conflicting things about visiting tourist destinations, restaurants, flying in the first place, etc. Some people don't seem concerned about Coronavirus (because there's not actually a very high chance of getting it, and young healthy people will be fine if they get it) and some people think it's totally justifiable to self-quarantine with nothing but a mild cough (because it's scary and not great to potentially expose immunocompromised and elderly people to it). What about the theory that fewer people going out in public should decrease our chances of exposure to it? 

For context, we are visiting from NYC... so I tend to think that no matter where I go at this point, I'm at risk of exposure to Coronavirus. But it is currently worse in Seattle, so I'm still a bit paranoid that if I visit, I could bring it back to my community in NYC where I go to school (and which has not had any confirmed cases among students or faculty here). I don't want to be responsible for closing the school down and I don't want to be in a 2-week quarantine. But I'm also not really altering my life choices here in NYC, so why should I decide not to go to Seattle? I go back and forth.

I'm just looking for thoughts from people who live there and see the day-to-day impact of Coronavirus on Seattle. Is there anything we should consider aside from all I mentioned here already? Do you have any opinion on whether we should postpone our trip?

Thanks in advance for your input!",Seattle,Should I avoid traveling to Seattle right now?

While most of us are generally young and in decent health (generalization), our establishments are transmission hubs. We are very likely asymptomatic and spreading it unknowingly whilst doing our jobs. Just by breathing, not to mention handling cash, dishes, trash, bathrooms... The more people we come into contact with, the more likely we are to catch/spread this virus. Not only you you, but to people we love who are part of the vulnerable populations. (Do your own research on that - cases young, healthy people suddenly coming down with extreme symptoms is starting to happen. This virus is new, you cannot know how your body will react based on assumptive data!). This alone should be reason enough for y‚Äôall to not want to come in‚Äî yet here we are. 

27% of Americans do not get paid sick leave, and that includes most of us. Yes, we accrue an hour of paid sick time off for every 40 hours worked. It‚Äôs not a lot (for me to take a week off, I would have had to have worked 40 weeks and used NONE of that sick time.) The incubation period for this virus, as best we know, is longer than that. Financially, we do not have the option to not work. We live paycheck to paycheck. Taking time off could mean getting evicted, going hungry, medication withdrawal, etc. This means we work if we are sick.

Most if not all of our establishments are not doing anything. My company has said nothing. Nothing. No change in policies, no ‚Äúabundance of precaution.‚Äù This puts us all at risk. There is simply not enough known about this virus to ensure our safety in public spaces. It‚Äôs up to individual judgment to take precautions, if not inhibited by business owners who aren‚Äôt taking this seriously. 

If you‚Äôre not going to listen to us, can you at least stop touching shit? Straws, disposable silverware, cups, chairs, tables, light switches, door knobs, YOUR FACE, your laptop, your phone, door locks, soap dispensers, faucet handles, POS systems and screens .... please, think about it. We literally have to watch you while you touch everything and then follow you around with a bleach rag to make sure, oh, you know, nobody dies. It‚Äôs exhausting. Businesses will value profit over people until they are forced to do otherwise. No business coming in would mean that owners would be forced to not only take this as seriously as it needs to be taken, but also to temporarily close. For all of our sakes. We have to take public health into our own hands here, and frankly, we aren‚Äôt getting paid nearly enough for this shit. Think about who is making these calls for us. You really wanna keep calm and carry on????

I honestly cannot believe people are still eating out. The exposure of risk is astronomical in a restaurant/bar environment. The pasties at some cafes are just sitting in open air!?!?!? Vote with your dollar by not spending it, please. Then maybe our bosses will consider closing our doors. But not until then. 

Make your own coffee *gasp!*, cook your own meal, get drunk at home. It won‚Äôt kill you. Or anyone else, for that matter.

I recently received a ticket for being in the HOV lane without passengers. I don‚Äôt have any qualms paying the ticket, but I‚Äôm more worried about the ticket going on my record and affecting my insurance. 

I had a ticket deferred about 4 years ago as well (and I had to have had a clean driving record for 7 years from the date that I deferred the ticket in), which is why I‚Äôm asking whether I should just pay the HOV lane violation or request a mitigated hearing. 

I have one speeding ticket (which was deferred), and now this ticket for the HOV lane violation.
Based off this info, I was wondering what would be my best option:

a) Pay the ticket - I received info from the issuing officer that it shouldn‚Äôt go on my record, but my own research led to conflicting claims about whether it was a moving violation or non-moving. Should I just pay the ticket and take that risk?

b) Request a mitigated hearing - on the chance that it is a moving violation (and would affect my record + insurance), should I request to have my ticket reduced to a non-moving violation (once again, while it sucks to pay, the fine isn‚Äôt the sticking point here - it‚Äôs whether it goes on my record or not)?

3690,Elusyb,1583808766,fg724k,Nan,"I work in a small office in the Kirkland area. A guy was out sick from 2/24-2/26 with a fever and dry cough. That individual returned to work Thurday 2/27 with a dry cough which has persisted to today. On Monday, 3/2, another person in the office called out sick. This woman also reported fever, coughing, headaches, etc - and was out the entire week; returned today appearing still quite worn down, although no longer feverish. She spent hours last Thursday speaking with nurses and doctors on the phone, explaining her symptoms and asking to be tested. Apparently after so many hours, she gave up, because she was told repeatedly that only severe (hospitalized) patients will be tested because kits are unavailable. Moreover, she was assured by multiple people that she ""only has the flu"" and not to worry. As a side note, the middle school that woman's child attends was shut down recently for covid-19 exposure.  This morning, another person called out sick, said he's feeling a little fatigued and has migraines. 

I had a conversation with the woman who was out sick for a week, and she said her symptoms began with headaches.  These past few days, I've been experiencing a tightness in my chest, although it's hard to know whether this is symptomatic of stress/anxiety - could be. To be sure, I'm checking my temperature and monitoring for other symptoms. 

I was at walmart yesterday. I heard a lot of dry coughing as I walked through the store - a lot of feverish-looking people, filling shopping carts with food and drinks, All these people, being told ""it's just the flu .. don't wear a mask"". Coupled with that, the lack of any available testing for people who call with symptoms. God help us all. 

One final note. Over the weekend, EverGreen Health posted on their coronavirus web page ([final paragraph](https://i.imgur.com/XsQfmQz.jpg)) that ""The CDC has determined that COVID-19 is now endemic, meaning that the virus is now considered to be regularly found in our region amongst our population"". That was the page's verbiage as of 3/6. But on 3/7, they changed the web page to omit any mention of the word 'endemic'. Also, the CDC has not published that 'determination', so perhaps EverGreen jumped the gun on that announcement and had to walk it back? Who really knows at this point.

3717,hecallstheshitpoo,1583856705,fgg8b0,Community,"While at Magnuson this morning, my dog was attacked by two Australian Shepherds that were together. One of the dogs, a black tri color Aussie, is named Rocky. I thought that the dogs were just playing at first, but then my dog became defensive after the two Aussies got aggressive and started biting at him. The other owner stood by and watched. I told the owner to get his dogs and leave, while mine was crying and fighting them off, but the other owner didn‚Äôt do anything but stand there. He didn‚Äôt say a single word to me, and it wasn‚Äôt after I picked up my dog and had the two Aussies then jumping up on me that he tried to grab his dogs. He didn‚Äôt ask if the dog was okay, or acknowledge me. What an incredibly irresponsible asshole.

In this situation, I would expect that a normal, responsible, fully functioning adult would simply take his dogs and leave the park. Instead, the owner walked them out of the off-leash area, took them off-leash and let them run around. 

I saw him again as he was leaving and asked why he couldn‚Äôt say anything, just ignored the fact that his dogs were aggressive, why he felt it was okay to let his dogs off-leash outside of the dog park, and he continued to ignore me.  Another dog owner approached me to tell me that the same thing happened to them within the last two weeks. The Aussies attacked his dog, and the owner didn‚Äôt do anything, ignored the other owner and just walked away. The Aussie owner could not control his dogs at all. They were wrestling with each other and jumping all over him as he was trying to get them into his van. If you see this man and his dogs, be careful around them. He brings his aggressive dogs to the park and is not a responsible dog owner. The dogs deserve better than that low life.

My fiance and I are going to be relocating to Seattle at the end of the month. We have found an apartment complex willing to accept us. When we asked about splitting the payment¬†for a deposit up into six months (as we're signing a year lease), they said that they were not able to do that. I was informed of the new(er) law that states that landlords must offer the deposit as installment payments. I'm having their legal department look into this, but wanted to get info from the source.  


I looked into the new law, but what I'm seeing that is conflicting is this statement:  
The tenant cannot elect to pay the security deposit and non-refundable move-in fees in installments if (a) the total amount of the security deposit and nonrefundable move-in fees does not exceed 25 percent of the first full month's rent for the tenant's dwelling unit; and (b) payment of last month's rent is not required at the inception of the tenancy.  


As we are not having to pay the last month upfront, only the first month's rent and deposit (which is equal to the first month's rent), does this mean we are not eligible? Or does this mean that both of those conditions have to apply in order to not have the option to make installation payments?  


I hope this makes sense!",Seattle,Deposit/Move-in Fee Payment Plans for Leasing Apartment?

3750,daffban2448,1583881179,fgmxa2,Moving / Visiting,"Girlfriend and I are planning a cross country move to Seattle from Tampa in June for her new residency. Although I'm excited, the logistics of the move are making my head spin. I've scoured this subreddit and gotten some good info - just want to ask a few things and double check this is the right way to do it.

Girlfriend's residency starts July 1st so she's planning on moving up mid to end of June. She'll be splitting her time between the Puget Sound VA in Tacoma and the Seattle VA. I unfortunately can't join her til August after graduation from grad school.

The plan is to book a flight to check out the apartment situation at the end of May (we're looking at West Seattle, Beacon Hill and Columbia City). Yes we understand the commute but from what we've calculated she'll be commuting less than her current job now so she doesn't mind. Then she'll drive over there in June and I drive up in August with our respective cars

My questions are:

1) Is end of May a good time to go check out apartments for the beginning of July?

2) Will most apartment complexes have two available parking spots even for a 1BR? (obviously paying for both)

3) We both drive pretty basic cars (Mazda and Hyundai). Will this be alright for getting around the National Parks when we have free time?

4) I've heard mixed things about Seattle's rent laws. Since I won't be moving up til August and that's when I'll start working, I won't have proof of income until then. Can she just put her name on the lease or will they require both of us to? I just want to make sure we have everything prepared and all questions answered as I understand the renters market moves fast there.

5) What are the laws regarding declaring residency? Her residency is only a year and it may or may not turn into a job so is that considered temporary status?

Last week a woman who i Presume lives a rather comfortable life on Queen Anne. (As this is where she got off my bus). Berated me for letting a homeless woman on the bus and, giving her an all night transfer. 

Let‚Äôs call her.... Karen.   Karen didn‚Äôt think i should allow someone who smelled so awful to ride the bus. The homeless woman only rode the bus a few stops, then got off at Virginia (there is a women‚Äôs shelter there)  After the homeless woman exited the bus Karen stood at the front and proceeded to berate me about the situation and how unfair it is for Karen and, the rest of the paying riders to have to deal with these smells and situations. Of course i was interrupted and silenced when i spoke to defend the homeless woman and her rights to ride. To be honest until i got the official complaint in my work mail today i was going to leave this one alone. 

However i feel i need to post a story that related directly to the situation so that anyone on this subreddit that rides the bus, might have more understanding and grace the next time a person with less then stellar hygiene gets on their bus.

Four years ago i was early in my metro career and i drove the last E line of the night. It was done at 5am. So i was often out mostly shuttling homeless up and down aurora as well as providing a safe warm place to catch some shut eye. One night i was on my last trip into downtown and the bus was empty with exception to one woman. She sat at the front of the bus and she very much smelled of feces. At first i was really concerned for her and was trying to think of how i could help. After some time passed i worked up to speaking with her. I brought up her state of hygiene and started offering resources i knew of that could help her get a shower. Her response is something i will remember for the rest of my life.

She told me. She was well aware of how she smelled. She told me it was her choice. That since she had started to let her hygiene go. she had stopped being raped so often at night...

A friend and I have booked a trip to Seattle next week from London. We booked this trip in December, before all of this coronavirus malarkey kicked off, and now as the date nears I'm wondering if it's really not worth it.

We'll be on the west coast for 3 weeks, renting a car and driving around. But from what I hear, so many places are on semi-lockdown and there's a possibility of either the UK or the US suspending air travel during our trip, rendering us stuck over there.

The final leg will be visiting my brother in Eugene, OR via Amtrak from Seattle. We've not received word the cruise, flights or train have been canceled yet and a lot can change in a month.

1. Have you guys seen any cruise ships disembark/embark from the port there?
2. Are places really as emptied out as the news projects?
3. Should we just cancel this now or wait? (I probably have until 4/6 to get most of the money back we've thrown down on this)

3803,elveswearhandsocks,1583937513,fgy50d,Nan,"I bought 500 masks on ebay when things started kicking off. I had read a post here on reddit that day about a heist of masks at a local hospital in Seattle. So I thought it was kinda weird the seller of these bulk masks was in Seattle *for so cheap!!* while the whole world was tapped out.

My work overlaps with the medical supply community and these don't smell like a med supply warehouse - they smell like the cleaning agents used in hospitals; specifically that C-diff floor cleaner formaldehyde/napthalene scent, and they're in a translucent smooth plastic bag that I've never encountered before. I can't find any mask brands with this logo.

Anyway I'm pretty sure it's a brand from a hospital and I have all of that seller's information. I'd like to give these masks to my local hospital all school but don't wanna give away evidence if these are stolen. While I hate for-profit health care, these might belong to someone else and the person who pulled off that theft may have killed hundreds with their actions.

If anyone has advice or resources or remembers the thread about the hospital mask heist please let me know, or if there are resources how to reach out to law enforcement with something like this. 

Honestly I'd rather tie them to a drone and fly them over to the ER here. I didn't even think they'd come.

‚ÄúThe media misinformation is making this look better/worse than it actually is. I know better than to believe this narrative because I‚Äôm smart/level headed, etc. and the rest of you are too (insert derogatory remark) to understand‚Äù

On rhetoric itself, this is some Alex Jones type of arrogance (the government is turning the frogs gay) and this is why.

90% of the time these posts end with something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done my research, now you do yours‚Äù. 

On the sheer principal of wanting to dispel misinformation, this is a real crappy way to make a point since you only contributing EMOTIONALLY when criticizing others for reacting EMOTIONALLY.

Do you really want to help? SHARE WHAT REAL INFORMATION YOU HAVE! Share the source material you‚Äôre looking at and make damn sure you are getting this information from an actual reputable source (if from a news outlet make sure they‚Äôre referencing their sources).

At this point you might be asking, why do all of this? Well believe it or not, there are people who will forego their emotions for facts if shared with them by someone who isn‚Äôt being arrogant and emotionally divisive.

3831,Timbukktoo,1583954496,fh2o5k,Nan,"Stanford hospital board internal message: 

The new Coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days. How can one know if he/she is infected? By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late. Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning. Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection. 

In critical time, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air. Serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases: Everyone should ensure your mouth &amp; throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs. That's very dangerous.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - CORONAVIRUS 

1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold 

2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose. 

3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun. 

4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 

5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. 

6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent will kill it. 

7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. 

8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on. 

9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice. 

10. Can't emphasize enough - drink plenty of water! 

THE SYMPTOMS 1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days 2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further. 3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. 4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You‚Äôll feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.",Seattle,GOOD PRACTICAL TIPS RE: COVID-19 VIRUS

Watching the press conference right now, glad something is finally happening. Other notes from the briefing:  
  
- Inslee asking all managers/business leaders to change policy and allow telecommuting if possible  
- Asking vulnerable people to not go outdoors or to gatherings  
- Asking public transit districts to follow King County's lead on increased sanitizing  
- Wants to fight as much as possible to reduce the risk of an ""avalanche"" of people that need serious medical attention, even with planning this capacity will be ""stretched at best""  
- If your physicians discuss with you advising delaying non essential surgery please listen to them to reduce strain on hospitals  
- Schools: Children seem to be relatively free of serious disease associated with this, but the best science tells us they can transmit the disease to other people they come to contact with  
- Schools: Inslee is asking all schools to ***immediately*** begin planning for school closures in next several days  
- Schools: Expects to give more guidance in the next few days and will be in touch with King/Pierce/Snohomish county school leaders  
- Likely have thousands of infections or potential infections, doing this is to slow the epidemic  
  
Dow Constantine portion (King County Executive) notes:  
  
- Expresses the concern for those who know people that have passed and for those fighting the illness at the moment  
- Doing what they believe (talking to health officials) is the best current step to slow the stem of the virus  
- Believes ***gatherings smaller than 250 should still not happen unless clear steps are taken to slow virus***  
- ***Will be signing an order to prohibit gatherings smaller than 250 unless they can prove (with review) that health checks and social distancing are being followed correctly to the advice of health officials***  
- Has spoken with leaders of sports teams, they ""understand"" that they need to be doing everything in their scope as well  
- Wants to preserve the limited capacity of King County healthcare system. Delay spread to stop this from overflowing. Responsibility of everyone equally  
- Targeted approach to allow economy to continue. If businesses can be shown to meet criteria to help slow the spread, they should absolutely continue  
- Policymakers must ask if they are taking the most appropriate measures to help in this crisis, today's actions help keep people from harm  
- Epidemiologists say that doubling rate is roughly ""5-7 days"" and that fact underscores the urgency as to why these measures are being taken  
- Wants to thank leadership from the business community as actually helping, and going beyond, with the slowing of spread. Specifically thanks Microsoft for offering to give paid time off for hourly workers to help delay spread  
- Thanks everyone for joining today, will now allow Dr. Jeff Duchen to speak  
  
Dr. Jeff Duchin:  
  
- Notes that this will absolutely cause disruption to people's daily lives  
- Recognizing increasing spread of COVID-19 in community  
- As testing increases, more and more cases are being shown. Multiple instances of COVID-19 in Long Term Care facilities  
- Expects a ""large scale"" outbreak within weeks, equivalent to a major earthquake but the shaking will last for ""weeks and weeks""  
- Will be a difficult time for all going forward  
- Social distancing is intending to slow the epidemic, though ""we know we cannot stop it""  
- By delaying the spread it will have less impact on community and healthcare system  
- Many ""older adults and many community members with underlying"" items that *will* require healthcare through the healthcare system  
- Early, comprehensive, sustained social distancing is required to help those vulnerable  
- Need to make sure we minimize who becomes ill or the healthcare system will not be able to provide care  
- By taking steps now/acting together, we reduce personal risk of exposure and transmitting, but also reduces for those most vulnerable  
- As Executive mentioned, Dr. Duchin is signing an order that ***prohibits events with fewer than 250 members unless event organizers can prove they are limiting spread***, does not apply to grocery stores or family gatherings  
- Schools: Need to plan for those that require school for medical or nutritional services in the event of a closure  
- Schools: Additional recommendations are coming  
- Review new CDC guidelines for preventing spread  
- Introducing Pierce County Executive  
  
Pierce County Executive Bruce Dammeier:  
  
- Very happy that most of us have the immune system that will help us through this  
- Increasing concern about seniors, pregnant women, and those with underlying issues, they are ""very vulnerable""  
- Supports actions in Pierce County  
- Knows there will be consequences, fundraisers are happening right now for non profits (scheduled), now more than ever those critical pieces of our community are required. Calling on everyone from Pierce County to support these non profits at this time  
- Key part of our community is churches and faith centers, this order impacts many of them, his church will be live streaming their services and others should consider as they cannot come together for services  
- Time when we need to re-double our efforts to care for loved ones, friends, neighbors  
- Introduces Dave Summers, Snohomish County Executive  
  
Dave Summers, Snohomish County Executive:  
  
- Sad to hear about another death in Snohomish County  
- Thanking Inslee for promoting action and taking advice from experts  
- Look at whatever science is available and look at impacts on community  
- Working hard to reduce impacts on our residents  
- Decisions announced today (and those *yet to be announced*) will have impacts on our community, but it is important that we follow them  
- Personal responsibility is our first line of defense  
- Amazed that traffic from Monroe was half the time as normal to get to Press Conference  
- Important that residents are getting consistent messaging and action  
- Snohomish County will follow King County's rules on gatherings  
- If you are elderly or have people that are vulnerable you need to use caution  
- Common sense approaches to keep the community safe with a united state is required  
  
Inslee:  
  
- Opening for questions after a brief statement about a text from the ambassador to Italy  
- Thinking this vision of Italy could be ""us"" is very disturbing  
- Those that believe this is a minor problem/just a flu are wrong ""stop saying it's just a flu or severe flu, please come see our care facilities in Italy, people can't breath, we have nowhere to put them"" (text message summarized)

I am mostly writing this to the crowd back home because I am not sure that my friends and family are aware of what is going on.
If you don‚Äôt know already, COVID-19 has made an impactful presence here in Seattle. Much of this city‚Äôs economy is dependent on the function of Amazon, and since several employees were confirmed of carrying the virus, the company‚Äôs employees have ceased to go to their offices to work. I am not making a political statement, but simply telling you what I am experiencing first hand. I work in the heart of the city. I would venture to say that 85% of the folks I serve work for Amazon. In a matter of a weeks my hours have dwindled drastically because nobody is going out to eat (within reason). As a student I don't work *enough* hours to be legible for food stamps, and how could I work more without the consumer? Well-off restaurants that have been in the city for over a decade, and were thriving just a month ago, are closing. Hourly workers are not making money. Everywhere I go I hear conversations of people being let go. My classes have been moved to online, as have most schools in this area. I‚Äôve even heard about working class folks going homeless as a result. Of course this would happen so quickly. You can‚Äôt find a 200 square foot studio in most of Seattle for less than 1150 a month. Pair that with any other amount of bills, this city is built to live pay check to pay check unless you are well off. Even then though, people *with money* that rely on the consumer for the function of their livelihoods are scared. We are seeing an effect on this city that mimics that of the state of Wuhan just a couple months ago. Regardless of how long it takes to control this virus, its socioeconomic impacts are already here and many more local businesses are going to close in a matter of weeks if there is not a turn-around. Epidemiologists suspect that this issue will only continue to grow for several coming months, and a vaccine will be on the market in 1-2 years at the earliest. Don‚Äôt take my word for it though, do your research. Prepare yourselves in any way you can. Take stalk of the things that matter most to you and pour your heart out into that. All we have is hope.

3941,thehofstetter,1584029633,fhishv,Nan,"Hey, Steve Hofstetter here. If you have tickets to my pacific northwest tour (March 19 through March 28), please read this. You may also read this if you don't have tickets, but it may be a waste of your time. You have tons of COVID-19 emails to read from companies you bought one thing from 7 years ago. 

We are cancelling the Yakima show as it's at a venue above the state-recommended 250 capacity. Those who bought tickets will automatically receive a full refund. All the other venues are at 250 or fewer, and we are not currently planning on cancelling those shows. 

We are, however, offering refunds to anyone who has purchased tickets that does not feel comfortable attending. If you are 60 years or older, we recommend you take us up on this offer. This goes for Eugene, Everett, Vancouver, Kelowna, Richland, Spokane, Moscow, Couer d'Alene, and Seattle. (That is for the city of Eugene Oregon, not just a guy named Eugene). If you'd like a refund, please email refunds@stevehofstetter.com before Monday March 16th so he has time to process all of them. Please include the name you purchased tickets under and the date/time &amp; city of the show. 

As the situation develops, we will be making decisions on future tours as well. 

In the interests of public health, there will be a few changes at the meet and greet after the shows. As much as I want to shake hands with everyone, there will be absolutely no physical contact post-show, even for pictures. Also, sales will be credit card only to avoid the transfer of cash between parties. The good news is we will still be selling shirts. Even if you don't like the shirts, they can be useful in a post-toilet paper society. (If you're one of those selfish toilet-paper hoarding monsters, I hope you get crushed by a giant pile of it).

If you do attend, of course, I'd love to see you. After the show, we will wave at each other longingly, like one of us is on a train slowly pulling away from the station. 

I do ask that you be mindful of your fellow patrons. Please, please, please wash your hand thoroughly before and after the show. (And just in general, you dirty dirty boy).

One last thing: the name of this virus is Covid-19, commonly referred to as Coronavirus. It is not called the ""China Virus"" unless you are an asshole trying to scare racist people.

As of 3/11, all Seattle Public Schools will be closed until 3/27 due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Unfortunately, not everyone in Seattle has the luxury of being able to to work from home or take an extended amount of time off. This means that until 3/27, there will be a large number of children in the city with no designated caregiver. In order to help solve this issue, I've put together a spreadsheet asking any **certified teachers** who are available to volunteer with caregiving. Hourly wage workers, nurses, and more are currently struggling to find childcare in the city and volunteers are desperately needed. Nurses in particular are risking their health to help during this pandemic and now need some assistance.

Why only certified teachers? There are people who have already been pre-vetted by the city to properly care for children.

I have one time biked from Seattle Center up to Capitol Hill via the 2nd Ave PBL, then up Pike St. past the Convention Center, over the freeway, and up to 15th Ave. E. That route, while convenient, was pretty scary by the Convention Center where the bike lane changes from being on the left side of the street to the right side. This may be the best option, but I'm wondering if anyone out there knows of others they would suggest.

I can't go out and try any routes right now since I'm quarantined, so I'm just looking for ideas at the moment. I have an e-bike, so steep hills aren't a no-go (but if they were, would I be biking in Seattle?).

My friend works in the greater Seattle area for one of the biggest local companies.  Their daily lifestyle includes work, grocery shopping, and the gym.  Every single day.  (They only take two days off from work each month.)

They are in excellent financial standing, even with the crashing market.  They have close to, if not the, maximum amount of accrued vacation time and sick time.

I asked if they were planning to pull the rip cord and use the vacation and sick time to stay home from work.   

""I'll keep working until the virus gets closer and the company tells us to go home.""

I pointed out that the company had already communicated to all of the employees that the virus IS close (here), and that it is not safe/wise to be there anymore.  They did this when when they told everyone who could telecommute to go home last week.  The rest of the employees are not magically at lower risk; they are just SOL due to the nature of their work.  (That's the boat I'm in with a different company.)  The company is not going to come back around to the SOL folks and say, ""Now you guys should go home, too."" until people are showing up sick on the regular and it's too late.  (None of these are customer/public facing jobs.)

Frustratingly, no light came on.  Still plans to work 7 days a week because the company knows best, shop for one day worth of food every day, and go to the gym daily.  

Lots of ""none of my business"", ""what can you do?"", etc factors.  Not looking for support or arguments.  Just wanted to get it off my chest because it's very frustrating.  I'm sure they're a drop in the soon to be revealed ocean of people with similar attitudes who are, or likely will be soon, spreading the virus to everyone else.  (Oh, and they also refuse to acknowledge that washing hands, while always good, does not magically mitigate the actual, primary vector of the virus.)

Today I was driving in Bothell and the car in front of me seemed like he was going really slow (I later found out he was doing 37 and the speed limit was 35) I was following him kinda closely, but not dangerously close in hope he would move over with the other slow car. He did, so I went along my way. A little less than half a mile later he got behind me, but was pretty far back.

 In the back of my head I thought ""God I hope that isn't an undercover cop."" Sure enough, it was. He told me I was following too close which is why he got over and was going to let me go, but then I started to speed. He clocked me going 42mph in a 35mph zone. He said he knocked it down to 40 so it wasn't as expensive. That was the only thing he wrote on the ticket ""Going 5 over the speed limit"" 

I was willing to pay the $128 ticket, but my friend said I should fight it, otherwise it will stay on my record and my car insurance will go up. Does anyone know if it's worth fighting? I would hate to have a ding on my record, but it's not like I can say I wasn't speeding. Plus I'm not even sure fighting it will keep it off my record.

\[9:38pm local time on March 11th, 2020\]

We are at an unprecedented moment in our city, state, and country. First, I want to express my gratitude for your continued support and patience as we continue to evaluate and adjust our operations because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

As health officials and scientists have noted, we likely had 1,100 active COVID-19 infections as of March 10 in our region. If we do not act, there could be more than 25,000 cases by early April. As you likely heard, yesterday, the State and County issued additional measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, including a prohibition of events with more than 250 people, and a prohibition on events with less than 250 people, if they don‚Äôt meet public health guidance on social distancing and hygiene. We have been working round-the-clock to assess what that guidance means for the Library. After much discussion, and in accordance with public health guidance, The Seattle Public Library has been called upon to support the City, County, and State‚Äôs efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. We all must do our part to keep our city and region healthy and combat the further spread of COVID-19.

**Effective tomorrow at 6 p.m., Friday, March 13, The Seattle Public Library will close all Library locations, and these closures will remain in effect until at least April 13.** We will be in continued contact with public health officials to evaluate our facilities beyond this timeline. This decision was made in partnership with Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and the Library Board of Trustees, and please know we did not take the decision lightly.

It is clear that now is the time for strong and decisive action in order to protect the public we serve every day, as well as our staff and volunteers, who have been going above and beyond to continue providing service over the last several days as this public health crisis has taken hold.

Decisions like these do not come easy, as it means a temporary loss of access to the in-person learning services and gathering spaces the Library is known for providing to so many in our community. However, this does not mean a complete shutdown of Library services. We will continue to provide the many digital services you have come to love, such as [e-books and e-audiobooks](http://email.librarycustomer.org/ls/click?upn=og58oECJONcZv8rx4IOMKr6xUYzHMvyCZAJX9X-2FEPbRl-2FrKgzzJYwQp68c7ICxV5qUT-2BTocr6cpm5QPJTlBfGw-3D-3DG_LB_T5FOz7yQJEfLbBhmYcjUKvMThEINssP1X9WTM-2FbeC6HiQA3-2Fs4unc-2BIxMwN7vO2TWg2NNHot4Pw-2Fmzs-2FnWl1qSe86BvaIYRVHRk-2FQDkx-2B6J4B3aemxaFsrCb-2Beh2M9YFpQYcrkyjDIqIi8nyj6cGlaJ9V8cszf8T6WiYRma34TWhbAzqCJzPHy1r-2FCuX3weia7-2BmmMbXSfYvv5aRMmt548Cn9FUfWigdMcC2-2BYu4UoGoB43y6nI07SvEv-2BMAwxrl0djY7HqFfiKJmEwTrUvfpmIowflwyk5OFjJpOVWNNo-2BG-2BziEaT9Qu-2BAyESR-2F9TXw9cKqawgUglJTaKMobB9rA8dlQiyhhZWwkXZ4rPSDUQy6SWXjP5bwER3Vs9Oo-2B32rvEO6wRdZ0RLXPuSoht5Z0YDKI5a3ynqKQOMl6hKYxQE-3D); [streaming movies, TV](http://email.librarycustomer.org/ls/click?upn=og58oECJONcZv8rx4IOMKr6xUYzHMvyCZAJX9X-2FEPbTmUK7EcYXmkMIgDIyE4dx4fhfJQJXCuwf0gAN-2FAw9JAQ-3D-3DWEeR_T5FOz7yQJEfLbBhmYcjUKvMThEINssP1X9WTM-2FbeC6HiQA3-2Fs4unc-2BIxMwN7vO2TWg2NNHot4Pw-2Fmzs-2FnWl1qSe86BvaIYRVHRk-2FQDkx-2B6J4B3aemxaFsrCb-2Beh2M9YFpQYcrkyjDIqIi8nyj6cGlaJ9V8cszf8T6WiYRma34TWhbAzqCJzPHy1r-2FCuX3weia7-2BmmMbXSfYvv5aRMmt548Cn9FUfWigdMcC2-2BYu4UoGoB43y6nI07SvEv-2BMAwxrl0djY7HqFfiKJmEwTrUvfpsZptIZ1-2BOqJlP4y-2BSX2FXBITqPrzBvLuJ-2BujVD08fPZomeshXjCdt-2FMXUJrwhJbH573ZoCSAyPH-2F7ZTXRTxNnYEqUopM6vZ8ah7dbjJN8WRZxFF3y2RDvcl-2FlA5Sy0uhCIuqQUPXOyBV8Lm68klY38-3D) and [music services](http://email.librarycustomer.org/ls/click?upn=og58oECJONcZv8rx4IOMKr6xUYzHMvyCZAJX9X-2FEPbSnzTbNVIpRMGQIQRqBaKCLDZcIELexefUez29w6PnlBQ-3D-3DdLWY_T5FOz7yQJEfLbBhmYcjUKvMThEINssP1X9WTM-2FbeC6HiQA3-2Fs4unc-2BIxMwN7vO2TWg2NNHot4Pw-2Fmzs-2FnWl1qSe86BvaIYRVHRk-2FQDkx-2B6J4B3aemxaFsrCb-2Beh2M9YFpQYcrkyjDIqIi8nyj6cGlaJ9V8cszf8T6WiYRma34TWhbAzqCJzPHy1r-2FCuX3weia7-2BmmMbXSfYvv5aRMmt548Cn9FUfWigdMcC2-2BYu4UoGoB43y6nI07SvEv-2BMAwxrl0djY7HqFfiKJmEwTrUvfpslEavqjawSN2ukT8ifXQpAj1d1mO2saQ2V9AkpWbBR5qQyxq36BvuckXQQr1oDsctxeJkvn1DNluQbqyw5k8bYoisa6UOfsQe-2BBTpxvHxAzHO6C2cqPY9RsFmNqNe75VHrteXfS3a3C2TTqxuUg7dw-3D); [free access to magazines and newspapers](http://email.librarycustomer.org/ls/click?upn=og58oECJONcZv8rx4IOMKv1g3WEPvpQkrWpVTTR3Q0nx8vWfAD9CcgBXNKVJIPxbVsR0eI2fbaHHa-2FqoY2W8mQ5qasVQvdawY2BkvEc3JmY-3Dkbjs_T5FOz7yQJEfLbBhmYcjUKvMThEINssP1X9WTM-2FbeC6HiQA3-2Fs4unc-2BIxMwN7vO2TWg2NNHot4Pw-2Fmzs-2FnWl1qSe86BvaIYRVHRk-2FQDkx-2B6J4B3aemxaFsrCb-2Beh2M9YFpQYcrkyjDIqIi8nyj6cGlaJ9V8cszf8T6WiYRma34TWhbAzqCJzPHy1r-2FCuX3weia7-2BmmMbXSfYvv5aRMmt548Cn9FUfWigdMcC2-2BYu4UoGoB43y6nI07SvEv-2BMAwxrl0djY7HqFfiKJmEwTrUvfpoydy8ev1IExXwD0n3dzkebeN02k0ACqeLXebxBakm-2BCyMStHd8E963pcpt0SbJ6kUWV12WAjwhHd-2BvlDn6fcwkv9dKTPf7YP4caEznbA6rZW8riCpOfV-2Fw56oS1UwYZFGTOpxOpjKG3RpiSDOUqQGU-3D); and more.

Hi, I work for a moving company called Suddath which does all the office moves for Microsoft on the Eastside. A couple days after Microsoft announced that all their employees are to work from home through March 25th, all our scheduled hours were abruptly cancelled by Suddath, with management telling us that everything was ""up in the air."" We were expecting to work all throughout the month of March, and now we're looking at losing thousands in income. 
From my viewpoint, I'd say there's about 60 people in various moving labor roles supporting the Microsoft moves, including the supervisors who are not on salary.
Suddath has not been upfront about how long we'll be out of work. It's likely to resume on the 26th, when MS employees go back in the office, but the WFH order could be extended. Suddath has only updated us over the past week saying they're still in talks with the client and Suddath leadership. I suppose there's a possibility for information to be lost in the mix, as Suddath's technically working for CBRE, who manages lots of services for Microsoft's campus, but from what I've heard, management at Suddath knows what's going on.
The Microsoft announcement on paying hourly workers was a slight glimmer of hope, but most of my coworkers dismissed it (reasonably), as we don't have set schedules on the campus, presumably unlike the shuttle drivers, cooks, receptionists, custodians, etc. Some conjectured that CBRE would keep getting paid for our work, but it wouldn't be passed on to us.
Still, Suddath workers are on campus almost every day supporting Microsoft and essentially everyone on the team expected to be getting lots of work this month, with overtime even.
So, we haven't received any communication from the company on how they're going to support their workforce for three weeks. They've asked us to ""be patient in these changing times,"" and it seems like they know many of us workers (some of whom are temps from a staffing agency hoping to convert to employee) would walk if they told us we'd be out of work for three weeks, or even more.
One coworker asked ""How are we going to survive?"" and even the supervisors are unsure if they can withstand more than the three weeks of no work.

I felt like I had to write this post when I saw news reports saying that Microsoft would pay *all* their vendors, as that's very clearly not true.
Many of the less fortunate of us at Suddath are going to be rather harmed by this, and I'm not sure if I will continue to work with them. I wish I could, as the work is low stress and the pay is fine, but they so often show no respect for us as workers or fellow human beings.",Seattle,Microsoft Is Not Continuing To Pay All Hourly Workers Supporting Their Campus

I investigated the unemployment benefits available for those 2 weeks. I do not qualify bc I didn‚Äôt work 680 hours or more in 2019. However, I‚Äôve worked more than 680 hours beginning September 2019 to present date. I‚Äôm eligible for unemployment benefits beginning April 12 as that‚Äôs the start of new fiscal quarter and the hourly amount calculation is updated to include Q1 2020. That is decent.

I‚Äôve been hustling to get insurance benefits from my employer as 630 hours are needed. I met that on March 4. A memo from Governor‚Äôs office states benefits eligibility apply only to hours worked up to the declaration of emergency on Feb. 29. I had 626.5 of 630 needed hours accumulated on that day. 

I‚Äôm ineligible until school resumes. We pay out of pocket for high cost and deductible plan, and wanted to drop it so fast. Looks like it will be delayed until May. 

I‚Äôm mad about what seems an arbitrary Feb 29 cut off date for benefits eligibility. I worked and schools were open until this week. That time not being counted towards benefits eligibility is maddening and seems wildly misguided. I hope it works out. 

These 2 short comings related to health care and supplemental income during unforeseen circumstances really makes me question my employment choices and concerned about the support government provides to low to middle income earners during unusual circumstances. 

I‚Äôll find additional income. I believe. However, $700 per month for insurance is not helping us at all during this time. Maybe it‚Äôll help if we‚Äôre injured or ill. 

The unemployment benefits current exclusion, and health insurance exclusion are the primary annoyances I‚Äôve experienced among a plethora of lessor BS.

Ive learned a good bit about unemployment benefits if anyone has simple questions. 

I‚Äôm living in an apartment, I‚Äôm not sick, I can support myself during this time, and other people need assistance Much more than I do.

I live in North Seattle where there are at least 8  walk in clinics and 6 hospitals most 9 to 5 but 2 the regular kind open 24/7 within 1.5 miles.  

I had a hard time finding a place where a doctor could see me.  I first went to the polyclinic by Seattle Athletic Club.  It is now a triage for upper respiratory treatment.  There are 2 people that screen you for the COVID-19 in the lobby.  I got a piece of paper that said... has been screened for the COVID-19.  Meaning i was fine to talk to a screening nurse for seeing a doctor.   Many people in line had masks.  I was given a mass amount of hand sanitizer the kind you find only in hospitals before i left the lobby.  I took the elevator up.  The 2nd floor was a check in with about 4 counters of practitioners.  Once i got through the line to see a nurse,  i was told i would only be seen if i had upper respiratory problems.  They told me to leave and printed a paper for me with clinics in the area and told me to go there.  The closest was lake city's urgent care next to O'Reilly but i understand that closed down for good so we didn't head there.  We passed pac med and i remembered they have a walk in so we went in.  This was 6 pm and they closed at 7. There were big signs to screen for COVID-19 that asked if you had been to iran Italy or china in the last 14 days to not go in. We went in and the admitting nurse told us the doctors went home exhausted so they were closing the clinic for the day.   They asked me a few questions, insurance,  last time i was there then said Good luck If i were you I'd go to the emergency room of northwest hospital.  Ok that's where we headed.  The emergency room was packed. I was told to wait.  The room was spinning. 
I was sitting in a chair curled up in a ball trying to not move,  with my eyes closed trying not to vomit.  My chair was next to the hand sanitizer.  They called my name, 
I followed the nurse,  she took my vitals.  No fever.  The nurses were ecstatic.  Told me i could wait in the locked waiting room. There was an empty area,  locked apart from the main waiting area.  There were couches.  I laid down and waited in there until they called me back to do an ekg and screen for heart and stroke. I was told to wait in the waiting room.  I asked if i could wait in the locked waiting room and the nurse said yes and unlocked it for me. There was now another couple that was also allowed in that were also waiting.  Now we were 4 in that special waiting room. I threw up 6 times. I hadn't eaten for 36 hours because i didn't want to vomit. 
I vomited bile.  The nurse came and said they could take me back. They did an MRI, took my blood for labs,  gave me suero.  I don't know the word in English.  Nutrients in liquid form through an IV. They also have me valium and anti- nausea medicine.  I do have a history of vertigo but it has been a long time since I'd had it this long
 I was going on 4 days.  Everything was normal.   i didn't have COVID-19 based on screening.  
  I wasn't tested but i didn't have a cough,  fever,  chills,  sore throat,  body aches,  becom in china, iran or Italy in the last 14 days or been in close contact with someone that tested positive.

4211,alexsmith2332,1584226528,fir8oa,Community,"About two years ago, I had  a bout of severe health anxiety due to personal reasons which caused me to become super stressed and worried about everything health related and otherwise. While I am fine now, looking at the general mood , I can imagine a lot of people getting very stressed out about the virus situation and I just wanted to share some learnings on how to deal with these stressful times.   


Please note, these are based upon my experiences and hence might not be universal to all but i am hoping you can take away something from this post.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Take some time away from the internet and the news** \-Its easy to get caught up in the frenzy with all the new articles talking about the virus and all the fear mongering going out with everyone weighing with their opinions. If possible, I would strongly recommend taking time to get off the internet completely so that you can take a break from the constant hubhub of information coming in.
2. **Try to take up a hobby which would take up most of your time and not allow you to focus on the gloom and the news**. It could be something as simple as reading a book,playing music, painting or anything that tickles your fantasy. The basic suggestion is to spend some time away from all the news spreading around
3. **If you must want to keep yourself informed, set aside a certain time in the day for an hour to read all the news you want**. Also try to ensure the news you get is from reputed sources so that you don't get caught up in the fear mongering
4. **Understand there are certain things you can definitely take to keep yourself safe** such as washing your hands regularly, avoiding large crowds and so on. Do what you can make you safe but try not to get caught up in the fear pathology that you should not get out of the house and just be isolated completely. You do have control on what you can do and use that control well.
5. **Mediate** : One of the things which I mentioned in my post linked below was developing the habit of meditation. I use insight timer as an app to meditate and it has helped me a lot to keep calm and relaxed in times of stress but you can use any method you want such as meditations on youtube or any app on the app store or just sitting still for a while.
6. **Talk to someone if you can** \- Sometimes just talking to someone can just help allay your fears and getting your thoughts out.
7. **Look for the good in people** \- While it can get frustrating with all the people behaving irrationally and hoarding toilet paper and water and people even trying to make a profit of it, there is still a lot of good happening and not a day passes when I see someone in my local facebook groups step up to offer to help. Take hope from them",Seattle,Dealing with health anxiety- some suggestions

WA's testing yesterday exceeds the lifetime total testing for about 47 or 48 other states.   And UW has been actively helping other states with their testing.

Is this a case of ignorance and non-reporting?  Seems amazing that health system impacts could hidden if it were anywhere near as massive as they have in Europe.  

I have wondered if the general stereotypes -- specifically of the Seattle Freeze and, compared to Italy, far less mixing of the generations -- might make the city somewhat more resilient.  Perhaps our baseline social distance is higher, and of course it has increased inexorably over the last weeks, even though there are still groups of dickheads flaunting the new norms.  Or perhaps inadequate testing means just the crisis is spring-loaded and one day soon 1000 people will show up in ERs.

4461,teepo1992,1584394025,fjsrnd,Rant,"Hi. I'm a Chinese-American studying at UW. I have not yet been directly discriminated or harassed due to the coronavirus. However, my friend (who I will call R) told me of an incident that happened that made me really, really mad. I'm still mad about it.

R is my girlfriend's roommate, and she is a Japanese study-abroad student who studied here from the beginning of the school year. She left back to Japan yesterday. She came with a group of other students from the same school(s) in Japan. This incident involves R's friend, who I will call M.

M is also a study-abroad student. I don't know M, nor do I know where exactly this incident took place, just that it was in Seattle. Last week, while going out to dinner with my girlfriend and R, R told us that M was mugged by a group of high school boys. They asked her if she had the coronavirus, and M said no. They proceeded to take her purse, wallet, and phone, and ran off. I'm sure there was a physical altercation, but I'm unsure if she was physically hurt. M tried contacting the police, but she never got her stuff back. Apparently, this was an experience she cried a lot about afterwards. R told me that nobody who witnessed it did anything to help. I had never felt so livid in my whole life. At the boys, at the people who saw, at me for feeling this anger.

Many of the Japanese study-abroad students were here on an English learning program, meaning that a lot of them were not yet fluent. I can't imagine going to a foreign country to study only to be attacked and discriminated against not even because of what country I came from, but because I look similar to a certain group of people on the same **continent.** I can't imagine being interrogated with a racist question when I might not have the linguistic knowledge to argue back.

I don't believe what the boys did was driven by fear. They wouldn't want to touch her belongings otherwise. I believe that they wanted to rob her first, but used the coronavirus remark as a verbal insult. I don't know if they wanted to rob her because she was Asian in the first place. None of this makes it any better, however. Regular mugging is one thing, but the coronavirus remark implies a racist intention. I literally cannot understand how dull of a sense of empathy they must have to do such a thing.

I'd been noticing a lot of wariness from the Japanese study-abroad community recently. Most of them live in the same dorm, which I frequent a lot because my girlfriend lives there as well.

Sorry, I'm just mad. I don't usually care for such things happening, but for some reason, this makes my blood boil. I live in central Washington and have only been to Seattle for school and other events. I hope that this incident is not representative of what the city is like under such events.",Seattle,My friend's friend got mugged because of the coronavirus.

Every year Seattle and King County get together and put on a 4-5 day long medical clinic for the under and uninsured. It is essentially a MASH unit setup in the middle of the city once a year. Volunteers from all medical professions, including physical therapy, radiology, dentistry, pharmacy, optometry and others, come together to serve tens of thousands of people who would otherwise not have access to full health care. Others, like me, who do not have any medical training are there to help with logistics and operations to ensure that patients do not get lost in the system. We are critical to enabling medical professionals to focus on treating patients and helping patients who sometimes have social challenges navigate through what can only be called controlled chaos. SKC clinic has served over 20,000 patients.

You can find more about it here: https://seattlecenter.org/skcclinic/

They recently sent out a call for volunteers to prepare for a response to a potential large scale outbreak in the Seattle area. The tasks could range from sheparding patients from station to station, checking them in, or ensuring supplies remain stocked for medical professionals.

These people are absolute professionals and know what they're doing to set up a field hospital. This isn't some amateur or bureaucratic event.

If you feel you are willing and able to help, please consider signing up. They will reach out should the need arise to spin up a field hospital.

You can sign up here: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=mgXluvB210mZlnLf6V1pxxcuXdcQ0D5FmdIB9bOOE5VUQ1E5SVNITE1JQjU4QllSVlVSQTFVOUNIMiQlQCN0PWcu

Even though Amazon has agreed to pay its hourly workers for the month we food service workers, receptionists, security guards and cleaning crew are still required to show up and stay our full shift in order to get paid, still exposing us to the virus. We have no idea what will happen to us in the coming months, and nothing is being communicated to us. We are absolutely not held to the same standard as it‚Äôs salaried employees and are still expected to come downtown and ‚Äúserve‚Äù a nonexistent population. Putting ourselves and those around us at risk. They don‚Äôt care about it‚Äôs hourly employees. At the end of the day they only care about covering their ass. 

After the federal mandate closing all eating establishments restaurants and bars with seating, Amazon has chosen to keep a cafe that has open seating and is still serving food to people. This cafe is not open to the public so it‚Äôs hours and operations are unbeknownst to the public. Forcing the employees there to come in contact with numerous people and putting customers at risk. 

The announcement earlier this month that hourly workers will still get paid during this time of crisis is shady and misleading, as it has been left out of many major news articles that we are still required to work our full shift on campus and risk exposing ourselves to the virus in order to get paid. I understand that many people across the country are losing their jobs due to this outbreak and I am grateful to still be receiving a paycheck. But Amazon is not being fully transparent with what they are sharing to the public. As hourly employees we feel our position is being misrepresented in the media. 

Amazon has done nothing but gain good press from this hourly worker wage announcement.
But we as hourly workers are the ones that are serving, scrubbing, and sacrificing for this tech giant. This company depends on us and they are treating us as if we‚Äôre disposable. WE DO NOT FEEL SUPPORTED. 

I just want the truth to be fully exposed. Especially since federal mandates in regards to food service locations are not being followed and our concerns are not being heard by those above us. 

If Jeff Bezos, richest man alive, and his billions can‚Äôt support the hourly employees that help keep his campus afloat, then we really are all doomed. 

Fuck Amazon. I really don‚Äôt get paid enough to put up with the bullshit that is this company

I have an idea and need some volunteers to help me execute on it.

Problem Statement:

As we are all aware, the recent coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc on Puget Sound area businesses.¬† Small businesses are getting crushed, and we simply don‚Äôt have the social safety nets to ensure these businesses weather this storm.¬† I get it - ‚Äúthat‚Äôs capitalism.‚Äù¬†¬†

While we all need to fix this in coming election cycles, I need help fleshing out and building something to try to help small business owners today.¬† ¬†If we don‚Äôt set something up to ensure local businesses can stay afloat through the coming months, then the only businesses that will emerge from the wreckage will be corporates that have the capital reserves to weather the storm.¬† Looking for some volunteers to unpack¬†an idea¬†and help me make it a reality.

Idea:

My idea:¬† ¬†establish a platform where local businesses can onboard to sell ‚Äògift cards‚Äô for future dates.¬† As part of their onboarding, the businesses provide basic information about their¬†fixed costs, so we know the minimum each business needs to stay afloat.¬† Once onboarded the platform can¬†sell gift cards¬†to the business redeemable at a future date.¬† If the restaurant exceeds its monthly fixed costs in a given month by 150%, then any proceeds beyond 150% will go to a collective pool to help businesses that sell gift cards between 85% and 99% of their monthly fixed costs.¬† Businesses that sell under 85% of their operating fixed costs will need to make up the difference to stay afloat.

Here is what I think we need at¬†a minimum:

* 1 person to ‚Äòpound the virtual pavement‚Äô and find business partners
* 3 people to dev the platform (sign in portal¬†for businesses and customers, payment processor, and redemption workflows)
* 1 person for UI
* 1 PM to work with¬†devs¬†on scenarios to enable (I can cover this)
* 1 person to blast social media and get the word out when we are live (I have an idea for this one)

Final comment.¬† I am not married to the idea above, so if someone wants to recommend a better way to solve the problem, then let‚Äôs discuss.¬† If we can agree on what problem we are solving, then the rest is just execution.

Some pre-reqs:

* You are not getting paid
* We are not doing this for profit

4573,mccincol,1584475133,fkbxat,Nan,"Hi, looking for some tenant guidance here since I'm having absolutely no luck finding this on the internet. 

I have a lease that ends on August 25 2020 and our landlord is already asking us if we will renew the lease and sending us the renewal document, *in addition* to starting to show the house to interested parties. We don't know whether we'll renew yet, and even if the lease is renewed, we're not going to have all the current tenants still on the lease (3 roommates will be leaving including myself), so my other 2 roommates have to find 3 other people to fill the spots, and of course it's really early for them to start doing this let alone to find people to sign right now.

What's the legality of this? My gut feeling is that it's WAY too early for them to be doing this, and I want to be able to push back on their constant pestering with legal info to back me up.

Any help appreciated!!",Seattle,Landlord is asking us to renew lease while we still have more than 6 months left until it ends

While we typically remove most posts on /r/Seattle advertising for businesses to prevent spam, we understand that this situation is completely not normal and falls outside of anything we've ever really experienced.  


Please use this thread to promote local businesses that are still open for takeout, food delivery, financial assistance (free meals for kids, discounted items, free services, etc) or other services that can help provide for folks during the quarantine.

New posts about business promotions will still be reviewed and possibly removed by mods, but we'll do our best to link them back to this thread so we have a consolidated way to see them all, and leave /new a bit cleaner.  


A few quick rules:

* Please do not share referral codes that provide you with rewards. Discount codes are fine, but not personal referral codes.
* Please do not report comments from business owners as spam, unless they contain personal referral codes or are obviously blatant spam advertisements.
* Please try to search comments for previous posts about specific businesses / deals to try and avoid duplicates.
* As usual, please do your best to not share personal information about businesses or owners in this thread. Facebook links will be auto-removed by automod, and we'll work on approving those that are links to actual business-owned pages (our rules still apply for personal FB pages).

This thread and it's contents will likely be edited over time - I'll try to have it stay stickied for a few weeks depending on how it goes.

Thanks to everyone for helping keep this community going.  


If I missed anything or you see an opportunity to improve this thread, please let us know by replying here or sending us a message in mod-mail.

Two, many of the office staff (not me) are over 65 years old and at higher risk to contract the virus.

Now hear me out on this.  I get that this is a serious situation, and we need to take precautions.  But why did we not go this nuts with SARS, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, Zika, Hantavirus, even fucking Ebola for chrissakes?

The swiftness with which we have changed our daily lives in a wholesale fashion is dizzying and indeed breathtaking.  I‚Äôd posit absolutely frightening.

Im getting to the  troubling part, and it goes like this.  DAE feel like there is this governmental one-upmansip and inertia  that is extremely distressing in all of this? You‚Äôre going to suspend this? Well I‚Äôm going to cancel it entirely.  You‚Äôre going to cancel it?  Well I‚Äôm going to cancel it for the rest of the year.

You‚Äôre going to prohibit gatherings of  500? Well I‚Äôm going to take it 250, 150, 50, 10, 5.

You‚Äôre  going to close bars and restaurants for dine in? Well, we are going to have people shelter in place.  Yeah, you can‚Äôt leave your house.

Do all these rah rah people that are blindly cheering on every new restriction give any though to the mental and psychological toll of all these measures?  Do they fail to understand the experiment that is being manifest for all levels of government to see?  That a virus if properly hyped can essentially by the breathless media and our leaders end America  as we know in a week‚Äôs time.  Do people really think there will be no ramifications? No scars from this?

Does this now happen every time the media starts talking about a virus?  How do we ever go back to business as usual after this, assuming it goes on much longer?  This is to say nothing of the financial impact for millions upon millions of people ad families.

People need to take a hard look at the real risks of what is happening in this country.  We are in an unmitigated freefall of panic right now .  We need to sober up, take a step back and get a grip or we are going to lose this country as we know it.  And no, I don‚Äôt feel my comments are hyperbole.

Mental and psychological health are equal to physical health.  If we sacrifice the former for remotest risk of possibly endangering the latter, then what is the point?

We are about to give large sums of money to various industries  to keep them from failing.  Rather than giving it to them, or loaning it to them, I think that any company that receives aid should give up partial ownership in that company, with the ownership share going to a societal mutual fund that each citizen gets an equal share in.   This mutual fund would have a say in the operation of the company, and a share in the income of that company, to be paid to each citizen on an annual basis.

4662,Xelif,1584523834,fkmugy,Nan,"This is either a really stupid idea, completely irresponsible, or might have some potential.

I live in Capitol Hill. I'm trying to support my local restaurants responsibly, and I know others are as well. Our individual efforts probably won't shift the scale for restaurants at the cusp of going out of business.

Many of us are stuck at home - some would ordinarily eat out, or are too stressed to cook, or maybe normally cook but would like to support community restaurants. Meanwhile, community restaurants don't know if they'll continue to get business day to day.

The idea is ""restaurant cakewalk"": we move in turns along a walking loop of community restaurants, but like a cakewalk, you're not allowed to be in the same place as somebody else on the same turn. Unlike a cakewalk, you won't be eliminated, just asked to wait outside with safe distance. At each station you get some food. At the end you'll have enough meals to let you stay in for several days. Everybody pays an appropriate amount for what they're getting, and specifies vegan or no-restrictions food.

We get a bunch of restaurants in walking distance to participate - for example, restaurants up and down Broadway. Each restaurant provides packaged dishes that will keep in a refrigerator, 1/2 to 1/4 a meal, clearly labeled, with no-restrictions and vegan options available - other options purely at the restaurant's discretion. It's arranged so you touch your food container only: the door is open or shoulder-operated or whatever, you've already paid, the food is already placed for you to pick up, restaurant staff stay at a polite distance and wear gloves for any interaction.

Using an app, a site, or just a group text, everyone rotates restaurants as a group, so only one party is inside as a time. Everyone else waits outside - hopefully volunteers would help set up proper distancing depending on how many people sign up. At the end, hopefully we could set up some cleaning stations for people who would like to wipe down the containers they got.

The end goal is:

You: get a variety of delicious meals to last you several days of shelter-in-place, without having to endure a Capitol Hill QFC, where word of this newfangled ""social distancing"" thing hasn't quite reached yet.

Restaurants: get some bulk business, and draw down ingredients since they can decide what they're offering.

Community: keep as many local small businesses viable as possible; get out and about and somewhat social - at least doing a shared activity - in a safe and responsible way.

You can check out the list [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B90YSLElBro/). [I just bought 5 pounds of clams from Hama Hama Shellfish for around 25% off](https://hamahamaoysters.com/collections/quarantine-sale) .

It's also getting to be CSA season. If you have some extra cash you could put towards getting a box of fruit, bread, eggs, meat, whatever, that's a great way to literally put your money where your mouth is and help out.

It's tough because everything needs help right now, but investing locally in farmers has a lot of important benefits:

\- With stores running out of essential stuff, it's a good way to get what you need to stay home without putting yourself at risk.

\-Strengthens our region's food sovereignty, meaning that we're more able to support ourselves without depending on food being shipped all over the work

I had five generic masks lingering in my bathroom storage that I had bought from CVS. I needed them back when my husband and I were sick around our newborn. I had previously thought only medical grade masks were needed, but generic ones are, too.

Here is the post from the Seattle Children's FB page: 

""Seattle Children‚Äôs is actively working to conserve and to acquire more protective equipment for its providers, patients and caregivers. Supplies are limited due to the impact on manufacturing and a dramatic increase in global demand. If you have access to any style of basic isolation mask such as the one pictured below, we could use the support. Masks we are currently accepting: Basic isolation masks, 3M N95 masks (specifically the 1860, 1860s, and 1870), and surgical masks. We are not accepting gloves at this time.

We can accept curbside drop off of unopened boxes or bags of masks between 9am-3pm M-F at the Seattle Children‚Äôs Guild Association Office. We are located within the Seattle Children‚Äôs Administrative Building located at 6901 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115. We will get these items to the hospital; please do not drop off supplies at the hospital. Please call 206-987-7000 when you arrive and we will come out to your vehicle.

We can also accept curbside drop off between 9am-3pm M-F at the Seattle Children‚Äôs Bellevue Clinic located at 1500 116th Ave. NE, Bellevue, WA 98004. 

If you have questions, please call 206-987-2153.""

I told him apologetically that I only had a few and he said ""A few is still a help!"" There's no reason not to donate masks if you have any.",Seattle,"I donated a few masks to Seattle Children's.

* Get ready in the morning.

It is so easy to roll out of bed (or stay in bed) and just launch your computer. Take your shower, do your makeup, throw on that business causal button up. Doing what you would normally do in preparation for the office helps switch your brain into ""work mode"", which is the ultimate goal.

* Open your front door.

Breaking the plain of your home can be what you need to switch out of your ""I'm home."" mind. Obviously we are quarantining but taking one step outside can do the trick. Normally I'd say go for a coffee but obviously that's not an option.

* Look outside, sit in a window.

It's been beautiful out and a little sunshine through your window can really boost your mood.

* Call someone on your break.

Whether it's a parent or a friend or whatever, getting that social interaction can help a lot and it's really never a bad time to see what's happening in their life and tell them you love them.

* Think of the big picture.

You are lucky enough to be employed at a time where many members of our community are not, be mindful of that.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like, this is all part of life. This virus situation in general will change day to day.

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

To alleviate some of the financial hardships New Yorkers are experiencing due to the spread of coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a 90-day mortgage relief for homeowners across the state.

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not exempting people from the mortgage payments, we‚Äôre just adjusting the mortgage to include those payments on the backend,‚Äù he said.

* Grace period for load modification
* No late payment fees or online payment fees

\~Call/Text/Face-time your friends, family  (check-in, see if they need anything).  

\~If you are able-check-in on your elderly and immunosuppressed neighbors; offer to pickup a few items for them next time you make a grocery or pharmacy run

\~Contact the local shelters/rescues about fostering.  Since they are closed to the public and in person volunteers are limited, they are in desperate need of fosters.  Consider fostering a pup/cat/rabbit, etc.  

\~If you are able--donate to one of the non-profits in our area

\~If you have masks or other protective gear- please consider donating to a hospital, nursing home, etc.  My sister is a nurse and she said their inventory is running VERY low.

There are still so many employers that wont or can't have them WFH. The average size of household has only increased as it gets harder to live alone, especially in Western WA. 

Yes, the average virus holding date can be two weeks before symptoms shows - which means you are likely holding it for 3+ weeks if you do have it.

This does not include outpatient visits delivered in hospital based clinics. 

Examples of procedures to delay include, but are not limited to: most joint replacements, most cataract and lens surgeries, non-urgent cardiac procedures, cosmetic procedures, some endoscopy, and some interventional radiology services. 

**EXCEPTION**: The above prohibition does not apply to the full suite of family planning services and procedures or to treatment for patients with emergency/urgent needs (examples of the latter include, but are not limited to, people with heart attacks, strokes, or motor vehicle accidents). Hospitals and ambulatory surgical facilities may perform any surgery that if delayed or canceled would result in the patient‚Äôs condition worsening (for example, removal of a serious cancerous tumor or dental care related to the relief of pain and management of infection.)

A friend of mine is a phlebotomist at Bloodworks and has been filling me in on the situation for the last few weeks. Not *only* are the Bloodworks locations incredibly understaffed and over trafficked right now, but they are also actively refusing to take steps to prevent infection among donors and the staff and operating against their own official policy.

And get this. [They have higher levels than they've ever been.](https://imgur.com/suQuM4U)

Now obviously neither my friend nor myself are anywhere near Bloodworks management so its hard to say what they're trying to do. If they are worried about a shortage in the future... or if they're stocking up because OTHER blood banks are struggling right now and they're trying to make a profit.

Regardless that doesn't change the fact that they have been actively ignoring their own policy and are opening themselves up to a **substantial** lawsuit. My friend was recently concerned that they had COVID-19 and was told to take a test. They took the next two days off work as per protocol while they waited for the result which turned out negative.

Their *own* protocol states that if any staff member is under investigation for COVID-19 they must inform all employees that worked with that person and those employees must also take work off until that person is confirmed negative. This has not happened. No one has been told anything and the workers have relied on their own communication to find this out. It didn't happen with my friend and didn't happen with two other cases **one of which has not been determined whether the person is positive.** These are people who have close contact with hundreds of people every day.

I have more information that is potentially damaging to the company but I don't want to implicate my friend any more than I have.

The last three days, we've added 175, then 189, then 148 new cases today.  But the drop in new cases today is probably because WA did over 1000 fewer tests than the day before.  Generally WA has tested progressively more people each day.   So testing for the past three days: 2801, 3418, 2383.  I'm not sure what caused the drop in testing.

We have 1,524 positive and they have 7,102 positive.  I think it's much worse there, which is perhaps why they're on lock-down.

 **FOR ACTIVITIES OCCUPATION WORKERS**

SEATTLE ‚Äì Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of King County announces additional support through extended programming benefits for those in the trenches caring for the community. Families who work in these occupations, and who have no alternatives for youth care during the CV-19 health crisis in the Greater Seattle area, can attend any of the open Clubs for a joining fee of $50. The organization is waiving the daily cost of $25 per person for these workers until school districts reopen. 

Occupation workers are identified by Washington state as essential activities occupations during the Coronavirus outbreak and include: 

&amp;#x200B;

* First Responders and Public Safety Personnel (e.g.,      Police, Firefighters, Emergency Dispatchers, Department of Corrections)
* Public Health and Safety (e.g., Metro Bus Drivers,      Sanitation Services, Utilities, Public Health Employees)

We want to ensure that people on the front lines have their child care needs taken care of, so that they can continue to do their critical work helping our community fight this virus. They deserve additional support,‚Äù explained Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of King County‚Äôs President &amp; CEO, **Laurie Black.** 

While there are no signs of the virus at the Clubs, the organization is following the guidelines from Governor Inslee‚Äôs office, King County Board of Health, Department of Children, Youth, and Families, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the [Public Health Guidance for Childcare under which Clubs fall. ](https://publichealthinsider.com/2020/03/13/public-health-guidance-for-childcares/)

Along with previously instituted additional sanitation and cleaning procedures the Clubs conduct health screenings for everyone entering, including:  

&amp;#x200B;

* Asking at drop off if the individual      was in contact with anyone with a confirmed case of the Coronavirus, or if      they are awaiting test results from the last 14 days. 

 

* If the answer is yes, the youth is       unable to attend, or the staff person is unable to return to work until       after the quarantine period has elapsed.
* Requiring kids and staff to wash      their hands thoroughly upon arrival at the Club, before eating meals or      snacks, and throughout the day.
* Checking everyone‚Äôs temperature upon      entry. If a person‚Äôs temperature is over 100 degrees, staff or youth will      be sent home and encouraged to contact their primary care provider.

A daily updated list of Clubs and FAQs is at [www.positiveplace.org/extendedprograms](http://www.positiveplace.org/extendedprograms).  

‚ÄúWe want to give back to everyone in our community who are doing so much to keep us all healthy and safe,‚Äù Black indicated. 

Families who are not in activities occupations and are not currently Club members can still join, and receive extended programming care for a small fee. There‚Äôs no additional fee to current youth and teen Club members. New members will be responsible for paying the $50 membership fee and $25 daily fee.

‚ÄúThis is an exceptionally challenging time for our community as a whole. We want to ensure that people on the front lines have their child care needs taken care of, so that they can continue to do their critical work helping our community fight this virus. They deserve additional support,‚Äù explained Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of King County‚Äôs President &amp; CEO, **Laurie Black.** 

While there are no signs of the virus at the Clubs, the organization is following the guidelines from Governor Inslee‚Äôs office, King County Board of Health, Department of Children, Youth, and Families, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the [Public Health Guidance for Childcare under which Clubs fall. ](https://publichealthinsider.com/2020/03/13/public-health-guidance-for-childcares/)

Along with previously instituted additional sanitation and cleaning procedures the Clubs conduct health screenings for everyone entering, including:  

&amp;#x200B;

* Asking at drop off if the individual      was in contact with anyone with a confirmed case of the Coronavirus, or if      they are awaiting test results from the last 14 days. 

 

* If the answer is yes, the youth is       unable to attend, or the staff person is unable to return to work until       after the quarantine period has elapsed.
* Requiring kids and staff to wash      their hands thoroughly upon arrival at the Club, before eating meals or      snacks, and throughout the day.
* Checking everyone‚Äôs temperature upon      entry. If a person‚Äôs temperature is over 100 degrees, staff or youth will      be sent home and encouraged to contact their primary care provider.

A daily updated list of Clubs and FAQs is at [www.positiveplace.org/extendedprograms](http://www.positiveplace.org/extendedprograms).  

‚ÄúWe want to give back to everyone in our community who are doing so much to keep us all healthy and safe,‚Äù Black indicated. 

Families who are not in activities occupations and are not currently Club members can still join, and receive extended programming care for a small fee. There‚Äôs no additional fee to current youth and teen Club members. New members will be responsible for paying the $50 membership fee and $25 daily fee. New teen members will only pay the $50 membership fee.

For instance, if we are  low on oxygen equipment too, could the high altitude mask and associated equipment installed in airplanes be of use?  Could donated scuba tanks or welder‚Äôs oxygen be attached to a timer and a mask, and be used to inflate and deflate the lungs like a ventilator?  Heck, could manual bellows work as a ventilator?

5051,james826561,1584788659,fmdcwg,Nan,"There was a NY Times article linked below discussing the economic trade-off choosing between maximizing social distancing to prevent the spread vs minimizing economic damage. As the lockdowns, shutdowns and social distancing continues to increase across the world it is becoming much more clear just how damaging this is to the economy. The social distancing strategies have been effective at slowing the virus and saving lives but at an increasingly extreme economic cost.

At a certain point the question needs to be debated if the massive economic costs are worth lives being saved. This idea was tested in the UK when discussion by leaders suggested allowing the virus to spread while trying to mitigate the lives lost. This idea was very quickly shutdown by leading public voices and media which labeled it as inhuman. But often the decision makers and public voices are people who stand to lose the least from a massive economic shutdown. They are often well paid white collar workers who can comfortably work from home and have savings to easily mitigate any impact to their lifestyle. Additionally the government is determined to stop at nothing to save these same people from losing even a fraction of their wealth and savings from declines in the stock market. Even if these investments involved reckless stock buyback schemes designed to further their gains.

The idea that nearly all workers can isolate and maximize social distancing for weeks or longer many with no ability to work from home is completely unsustainable. It's a great strategy for government leaders, office works, actors, media personalities and hedge fund managers but it is a life changing decision for many less fortunate workers. For many other workers it is a decision that will likely come at the cost of losing their homes, being evicted, laid off and bankrupt. Even if a miracle cure were found, realistically it would still be months away and far too late for those who live on the margins. These workers are struggling every day and cannot survive a continued shutdown while a cure is developed without significant personal economic costs. Many of these people while perhaps not infected by Covid-19 would still be economically destroyed. This will put them on brutal path that often ends with drug addiction, homelessness and suicide. Already each year there are 500k homeless, 50k drug overdose deaths and 50k suicides. It's clear that these numbers are already set to significantly increase and will only accelerate further as the isolation continues.

Additionally the same leaders and public voices have attacked anyone who dares stray from their plans to isolate everyone. They attack students who dare to go outside, vacation and carry on with their lives. The students already stressed from student loans and rapidly decreasing economic opportunities have dared to decide they want to live their lives. Meanwhile billionaire hedge fund managers bunkered in one of their many homes call into CNBC breathlessly demanding everyone get back inside immediately and lock down everything lest they face the possibility of catching virus if it were to continue to spread.

Many of the leaders and public voices have backed up their decision on the trade-off with an idea that everyone can simply be bailed out. Perhaps their minds clouded by past memories of previous bailouts have developed a belief that this will work for everyone else. The reality is much different, there is no economic system that will allow for all economic activity to simply stop and be replaced with a government distribution of money. There is not even remotely sufficient government funds for these plans. The government is already reaching the limits of the debt and even massive tax increases would do little as the plan would already suspend most economic activity cutting off the majority of tax revenue. Instead the solution being proposed is to simply print the money. This desperate policy has been tried many times in the past and has always ended in chaos and destruction. Printing money will only further decrease the buying power of all workers who don't hold valuable assets such as homes and stocks. These workers will continue to earn the same stagnant wages watching their quality of life decline as the printed money lowers their buying power.

Instead these bailouts will work the way that the bailouts have always worked. The money will follow the powerful, wealthy and well connected. Saving their already inflated investment accounts from even minor loses. By the time the money finds it's way to the people in need it will be far too little and too late. Perhaps it will be enough to save many of them leaving them just short of complete economic ruin and allow many lives to be saved from the virus. But the question remains what right do those who are fortunate enough to be able to isolate at home without economic consequence have to shift all this burden onto hard working people. All while posting memes on social media about the challenges of working remotely and attack anyone who dares stray from their mandated shut down.

I would like to hear the opinion of workers who have lost their ability to work, small business owners and those facing economic ruin. What is your position on the trade-off between lives lost to the virus against the devastating economic impact of social distancing? Should we instead shift to a policy of controlled spread while attempting to mitigate the worst of the damage?

It seems that the builder of the development did not fully connect the home to any broadband provider. They built conduit underground that lines of coax and/or fiber could be run to the houses, and wires the homes up for both coax and Ethernet. The critical step missed is hooking up the house to the existing telecom connections.

The new neighborhood is served by a cable company (Wave) and all of our surrounding neighbors have this provider. Another townhouse in the development was bout before us, about 5 months ago, and have been trying to figure this out since they moved in, and have been without internet since. 

We have gotten as far as figuring out that an underground node to the service provider is approximately 35ft from the conduit end the home builder built to get to our homes. But we are now stuck bridging that 35ft. 

How do we get that gap bridged and get connected? who‚Äôs responsibility is it to get connected? What is our best course of action?

While the machines themselves will be absolutely needed they are not by themselves going to help much. Intubation is a serious health procedure that requires lots of staff and lots of medicine and equipment. To place a breathing tube appropriately is a process that takes a lot of practice and training. Improper placement can be fatal or cause permanent damage. Drugs are required to place a tube, we use propofol and a paralytic to get that guy in place. We check placement with a end tidal Co2 monitor and a chest x-ray. 

After successful intubation people need sedation to keep them from pulling out the tube most people cannot stand the feeling of having a tube in their lungs and will do everything possible to pull it out. Almost all patients need to be physically restrained to keep them from removing the tube. 

Patients who are intubated need to be turned ever two hours to mobilize their secretions. You can't cough and clear the gunk in you lungs with a tube so suctioning is necessary. That suctioning is done by a person who has been specially trained to do that. Improper suctioning technique can cause permanent lung injury. 

I want to mention this because I want to make sure that the public health officials who are working so hard to keep us alive are getting supplies from FEMA and the Feds. Make sure they remember all the things that go into operating a vent and not get tunnel vision(easy to do) on manufacturing just the machines.

Call a cheap m/hotel, and gift a week or more to a *deserving* current guest. (Warning, may require social interaction skills to get front desk to get your point!)

First off, what is ""shadow homeless""? Those of us that derive enough income, usually sporadically, to afford floating accommodation between the cheapest safe place to sleep, and rest stop hopping, itself a whole subculture I've come to experience. Cars are a near necessity, even if unsafe and/or unregistered. They are mobile accommodation. Safe shelter when motels aren't an option for whatever reason. 

 Me? Undereducated, oversmart, 4X yo newly jobless, ADHD *enabled*, Connective tissue issue, chronic pain, depression, anxiety... disabled (non-combat) Army veteran. My last gig, directly associated with a major player in consumer electronics, dried up a week ago. Gone completely. I'd only recently gotten back in shape from medical issues which took me out of working condition for nearly 3 years.

No. Drugs and Alcohol are not, now or ever, a problem. Except for beer. I like trying new beers at new breweries.  That has made me a ""you gotta try this!""'ist. (Please let that be ""proper"" grammar/punctuation!). My fixations are Consumer Electronics,  Bicycles (20+year pro mechanic), Cars (I've owned/built RX7's, Air-cooled *Vee-dubs*, Second gen CRX Hf chassis for road racing, etc...), etc...

This isn't a job interview, I just want to illustrate what kind of talent lives in the shadows.

I'm now ~3-5 weeks from TRULY homeless, but have a couple rooms booked at an extended stay for myself, friends, their pets, and their grandmother.  My last $2000 just went to that be sure we have about 3 weeks together, in combination with the income of others of course. We all chip in where we can, but with fewer options, and rising prices at those places that *are* open, we're being pinched.  No jobs, no way to make an income, no way to keep a shelter over our heads.

Maybe call a local/regional low price motel, and share that you'd like to comp a week/month for a good tenant. One that struggles but never fails to leave a dollar for housekeeping, or at least makes the staff feel like people, rather than *staff*.

We exist.  

The front desk can call housekeeping and ask if someone deserves a little hookup because of X or Y. You can wait that 3-5 minutes.

We were doing our laundry in the laundry room of the hotel, and then there was a couple who looked homeless knocking on the door getting us to let them in. 

Now, the laundry room can only be accessed with a key card given to guests. I thought that it was kind of strange for these ‚Äòguest‚Äô to not have their key card with them when they were trying to get inside the laundry room. We let them in anyway out of naivety and the couple starting doing their laundry.

It hit us in the head that these guys are very likely not guests staying at the hotel, we left them alone as our laundry were still being washed (yes..I know, we fucked up). We came back about 15 mins later and found out that they were (hiding?) in the toilet of the laundry room doing god knows what. 

Now my family and I are worried that they might steal something from the laundry room, and that (I know, sounds too drastic) the hotel might hold us as accomplices if they find out that the couple did steal something from the laundry room as we were the ones who let them in in the first place.

Should we let the hotel know about this or just let this be a lesson learnt and not to be so naive next time?",Seattle,Did my family and I fucked up by letting a couple (homeless?) do their laundry in a hotel?

5171,gruntbiscuits,1584896196,fn2t7d,Nan,"The magical figure for social distancing is specified as being 6 feet. However I'm wondering if this is way too short because:  
a) yesterday I was on the way to the grocery store and saw in the distance there were a couple of teenagers sat on a bench vaping and exhaling. Due to the smoke I could see that their exhalations spread out a distance of much much more than 6 feet, more like 15 to 20 feet (they weren't forcing the smoke out, just normal pushing smoke out that smokers do and there was a very very gentle breeze causing the smoke to slowly drift this distance).  
b) studies are showing the virus could remain suspended in the air for more than an hour  
c) I've seen a few doctors say you can catch it just by talking to someone or being near someone, they don't need to sneeze or cough etc. to infect you.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had walked within 6 feet of them I would have walked through the smoke plume, if I had walked 12 feet in front of them I still would have. The smoke itself is irrelevant, if they hadn't been smoking, just exhaling then walking 12 feet in front of them would still have been within the plume of air that was moments ago inside them.  If the virus can get transmitted into the air just through ordinary breathing, and if the air can spread much further than 6 feet, then seems that could be too short a distance?",Seattle,Is 6 feet too short?

I‚Äôm no skeptic or conspiracy theorist.

I‚Äôm just genuinely curious, with all of this time at home, what are your thoughts or concerns about the future of our freedoms or what are your concerns regarding the inevitable impact this will have on daily lives far down the road?

As we know, those of us who have experienced large scale tragedies, like for example 9/11, once freedoms/rights are taken away, they are rarely given back.

Is anyone concerned that things may not go back to the way they were? Is anyone concerned about the possibility of predatory people in power taking advantage of this time to put policies in place that aren‚Äôt in your best interest?

As I see it now I feel we will lose a lot of our freedom permanently and this will become the new norm.

For background, I'm originally from the area (Swedish Children's baby) and am very familiar with the area; I visit multiple times yearly because of family in Tacoma.

My long term significant other is starting medical residency in Renton this summer. I work in the tech industry and will in all likelihood find a job in downtown/south lake union. I'm quite familiar with several neighborhoods in Seattle (Downtown, Fremont, Queene Anne, Capitol Hill, Pioneer Sq, etc), but not too familiar with any in the southern part of the city. 

We'd ideally like a house with a small yard for a dog, and it would be nice to be walkable to coffee, restaurants, parks. Based on research it seems like Columbia City, Mt Baker, or West Seattle could be good fits for us, but I wanted to get more input from locals. Light rail would be great to get to M's games.

My question is: In terms of commuting to SLU/Renton, and overall neighborhood appeal, what are the parts of the city we should be considering?

Thanks in advance, any advice is appreciated.",Seattle,Favorite neighborhoods south of downtown or in West Seattle? (Best commute to SLU and Renton)

I‚Äôve noticed that people have this attitude that it‚Äôs their world and everyone else just lives in it. I‚Äôve noticed it with the way people drive, things like sitting in the left lane doing 55-60 on the freeway in clear traffic, completely disregarding the steady flow of cars doing 65-70. Another Seattle classic is crossing the street when/wherever they feel like it, basically expecting cars to stop and then flipping off whoever honks. I‚Äôve seen it on 4 lane busy streets. Yesterday someone came to a dead stop at a yellow light with a line of 5 cars behind them. Just 3 mins prior to that I had a lady walking her dog straight down the middle of the street and I noticed that she wasn‚Äôt moving despite the presence of a car moving towards her, so I gave a couple heads up beeps. She then turned around and stopped, still in the street just to stare, as if I was bothering her.

I can‚Äôt explain what it is beyond some crazily selfish behavior that‚Äôs been normalized due to people‚Äôs politeness I suspect. It‚Äôs pretty disgusting.

So it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that people are flooding parks and doing things that seem incredibly selfish, what do you expect them to do? Change their ways just because YOU may need to be protected?

Seeing folks get food and stock up makes me happy that I am there helping them and adding to their day. With that being said I just have some tips for anyone going grocery shopping during this pandemic:

‚Ä¢Please bag your own groceries. It‚Äôs great that you brought your own bags but I can assure you that most of us working don‚Äôt want to touch your reusable bags because they are normally dirty and smelly. And if you choose not to bring your bags, that‚Äôs completely okay, but please bag your groceries so the lines goes faster.

‚Ä¢Please be patient if we are out of something. I get that many people get frustrated that we are out of an item. This is not a normal time to work and stock at a grocery store, if you don‚Äôt see it on the shelf, the chances of it being out is pretty high, you can still ask us if we have anymore of it in the back, but please do not be upset if we are out.

‚Ä¢Please give us and other customers space. Don‚Äôt touch us, don‚Äôt tap our shoulders, don‚Äôt breath down our necks while we are stocking. Just be patient. 

‚Ä¢Please try to pay with a credit/debit card instead of cash. Cash as you know is insanely dirty and by handling cash we might touch each other‚Äôs hands and we want to limit that.

‚Ä¢Please don‚Äôt hoard/buy so much food that when senior citizens come to the store they don‚Äôt find any for themselves. We are all in this together. We understand that you want to limit your visits outside and buy a lot of food all at once, but I can assure for the time being we are not running out of food. You will not go hungry.

‚Ä¢We understand that you might be working from home, and we could be your only human interaction in the whole day, but please don‚Äôt vent to us about the news, we know what you know and we are emotionally drained, we can still chat and talk because it is part of our job to make a light in your day, so let that interaction be positive, instead of paranoid perspective and sharing your conspire theories and sharing how thankful you are that you working from home. It is not cool.

‚Ä¢We stock everyday. Every major grocery store stocks daily and throughout the day, if we were out of an item, the likelihood of it being on the shelf is pretty high.

‚Ä¢We thank you for the support and the nice words some of you are saying to us. It is really motivating.

Please ask any questions if you like. We‚Äôre all a community and grocery store workers are happy to be recognized nationally, we are all in this together. Sorry if this came as rude in some points, but we are working hard!",Seattle,Sharing perspective from someone who works at Trader Joe‚Äôs
5315,KittyConfetti,1585002486,fntf88,Nan,"Hey all, I had a question regarding the shelter in place theory (in general) that I'm not having much luck googling because its a long question.

I'm wondering, IF we went to a shelter in place directive, or for all the other places that are currently doing it, would 'getting it out of the way' as in putting it in effect earlier, really make us able to come out of it sooner in the year, or whenever? Like in theory, lets say a shelter in place order works. Somehow we 100% clear the virus from Washington, no new cases even asymptomatic carriers and testing everyone, we're done with it, horray! Then the order is lifted. Don't we just go back to square one and start getting reinfected from travel etc? Wouldn't a shelter in place order just put us into that situation for a longer period of time, rather than us being able to actually fix the problem? Because we won't have a vaccine for quite a while still. Is it just to slow the spread so that we can spread out our rescources?

Someone please explain I guess long term goals of this because it seems to me that a shelter in place order would only work if we all stayed in it until a vaccine is put out. And I'm pretty sure there would be mutiny and anarchy if we were forced to be for so long. I just don't think its sustainable for our economy or us personally. And if it is so we can be able to better distribute our resources, then I go back to my thought that in theory we shouldn't come out of it at all until we can actually cure it (vaccine). Right? Wrong? Thoughts?

The woman couldn't give us the web address to it directly (What?).                                                            She also said she could not email it to us!..... SMH

Said we didn't qualify because we are currently current on our mortgage (Duh!)

She said she will send us a packet and we will get it in 10 to 15 business days and maybe we might qualify for a 3 month forbearance.

When we asked her what the forbearance rules agreement would look like if we qualified she said she couldn't explain that to us and we just need to wait for the packet.

Does anyone have the link to this special form?

Anyone from BECU  or other BECU members who got through to them have any advice?",Seattle,Guidance / Help needed - BECU you are better than this crap! Anyone have to mortgage form link?
5432,dragyourself,1585076791,foazal,Nan,"I know it is hilarious and fun to mock local media as a dying breed and ridiculous during lulls in need of their broadcasts/publications. But during ~times like these, it is apparent that we still turn to them for important information like live broadcasts of Inslee's addresses, informing those who are stuck inside with local developments, and early breaking news of the deaths that occurred here before elsewhere in the nation started paying close attention. Many of the links posted in this very sub are direct to these outlets, even MyNorthwest (gag). 

It is however, also a shame that we have dwindling resources and outlets in our area such as The Seattle PI (online only with limited income for investigative journalism) and alternative perspectives like The Seattle Weekly and The Stranger -- which is an empty husk of what it once was. 

Local news isn't perfect. There is a lot of ""fluff"" and some sensationalism, which is rampant in most outlets throughout the world no matter where you are. KOMO is slanted obviously to the right. But I think we owe a thanks or at least a second thought to The Times, KING, Q13, etc for what they do for our community.

I was a tiiiny bit ahead of the curve, as I lost my restaurant job before restaurants were instructed to operate with takeout services only. I applied for unemployment on the day I find out I was laid off. Other than sending me an estimate of how much I \*could\* earn, I haven't heard a thing from the unemployment office about an approval or denial. The process was a bit complicated for me, and I'm afraid I filled out a couple things wrong, but I, of course, cannot get a hold of an actual person. The automated guy told me it can typically take up to 8 weeks. Kind of curious if they are working on getting checks to people faster now, given the situation. I know Inslee mentioned something about waiving the ""waiting week"" or something of that sort.

That said, I would like to ask for just a little emotional support, if that's even an ok thing to ask of a population that's currently in crisis and struggling itself. Because, as front line staff whose job necessitates communicating with the populace daily, just mental health toll of this crisis is already becoming a lot to bear.

Working at DSHS normally is already a hard task because, day in and day out, we're required to experience the worst that society inflicts upon our community. Job loss, child and elder death, homelessness, child and spousal abuse, and everything around and in between are a part of our day to day conversations, and secondary trauma is a frequent occurrence. Outside of trying (usually unsuccessfully) to find (and afford) a personal therapist, we don't have any mental health support at work. Even training that explains *what* secondary trauma *is* had only started last year. 

But this crisis is so much worse than even what our day-to-day inflicts. For 2 weeks, the influx of clients has been non stop, and there's no signs of it slowing. Just our office has gone from 50-80 cases a day to well over 200, and that's a conservative number. HQ isn't hiring more to staff up to meet demand. And daily, we get emails from administration thanking us for our service, but nothing about how we'll be supported through this. The prevailing philosophy in DSHS is that we should think ourselves lucky for whatever stability we have and that, if we didn't want to ""sacrifice"" for our community, we wouldn't have taken the job. (This ignores, of course, all of the people barely making more than minimum wage at DSHS who took the job primarily because they wanted to pay their rent, a valid reason to apply for any job.)

That leaves thousands of us depressed, exhausted, working overtime and way harder than we're capable of in a healthy manner, with no mental health support, and made to feel guilty whenever we start to burn out.

I have no leave left. No PTO. No breaks (aside from the legally mandated lunch and 15's). No days off. And I'm starting to crack. And I feel *guilty* for starting to crack because on the daily I see first hand how hard many of you have it right now.

I'm sorry for my weakness. But, any emotional support I could get right now, although I am not entitled to it, would be much appreciated.

Thank you for allowing me to vent (presuming this post isn't removed).",Seattle,"One of your Seattle DSHS front line workers, apologetically coming to the community for support."

What stood out about it was that I very rarely ever get the flu, but whatever I had hit me hard. Fever for 48 hours, large respiratory impact, asthma flair ups with lots of nebulizer use, and the weird lost of taste and smell towards the end while recovering.

The lost of taste and smell is something that stands out and has been commonly associated with Covid-19, but it also doesn't seem too too hard to think that any nasal congestion could cause that.

It's also not hard to believe a virus can move undetected for quite some time, especially considering the limited testing we have even now.

I am working on a team sponsored by NASA Ames Research Center on a research project around crew autonomy on long-duration missions to the moon and Mars.

One of the challenges astronauts traveling to Mars will face is confinement and isolation. They will be stuck in a small space with \~3 other people with long communication delays between themselves and the ground.

We are hoping to explore quarantine as an analogous domain to help gain insights into what we might design to help astronauts stay safe, healthy, sane, and focused on the long trip to Mars and back.

Want to help us in a big way? [Sign up for our 10 day diary stud](https://forms.gle/wt9QkCkLC6x6TuTx8)y! Every day for 10 days, you will be asked to spend about 5 minutes answering some questions about your day. Use it to vent anonymously about what‚Äôs going on, or just for something to keep you busy! We will read every response and it makes us feel better about our own quarantines to hear about other people‚Äôs lives.

Want to help, but don‚Äôt want to commit? Reply to this post with a little bit of information about your quarantine situation. How are you doing today? What helps you stay sane?

The WA order is NOT more or less rstrictive than CA, NY or anywhere else. Those three orders in particular are basically carbon copies of one another in terms of their restrictions and allowed activities. All are legally enforceable and qualify violations as a gross misdemeanor.

In fact, California‚Äôs order, which is constantly referred to as a ‚ÄúShelter in Place‚Äù does not actually use that term at all. The initial bay area order used it and that is what stuck in people‚Äôs minds. 

Similarly, NY also does not use the term ‚ÄúShelter in Place.‚Äù They use the name ‚ÄúNY State on PAUSE‚Äù for their order. 

Why does everyone have to be different? No idea.

5851,ihatefungus,1585453009,fqz3dt,Nan," I  recently moved in to an apartment in Seattle. The night that I moved  in, I was itching all over and I woke up the next day feeling lethargic,  congested, and foggy. Being in the apartment seems to bring these  symptoms on, and being outside or anywhere else for a while makes them  go away completely. I recognize that these symptoms are a reaction to  mold in the apartment.

I  contacted the apartment manager, who said I can break my lease by  either paying 2 months extra rent, or staying on the hook for rent until  another person moves in.

I  talked to my doctor, and she said that I should try to get the landlord  to release me immediately, as the mold poses a serious health risk, as  well as being inflammatory to the lungs and exacerbating risk of having a  bad reaction to coronavirus. She said that if the landlord did not let  me out of the lease without paying extra, I could call a county  inspector, and if they found mold (especially black mold) in the  apartment, then I could get out of the lease based on some county code.  It was implied that a landlord would not want such an inspection to take  place.

My  question is: What law is it that allows me to exit the lease based on  doctor note + presence of mold? I have looked in the WA state renter  laws, King County codes, and Seattle city laws, although not  exhaustively, since they are lengthy and difficult to navigate. I am  wondering if anyone could answer how this could be done, or could give  me pointers on how to find the laws, or if they know for a fact that my  doctor is incorrect.",Seattle,Question about breaking a lease for moldy apartment with doctor note

Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

I'm part of a team of doctors, engineers and experts working together to meet the anticipated demand for medical ventilators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

About Us:

1mventilators.com is a project dedicated to rapidly prototyping, manufacturing and distributing 1 million ventilators. The ideal device will be easy to transport, sanitize, and use in low- and no-power settings. Our design needs to scale to 1M+ devices for &lt; $200/unit and needs to be operable by anyone with &lt; 1 hour of training.

Our Goal:

In less than a week since we posted our 1 Million Ventilators project on HelpWithCovid.com, over 100 professionals have volunteered to help. We have also secured a manufacturing commitment from Liam Casey, founder &amp; CEO of PCH, and a funding commitment from Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. This project was founded by Neil Thanedar, CEO of Labdoor.

How You Can Help:

While our team is donating their time and efforts, we are looking to interview medical field workers in order to gain insights on both device demand and how this pandemic has impacted their lives.

StudioWorks Ballard, a coworking space for small businesses, is qualifying for mortgage assistance to stop paying THEIR mortgage for the next coming months, but is still requiring their tenants to pay their monthly rents in full and on time. She‚Äôs attempted to qualify for unemployment and grants, but still waiting in those.

Legally, they can‚Äôt charge late fees or begin the eviction process for 60 days so thankfully she is safe for now. However, anything she doesn‚Äôt pay now will be charged the first month she is able to begin working in the space again.

On their Facebook page, they are sharing links to places offering loans for small businesses. However, loans should not be the first line of defense for the businesses, as what happens when those loans come due? More payments they probably can‚Äôt make, more credit that is damaged.

My friend has emailed them asking for flexibility, offering additional months on her lease or a payment plan when she is able to work again but they have denied her and sent links for additional loans and grants stating that they still expect her to pay.

Many other coworking spaces, such as Fremont Space Building, are offering rent deferments so this is not an unheard of request in these times.

Negative reviews, or posts on their FB pages, are being taken down. Just wanted to spread the word so people know in the future not to do business with them (and if more people wanted to review on FB, I suppose that would be cool too).

Thank you! Stepping off my soapbox. If anyone has any additional resources I can pass on to her, I‚Äôd love them! Thank you.",Seattle,StudioWorks Ballard - not paying mortgage but still charging rent

Although WSU is a legitimate accredited institution, I do have friends that go there and I also know a lot of people that ended up leaving WSU to go to UW. WSU has a very low bar of entry, abysmal student retention rate, major lack of diversity, countless racist incidents, companies unwilling to hire WSU alumni and the stigma of being a WSU alumni, I can't believe that counselors and advisers would offer such a place as a suggestion when there are hundreds of other respectable institution of higher learning out there that have modest admission requirements and are still respected by the industry and greater society.

online, it says that the prospective tenant has up to 48 hours to accept/decline the offer before it is back on the market. if i applied but it is taking more than 48 hours just to finalize the tours, then am i no longer eligible for the first in line process?

I understand fully the overhaul on the system as well and that they are going to back pay any claims, but I‚Äôve done digging and found a few questions that raise some concerns of how to dispute/appeal. (Any helpful comments welcomed)

In the 1099 section is says the status is ‚ÄúDisqualified‚Äù with no reasoning on each valid claim I‚Äôve submitted. My claim is still ‚Äúactive‚Äù but when I click the clicky labeled Disqualified it says I have to contact the offices to dispute.

I‚Äôve also been approved of standby (March 21st got the letter), but have now had to request standby again multiple times due to the 1099 disqualification.

I‚Äôve already sent an email (Monday) and am hoping to hear back.

A) my boss isn‚Äôt actually complying with the letters sent (or isn‚Äôt even responding back?)*

Again this is just a gut feeling knowing how I‚Äôve been given the runaround since I started almost two years ago.)

B) the system is automatically kicking me these notices and they are working on getting it fixed.

I understand the phones are overloaded and there is now a scheduled time to call in based on the last digit of your social security number, but being left in the dark with absolutely no guidance and my funds running lower (alongside my husbands job slowly shutting down) it‚Äôs getting a bit more hectic and scary (as well as slightly unnerving if I‚Äôm right in guessing my boss is doing this to cover his own ass.

I really need the month of January 2020 to March 2020 to come into play so it can potentially qualify me. Because from what i see, its only going up to december 2019 for the alternative base year.

6218,dump_cake,1585845962,ftppa3,Nan,"Been seeing a lot of these posts lately.

I'll start this off with a cool little graph from the article here: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/02/weekly-jobless-claims.html

The graph is about midway through the article. Long story short, this current situation is unprecedented in the history of unemployment insurance. You're going to hear ""unprecedented in the history of UI"" a lot because it's **true**, both the scale and degree to which UI will be helping folks has never been seen before.

For that reason alone, understand that when you ask speculative questions, a lot of the times, there's no real answer because we are already drawing outside of the lines. You and me and Mrs. Jackson will just have to see what happens next.

OK. Now. On to the learning ...

CARES ACT

From here: https://www.esd.wa.gov/newsroom/covid-19

""Q: What benefits will become available to me?

A: There are a few big changes under this legislation:

- Eligibility for unemployment benefits is expanded to include many Washingtonians currently not eligible, including many self-employed people and those that don‚Äôt have the typically required 680 hours.

- An additional $600 per week will be available to everyone on unemployment from March 29 through July 31, 2020.

 - Benefits will be extended by 13 weeks, for a maximum of 39 (which is about nine months). This includes people who were already on unemployment as well as those who are newly eligible.""

""Q: I heard $1,200 will be part of this ‚Äì when can I expect to get that money?

A: This is a one-time payment to families that earn lower to middle incomes, but it is in no way connected to unemployment. This money will come directly from the federal government. Learn more from the IRS.""

""Q: When should I apply for unemployment?

A: Two things affect the start date for your benefits.

- The date you became unemployed and eligible--not the date you applied or were approved.

- The start date for particular unemployment program, like Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). PUA started March 29, 2020.

Examples:

    You became unemployed on March 29 but didn't file a claim until April 8.
        You would get regular state and federal PUA benefits going back to March 29.
    You became unemployed and filed a claim on March 6.
        You would only get PUA going back to March 29.

- If you were eligible for unemployment before the federal legislation passed, please apply as soon as you can ‚Äì taking care to read the information on ESD.WA.GOV beforehand and double-checking your information before submitting your application.

**- If you were not eligible for unemployment before the federal stimulus package was passed, we are asking you to wait to file for unemployment because our system is not set up to accept your application. We expect those changes to be complete by mid-April, and the team is working around the clock to get them in place as quickly as possible.**""

""Q: I was already on unemployment; do I still get the extra 13 weeks and $600?

A: Yes. Everyone already on unemployment or going on it during this crisis will have 13 more weeks added to their claim for a maximum of 39 weeks. They will also get $600 on top of what they otherwise are owed.

The 13 additional weeks are available until Dec. 31, 2020.

If you've already exhausted your benefits from a claim that expired on or after July 6, 2019:

 - Continue to file your weekly claim.
 - You will be paid retroactively after our systems are updated for the new federal legislation.""

WORK SEARCHES
- Work searches are optional for the time being. I've not heard an end date on that.

STANDBY

""IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING STANDBY: If you request standby status (full-time or part-time), you may have received an automated notice indicating your request is denied. Do not worry, that notice does not reflect the emergency rules. We are in the process of updating our computer system. You do not need to call the claims center. We will review all standby denials from March 8 forward to determine if they meet the new criteria. If your standby request is approved, you will receive another letter informing you of the approval. Keep filing weekly claims during this time. (Update 3/26: Our online application has been updated to reflect these emergency rules and new claims can request 12 weeks of standby.)""

GIG WORKERS (from https://esd.wa.gov/newsroom/covid-19-worker-information)

""We realize that there are some challenges with the online application, and it is not currently designed for the way you work. We are working to resolve those issues. For now, fill it out the best that you can.

**If you do apply, to help speed the process for determining your eligibility and potential benefit amount, please be prepared to gather your payment records from the last year to provide to the claims staff.** This process may take some time, but we are doing everything we can to increase efficiency and hire more staff.""

Just another note: until the computer systems are reconfigured for the new paradigm, understand that you WILL get inconsistent messaging. Understand that, at this time, the first word is not the last word. IT is working on it.

I hope that has been somewhat helpful. I'm being told that well over 100 new people are being brought in to address the current issues. Stay tuned, and have a good day.",Seattle,"Unemployment stuff, blah blah"

 White CenturyLink Field is usually home to the Seattle Seahawks, the stadium will now be converted into a temporary hospital for non-COVID-19 patients in the area.

Washington state has been a hot spot for coronavirus, killing 195 people and infecting more than 4,000 people. Now, as hospitals are filled with patients suffering from the virus, the temporary hospital will treat others who are sick but aren‚Äôt infected with COVID-19. This will allow hospitals to keep bed spaces open at hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients quickly.

I know you can't get paid from your employer and collect unemployment. Makes sense. So for the next 2 weeks I will use my 80 hours of sick time for a full paycheck.

Should I wait until I've exhausted my sick time to file for unemployment? As I won't get an unemployment check during the first two weeks, will those first two weeks count against my total of unemployment weeks even though I'm not receiving any payment and thus lessen my availability to be on unemployment by two weeks?

A good friend of mine recently got a job at Harborview. He was excited to start his role, however the position he applied for is currently on hold due to staffing needs for COVID-19.

He was contacted by HR and basically given two options:
1. Work with COVID-19 patients until the surge goes down and supposedly return to the job they were hired for.
2. Take ‚Äúupaid leave‚Äù until the surge goes down and be on boarded correctly.


What I want to know before he makes his decesion can only really be answered by staff who work the floors there, as he doesn‚Äôt know anyone to reach out to.

Can someone who either works on a dedicated COVID-19 unit or a non-COVID unit please paint me a picture of how bad the situation is on the ground? Is PPE being appropriately supplied even slightly?

What is staffing like, is every one short staffed?

How many of your colleagues are getting sick, and what happens if an employee experiences symptoms?

I just had my claim go from 'pending' to 'processing' and it took zero time on the phone. I'm a couple days away from getting paid out for 3 weeks and feeling much better about keeping my head above water.

I wanted to share my experience to hopefully help others have a maybe just that tiny bit more faith in the system.

I filed on March 12th (just before some of the really big weeks we've seen for new claims). My standby status was quickly denied. My claim application went into adjudication after a couple days.

I checked the FAQ and covid19 pages and saw that I was really just suppose to twiddle my thumbs for 3 weeks. 

I applied for a couple jobs (regardless of my chances of being hired) and submitted my first claim.

The Standby status was redetermined and Approved without filing an appeal or contacting anyone.

I kept filing my claims each week. No more job search needed.

After 3 weeks I sent an email via the ESD portal.

After another 4 days my application had been updated. 'Pending' next to each week and a bunch of zeros is now 'Processing' with my weekly benefit amount.

I spent zero time on hold. I ate some ramen. I drank less. I smoked less. I used some savings and some credit card balance. It's a pandemic. I think I've gotten off pretty light so far, all things considered.

The ESD is getting crushed right now. Be as patient as you can afford. Be as polite as you can manage. Everyone at ESD is working hard to get you paid. It'll work out in the end. No government program is without it's shenanigans.

6491,SeaHaw808,1586166307,fvvvnq,Nan,"Before Co-Vid lays offs, I had been working 2 full time jobs as a line cook for roughly 70ish hours per week. 35-40 hours at one, and 35ish at the other.

The restaurant that I did 35-40 hours at closed and laid off all staff, and they urged everyone to file for unemployment. This was March 15th, so it has been several weeks.

My other job still employs me at a reduced rate of about 25 hours a week (compared to the usual 35ish hours). We switched to to-go and delivery only, so the tip pool share dropped from like $150 to $50 or less. So less hours and less tips also.

All told, I went from 70 hours of employment at 2 jobs, to 25 hours at 1 job (and maybe $100 or so less in tips a week on top of the hourly wage loss).

I am able to afford my rent, but barely.

The reason I have held off on filing was because (1). I understand many other people are suffering as well. I've lost most of my income, but I still have enough work to pay rent (but not much else), while many others don't have a job at all and could have priority in receiving funds. And (2). I understand that our nation, and government as a whole, is strained by the huge number of people filing for unemployment, and I feel bad if I did file and receive unemployment when I still have 25 hours of work while many others are out of work.

Asking for the opinions of other Seattle folk. Please advise. My (former) employer did tell us to go file for unemployment during a meeting after everyone was laid off, but not everyone had a second job.",Seattle,Laid off from 1 job/Still employed at 2nd job. Should I file for unemployment?

People are usually spread out on the trails and in general you can step to the side to pass others fairly easily. 

When you have the thousands of people out and walking around the right sidewalks and city parks in Seattle you‚Äôre exposed to a lot more people and trying to dodge around people while running in the road and avoiding cars seems more dangerous. 

I went for a run this weekend and I spent the whole time dodging over a thousand people who are out walking and running all over the place. I almost got hit by a dozen cyclists and other runners not paying attention. Our local walks are getting overrun and is forcing people closer together than they should be. Keeping state parks closed longer is going to keep making this worse as more and more people are out on walks in a smaller space.",Seattle,Closing our parks runs a higher risk of infecting people than keeping them open.
