Two days ago my best friend had his custom built guitar stolen along with his new smart television from his house. This Guitar is priceless to my friend and not worth anything on the open market because it was a custom build. The likely hood that this Guitar will be found is slim. We have contacted all the pawn and music shops in the area, contacted the police and have been watching Facebook marketplace and Craigslist. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m including pictures of the Guitar and the build for authenticity. The theft did not occur in Pittsburgh but an hour outside of the city. I have a feeling who ever took it won’t try to sell it locally which is why I’m posting in this subreddit.

They have recently acquired two trailers about as long as cars taking up two additional parking spots in the street where parking isn't exactly ample. This is squeezing me and my housemates out of the area whereas we rarely had issues with parking before. These trailers are often not even attached to anything and/or empty. 

Additionally, this person is taking advantage of their disabled parent's handicap parking space directly in front of the house. The parent simply does not ever drive a car and the scrap-hauling person is essentially abusing the spot for personal convenience (I'm assuming the vehicle is technically registered to the parent, but definitely in name only). 

All in all they take up five or more total parking spots at all times for one person's business. (three large vehicles, two trailers, and a motorcycle)

I've considered reporting this to the authorities but I'm just not sure whether any of it is illegal. It's annoying day to day but annoying ≠ illegal. I'm not eager to cause problems for these people but the amount of space they take up is becoming increasingly frustrating.

I have lived in Pittsburgh for over 5 years now (I came here for school and now work here as well). Last year I moved into a Lobos managed apartment and I really cannot wait to move.

Their leases are shady and they come into my apartment with little to no warning, which scares my cat, who was abused. I have had a broken light that they have never fixed and I quit asking. My mailbox lock has been broken, and they still never fix it. The washers and dryers constantly break and then my whole building has to share ONE. 

They are also terrible with my cats. I have an emotional support cat (and another cat because they denied my doctor's paperwork that said I can have more than one). Like I said, one was traumatized on the streets before I got him and he hates strangers, so he really needs me to be there or needs me to get him to my boyfriend to watch. They do not care and they charge me so much. I got a letter about my litter boxes needing cleaned although I clean them every other day. When I read the letter closer, it was to avoid an issue (which I get), but I work two jobs and clean them when I get home at like 11 pm. It's been issue after issue and I am super miserable.

I want to leave Lobos and move in with my boyfriend when our leases end in July 2020. I would love if I could get some advice on some cat friendly apartments that do not cost an arm and a leg for (I work in grant funded research and struggle with bills).

My first time heading there for a match against Winnipeg is out of a romance novel. Love at first sight. Exiting the tunnel, and there's the city. The skyline was beautiful.  I've been to other cities before. Cleveland is not too far away, absolutely depressing city. Living off life support of the Cavs win a few years ago, and hasn't been the same since lebron left. I'm a sailor on the Lakes, and I've been on the Cuyahoga and looks like it's about to catch fire again. Chicago is nice, but only if you have money. Beyond that I dont find anything too interesting beyond deep dish pizza and standing off the side of a tower. Not to mention I was right next to a gap where a murder suicide had just taken place. Cincinnati definitely exists. I went to Detroit to board a ship for my last assignment. My introduction on the highway into the city was potholes and gunshots in the distance. Very busy but there was nothing going inside the city. Boston is absolutely terrible. Rude people, terrible taxis, and always had a bad dining experience. The entire town felt like a historical tourist trap.

But Pittsburgh, it's different. It hasn't always been the city of champs. The Steelers back in the day were basically the Browns in a sense. The Pens we're at one point the laughing stock of the NHL. But through perseverance, they all pulled through. Franco Harris expected to lose to the John Madden Raiders. But didnt give up, and boom, the Immaculate Reception. The Pens are about to go under, boom, we draft a big French Canadian guy. It seems like every time I'm in the city I hear someone talking about how theyre going to make big. A strong work ethic, perserverence. Ive also heard people whove visted complain about how black and gold is worn by too many people. Bit imo, thats a good thing. It shows city pride and unity.

Yea other cities are unique, Cleveland and Cincinnati excluded. But they dont have the same charm. The food, Pittsburghese, parking chairs, pride, unity, the sports, the icons, I can go on forever.

This is a hell of a raise staggered or not. It's a compound raise exceeding 4% for each year from 2019 through 2022 and a portion of it is retroactive. At the end of 2022 they will have received a 17.549% raise which is fucking crazy. Don't believe their union presidents, these guys are fucking looting us.  An average person working for the private sector might get 1.5% a year, or a shade above 6% cumulatively over this same time period.  What I wouldn't do for a 17% raise over 4 years!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They will get retroactive pay raises for 2019, including a 1% raise effective Jan. 1 of that year, another 1% effective April 1, and 2% effective July 1. Officer Swartzwelder said he believed the raises were phased in to benefit the city, not the officers, who will only get a small amount of back pay for the many hours of overtime they worked in connection with the trial of former East Pittsburgh Officer Michael Rosfeld, and subsequent protests.

Similarly, raises this year, next year and in 2022 will be phased in. This year officers are awarded a 2% bump effective Jan. 1 and another 2% effective July 1, he said. In 2021 and 2022, they are entitled to 3% raises on Jan. 1 and 1% at mid-year.",pittsburgh,"Police union says arbitration award unfair, “compromised”"

My hometown used to be full of highly educated residents, many of whom were transplants, due to a very technically-oriented industry for the time period. I’m talking well before I was born, like mid-20th century.  These people created a tax base that allowed for good services, a broad retail economy, investment in cultural institutions, etc. etc. 

Then the industry left, the educated people retired, or if they were young enough, left with their own families, and the best educated kids with the best economic prospects also largely left because there was no future.  Sort of like Pittsburgh, but it was technical workers that bore just as much of the brunt as the blue collar workers.  Maybe 10% of my friends growing up still live there, almost everyone left. 

Maybe someone can tell me why I’m wrong, but in my mind, a place with lots of educated people earning high, taxable, professional incomes is basically a key to having a prosperous community.  Yet everyone seems hell-bent on chasing out the tech workers who tick these boxes (or at least making them feel unwelcome).

The father stated that his son wasn’t aware the knife was there in the bookbag after going through the metal detector. Kid was sent home half a day and allowed to come back the next day.... 

After doing some digging the kid was previously documented at his previous school of sharing violent images to students on a kindle prior. 

This would be the wonderful Center Twp school district..... figured they would like a solid shout out and hand clap for attempting to avoid the issue and handle it properly.

Luckily, I was able to catch video, but 3 cars (2 BMW, 1 Camry) came flying out of Oakland past Duquesne, with the 2nd and 3rd car in the clip barely missing the truck in the right lane. Keep in mind that I am going 55 in this clip and the truck in front and to the right was around 45-50. I hit the brakes fairly hard after the 2nd car seeing the 3rd coming up fast, but as you can see, they still didn't have much room. Fortunately, no accident was caused but this could have quite easily been tragic.

I attempted to peep plates only to find that it looks like the second doesnt have a plate at all.

Be safe out there.

So I visit my relative's place down in Tampa and in the Bay Area a lot. So my alternative grocery experience is with Publix and Safeway.

I somehow find that the food and options at the Publix and Safeway at those places are far better. They have a much nicer bakery with a range of options (Not just a bunch of cinnamon flavored sugary treats but more savory stuff too), they have fresh soups which I don't see at GE, and somehow the produce tastes tastier, like fresher (though those places are in warmer climates). Oh and stuff is so much cheaper there too, a lot of them like Aldi prices.

This year, I am setting out a hefty goal of $500 for $39.99 Coleman Mummy Sleeping bags, with a temp rating of 0F. Typically I create roughly 200 packages each year, including items such as: socks, hats, gloves, hot and hand warmers, fresh fruit, hand warmers and other hygienic products. 

As local shelters &amp; resources are threatened to close due to safety concerns; I am attempting to provide temporary relief through quality sleeping bags, that can withstand temps up to 0F. This is not to encourage sleeping outdoors, and perpetuate that as a standard. It's to provide a warm sleeping bag, because the disheartening reality is, they may be stuck outside in the blistering wind at 5F.

These sleeping bags are light weight for travel, and durable. Based on the success of this fundraiser, I will also be supplying light weight sleeping pads, emergency blankets, hygienic products, and other clothing items. 

In every pack, I will also include a print out of local warming centers, shelters, with their hours, and other info. 

If you are unable to give at this time, I understand. It’s hard after the holidays. If you could share my fundraiser by copying the link and posting it- The visibility would be greatly appreciated. Getting the word out is the next best thing I can ask for! Thanks for your time!

In the Kennywood Memories program there was a segment where one of the workers was in a vault/basement near the Penny Arcade where old relics were put.  He found some old movie reels that were played on a specific kind or player.  One of the reels he found was titled ""studio wrestling.""  I remember this because he said his grandmother loved studio wrestling.  He then flipped the reels for a couple of seconds showing the action in the ring.

My dad grew up in East Liberty and watched studio wrestling with Bill Cardille (Chilly Willy's theater!).  He also worked as a counselor at a local YMCA that Bruno Sammartino happened to visit.  Dad would tell me how Bruno would use so much weight on the barbells that the beam would be bending under the weight Bruno lifted.

This leads me to this question: does anybody know where that reel of studio wrestling came from?  I'm kind of curious as to who was wrestling in that short clip, when it was, where it was filmed, etc.  Dad passed away in 2002 but I'm sure that he would be tickled to know this piece of history.

I grew up on the west coast where racism is more due to gangs and have lived in a few different parts of Texas and Louisiana but when it comes to blatant and overt racism, Pittsburgh takes the cake by far. I’ve also noticed that the natives are very protective of the culture here and seeing as racism seems to be part of the culture, it’s almost like people feel the like they have the right to be bigots. I’m bi-racial and when I’ve been called hateful derogatory names in traffic and once by an old white lady at work. I posted something about it on this sub and got nothing but downvotes and people pretty much making excuses for the lady and not a single person seemed to care about the hate she was spewing. A couple people even told me that if I didn’t like them I should just move??? Yea so you wanna live in your bubble of hatred and misery and if someone has a problem with it then they should just uproot their life to make you comfortable?

We already have a full band aside from vocals, and have actually made 15+ songs so far that we are excited to complete. We attend the University of Pittsburgh and have access to the on-campus recording studio. Below you'll find two of our demos, both of which are very roughly mixed.  They each show a different side of the metal music we play. Obviously, none have vocals yet, but we have some ideas in mind for how we'd want them to sound. However, nothing is set in stone and we invite creative input. Let me know any opinions on the music, and if you're interested in being our (or one of our) vocalist(s), you can send info/recordings to [bswatchick@gmail.com](mailto:bswatchick@gmail.com)

I'm a mental health therapist, early 30s, with a dog who needs to run every day.   I'm looking for :

  
1. A place with a big enough greenspace to play frisbee-catch with a dog.  I see there's a few off-leash areas, but do people get tickets for playing fetch in regular parks?  (For the record, I sympathize with people who don't like seeing dogs off-leash, not trying to start an argument that I should be entitled to this.)

2. Any chance of finding apartment buildings with rooftop green spaces?  I live in Seattle and this is fairly common in any new-ish building, but we don't get snow so there's a lot of flat roofs with patios and grass n'at.  (It is so, so nice to take a dog out in the morning without having to fully get ready and have a walk if I'm not feeling it.)  Would looking for this mean going towards the neighborhoods I usually hear about being gentrified like Lawrenceville?

3. My practice is going to be part-telehealth (so I can work from home) and I'll probably rent some office space a few days per week.  From a business perspective, where should I consider setting up an office?  Unless Medicare-for-all suddenly gets passed, unfortunately I kinda have to plant myself among working professionals who have insurance.  

4. In Seattle, there's four non-highway bridges and crossing any of them as part of your commute sucks.  Does that hold true for the Burgh too?  Aside from going through downtown, what areas are hard to get across at rush hour times?

As before, attendees are a mix. Some extroverted, some introverted. Their interests range from tech, personal development, dancing, beer, art, running, hiking, food and more. Turnout was great, perhaps 3-4 dozen.

If you're new to Pittsburgh, or just want to make friends, it's a good way to get introduced, talk, and plan for a future gathering individually.

I'll call the Abbey and let them know we're coming.

We had board games aplenty last time. Some played, some talked. If you guys wouldn't mind, bring some more please (I'm lacking there). Something fast and relatively casual works best.

My kids are 7 (will turn 8 in August), going into 2nd grade, and 4 (will turn 5 in July), going into kindergarten.  We've had good experiences in the past with Winchester Thurston, Center for the Arts, Science Center, and the animal shelter.  We're going to try some camps at Shadyside Academy and the JCC this summer.  We live in the East End, and are willing to look at camps Downtown and on North Shore, but not further west than Downtown or further east than the Squirrel Hill Tunnel.  I used to commute on the 279/79, and I'm wary of anything much further north than North Shore as well.

Winchester Thurston sent out their schedule at the beginning of the month, and a number of the popular camps have waitlists already (!)  If you're thinking of sending your kid there, get on that pronto.

I've got my kids booked up except for the weeks of June 15, June 22, and August 17.  I want to sign them up for camps that are geographically close together, and that have full day programs for the younger one (not half day, unless they let you combine two half day sessions like Science Center does).

Are there any good camps for a 4 year old on North Shore, near the Science Center?  I've signed the 4 year old up for all the science center camps he wants, but I think his sister might like to do one or two more.  It would have to be a camp with full day for a 4 year old.  I looked at Aviary and Children's Museum, but they don't have anything for his age.

What about in Oakland at the end of the summer, the week of August 17?  I think the 7 year old might like camp at Phipps, but they don't have full day camp for the 4 year old.  He'll be 5 by then, but I'm not sure that the Carnegie museums have full day camp for 5 year olds.  Are there any other camps in Oakland that I should look at?

I pay out of my pocket to attend groups that are mandatory in order to get help with housing we have to give 20 hours of our time to them. Don't ask for any help you will not get it. They play favorites there, if you don't believe in their religion and they think you aren't living how they want they will make your time miserable there. They will claim people bad mouth them because it's disgruntled clients. Nope. People are scared to say anything because we are threatened with being thrown out and the idea of being homeless again is enough to keep your mouth shut. You can't work until they so. Pretty much for 2 years or more you sit in a room reading from books. You can get on welfare and that's your goal welfare and you are responsible for utilities and your needs and the bus. I asked for help for several things  and was told to pray. Im not against God but they give you a bad representation of Christianity. If your lucky and they like you they will let you work or go to school instead of going to group but if they dont like you then you will see people work and go back to school while you rot 4 days a week being told to mind your business when you ask why can she work and I can't ?. Women are having to go to outside organizations to get help like Catholic charities and st Vincent de Paul with all they money light of life takes in nobody in any of their so called programs should have to ask for help outside of light of life.

You should also sign up for alerts from one or more of the nonprofits fighting poor air quality listed below. They can help direct your frustration productively, like lobbying your legislators and filing air quality complaints. 

* [Breathe Project](https://breatheproject.org/)
* [Group Against Smog and Pollution](https://gasp-pgh.org/)
* [Clean Air Council](https://cleanair.org/)
* Even the [Nine Mile Run Watershed Association](https://ninemilerun.org/)

[Learn who your County Councilmember is](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/county-council/council-districts.aspx) and how to contact them. Unlike most PA counties, Allegheny County enforces air quality regulations rather than the state. This is a huge advantage for us. It can be hard to communicate directly with your State Rep or State Senator, but your County Councilmember is much easier to reach. I've exchanged a number of emails with my County Councilman about this issue. He writes me back with his own fingers!

Finally, everyone should download [Smell PGH](https://smellpgh.org/) to get air quality alerts and make reports to the ACHD when you experience pollution yourself. 

P.S. Don't let someone tell you not to worry about the air because it used to be worse. [It's still not good enough](https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/pittsburgh-region-gets-f-grade-for-air-quality/).",pittsburgh,Angry about US Steel polluting our air? Here's what you can do.

My  band is currently looking for a metal vocalist that can preferably do  both clean and unclean metal vocals. (If you can do one but can't do the  other please still contact us! We need both clean and unclean vocals,  and we're okay with having 2 vocalists if necessary!)

We  already have a full band aside from vocals, and have actually made 15+  songs so far that we are excited to complete. We attend the University  of Pittsburgh and have access to the on-campus recording studio. Below  you'll find two of our demos, both of which are very roughly mixed.   They each show a different side of the metal music we play. Obviously,  none have vocals yet, but we have some ideas in mind for how we'd want  them to sound. However, nothing is set in stone and we invite creative  input. Let me know any opinions on the music, and if you're interested  in being our (or one of our) vocalist(s), you can send info/recordings  to [bswatchick@gmail.com](mailto:bswatchick@gmail.com)

Until a bus decided that he was just going to ignore the lights, the traffic and the pedestrians in the crosswalk and just blow right through his red light. To be clear, this wasn't one of those ""I was already in the intersection when it turned red"" deals. The light had turned red while he was coming down the hill, and several people had walked out into the street as we had the walk light... but he decided he wasn't going to stop. He ended up right behind a cop car after completing his turn, so I was excited to see him get busted for being an unsafe maniac... but instead the cop just drove off with the bus behind him and nothing was done or said.

So when I got to the office I started googling and found stories of them racing each other on the parkway and crashing, them plowing through red lights and into vehicles, them straight up running over and killing kids going to the colleges and people walking downtown... what's going on here?! Do they have some kind of deal with the city where they don't have to obey the rules of the road? Do they have some kind of deal with police? Is everyone somehow okay with this? Is it like a culling of the herd type thing?

My family was so excited to start our life here in Pittsburgh, but now me and my wife are texting trying to figure out the best way to tell our kids that these buses may run them over indiscriminately, even if they have the walk light, without terrifying them.

**Work with the couple to make sense of what they need** 

As a matter of first importance, you have to realize what your customers need their wedding to incorporate and what they anticipate that the wedding organizer should be liable for. All that they expect of you should be obviously clarified in the agreement. On the off chance that the agreement says ""all coordinations,"" those coordinations should be perfectly clear. On the off chance that they need six white swans swimming in a little pool as visitors stroll in, at that point that should be in the agreement. 

**Draw up the wedding organizer contract** 

Recognize the gatherings 

Do this above all else. This incorporates names, locations, and all contact data for all gatherings, including the couple and the wedding organizer. 

Decide the extent of administrations 

The wedding organizer contract needs to characterize what is anticipated from the organizer, and what the couple getting hitched will deal with. Does this incorporate arranging the topic and style of the wedding? It may for certain couples. 

It ought to incorporate things, for example, 

Booking the scene 

Choosing a cook 

Arranging other outside sellers and recognizing what they will be contracted to give 

Any hardware you are required to give, for example, broad media gear 

The agreement likewise needs to explain the specific course of events you should follow for playing out any assignments. For instance, how long seven days the organizer will counsel with the couple. It ought to likewise explain if the organizer will be available on the real wedding day or in the event that one of their workers will go to. A few couples require the organizer to be available for all occasions. 

Characterize remuneration for the wedding organizer 

The agreement ought to indicate how and when installment will be done, just as who will make the installment. Decide whether remuneration will be per task or for the entire wedding arranging bundle. Utilize this segment to choose when the underlying non-refundable store will be made and afterward make the remainder of the installment plan. 

Incorporate an undoing strategy 

Now and again things fail to work out, and the best thing you can do is be as readied as could be expected under the circumstances. A crossing out approach or power majeure proviso guarantees that you as the wedding organizer are secured if a seller drops at last or a scene fails to work out. This additionally will help if there is a type of crisis or disaster — ailment, hospitalization, climate issues (otherwise known as ""Demonstration of God"") constraining wiping out. This is the reason it is critical to incorporate statements that determine that any stores or charges settled up until the purpose of retraction are non-refundable. 

Right now, can likewise incorporate an end statement that characterizes what conditions could cause undoing, the gathering with the position to drop the administrations, and what occurs on account of these occasions, for example, rescheduling. 

The last advance is to have a legal counselor audit your agreement, at that point sign and date. Presently you should simply design the wedding!

The advantages you bring as a wedding organizer 

In spite of the fact that a wedding organizer agreement can look a bit of overpowering, it will give an itemized arrangement to you to follow to guarantee your customers' unique day is as immaculate as could be allowed. 

An organizer, alongside an iron-clad agreement, can assist couples with adhering to a financial limit and experience the wedding they had always wanted. 

What's more, if something turns out badly finally, similar to a meeting room being overwhelmed or a seller attempting to pull out, a great wedding organizer is there to take care of these issues. They ordinarily as of now have associations with these merchants, so they can redress the circumstance without the lady of the hour and man of the hour getting included. 

Organizers Claire Weller and Susan Cordogan of Big City Bride told Brides.com, ""In the event that we call our lighting fellow and on the big day we don't care for what he's brought, you can be certain we will have him include additional lighting and \[you're not going to\] get charged for it,"" she says. 

""We are rehash business. Couples are definitely not. \[The vendors\] expect to satisfy us so we bring them more business,"" Cordogan says. 

Wedding organizers can likewise get more recurrent business on the off chance that they have a strong site publicizing their administrations and on the off chance that they utilize their internet based life records to discuss how well they have finished with past weddings. Here are some extraordinary tips on beginning a site. For more info [**Ace Limo**](https://acelimoli.com/)",pittsburgh,The most effective method to compose an ironclad wedding organizer contract

I'm new to your delightful city, but enjoying it very much! Trying to figure out which insurance coverage to choose at work, so asked my fiancé what his doctors are. Not shocked to find out that he has none, both because he's a longtime bachelor and because he's nearly 350 lbs. He's trying to lose weight, but it's a slow process.

He's reluctantly agreed to see a doctor once I decide on one, but he's always had the stereotypical experience of most bigger people, where you walk in and this stranger with a god complex prejudges that your only problem is your weight (thus you're wasting your money because they only tell you things you already know and don't listen to you about anything else that might be an issue).

Can anybody recommend a doctor who DOESN'T do this? We're out east, but willing to travel for somebody good.

There were no watermarks/holograms on the ID, and when I asked for a business card he just said ""it'll only take 5 minutes, man"". I asked him to leave and he didn't put up any fight.

However, as I’ve gotten older I’ve almost gotten to the point I root against them. I think it is a combination of things. First, they’ve had a ton of unlikable players, and some that are plain questionable people. Two, I find the NFL in general boring compared to college. The lack of variety in NFL offensive schemes bores me compared to the variety of college. Three, the media obsession and frankly “sucking up” to the steelers in the city, including very questionable characters like Ben and James Harrison.

The last thing though, and probably the biggest thing is how obnoxious the fans are. The constant belittling and sometimes racist rants directed at tomlin. The entitlement that they feel they deserve a super bowl every year. The delusions that every player on the team will be the next HOF player (see duck Hodges). The way that if you aren’t a 100% steeler fan and say you like the pirates or Pitt more their fans mock you.

She works very hard and over the last couple years, together, we have worked very hard together to overcome addictions. I am am alcoholic who has been sober for 9 months and she is recovering from bulimia (we are both open about this so I'm not putting her dirty laundry out there and she's also aware I'm making this post). She has quit smoking and between the 2 she has gained some weight which, to me she's beautiful, I don't look twice at it, but it bothers her. We are both dieting and doing keto and she's seeing a counselor for the bulimia. Anyways, tonight we went to my soon to be son's art show and she was visibly frustrated. After the art show we talked about it and she stated her frustration with her body, her makeup and her hair. She frequently says thing like ""I look like a man""  and gets upset because she grew up in the country and no one ever taught her how to do girly things like makeup and hair. She said her mom never sat with her or really cared about any of this type of girly stuff... I've offered to send her to a salon but up until now she has declined. Tonight she finally said she wants to learn how to do her makeup better and her hair. She wants to go somewhere like Sephora and get tips on makeup but neither of us are really sure where to start. I'd like to see her get something more personalized than YouTube stuff and someone just trying to sell her crap, so I was wondering if there is anywhere locally that has like sessions for this and hair or where do we even start?

My mom lives in beaver county near Heritage Valley Beaver and personally I would prefer her care come from UPMC. My sister prefers AHN. We each have nothing against either.. just what we've seen from our own personal experiences.  (My sister was a surgical tech intern at AGH). We plan on getting different opinions so suggestions from either network are fine. I should note my mom has UPMC for you. Not sure if that whole AHN vs UPMC feud will  play a part in who she can/can't see. 

Does anyone have any personal suggestions or any insight to this at all to calm my anxiety? 

I should also note my mom does not drive. I will be taking her to appointments and taking her home. I live in south side so anything in between those 2 locations are fine. (Beaver county-oakland)
  
She has an appointment next week at UPMC mercy. We just wanted to get in asap so we booked an appointment.

I appreciate any and all advice. Thank u",pittsburgh,Cardiologist recommendations

I was in Target in East Liberty shopping when a young woman (late 20's) approached me (f, 23) and told me that she liked my shirt. I thanked her and told her where I got it and she struck up a conversation. Surface level stuff like what our jobs are, where in the city we live, etc. She noted that it was nice to meet someone just while out shopping and asked to exchange numbers so we could get coffee sometime. I agreed and then later felt like it was weird. Didn't suspect an MLM (I actually was afraid it was some sex trafficking things because you always hear stories about being approached by women). 

Anyways, she texted me a few days later and we ended up meeting for coffee. Again, normal. She was nice and easy to talk to and we chatted for about 45 minutes before money somehow came up. She mentioned that she was working with some friends she had made to create ""passive income"" and that she was excited about it but didn't say much more so I didn't even think about it. She texted me about a week later and asked to meet up for coffee again and said that she could give me information about the passive income stuff she was doing if I wanted. 

We arranged for coffee again and I wasn't really interested in the money making thing but we chatted for a bit before she brought it up. Showed me some slideshow on an iPad and invited me to come to a meeting to hear more and meet everyone. I politely declined and soon after she said she had to go and then never texted me again. She may have used the term ""network marketing"" but I also may have made that up in my memory because I know the term is associated with an MLM. I'm annoyed because I want to research the company but I can't remember the name.

I was shopping at Giant Eagle and Walmart for groceries.  

I rifled through my bags and pockets, but it was nowhere to be found. I was seriously panicking and freaking out. My route 91 pulls up and I have no bus pass to get home. I'm still searching the area in futility. It's gone. I'm having trouble believing it. I get a moment of clarity and call up my banks to cancel the two cards in the wallet.

I gather myself and wonder how I will get back to Lawrenceville. I build up some courage and start asking people if they can assist or spare some change. Reactions vary from people who were nice and said they couldn't help,  to those who were at least honest they weren't interested in assisting. Then there was the people who sped walked and avoided eye contact like I was a pan handler. More than 10 of them. None could help. I'm not mad at them or think less of those folks. Most of them are probably good people.

I sat dejected on the curb for a few minutes with my head in my hands, pondering how I will get home. My mind state is deteriorating. I'm unemployed at the moment and I don't have access to my meds. I try to stay in a positive mind, but events like these are sometimes triggers. I was considering walking, but it's really far and that was a last resort. Walking home sounds like a manic episode.

I thought asking my PAT driver to see if he could let me slide was my best option. It would have been a $1 transfer on my part, but there wasn’t even change in my book bag. I waited in the cold for the next bus with low unrealistically high hopes.

The bus arrives. I blubber to the driver. He doesn't hesitate. He's my savior and graciously allows me to board his coach and ride home. I'm so appreciative, I can barely hold it back. I silently (I hope) sob for a few minutes (prob the whole ride) on the way home. He even called me up to ensure this was my route to get home. This dude was a prince.

I’ve always had great relationships with my regular PAT driver, frequently on a first name basis. Even exchanging hugs or daps when their change routes. My PAT driver helped me get out of a very dark place tonight and I'll be forever grateful.",pittsburgh,Lost wallet at Waterworks Walmart - Thanks to my PAT driver

We're looking at areas with affordable housing, good job markets, decent weather (it's pretty much summer year round here, with upper 80s this week). Couple of questions that I figured people here could shed some light on.
1. What are some decent affordable areas? We're looking for something in the $150K range, which I know puts some of the nicer areas (ie Squirrel Hill, Shadyside) out of reach. I've looked at West Mifflin, Brentwood, are there any other areas that I should be considering?
2. I know this is subjective, but how is the traffic in the Pittsburgh area? Coming from Orlando, we deal with very heavily congested roads.
3. How are the winters? I know it's going to be a lot colder than Florida, and we'd have to get used to some snow.
4. How difficult is it to bring a car into Pennsylvania? Is it difficult to get a PA license and transfer paperwork in the time allotted?
5. Taxes - coming from a state with no income tax, this would be something new. I understand that we'd be paying local and state income taxes - does Pittsburgh levy income tax on top of Allegheny County? And how are the local property taxes and sales taxes?
6. Health care - how easy or hard is it to get coverage through employers, and what are premiums like? Florida ranks near the bottom in health care, so I'm sure almost anything would be an improvement.
7. Utilities - how much do people usually pay for electric, water, gas, etc?

I know these are a lot of questions, just trying to put together some info to help decide. At some point I'll have to come visit and check it out for myself.",pittsburgh,Considering moving from Florida

1468,HekkeH2020,1581603387,f3alar,Nan,"Hey everyone...

I came to visit Pittsburgh last week and was curious why Pittsburgh resembles the look of America during The Great Depression?  And by this look, I mean the rusted awnings, broken staircases, and the old and vacant buildings that make up most of the city...

I’m not a scholar and don’t feel like googling the answer either.  Please also know that I am not trying to be offensive.  I‘m sure that many of the people who live in PGH actually enjoy it and wouldn’t prefer to live anywhere else even though let’s be honest, they probably cry at night before going to bed.  I’m sorry I couldn’t help it, I’ve just never seen a town before that looks like Billy Batts shortly after the restaurant closed.

My original theory was that I had walked into a large movie set about either Dresden Germany deep into WW2 or an asteroid movie in which only a few people lived.  The person showing me around replied to me saying, ‘we get that a lot‘ and then went on to say it was a great city whose toilet systems feed directly into the river(s).

A city with such hillsides has so much potential.  My thoughts are that likely the residents here are letting corporations lead the way which I cannot stress enough, is a very very big mistake.  I cite this example as the only hospital here feels like it needs to advertise on anything available even though their name is already on the tallest god damn building.  (FYI nobody ever sees an insurance company posted on a bus as goes ‘hmmm Im gonna get that one‘) Meanwhile I stopped by the south side dog park and it’s a mud pit with rocks.  The locals would tell me that the city invested heavily into it just recently when they added a wheel barrel sized pile of mulch directly in the center.  If you look closely at the ground in the middle of the field, you can see the spot they are talking about.  What kind of sick person does the city manager have to be to torment dogs and dog owners with a useless upgrade?  How Disgusting.

Where is the modernity?   Most cities are starting to bury their power lines and opt with the aesthetic street lights which makes sense.  Can’t they do that in Pittsburgh or is there a weird law against it?  I know it’s easy to give up, it’s easy to get distraught.   But this city has potential if you start tearing down some of the ugly broke down homes and outlawing metallic awnings and jean shorts.  You do that and momentum will carry you the rest of the way, I’m serious.  

My advice would be for the locals here to examine the city’s relationship with the corporate tech and healthcare structure that are both rumored to be highly influential, which as anyone knows is a bad thing.  The idea that corporations are here to help YOU or your neighborhood grow is beyond non sensical.  Other ideas include:

\- Taking from Philadelphia’s example and outlawing cash only businesses which literally suck out public tax dollars needed for education, potholes, etc (Most Important)

\- LED street lights

\- Legalizing you know what to help give the city a real economic engine (including protection for people who work in healthcare, police, etc)

\- Instead of jailing people, have them clean up garbage the accumulates on the side of streets, under the many bridges, etc (you’ll save money too)

\- Enforcing already existing city code that does not allow one to keep a rusted broken down car on their front lawn and/or hoards of useless junk.  For real, nothing good can come from looking away from such characteristics.

\- Replace those lead lines.

\- Make some streets such as The Strip District \*car\* free.  Not carefree.  Car Free.  Carefree is the fleeing you get walking around an area in which cars are not authorized.

\- Make one of those two yellow Bridges pedestrian only.  You have over 400 other bridges, don’t worry, you’ll be ok.

\- Prune your trees.

\- Overhaul recycling program.   Currently it’s every two weeks for pick up.  Who is writes the rules for the city exactly?  I feel like I this city should be called Pittsburgh.com or something.  Are the people in charge here or do they just enjoy getting spanked by big business?

\- Car charging stations. Yes, there are not many teslas around or electric vehicles And theres a good reason for that.  Because you need some car charging stations.  The wave is coming and this city is amazingly not ready.  I thought tech was a big thing here?  Hm?  Oh... looks like they just wanted the tax breaks, who woulda thought?

Thats all for now.  

I encourage the people here to examine these issues and to consider what’s holding the city back from common sense repairs or steps towards modernity.  I promise you the city has lots it power because it’s using it to blow the corporate tech and healthcare infrastructure.  Ask yourself some questions, take a closer look.  The reasons for the city’s issues are clear.  The solutions to the issues however aren’t feasible because they aren’t in focus.

Inside was a Notice of Condemnation and Declaration of Taking, informing me that the “Northside Redevelopment Association of Pittsburgh” has filed with Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas to condemn the building I own in the city, claiming it is abandoned, and said “Association” will take title of it. Take. Title. Of. It. Well, I’ve been working this house for a couple years now, still in the gutting phase, but continually working on it. I pay utilities, all taxes are current. Immediately I contacted every law firm I could find, and the general consensus is that this falls under specialized practice of Eminent Domain, and have been in contact with every specialists I’ve been referred to. The specialists consensus is “Pay me $3000 retainer and I’ll look into it and file a Preliminary Objection, no certainty what will be the outcome, but it’s $400/hr whatever. Or if you don’t pay me, they get your house, no question, no compensation under this statute.”

So here I am, dumbfounded, thinking that since I live in USA, such seizures are unconstitutional. But it seems a fact that Allegheny County and/or the City of Pittsburgh have some kind of exemption from The Constitution and are permitted to seize property at will, with no notice, no communication, no compensation, no discussion. I can see only three options: A) I can let someone legally steal my house; B) I can pay a minimum of $3000 to a lawyer, and still have someone legally steal my house; or C) I can pay a minimum of $3000 to a lawyer and keep my house, which would be basically how things were a week ago, except some lawyer would have $3000 of mine.

I understand why the ""Pittsburgh"" left is a thing. At some intersections, it's border line necessary (Looking at you Braddock and Forbes). That being said, if there is a pedestrian crossing, cut that shit out!

Driving home today through Squirrel Hill with my wife, we came to a stop at a red light and saw the person across doing the typical behavior (inching over the line, wheel slightly turned, etc). To my right, at the crosswalk the other car was aiming for, was a family with a baby stroller. 

Thought the other car would obviously see this, but I prepped my wife that I may need to use our car to get in the way of this jackass if he tried to mow down a family. Sure enough, light turns green, the family starts crossing, and jackass tries to make a dart for the turn completely oblivious of the people there.  

I knew it would suck to get my car fucked up but I couldn't live with the idea of seeing a baby run down in front of me.  Hit the gas and horn at the same time and thankfully the jackass came to a screeching halt in the middle of the intersection.

BEN AVON (INCLUDING HEIGHTS)

\- Are there a lot of young families in the neighborhood?  Are they concentrated in one area of the neighborhood?

\- Are there many public green spaces in the neighborhood?  Based on Google Maps all we saw were the park up in Ben Avon Heights &amp; the park on Camp Horne Rd.

\- Any feedback/opinion on the quality of the schools in Avonworth School District?

\- General thoughts on the neighborhood?  Things we should be should be aware of?

\- Any feedback on Emsworth?  Are there young families in the neighborhood?

&amp;#x200B;

ROSS TOWNSHIP

\- I know the township is huge.  Are there certain area you know of that have a lot of young families in the neighborhood?  Are certain elementary schools better than others?

\- Any feedback/opinion on the quality of the schools in North Hills School District?  Trending positive or negative?

\- If possible we do like sidewalks and decent yard -- is there a place where you'd recommend to find these in Ross other than North Hills Estates?",pittsburgh,Ben Avon &amp; Ross Township - Neighborhood Questions

Can anyone speak to their experience giving notice at Highmark? Were you allowed to complete your two weeks notice, or were you asked to collect your things and to leave immediately?

I ask because I’m considering leaving, but fear that if I respectfully give two weeks notice they will ask me to leave immediately, and I will be unemployed for two weeks till my next job starts, or that I’ll have to “be sneaky” and potentially hurt my reputation by giving notice right before the next job starts, hoping that they terminate me right then and there and not let me finish the two weeks.

It's really hard to keep topical posts up top and to keep the conversation the key point with 6 photos of the sky. But they seem to be well upvoted so maybe its what the people want?

1643,thatburghfan,1582070320,f61i0j,Nan,"This is a party- and position-agnostic topic. These phone polls are designed to teach candidates what to say to win over voters, not to find out what people think.  First question is how likely it is that you will vote. Then some questions about how you feel about issues or candidates. The answers are only used to tailor candidates' talking points and ads to better mirror the same opinions as potential voters.  It makes candidates pretend to be something they are not to improve chances of winning.  Since the questions are not open-ended, you can't offer input other than on the specific topics posed (the ones the polling outfit thinks are the drivers for winning election). 

Some questions are in this format ""&lt;candidate name&gt; has &lt;position&gt; on &lt;issue&gt; - does that make you more or less likely to vote for &lt;candidate&gt;?"" That candidate may be the one running against the person sponsoring the poll. Did you say less likely? They know what negative comments to make about the opponent.   More likely? Then lean more that direction to sway votes your way.

I want to hear a candidate's platform before it is driven by ""Polling says push X and Y, and avoid Z.""

There was a post a few months back about starting a [Repair Cafe](https://repaircafe.org/en)\-styled event in the Pittsburgh area and I wanted to drop an update for everyone.

I run [Fix It PGH](https://smrichardson.com), a small handyman operation and I'm also the organizer of the Free Repair Clinics taking place in Bloomfield at True T Studios.

We had our first Clinic on November 17th, 2019 and had a great turn out. People brought all kinds of things to have looked at; banged up transistor radios, a microwave whose inner workings had melting during a cleaning cycle, LED rave wear that got too sandy at Burning Man, wobbly chairs, rusty bikes, and lots of other cool stuff that just wasn't quite right. We were able to fix about 85% of the projects that came in and any donations made went directly to support True T's mission and programming. We've secured a small amount of funding through [Awesome PGH](https://awesomepgh.com), a local micro-grant maker, to support our growth for future events. **The event is offered for free and will continue to be free** as long as I have a venue to host it in.

As we plan the next event, I would love to include more local tinkers to volunteer their skills. We provide refreshments for the volunteers, tables, power outlets, and a small stockpile of tools, but last time there were only two of us (my partner and I) with the skills to feel confident taking on &lt;1 hour projects with people for an afternoon. If you'd be interested in volunteering, I'd love to hear from you. 

We're specifically interested in people who have experience with:

* Small electronics (phones, radios, table lamps, etc.)
* Textile and clothing mending
* Bicycle repair
* Furniture repair and woodworking
* Miscellaneous specialties",pittsburgh,Free Community Repair Clinics in Bloomfield

**PROGRAM TO AID CITIZEN ENTERPRISE (PACE)**

**INTENSIVE SERVICES CAPACITY-BUILDING GRANT PROGRAM**

***2020-2021***

The mission of the Program to Aid Citizen Enterprise (PACE) is “to advance a more equitable community by increasing the capacity of individuals, groups, and organizations that challenge injustice.”  We are governed by a board of commissioners comprised of a diverse group of community stakeholders committed to providing support to the African American and communities that have been marginalized in Pittsburgh and the region.

A founding partner since 1968, United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania enable PACE to provide 10 million dollars in support to over three hundred organizations.  Fourteen years ago, PACE redesigned its grant program into a capacity building program with the opportunity for an implementation grant. Through the years BNY Mellon Foundation of Southwestern Pennsylvania, McAuley Ministries, The Faulk Foundation, and PNC Charitable Trust have joined PACE as investing partners.

The purpose of the Intensive Services Capacity-Building program is to develop stronger, more resilient community-based nonprofit organizations to serve the community effectively and meaningfully.  Capacity building funds are designed to strengthen community-based nonprofit organizations by helping them improve internal governance and leadership, cultivate strategic community linkages, and develop financial and human resources for long-term stability. We believe that building organizational capacity is a long-term, evolutionary process.

It isn’t until the 4th paragraph that they acknowledge that the # of closed store fronts is actually “fairly normal” for an urban area (40-50 out of 600 businesses).  And the biggest chunk of the article (the rest of it) just quotes from a press release on how PED funding is going to be used to address the issues.

My sense is either they just used a sensationalist opener to get people to click on the article (worked for me) or, more pessimistically, they are intentionally manufacturing a controversy for some behind the scenes reason.

I work out of my house most of the time, as my office is actually in Detroit.  My wife also watches kids out of the house, and it's starting to really frazzle me.  Not nearly as productive as I want to be.  I can't really expect kids to be that quiet, so I'm looking for other options.

However, I'm unsure where the Millvale loop is.  Is it the off ramp from Route 28 where you dip down to that home furnishings store and then can loop back onto 28, or is it the parking lot back near the underground bar and pizzeria that they used to turn around in years ago - the useless stop where nobody got on?  I thought it was the latter, but it's ludicrous to bring back that stop just for the weekend.  If they're going through Millvale like on weekdays, this bring back might have value for Millvale people only.  Millvale already has weekend service, though, from the 1 bus, albeit at that 28 exit.

1786,hg13,1582504059,f8iptk,Nan,"So, let me start by saying, I LOVE Pittsburgh. I'm proud that my immigrant grandparents built a community with immigrants from other countries, I'm proud that my grandparents worked hard in the mill and owned boarding houses to give their descendants a middle-class lifestyle, I'm proud that they kept a strong community through Pittsburgh's ""depression"" when the mills closed. I think downtown is eclectic and green and hilly and beautiful. I grew up in Pittsburgh, attended Pitt, and would love to move back.

I know this is an overly negative and entirely useless complaint that will likely draw some heat, but I'm still going to get it off my chest anyway.

I'm SICK of hearing ""you know you're from Pittsburgh when...""-isms that are not even unique to the city or are otherwise somewhat vapid.  

For example, the Pittsburgh Post Gazette posts reminiscent articles about Isley's every 2 months. Not only did Isley's close decades ago, but it wasn't even centrally located in Pittsburgh. I understand boomers had good memories here, but if it was so great why is it out of business? It seems like a random thing to fixate on? PPG must be getting a lot of clicks on ""Isley's"" articles to continue posting it.

Other examples include the ""Pittsburgh Left"", which is not unique to Pittsburgh; [Jaywalking!](https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/thedigs/2014/03/17/jaywalking-in-pittsburgh/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook_Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette&amp;fbclid=IwAR0dvblNlr1BNa_bK7rMAVm7NKjQHgx69U1IatQtgdXmpw-kJ1PXD_zNpog), which is not even close to being unique to Pittsburgh; saying ""pop"", not unique; other various phrases like ""jeet jet?"", very few of them unique, and in any case, I don't exactly define my upbringing around the fact that I said ""gum band"" instead of ""rubber band"".

I understand that most of these are in good fun, and I'm probably just being overcritical of my hometown like some people are, but I meet so many people (especially boomers) who are oblivious to the fact that these things either aren't unique to Pittsburgh, aren't particularly interesting to outsiders, and don't define a culture.

I've lived in other US cities where people reminisce a bit, but are generally more focused on moving forward. There isn't an ongoing need to show how 'unique' they are, grasping for random crap like ""chipped ham"" and ""jaywalking"" as proof. 

When I see the city's major newspaper continuously posting articles about these things, it doesn't make me think Pittsburgh has an amazing culture. It makes me think Pittsburgh is a very insular and backward community still reminiscing about the 1950s. Of course I know that isn't true, but it's still a bit cringy to see.",pittsburgh,Petty and pointless complaint: I love Pittsburgh but I'm tired of people reminiscing about Isleys and other uninteresting Pittsburgh things.

I was wondering where should I live? I'm a 24M I'd like to live somewhere with my people around my age group. I also will be cycling to the hospital most probably and I won't have a car so I'd like to live somewhere with restaurants, a grocery story, and gym if possible.

I live in Shadyside in a condominium building, which doesn't currently have any support for charging. Management is willing to sit down and discuss options, but they've indicated the cost will be quite high as the garage is mostly unelectrified, and the cost would have to be passed onto me. My work currently does not have charging, either (this may change next year).

My commute is about 30 miles roundtrip per day, and I work from home Fridays. I probably drive another 30-50 each week casually. So probably 200 miles per week.

I know there's a Supercharger in Sewickley, but obviously not super ideal living in Shadyside. And I know there's one coming to Pittsburgh ""sometime in 2020"", but that's very undefined.

I'm very new to EVs and the charging options around the city area.

They were horrified to find out that none of them could get erections, so they all curled up and started crying and peeing on their own bodies. One of them (I won’t say who) became furious and after beating up the pathetic ones went to his study to draft what has become known simply as “the manifesto” to the mods.

The manifesto claims that if they are able to drink semen from non-mods then they will regain their ability to gain erections (needless to say, there is no science to back this.) The manifesto also sets out some weird rules, such as those who donate their cum to the cause may become pregnant with a mod’s offspring. I know what you’re thinking, how can a man become pregnant? Well because men don’t have a uterus or birth canal, the “offspring” manifests as green slime that escapes the anus. I know none of this is real, it’s just what’s in their manifesto.

I think they need to be stopped, because even though they are gaining consent from people before they drink semen, they are getting consent under false pretenses. Of course the donors have access to the same information as the rest of us, but they may not have been made aware that donating semen will not sure another persons erectile dysfunction, and in no way will lead to their pregnancy.",pittsburgh,The mods of r/cars are doing some weird stuff

With the girl I know, he basically just talked about things that happened to him (some, obvious lies) and said he really likes people. Then he basically just forced her into a hand shake. Later, mutual friends stated they had been in similar situations with the same guy. 

It's a tough situation because clearly, the guy doesn't mean any harm. On the other hand, people are entitled to their privacy. Obviously, if the guy was not mentally challenged handling this would be much more straight forward.

Out of curiosity, does anyone know the story with this guy? He seems to have the mind of a child and apparently rides the T frequently.  Considering the straight-forward approach and uncomfortable result, I wouldn't be surprised if something bad eventually happens (to him, or someone else).

I ask because it looks like they have absurd hidden fees. We went to one of their urgent care facilities and they said that $115 covers everything, even in house procedures, which he got. We just got billed an extra $500+ in the mail because of this and we feel screwed over, considering all the other urgent care places we called were transparent about any other fees being mailed to us, but UPMC said specifically that $115 covered everything in house.

Is UPMC an okay place to go in his position, or are there other local places/alternatives? I know there's apps where you can get a one time visit with a doctor for around $15, but would they give the same services as a PCP for reoccurring issues?

I’m not so much worried about the virus itself but the reaction...I don’t think it is a guarantee but I’m starting to lean towards there being some large scale quarantine and definitely school closings.

The thing is, I’m still not convinced any of the numbers from China really are accurate. For something that is claimed to be a highly contagious disease, it doesn’t really mesh with there only being 65k cases in Hubei province where it originated since the pop there is 58 million. I’ll compare it to Allegheny county numbers for the flu this year...there have been 11k reported cases, but I think it is safe to say there are FAR more actual cases that are mild. I’d suspect the same with this.

Basically, it comes down to this...stay safe, wash your hands, I won’t tell anyone to stay home...that is a completely different issue with sick time not being a reality for a lot of people. 

In any case, I’m just being prepared. At worst I’ll have a few weeks I don’t have to go grocery shopping later down the road.",pittsburgh,So have any of you prepped for coronavirus as of yet? How do we think local officials will handle the inevitable first cases?

The purchase price of the puppy is inflated with products you may not need and when you attempt to opt out of them they refuse by telling you it is part of the puppy purchase price.  If you pay attention to your receipt you'll see that they are not actually included and are all itemized.  They refuse to allow you to return any item they charge you for in this process.  

Personally, I bought a puppy for $2,199.99 and they told me that a whole list of items were included wit the puppy and that I could not opt out of receiving them.  They charged me a $25 doc fee, $299.99 Enhanced Protection Program, $75 Processing fee, $450 Puppy kit, and $65.99 for dog food.  I also purchased a collar for $9.99 and leash for $14.99.  In total, I paid $3,140.95 plus $266.99 in taxes for a grand total of $3407.94.  So essentially, I was forced to purchase $915.98 for things I didn't even need in order to purchase a puppy from Petland Monroeville.

**Specific Questions: **
* What are good resources for finding housing in Pittsburgh? Being new to this I've heard mixed reviews for Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace (however I could not get into any university specific facebook groups since I did not have a school associated email).
* What is an average/median Monthly rate for renting in Pittsburgh? So far I've seen ~$1,000 a month for a ""1 Bed"" setup but was not sure if that was the usual or more on the high end.
* Are some neighborhoods more expensive than others? If so where would you suggest?
* Which Neighborhoods are most resource effective? I've heard very good things about the Bus System - is it the standard across the city or will you be better off with a car in some neighborhoods?

We had movers come to our apartment yesterday and all of our stuff was packed and removed. All 3 of our cats were secured in their crates the whole time.

We came back this morning and found our other 2 cats still here, but Ruru is missing. 

We're fairly sure he's not outside because he's extremely shy, we're on the second floor, he would need to go out the apartment door and building front door, and our other 2 cats didn't escape. However, he was really stressed by the movers and who knows what a stressed out cat will do? 

We found 2 holes in our walls that he could have gone into. So we called our local cops and fire dept and they came over with thermal imaging cameras. They found one hot spot in the apartment completely on the other side from the 2 holes. We're not sure if it's the cat or something in the downstairs apartment.

We are looking at moving to the south side flats area.  We are both in our low 30's, no kids and like to be close to a good night life with good to decent options for food. A lot of people have told us it is a very fun area if you like all of these things but there also other people who say its not a good area because of noise etc.  We have spent a few days walking around Carson Street and the area where we intend on buying and I haven't had an issue.

We have also looked at other areas like Lawrenceville and the north shore but they don't seem to accommodate the night life that we are looking for but still have nice neighborhoods.  We have heard that Lawrenceville is one of the highest appreciating neighborhoods in the country, by margin and may be at its peak, which gives us pause because we wont be here forever (3-5 years most likely).  

My girlfriend works west of the city closer to Rosalyn Farms so we would like to be no further east than Shady Side because it would make her commute long with all the traffic during rush hour.  

Any opinions on neighborhoods or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Anyway, I've noticed many places in the city where the property lines seem to indicate the presence of a road at some point (examples included in this post). In some of these cases there is clear evidence of a road having at one point existed in that location, especially with dead-end streets, but in some other cases there isn't really anything in the landscape that would indicate there ever having been a road there. They seem to be more prevalent in hillier neighborhoods and neighborhoods that have suffered significant depopulation. Does anyone know anything about these ""ghost streets"" (as I've taken to calling them)? Are there just a huge number of streets that no longer exist in Pittsburgh? Were there planned developments in these places that never got built? Any insight would be appreciated; I've never seen anything like this in any other city, and I've been curious for a while now.

I've only been in there a couple times, but the visitors seemed to skew on the old side, especially around the slot machines. I think it's safe to assume that thousands of people--many of whom are at high risk--pass through the casino every week.

By their nature, slot machines are touched by many different people. Keeping them clean is going to be an extremely difficult task, especially while people are breathing, coughing, and sneezing nearby. Table games pose similar challenges because people are constantly handling chips, cards, and surfaces. 

People come to the Rivers from all over the area. There's a big indoor smoking section. Older people, especially smokers are hit especially hard by the Coronavirus.

March 13, 2020

Dear Parents and Guardians,

At this time, the Fox Chapel Area School District has decided to close all campuses through spring break. Classes tentatively are scheduled to resume in Fox Chapel Area schools on Monday, April 13. In the event that this date would change, we will communicate that in a timely fashion.

Please know that we understand the challenges and stress that a prolonged closure will put on our families. However, we believe that shutting down our campuses is in the best interest of protecting the health and welfare of every member of our educational community, especially those at a higher risk of contracting coronavirus. We will be here to assist our families in any way that we can during this time.

Here is the latest information we have in regard to how the district will operate during the shutdown.

**ONLINE INSTRUCTION**

As we detailed in a prior communication, we have created a comprehensive plan for how we will continue instruction via online learning. Electronic devices and/or Wi-Fi hotspots are being distributed today to students who have indicated a need for them.

As we previously communicated, students will not begin online learning until the third day of the closure, which will be Tuesday, March 17. Elementary school students will use Google Classroom and Clever for their instruction. Secondary students will utilize Schoology and Clever.

**ACADEMIC EXPECTATIONS**

2494,toolatetobeoriginal,1584133752,fi6w07,Nan,"To anyone who had seen and participated from my last post about Sherman. Just a quick update. 

He totally called me out on making him a “popular homeless guy” on Reddit. He was actually very appreciative of this.

Over the last week, the Pgh community has given Sherman filet mignon, had pgh bicycle cops stop and make polite conversation, and “about a hundred people just came up to ask how his day was”. 

So thank you. Seriously. Everyone. Thank you so much. 

He told me, “you know, a lot of people are out here just for the *grabs cup with change*. I’m not, I’m here for the resources and services available to me. The way I’ve been treated is worth $10 million bucks.” I’ve had quite some interactions with the homeless community throughout my annual fundraisers. Every person has different nuances to them. But this guy, even with his faults, has been genuine and self aware. He has also always been polite, and never asked me for more than what I’ve offered. 

Operation Safety net is putting him into a new facility. He said this is something that you kind of have to be selected for. He accredits local resources in conjunction to his “recent popularity” from Reddit”. 

**Tldr:** he told me that he feels like he’s being treated like a person, and feels so special thanks to the attention he’s been receiving. Not just another person people walk by.

So thanks everyone for being good people. That’s the last you’ll hear from me on this. Just wanted to provide some warm and fuzzy updates in a time of gloom.",pittsburgh,Update: Sherm is moving into housing!

I yelled while slamming on my brakes but he had no reaction whatsoever and plowed right into me. I sustained injuries and my bike is totaled. After he hit me he pulled over and said he would give me his info if I didn't call the cops. He sounded impaired, was slurring his words, and called my bike a car a couple times. I told him I had to make a report or else an insurance company could just deny that this even happened. At that point he told me that his car wasn't inspected and his girlfriend in the car with him had warrants. I told him I still had to call, at which point he yelled to her that they needed to get out of there and he got in and sped off. There were witnesses who stayed and waited for the cops with me, but this guy fled the scene. I trust that the police will investigate, but I don't have a ton of faith that this guy's car/plate are even registered. If your recognize the guy in this picture or his car, please let me know.

UPMC has developed a test for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — and will use this test to diagnose select, symptomatic cases. 

The health system plans to rapidly increase capacity at its central laboratory. If there is a need, UPMC could soon be ready to test hundreds of patients per week, filling a critical gap until other commercial tests become available.

“Developing this test for a never-before-seen virus in the midst of a pandemic was a tremendous challenge, even for our academic medical center with its long history of such developments,“ said Alan Wells, MD, DMSc, medical director of the UPMC Clinical Laboratories and Thomas Gill III Professor of Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. “But testing capabilities are absolutely essential to managing a pandemic.“

“If the communities we serve see a surge in severe illnesses, we must be able to diagnose people quickly to give them the appropriate care while protecting our staff and the broader community.”   

On Tuesday, UPMC will begin directing patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 to a specimen collection site in Pittsburgh’s South Side neighborhood. 

The site is not open to the general public. Patients must have a physician referral approved by UPMC’s infection prevention team and an appointment to have their specimen collected for testing by either UPMC or public health authorities.  

UPMC will later open additional specimen collection facilities in Harrisburg, Erie, Williamsport, and Altoona. This will happen at a later date after UPMC gains experience with the South Side facility and after UPMC’s testing capacity increases. 

“Testing capabilities for COVID-19 in the U.S. have been delayed and limited, creating anxiety for the people we serve and impairing our ability to optimally guide the public health response,” said Donald Yealy, MD, chair of emergency medicine for UPMC and Pitt. 

“By creating our own test and collection centers, we can both help our patients and the overall community. We seek getting a diagnosis in hours, not days.” 

The U.S. lagged behind other countries in testing capacity, which was centered around public health authorities. The tests created by commercial laboratories are either not serving the Pittsburgh region or can take longer for results, Wells says. 

Trained UPMC providers will collect specimens, doing so safely while wearing personal protective equipment, including gowns, gloves, and N95 masks or respirators. 

Collection will occur in negative pressure rooms. This assures that air does not leave the room until it flows through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter that removes pathogens. 

The process involves a “nasopharyngeal” swab, a thin device inserted through a patient’s nose into the nasal cavity. 

The specimens will be safely transported for testing to the UPMC Clinical Laboratories, the largest academic clinical lab in the U.S. In most cases, results will be returned within 24 hours. 

UPMC may continue to send specimens to the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s laboratory in eastern Pennsylvania or health department laboratories in New York and Maryland as needed and for confirmation. 

UPMC will work with commercial laboratories to send specimens to them as soon as they have capacity, which will maximize the health system’s ability to test all who need it. 

UPMC created its laboratory-developed test using reagents already approved for making a SARS-CoV-2 test and following U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. It is validated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments program of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for use in human diagnoses.  

The test was created by a virology team led by Tung Phan, MD, PhD, assistant professor of pathology at Pitt and assistant director of clinical microbiology at UPMC; Charles Rinaldo Jr., PhD, chair and professor of the Pitt Graduate School of Public Health’s Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology and director of the UPMC Clinical Virology Laboratory; and Stephanie Mitchell, PhD, assistant professor of pathology at Pitt and director of clinical microbiology at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. 

Arlene Bullotta, Barbara Harris, and Kathy Greenawalt of the Section of Virology at UPMC Clinical Laboratories did implementation work. 

“This was a tireless effort by a team dedicated to serving the needs of our patients,” Wells says. 

The test was validated with genetic samples of SARS-CoV-2 shared by Paul Duprex, PhD, director of Pitt’s Center for Vaccine Research. The center also is pursuing development of a COVID-19 vaccine. 

Anyone whose sample is taken should self-isolate until results come back. If it is positive, UPMC will refer the patient to public health authorities and ensure ongoing care. All positive UPMC test results will be “presumed” positive until confirmed by the CDC or state public health laboratories. 

People who suspect they have COVID-19 but do not have a high fever or breathing problems should call their primary care physician or use UPMC AnywhereCare, an online tool to get advice. Anyone with a high fever and breathing trouble should go to his or her local emergency department for evaluation and care.

1. Apply for unemployment (won't even cover her bills, but is a start) \[does Pittsburgh have a way to waive delayed period?\]
2. Reach out to bank for mortgage deferment \[It doesn't seem that there is any federal, state, or local mandate that this can be granted, is that correct?\]
3. Reach out to utility companies and credit card companies for some sort of deferment \[It doesn't seem that there is any federal, state, or local mandate that this can be granted, is that correct?\]

""At the same time, we are concerned about recent comments by government officials that could 

be interpreted as recommending that hospitals immediately stop performing “elective” surgeries

without clear agreement on how we classify various levels of necessary care. We agree that the 

crisis as it develops may require the curtailment of the least critical or time-sensitive hospital 

services, but any curtailment must be nuanced to meet the needs of all severely ill patients. Our 

patients will be best served by carefully evaluating and prioritizing gradients of “elective” care to 

ensure that the most time-sensitive medically necessary care can be delivered by physicians and 

hospitals. 

While modeling predicts a surge of the number of serious COVID-19 cases that will need 

hospital care, the hospital system must continue to balance the needs of caring for patients with 

COVID-19 while providing vital services to others in the community who need care. Hospitals, 

their physicians, and staff will be called on to treat many patients with emergency or immediate 

and serious needs: many patients, such as those with cancer or a need for cardiac surgery, will 

not be able to postpone medical interventions. Where possible, we cannot completely cease

I'm consistently running into obnoxious, rude, or plain self-centered people and it's really beginning to grate on me. Add in the general feeling of sheer hopelessness and misery some just push onto others and it's starting to impact my mood to the point where I need to move.

When I was in SC and got stuck in a line somewhere, I knew I could just strike up a conversation and BS with anyone then part ways the moment the line was gone.

Additionally, I conduct private SAT and AP tutoring for highschool students, with emphasis on math and statistics. After graduation I am matriculating to a top 7/ivy league law school. 

Target subjects: Any highschool level math course including AP Calculus AB, BC and AP Statistics; Calculus 1, 2, and 3; Introductory through intermediate university level statistics; Linear Algebra; Differential Equations

To keep my tutoring affordable during these difficult times, I am doing 1 hour, online sessions at $20 hourly, negotiable based on nature of the work. We can cover whatever is most helpful to you, whether that be individual problems or covering content.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like, this is all part of life. This virus situation in general will change day to day.

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

Bonus rule

Try to remember the lessons of past.

So there are 230,287 seniors in our community. According to current projections from the COVID 19 response team at Imperial College in London ( https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3yxgwueIAk6r9DdmyDcky9T135DH06pqbuX5cSPFD9U7Iw9BMByJMHpM8 ), 8-15% of all Americans over the age of 70 will die. So if you do the math, anywhere from 18,000-34,500 of our senior citizens will die in Pittsburgh alone. In 2017 Allegheny County had 10,700 deaths in one year for ages 65 and older ( ""These data were provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The Department specifically disclaims responsibility for any analyses, interpretations, or conclusions."" ) So we are looking at almost DOUBLE the death rate for our seniors from COVID 19 alone at the very least, and more than TRIPLE the death rate on the upper end. This isn’t including the deaths of other age groups, which will be even more disproportionate to the death rate in Allegheny County. Do you think we have the resources to handle this massive influx of death? Do you think that we have enough nurses, physicians and support staff to handle how many people who will be critically ill and require ventilator support? We aren’t. And we don’t. Stay inside.

* Do not follow anyone to their homes because you don't like something they did
* Get your facts straight on what businesses are actually closed right now
* Parks are not closed
* People are allowed outside
* Stop  saying you heard from some one that knew someone that they are  declaring martial law. Only the President of the United States can  declare Martial Law across the country

Out of nowhere, a 50ish-year-old woman beelined towards me from across the street. She had a nasty smirk on her face. She was shouting something but I couldn't hear her. I said, ""What?""

She stopped ***IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET*** and pretended to make a ""Stop"" gesture (✋). She said ""Social distancing!"" in a taunting way.

I had no idea what she was talking about so I just shook my head and continued walking. She moved back to her side of the street, and didn't say anything else to me.

A moment later it hit me. She was mocking me for wearing blue medical gloves, and she was trying to provoke a negative reaction by getting into my personal space and shouting ""Social distancing!"" 

She probably wasn't expecting me NOT to react, though, which is probably why she didn't totally cross the street. (I didn't react because I was totally confused at the time.)

When I realized what happened though, I felt violated and infuriated. I still do. 

What kind of sociopath GLEEFULLY DENIES that a pandemic is going on, then proceeds to torment other people who are PROTECTING themselves from it??

Oh. 

I feel that if another person ever insists on being in my personal space, I'll just pretend to sneeze into my gloved hands, then stick my hand out to greet them. I'll also compliment their hair and clothes, wiping my fingers across it all. If they start backing out of my personal space I'll insist that they stay; they're more than welcome.

The Pittsburgh Parking Authority owns the lot we use to park. We pay a daily rate of $9 or a monthly lease of $170. The Parking Authority decided to price gouge us and demand we buy a monthly lease. Medical and corrections work weekends. The lot is free on the weekends. They might only work three days during the week. There are healthcare workers that only work 2 days a week. How dare they try to make up the money they are losing elsewhere by making employees that are mandated to work pay extra. That is a new level of evil. Please make this go viral.

If people want to buy large quantities, fine but tell them place a special order then or invited to deal directly with the manufacturer/wholesaler/distributor.

I am incredibly worried for her. She is almost 60 with high blood pressure. Almost everyone there is around her age. She is really worried and upset too.

As the Rabbanim of the community, we issue the following directives for the safety of each and every individual in the community as well as the community as a whole , as part of our Torah obligation of hatzalas nefashos:
At this point, there are active cases of Covid 19 in frum communities across the world, including a confirmed case in the Squirrel Hill Jewish community. Every effort should be made to prevent guests, including children and elderly relatives, from coming to Pittsburgh, including for Pesach or simchas. 
Family members who arrived here from out of town already, must be quarantined AWAY FROM the entire family, or THE WHOLE FAMILY/HOME must be quarantined from the community for 14 days. This time frame is subject to change based on guidelines of your family doctor or of the CDC.
You should not leave for any other community for Yom Tov, simchas or any other reason. The Rabbanim in South Florida are begging people not to come. We need to protect our families, our community, and other communities as well
One should not invite guests locally for Shabbos and Yom Tov meals, including the Seder
If you believe there is an emergency situation requiring travel, you must first consult with your Rav and family doctor 
We have the opportunity and obligation to sanctify Hashem’s name and fulfill the paramount mitzva of hatzalas nefashos (saving lives). We beseech you to do the right and responsible thing.

It was also supposed to be a big money maker for the *City Paper* who, like most alt-weeklies these days, derive most of their revenue from advertisements from local businesses. “Not only did the events start canceling and we didn’t know what to do with our coverage, but a majority of our advertising pulled,” Cunningham told me.  
&gt;  
&gt;In less than a week, *City Paper* lost more than 90 percent of the ads in its paper, Cunnigham says. The paper ended up printing a 32-page paper full of stories about how COVID-19 is affecting Pittsburgh, along with a desperate editorial from Cunningham: “Our entire city is facing the devastating results of the pandemic, and *Pittsburgh City Paper* is no exception,” she [Cunningham wrote](https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/no-news-is-bad-news/Content?oid=16966532). “I’m gonna be totally honest: *City Paper* is in trouble.”

So i already have a benefits account with welfare and an ebt card. Last december my food stamps benefit was reduced to $0 because i was making too much money.

Now my current employer has temporarily/possibly permanently closed bc of covid (it was a restaurant).

It seems you cannot report a ""job loss"" online, you have to download a form, complete it and either mail or fax it into welfare. Theres nobody at the county assistance office to receive it, correct? Is there another way to do this?

""Allegheny County said the positive cases of COVID-19 have increased to 88 people — 13 of them hospitalized, according to a statement released at 11 a.m. Wednesday. Additionally, the Kane Community Living Centers said a staff member at its Glen Hazel facility tested positive for COVID-19 

In Allegheny, the number is up from Tuesday, when 58 cases were confirmed, and Monday, when there were 48 positive cases.

As of noon Tuesday, the most recent time in which the state has released data, the other counties in southwestern Pennsylvania that are reporting COVID-19 cases are Westmoreland (11), Washington (9), Butler (6), Beaver (3), Fayette (2), Mercer (2), Cambria (1), Armstrong (1) and Somerset (1). Erie is reporting four cases.

Statewide, there are 851 positive cases and seven deaths, with at least one case in 40 of the state’s 67 counties.

Dennis Biondo, Kane’s director, said in a release that the person who tested positive “does NOT provide direct care and has NOT had any direct resident contact.

“The staff person ... has not worked since last Thursday, March 19, 2020. All protocols recommended by the Health Department are being followed and, where appropriate, additional testing has occurred.”",pittsburgh,Post-Gazette: Allegheny County COVID-19 cases rise to 88; Kane Centers said staff member tested positive

I've just received an email that our community dog park will be shut down due to the pandemic. My large dog and I visit this park around 7am daily, and usually again around sun down, while no one else is ever there. Large gatherings are extremely rare there and I am certain that rules could be established to force social distancing. I pay a monthly pet fee, and this dog park is mentioned as an amenity. 

Maintenance is only entering apartments for emergencies, and the playground is being shut down - all understandable, social distancing; I'm taking it seriously. 

All Stay at Home orders permit communities to be outside, hike, and walk pets, so long as they social distance. New York City dog parks are staying open  \[source\]([https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-new-york-city-dog-runs-parks/](https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-new-york-city-dog-runs-parks/)) and I am planning to take the time necessary to regain access to the park if possible. Not as many tenants as I would expect even go there. At least a dozen people could honestly stand the recommended 6 feet away with proper coordination. 

I feel like it would be fair to instate some additional rules for these conditions so that the tenants here can have access to the exercise their pets need. 

On a personal level, this bothers me, as I would not keep a large dog as a companion, if I am unable to access space for them to run. If the park is closed, I will have no other option but to begin taking my pup who is not properly leash trained, on lengthier walks than I am comfortable with. This will be an issue with my current work schedule, which has been very bumpy due to the pandemic. 

I am planning to call the property office shortly, and try to speak with someone about any plans to alter this closing.",pittsburgh,Property Manager Closing Dog Park - What's the law say?

&gt; “I am extremely pleased that Governor Wolf has acknowledged that he may not eviscerated citizens’ inviolate rights, regardless of any states of emergency that may exist,” said Joshua Prince, who had filed suit on behalf of a gun shop and a would-be gun purchaser.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had narrowly dismissed Prince’s suit, which challenged Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses deemed “non-life-sustaining.”  
&gt;  
&gt;But in a dissenting statement joined by two other justices, Justice David Wecht said Wolf’s order amounted to “an absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth — a result in clear tension with the Second Amendment” and the state constitution.

Wishful thinking that this thread won't degenerate into the typical shouting match seen around the topic of gun rights, but I'm just struck by the thought that out of all the essentials to living, and other rights we enjoy, free access to firearms seems to be the overriding one that we guard like The Precious. In other words, it's unfortunate that the Constitution doesn't guarantee the availability of TP, PPE, or the right to put the health of your family before the need of unscrupulous employers to make a buck by insisting that you continue working without protection.",pittsburgh,Wolf Reopens Gun Shops After Dissent From Pa.

I am working on a team sponsored by NASA Ames Research Center on a research project around crew autonomy on long-duration missions to the moon and Mars.

One of the challenges astronauts traveling to Mars will face is confinement and isolation. They will be stuck in a small space with \~3 other people with long communication delays between themselves and the ground.

We are hoping to explore quarantine as an analogous domain to help gain insights into what we might design to help astronauts stay safe, healthy, sane, and focused on the long trip to Mars and back.

Want to help us in a big way? [Sign up for our 10 day diary stud](https://forms.gle/wt9QkCkLC6x6TuTx8)y! Every day for 10 days, you will be asked to spend about 5 minutes answering some questions about your day. Use it to vent anonymously about what’s going on, or just for something to keep you busy! We will read every response and it makes us feel better about our own quarantines to hear about other people’s lives.

Want to help, but don’t want to commit? Reply to this post with a little bit of information about your quarantine situation. How are you doing today? What helps you stay sane?

During yesterday's wind storm a neighbor of mine's tree fell on the power line, knocking power out for our cul-de-sac. We called Duquense Light to let them know what had happened. They said that they would send someone to check it out. This was at about 3 PM.

We waited for them to come by, and they arrived at about 9:30. That's understandable, seeing how powerful that wind was, that there would be multiple outages all over the city. My mom asked them when they thought our power would be back up, and they said that it could be back in 5 minutes, or at midnight. So, we waited. My mom and I went to bed at about midnight, with no power still. We assumed that they would get it on soon, seeing that this was their late estimate.

We woke up at about 8-8:30. There was still no power. We were confused, but we assumed that our fridge, or at least our freezer, would be able to keep our food from spoiling since we hadn't opened it since our power went out. Then, at 9:30 AM, 18 and a half hours after our power went out, it came back on. We checked the food in the fridge, and it was all tepid. Almost everything in the freezer became soft. We had to throw almost all of it away. We went from a fridge full of food, some of which had just been purchased 2 days before, to a bag of frozen chicken, a bag of frozen spinach, some condiments, and fruit.

Population wise, the counties are fairly similar (1.2 mil compared to 1.5 mil) but the progression of cases are remarkably different.

Allegheny County - 219 - 265 - 280 - 325

Philadelphia County - 735 - 865 - 1006 - 1315

Now, I'm not sure how many tests Allegheny County has administered. Philadelphia states on their website they've had 6,850 negative results, meaning they've administered a little over 8,000 tests. The last report from Allegheny County that I saw was 5 days ago with 1,600 tests being administered.

I guess my question is what makes things different between the two counties? Is it because there are more people living within city limits in Philadelphia, meaning closer contact with people?

So I'm currently living in the city, in Squirrel Hill, and have been considering moving out. The main reason is that I'd really like to be able to be outdoors and not have to worry about seeing many, if any, other people while running or biking. This is, of course, due to virus-that-shall-not-be-named. My preference is to be able to run on gravel or dirt roads (think forest service roads), but that isn't really possible here except maybe Frick but it's very crowded these days. I was wondering if there's anywhere within reasonable commuting distance to downtown (say 50 minutes) that has a lot of country roads? One of my coworkers recommended Harmony/Zeilenople area.

Hey r/pittsburgh! If you didn't know, Monday was world bipolar day, so this is only two days late... My wife Rachel Kallem Whitman is a doctor, educator, and writer who has been shacking up with bipolar disorder since 2000. Her debut book, “Instability in Six Colors,” paints a vivid picture of what it is like living with chronic mental illness, trauma, and a complicated relationship with sanity, safety, and suicide. Through raw, honest, emotional, and poetic storytelling Rachel seeks to narrate her own journey, navigate her own recovery, and kindle hope for those impacted by mental illness. Rachel’s mission is to create an inclusive community that empowers individuals to look beyond their illness to find themselves.  

If you're interested, you can purchase a copy through [One Idea Press](https://aerbook.com/maker/productcard-5494155-8817.html) or on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Nobles (though these are delayed until end of April).

Trigger Warning: This book addresses themes of suicide, self-harm, depression, and contains sexual conduct.

""For the Musolino family, celebrating another year of life for Ellie is extra special after discovering about three years ago that she has a benign brain tumor. Now after two years of being chemotherapy free, the Musolinos found a way to give Ellie the birthday she’d been asking for, in the form of a mini parade that went right past her driveway.

Ms. Musolino, of Scott Township, thought about having people come and wave to Ellie through the window, but said the idea felt like “prison.” Instead, her sister and brother-in-law, Nick and Nicole Vincent, came up with the idea to have a parade drive by their house on Rose Leaf Road.

The idea actualized into a parade on Monday led by two Scott Township police cruisers as 21 other vehicles filled with close family and friends followed. Some of Ms. Musolino’s coworkers even joined the procession of cars adorned with huge “Happy Birthday” signs — one read “Ellie for Prez” —  while passengers waved flags and balloons.""",pittsburgh,5-year-old brain tumor survivor gets special birthday parade led by Scott Township police

In the Philippines, supplies for Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) for frontliners are on high demand and are getting more expensive. As a solution, the Vice President of PH and her partners were able to start an initiative of manufacturing reusable PPEs that can be distributed to various hospitals around the country.

Partnering with fashion designers and after getting approval from the medical community for the design's viability for use, they were able to create a blueprint for the PPE and shared the design for free. The style was made in consideration of women doctors to make it easier for them to go to the bathroom but is also usable by men.

If anyone wants to start a volunteer campaign or know people in other areas that are looking for a template to build these suits to donate to Pgh hospitals or even in heavy-hit states like New York or Washington or just hospitals in general, please feel free to forward this information.

3559,Tonyclifton69,1585851312,ftrdwd,Nan," A potential vaccine against the novel coronavirus causing the covid-19 outbreak has been created in a University of Pittsburgh lab.

Researchers say the first phase of human clinical trials — which would include healthy volunteers in the Pittsburgh area — could start in the coming months.

“This vaccine is designed to be safe, in part because it delivers very low doses of antigen,” Falo said. “Much lower doses than the traditional flu vaccine. Secondly, it delivers that antigen to a very confined space within the skin, so that it’s very unlikely that we would see any type of systemic responses that have been seen with some patients in the flu vaccine.”

The process for making the vaccine does not require significantly complex or expensive equipment, which makes it very scalable, Falo said.

“At present time in our lab, one person with the set of molds and the centrifuge can make hundreds of microneedle arrays in a single day,” he said.

The vaccine does not need to be kept frozen or refrigerated, which could reduce shipping costs and help with distributing the vaccine.

“When the vaccine is actually ready for widespread deployment, it would most likely be ready broadly so that we would not have to ration the vaccine,” Falo said. “I would expect that the manufacturing and scale up would occur during the testing process, so that plenty of vaccine would be available if it proved to be effective.”

I'm moving to Pittsburgh and want to calculate my budget, income taxes are new to me. i've recently learned that yall pay city taxes but i'm a little confused.

 I see that ""pittsburgh"" income taxes are 3%.

([Here's](https://www.jordantax.com/Forms/ACCTCD_EIT_Extension_Voucher.pdf) where i'm getting my percentages). However, when i'm using a [tax calculator](http://munstats.pa.gov/Public/FindLocalTax.aspx), anywhere i input is giving me a 3% tax, even when it's in a different borough/township. Am i misunderstanding  things?  is there a 3% rate for all of Allegheny county?

&amp;#x200B;

disclaimer, i don't know anything about Pittsburgh townships/boroughs/neighborhoods, i'm strictly going off of google maps and their outlines. my main goal is finding a place to rent that has a reasonable commute to downtown (preferably with public transportation) and with as little tax withholding as possible (gotta pay off my loans!). thank you!",pittsburgh,How do i calculate income taxes?

The way they are currently operating is as follows:

1. The drive-thru line starts from two directions (one by the laser tag and the other in front of the bank) and merges into one line. The laser tag side was much shorter, so they were able to get near the front of the line faster.
2. An employee is approaching everyone's window in order to help navigate traffic, take orders, and instruct people with mobile orders to park in from of the store.
3. If you have a mobile order, a different employee approaches your vehicle to ask your name, then they eventually bring the order to you.
4. It can take up to an hour to receive your drink(s).
5. Exiting the parking lot is a nightmare.
6. The employees have on gloves, but I saw those same employees touch peoples' cars.
