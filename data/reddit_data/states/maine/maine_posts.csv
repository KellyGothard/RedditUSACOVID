I went there for my interviews and it seems like a really cool place to work at least for a few years to get a little experience. 

Anyways in the tentative job offer it says that there is a security screening a drug test and a physical I was just wondering if a one who has been through the process knows a time frame for this? I had stopped smoking weed for a long period of time before my interview but through the whole process there was nothing about a drug test and I also have friends that graduated last year and went on to work there and they said they never got tested at all. Because of this I have started smoking again since thanksgiving. I was just wondering if anyone knew how long it might take before I actually get tested or honestly just any other useful information at all would be greatly appreciated. And yes I plan on not smoking again as of yesterday.",Maine,Portsmouth naval shipyard drug test

I'm seeking recommendations for engagement ring jewelers in the southern Maine region. My hopes are to sit down and look at a variety of diamonds to find the right one, and then have it set in a custom band (does not need to necessarily be from the same shop either). I can't really tell from websites if all of the jewelers offer this as several don't say custom or they have a very small diamond selection. I'm not that keen on getting a ring from the mall either but maybe I can be convinced. Was thinking of going by d cole later today as a start. This seems like one of those things where I want to have a better idea going into the shop because I doubt they'll want me to leave once I enter.

Any other suggestions?

Thanks",Maine,Best diamonds for engagement rings in southern Maine area?

We put had 100 gallons put in the tank about 4 weeks ago but the gauge is broken so we have no idea how much has been used. With the way the landlord built around the tank, we can’t really get in to try and troubleshoot the gauge ourselves. 

We run it at 68 or 70 degrees 24/7, depending on the outside temp and how chilly we feel. Unfortunately, the thermometer on the unit is also broken so sometimes it won’t run at all and lets the room temp drop to the 50’s and other times it continues running well past the set temp and pushes the room temp up into the 80’s. 

We really just have no clue how fast K2 oil burns. Should we be in a hurry to put more oil in? Or does this stuff run super efficiently and will last us a couple weeks longer? It’s not necessarily that we want to push it until the last second but due to having been recently laid off work, we have to plan accordingly for the cost as we’ve learned K2 is the most expensive heating method we’ve had.",Maine,K2 Oil Heater Question

Ive been to the 2 stores in Portland. While Ill keep my opinions to myself I do see a niche that's not being met. 

I do have some questions and would love so me feedback

1) how vibrant is the card gaming community?  A lot of places here now have committed a lot of floor space to gaming

2) What I didn't see a lot of were graded comics. Maybe a handful. Ive been told this isn't really a thing on the east coast

3) Outside of a the big chain store, I didn't see a lot of variants either

4) No one discounts?

I'm trying to take the proper steps to legally purchase a handgun from a licensed dealer. I currently have a medical card that's still valid for a few months. I am acutely aware that weed and firearms is still a huge no no. I'm trying to find out what steps I need to complete in order to be in full compliance with the law.

So far I'm trying the following things:

* Shredded the medical card and took a photo before/after (just in case)

* Stopped any consumption of marijuana

* Removed all marijuana and bongs/etc from my house 

* No dispensary purchases for over a month at this point

With these steps completed and I reasonably safe to proceed with the firearm purchasing process and answer honestly that I'm not a user of an illegal controlled substance?

Would my medical card show up on the background check? What about my doctor medical records regarding the medical card?

Basically if I'm ever asked I want to be able to honestly say I haven't used marijuana, there is none in my house, and that I no longer have access to my medical card to purchase more. 

Am I missing anything? I want to do this the right way regardless of what I think about our current laws.

Thank you all for your time!",Maine,Handgun Purchase and Medical Marijuana

This effort faltered in the legislature and currently does not have a path forward, which, in my opinion, is a shame.

**FAQ's**

*Who is this nerd and why does he care about flags so much?*

Quite simply, flags are a great way to show pride in where you live. In the same way that flying the American flag shows patriotism, flying a state or local flag shows that you are proud to live in your state or city. State and city flags are relatively rare to see in the wild in Maine, except for state and local government buildings, and there's one simple reason for that: The flags themselves stink. But they don't have to. 

*What's wrong with the current flag? It's fine! Leave it alone!*

The current official state flag of Maine is objectively bad in the eyes of people who study flags (vexillologists). It is a ""seal on a bedsheet"", that is, the flag design is essentially the state seal and nothing else. Seals are fine on a letterhead, but flags wave in the breeze, often at a distance. I'm guessing many people in this sub couldn't describe the current Maine flag in detail without looking. What's worse Maine's flag isn't unique -- [Maine is one of over 20 states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories#/media/File:Map_of_the_United_States_with_flags_with_territories_and_DC_final2.png) that use the state seal on a blue banner. If all the state flags were flying on 50 flagpoles all in a row, it would be very difficult to point out which flag was Maine's. One could argue there is no reason to have a flag if it is not identifiable; after all, most of the national flags of the world are easily identifiable from one another.

*What makes a good flag design?*

I'm not going to be able to explain it better than [this brochure](https://nava.org/digital-library/design/GFBF_English.pdf), which I'll plagiarize here. For a deeper dive, [check out this TED talk by Roman Mars](https://www.ted.com/talks/roman_mars_why_city_flags_may_be_the_worst_designed_thing_you_ve_never_noticed?language=en), host of the 99% Invisible podcast. 

1. Keep it simple. The flag should be so simple that a child could draw it from memory.

2. Use meaningful symbolism

3. Use 2-3 basic colors

4. No lettering or seals

5. Be Distictive or Be Related. 

As you may notice, Maine's current flag violates all five of these rules. While the seal does include some symbolism, these symbols are also spelled out using words, rendering the symbolism moot. The US flag doesn't label each star and each stripe, for example, with the names of the states they represent.

The 1901 flag, on the other hand, checks all of these boxes.  A child can draw it from memory; the images are distinct symbols (the green tree symbolizes the state's nickname, the Pine Tree State, and the blue star symbolizes the North Star and the state's motto, Dirigo),  it uses two colors (three if you count the field); there are no letters or seals, and it is distinctive.  

*The current flag is historical. Changing the flag would be erasing history!*

This isn't the case. The state's seal would remain, and would continue to be used on pretty much any other official materials aside from the flag. The current flag (like many similar state flags) was created to mimic a Maine infantry regiment from the Civil War, but is by no means the same flag. 

*I never see the current state flag, so why would I see the new one?*

States and cities with well designed flags tend to fly them more often, often by the citizens themselves. People take pride in a good flag. Chicago is a great example. The Chicago flag is everywhere in Chicago. Play around in [streetview](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.875712,-87.6283567,3a,75y,80.09h,86.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sAGckUOVLhXRpBhQip9Kgmw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) in downtown Chicago and it won't be long before you see a Chicago flag.

Allowing citizens to show pride in where they live is a good thing, and a good flag is the best way to do that.

I hope you'll join me in the effort to get the 1901-inspired flag design adopted at the state level, and in the meantime, I hope you'll join me in flying this design. You can purchase it online or at some retail locations (I'm not here to advertise the stores, you can google them easily enough).

&gt;East Machias Republican Rep. Will Tuell says he has had requests from several constituents to introduce legislation designed to honor first responders, and believes the anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, would be an appropriate day for a holiday.

This is so unimaginative.  

I agree, first responders deserve to be recognized.  But turning September 11th into another ""holiday"" like Arbor Day, Flag Day, or Boss's Day — holidays where everyone works (including first responders) — seems pretty meaningless.  For one thing, 9/11 is already a day where people remember the service and sacrifice of first responders.  And then the idea of a ""9/11 holiday"" just has an ""off"" vibe to it.  ""Hey, what are you doing for 9/11?  Let's go shopping and then have a barbecue!""   

Surely there's another way of showing our gratitude for these people.  A special license plate, a tax write-off, some sort of discount on emergency-related personal equipment — or how about we just make it a point to tell these people how much they are appreciated.

245,drumpfFOREVER,1579205476,epot0i,Nan,"Hello Everyone-
Just a followup to a post I made requesting guidance on Eldercare in Maine. See more here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/dv2ny6/elder_long_term_care_in_maine/

Thank you for the guidance. It was very helpful. 

In December, my father went into intensive care for pneumonia and a mild heart attack. We thought he was done for, but he held on. After 5 days in the hospital he was transferred to a skilled nursing facility (nursing home) for rehab. He was in rehab for 27 days. Then was discharged and is back home. 

So lessons learned about MaineCare and Eldercare in general after this experience: 

1. Don't trust the process. Be aggressive in getting answers and getting copies of paperwork. 
The care manager at EMMC was a trainwreck. She misquoted medicare rules and told us Medicare will not cover skilled nursing rehab. The medicare website clearly states it covers 20 days of rehab and then day 21-100 they will cover 80%. After fighting with her, I finally got a hold of a person at the Eastern Maine Agency on Ageing and they set her straight. Within 10 min of that conversation, the wheels were in motion for long term care. 

2. Eastern Maine Agency on Ageing is amazing. Great resource and was an advocate for me. Can't speak highly enough about them. 

3. Power of Attorney. If you have elderly parents, just go ahead and get a POA with them. Without that, you can't get anyone to talk you. Also get medical POA as well. 

4. Mainecare is stacked against poor people. My parents are dirt poor and living off social security only. No resources and have a 20 year old car as their only asset. The referral process and application process is so overwhelming that I firmly believe the entire goal is to keep needy people from gaining needed assistance. 
I know the conservative viewpoint is to say it is to prevent abuse, but the process is so stacked against poor people that I can see the average person giving up. 
The first thing that was sketchy:  After the first 17 days in rehab my father was recommended for long term care. He was on a high risk fall unit and was not allowed to walk on his own which was barely possible. 
Then within 6 days of this referral, the state sent in a private contractor called MAXIMUS Ascend and they reassessed and determined has not eligible for long term care. That raised my spidey sense but there was nothing I could do. Since they are a contract service, my gut feeling is that they have a vested interest to keep people from being referred. 
Within 24 hours we had to check him out and send him home. My mom is now struggling to take care of him at home and is on a waiting list for a traveling nurse to come to the house. 

The Mainecare application is crazy easy at first. Then comes the tedious part....they want 5+ years of financial records. We literally have turned in thousands of banks statements from 3 different banks. And they keep asking for more. They noticed a check cut to a Realtor for $1200 and then asked for proof this was not for a house. I had to get the realtor who was the property manager for my parents rental to prepare a document stating my parents were renters and the check was for a security deposit. 
Usually people who are at risk, elderly or just poor, don't keep good financial records. My parents did not have bank account information for accounts that were closed 5 years ago. It is not fun trying to get a bank to dig through their records. Wells Fargo was a bitch to work with and still fighting to get records from them. 
Long story short.......the financial disclosure process is overwhelming. I believe the whole process is designed to run people down so they give up. My mom who operates on an 8th grade level and elderly did give up, but luckily I was there to continue the process for her.
Right now, I have no idea of Mainecare will be approved and might be rejected because I can't produce a piece of documentation for something that occurred 5 years ago. Crazy. 

Getting a hold of someone from Mainecare is next to impossible. I spoke with someone yesterday asking for updates and the case manager claimed she had none. Then an hour later, I got a letter from her asking for my kidney and hundreds more documents. Really? 

5. If you suspect your parents will need Mainecare in the next 5 years. Make sure they are keeping good financial records. 

Anyhow, just wanted to vent and share my experiences on this process. It sucks.",Maine,Followup - Longterm care for Elderly and Mainecare

It's right off of Sabattus St. This is not the landlord, but rather the downstairs renter helping look for an ideal candidate for us. Here's the quick rundown:

\- 975/mo 2br1ba. First month and a security deposit equal to first month required.

\- Run by a WONDERFUL older couple. I've been here the entirety of 2019 and plan on being here another year. We've paid on time every time and they've taken care of every need we've had so far. He even brought us cookies on Christmas!

\- Your downstairs neighbors would be my brother and I, 18 and 22 respectively. We keep to ourselves unless we'd get along with you well and then we'd totally hang out. He works at McDonalds and is saving for school/other. I'm a professional poker player who works from home. 

\- Ideally I'm looking for people in our age group. We'd prefer 18-30 but our preferences matter less as we'll be sending you to Dave and Sonia anyway. (The landlords) Don't have a preference on men or women, ideally someone who either gets along with us well or wants to be left alone and doesn't make a ton of noise.

DM me with any questions/interest. I will do my best to answer/share pictures as well as give you contact with the more important people here, our landlords.

I have a trip planned in March to go look at houses, but I would love some insight on to where you guys would reccomend. 

We are looking on the cheaper end, but not so cheap we end up in the ghetto. We have done our research and know to stay clear of Sanford and I've heard Lewiston isn't great either. Auburn seems nice. Also looking at Windham, Gray, Topsham, Brunswick, Saco and even Scarborough if we can afford it. 

But I want to hear from you guys. Where should we move? When we get there, where should we eat? What should we do? We want to embrace Maine and learn and listen to locals.

the title is pretty explanatory. I’m not originally from Maine but I grew up going to Old Orchard Beach and I’ve been living in Portland now for over two years. I love Maine and I don’t want to leave this state at all.

The thing is, I’m getting really sick of Portland itself. It was great in the beginning but rent costs keeps going up, there’s nowhere to park if you work in town (both my boyfriend and I are in the food service industry), luxury condos and hotels are going up on every corner, etc etc. 

I’m just looking for some advice on other areas of Maine to look into maybe moving to. We’re not planning on moving until later this year, but we want to start brainstorming where we might end up now. 

We definitely want to stay on the coast, but I’m not very familiar with a lot of the coastal towns other than Brunswick (I’ve only been there twice) and Rockland (been there once since a friend lives there).  Just genuinely curious on what people will say and I appreciate any and all recommendations from you guys!

Long time lurker here, I absolutely love this subreddit- very valuable resource for information. I figure you guys might be the ones to ask a question I have. 

So me and my girlfriend (both mid 20s) are getting a 20ft yurt in late spring and are moving to southern Maine for my work (federal law enforcement). We are planning to stay in the area for 2-3 years. Because of such a short time being there we were hoping to be able to find a small plot of land to rent from maybe a large farm in exchange for money/help around or a combination of the two. 

We both have knowledge of most farming/livestock practices and would be a benefit to the land- not a liability. I’m a veteran as well and have a “no quit, get it done” attitude. None of our structures are permanent and/or make a permanent mark on the land. 

We are having trouble finding a way to meet up with and talk with local large land owners who might consider this, and are hoping perhaps somebody here can point us in the right direction or might know somebody in that area- Within an hour (preferably) of Kittery Maine/York County

Given other discussions on housing and the new Data school they are building, I wanted to bring to this subreddit a discussion of Micro Apartments.

Micro Apartments are modular spaces that generally range under the standardized sqft requirements NYC housing guidelines set out.  Typically one room in size (excluding bathroom) and under 400 square feet.

This follows an international trend in major cities, like Tokyo.

How do people feel about these - do you think its good or bad?  Do you think it could be a practical solution to deal with the ongoing housing crises by addressing cost of rent for average income residents, and capacity issues in general housing.

465,SeawolfGaming,1580215620,ev55kr,Nan,"On Thursday, we had a very welspoken and nice man from NY spend his hard earned dollars to come to the hearing to speak the facts about this bill and nobody here has said a single thing about it. I'm really surprised because this is a thing we really need in our state. Right to Repair if any of you are uninitiated is a law which if passed gives you the ability to repair your stuff without having to go through the manufacturer and send it off. So say you live in Houlton or somewhere up in the county and own a MacBook and a specialized chip died on the motherboard causing it to die, in our state you would have to drive to portland to the apple store and then have them turn around and tell you that you require a board replacement for the same cost of the machine. Instead of paying less than $50 to get a new chip soldered onto the board at a local business where the buisness pays $5 or less for the part to fix it. You have to waste your time and money going to the Apple store because it's the only thing Apple allows, in the current way without the bill Apple will not sell the chip to the business and the business cannot buy the chip from the chip manufacturer because they can only sell it to apple and so the local buisness can not fix your MacBook. This applies to anything with electronics, from the Radio's used in our Lobstermen's boats, to the industrial John Deer tractors where when a belt breaks you can buy a replacement and put it in but have to have a guy come from the dealership to plug his computer in to tell your tractor it's fixed.

We don't want to get to the point where Cousin Dougie can't come replace the headlight in your car for you and it won't start just because it wasn't replaced by the car manufacturers, or Uncle Jack can't get his boat to start because one of the belts in the engine snapped and he had to replace it and didn't have the engine manufacturer come do it so it just doesn't start and he loses a full day of work and pay over it. 

This is what the bill is for, so companies we buy stuff from can't force us to go through only them and no third party source to get stuff repaired and replaced at an extremely high cost. With how rural most of our state is, and how completely screwed people would be in this state if they couldn't fix their own stuff or have it taken to a local shop I think this bill is in the best interest of every single person in this state. 

I myself am not the best person to give examples for this but below I'll link to a video of the hearing where the man I mentioned above recorded the whole hearing. He has gone around the country to make sure that this passes in any state that wants to push a Right to Repair bill. I'd recommend watching it from when the man (Louis) starts talking at around 44:00 he makes very good points and gives examples. He also has other hearings on his channel from other states such as when he went to Washington and Massachusetts.

I have a Maine driver's license, birth certificate, etc. I still live with my parents in each of their houses in Gray and New Gloucester. What I'm looking to do is have my boyfriend, who has lived in Georgia his whole life, move up to Maine and live at my dad's house with me. I have a general idea of how to do that, but I'm wondering about specifics.

My boyfriend is 22, still lives with his parents, has a 2005 Ford F-150, and is able to prove that he is a resident of Georgia and the United States.

* How would he prove that he's living in Maine? He would be helping with bills, but not paying for them directly so that rules out utility bills as proof. Would he be able to open a bank account and use a statement as proof? What about if somebody just sent him a letter?
* What should we do first? Second? Get him car insurance, register his truck, or convert his license?
* He would still have to do taxes for both Georgia and Maine if he moved up here mid-year and got a job, right?
* What about getting his truck inspected? Would we have some time to get that done (Georgia residents don't have to inspect their vehicles) or would we have to go do it immediately after registering his truck?

If anyone wanted to take the time to explain the steps we should take in order to make him a permanent Maine resident, I would greatly appreciate it. Everything seems so daunting haha. Thank you!",Maine,How would I help my boyfriend move to Maine?

I used to have Fairpoint and could just get Internet no bells and whistles for 42.99 a month no extra fees. When I moved (3 years ago) the only provider we could get in our area was Xfinity. They have slowly raised our prices and continue to make us purchase ""bundles"". Its actually more expensive to just get internet (like 300 dollars). Most recently we had to update our plan and the cheapest they could offer us was Internet + Sports package. We don't even watch sports! It is advertised as 59.99/month but since July it has slowly gotten more expensive, we are up to 96/month now with these stupid fees and taxes. I feel like we are trapped by this company to pay whatever they can milk out of us just to get internet.

Hi /r/Maine \- I am a nearly lifelong Mainer, so I know this state is incredible and I'm hoping to get some help for some folks who desperately need it.

My friends, Fred and Laura Stone, are the owners of Stoneridge Farm in Arundel.  In case you hadn't yet heard on the news, their farm was recently discovered to be contaminated by chemicals called PFAS - per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances - which are known for their ability to not biodegrade in the environment.  These chemicals are sometimes called ""Forever Chemicals"".  This discovery led to the shutdown of their dairy operation, their primary source of income.

To say that this problem has been absolutely devastating to Fred and Laura would be an understatement.  Not only have they lost their primary source of income, but they've also incurred huge costs to install and maintain a water filtration system to filter the water coming into their home.  They also both have experienced numerous health issues recently, with Fred having spent a week in the hospital during Christmas time.

They have tried seeking assistance from state and federal agencies but so far have been repeatedly turned down.  Their local state representative Henry Ingwersen has been trying very hard to get help at the state level, but obviously when things move at the speed of government, who knows when that help will get to them.

I'm coming to you for help, as I just don't know what else to do. There is a GoFundMe page - [https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-this-struggling-dairy-farmer](https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-this-struggling-dairy-farmer) \- that has been set up for them  by their son-in-law if you are able to contribute. Or if you have any other resources, thoughts, prayers, anything, we would be most grateful.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.

TLDR: Please help these kind folks if you are able.  GoFundMe link above.",Maine,Seeking Help for Arundel Dairy Farmers Whose Farm Got Shut Down By PFAS Contamination

Scientists Proclaim, Susan Collins is technology on display. Unable to stand on her own, just a hollow space from chew to chute, Maine woman uses political device to replace her spine.

Moderate most when it matters least.  Always toeing the  company line and asking for permission from the puppeteers.  When it best serves them, they pull the strings taut.  The lips appear to be moving and a far away voice begins to talk.  As long as the puppet doesn't break a string, she will be rewarded with glorious things.  Like a gift of $150,000 from a women in  science group in Hawai'i.  My wife, a Maine scientist, would love to help the cause.  

What's that you say, the women are named Vlad, Alexei, and Sergey.   There is no group? What's in a name?  But that can't be!  Oh, Dear Susan would never betray Maine.  She would surely never deceive us.  

I plead with you friends.  Divert your eyes from the stage.  Susan is taking part in a terrible, poorly scripted play.  Pay no attention to her, the rest of these election days.  

No courage within her.   And no voice to speak.  Hardly a leader.  Mostly just weak.

I frequently snowblow my neighbor's driveways when it gets bad out. I am also the type to give walkers a ride if they want one. We just don't like talking much is all. And we do not believe in any faith or religion (but we have no problem with anyone who does, just don't push your religious agenda on us)

We think we would like Maine because we enjoy the ocean, love saltwater/freshwater/shellfishing, hunting and outdoor activities. Our biggest worry is will our son experience being isolated based on being slightly brown. We don't care about ourselves being isolated, we actually kind of prefer it that way unless you're trying to step on our toes.

We are looking into the Bangor and Augusta area. Possibly the Portland area, but it's expensive and we hate being around lots of people. (We lived by Myrtle Beach, SC for awhile. We hated the local culture and the amount of people during tourist season) 

We are used to the cold and snow. (We live in an area that averages 96"" of snow a year)

Based on what you have read, do you think we would assimilate into Maine easily?",Maine,We're blindly moving to Maine

I could list all the issues, starting with the detriment to the salmon population when they dig under the Kennebec river. The real problem is the lies we are being fed through ads. It takes a lot of research to get to the truth unfortunately. So here is what I have found.

1. CMP is not a Maine company so they do not owe us anything. They have fucked us many times in the past so why wouldn’t they do it again? The influx of money into our economy is nothing compared to what they will make and the difference in the average family’s bill will be about .40 cents. 

2. Janet Mills stands to make millions of dollars in this transaction. Enough said on that.

3. Atlantic salmon are precious to Maine and the building under the Kennebec is disgusting.

4. They say “it will be built along side existing power lines” what they don’t say is they will be clear cutting 75 feet of trees on either side of the lines for approximately 140 miles. They say it will introduce jobs but it’s only temporary, is that really worth it? No.

5. Vote!!!! You must get out and vote!!! Please please get out and vote local, not only on this but on everything. Local government is the last bastion of American freedom.

Bloomberg is trying to spend larger amounts of Money is Maine in order to hurt the other candidates. He has spent $446,000 on T.V. ads and online adds on sites like YouTube, Facebook, and Google. He has expended more funds than any other candidate on online adds alone. Tom Steyer (another billionaire) spends the second most at $34k and Bernie spends third at $24k. Bloomberg is trying to take advantage of Mainers who are less politically active by flooding their homes with ads. This is an issue because it leads to many low information voters being exposed primarily to Bloomberg when they may not know who else is on the ballot. Bloomberg's goal is to convince low information voters into casting their ballot for him due to sheer name recognition while they likely know little about any other candidate.

The goal of this post is to warn fellow Mainers about Bloomberg's manipulative campaign strategy. If you know anyone who plans to support Bloomberg I urge you to talk to them about his campaign and what his candidacy would mean for Mainers.",Maine,A warning about Bloomberg for Mainers

935,ThinkFact,1582658596,f9fjif,Nan,"The current question is: ""repeal Legislative Document 798, which was designed to eliminate religious and philosophical exemptions from vaccination requirements for K-12 and college students and employees of healthcare facilities, and reinstate the law allowing for religious and philosophical exemptions from vaccination requirements.""

What's peculiar about this whole situation is the campaign for yes on 1 has essentially made this whole argument about standing up to Big Pharma.  There has not been that much of an exploration into the impact on rights this will actually have in their camp.

First of all, attending public schools, colleges, and working at healthcare facilities are not mandatory.  Homeschooling is an option, and the person who chooses not to vaccinate themselves does not have to work at a hospital if they are genuinely as passionate about their position on remaining unvaccinated as they claim to be.

The yes on 1 campaign has also actively refused correcting the fulse notion that no on 1 advocates want to force people to be vaccinated in general.  One doesn't have to go far on Facebook to encounter this.  People should be concerned by a group that benefits so much by being disingenuous.

That being said, what these people are essentially trying to do is make it the equivalent of discrimination, essentially illegal, to have these people prevented from being able to attend or work at these public spaces, spaces which are full of individuals who may very be carrying diseases as well as those well who are particularly susceptible to dangerous diseases.

Beyond the fact that a number of vaccinations are not 100% effective, often in the high 90s percentile range.
These are places that often have individuals that are immune compromised, be that from cancer, genetic issues, suppressive medication, and so on.  To vote yes, someone also restricts these people from being able to say no, beyond the rest of us.  Essentially you force people who do not have a choice over vaccination to remove themselves from situations over the people who choose not to vaccinate themselves for ""philosophical and religious reasons.""

It should not be discrimination to want to protect yourself and your family from viruses in these 3 spaces.

Just a few years ago Maine had a new case of measles, a school-age child who had been attending school while sick with it.  That is scary, and we are fortunate that no one else goy sick, but you can't always expect that.

Beyond measles, Maine is about eight times above the national average in terms of cases of whooping cough.  That stuff spreads, and could you imagine having an unvaccinated healthcare worker managing your child and it being considered discrimination to push for them to not be working there.  It's not like health care workers are just going to open up about themselves being vaccinated or not right once they start talking to a patient.  These are places that you expect the employees to be safe to be around.  not only are those workers particularly susceptible, but before symptoms become a notable and convenience they could spread it.

To vote yes on 1 is to restrict everybody's ability to say no in order to not inconvenience unvaccinated individuals.  That's what this is.

It's no surprise they keep framing this around the pharmaceutical companies.

First of all, yes we all know they all often do sucky things.  But don't punish the rest of us because again, unvaccinated people don't want to be inconvenienced.

Secondly, pharmaceutical companies will still be profiting off of people getting sick, and arguably that's a better way to make money.   The idea that this is going to be some sort of meaningful blow is unfounded.  Pharmaceutical companies do sketchy things all the time, so do police officers, but if there's a problem I'm still going to have to rely on them either way.

Pharmaceutical companies are still going to make money off of people getting sick from measles, whooping cough, and so on.  And with the increased rate occurrence of particular viruses, they're going to be making money off that.

The Corona virus should be a prime example of the dangers of having a massive population with no immunity to a contagious virus.  You would be fooling yourself if you don't think pharmaceutical companies wouldn't profit off of an epidemic...

There are a lot of things that could be brought up, one notable one being universities often have a large student body made up of international students, and to create loopholes seems ridiculous.

During a time when where we have people vaccinating less and less, it should be all the more important to protect schools, universities, and hospitals.  No one 1 protects you rights to protect yourself and your family in these three areas.  Yes on 1 makes it discrimination to restrict unvaccinated people from being in spaces they do not actually have to be in because they personally chose not to be vaccinated.",Maine,No on 1 does more to protect your rights.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a physician practicing in Maine, and I urge everyone to vote  No on 1 this Tuesday. The medical community overwhelmingly supports vaccinations, and for good reason. It's not because we are ""in bed"" with the pharmaceutical industry. It's because we are trained to think objectively and critically, because we are the front lines of illness, and because we know that few things in medicine have as large a benefit-to-risk-ratio as vaccines. Vaccines are our ally, not our enemy.  It takes a special kind of arrogance and selfish privilege to forsake medical advances people in other parts of the world wish they had access to, to reject the advances our recent ancestors would have loved to have had.  For the sake of my patients and the health of all Mainers, I have been appalled by the unfounded and irrational arguments I've heard against vaccinations, so I've chosen to address some of them here:  


Argument 1: ""Vaccines are just a way for Big Pharma to profit."" I have been seeing a lot of these “Yes on 1. Reject Big Pharma” signs.  I’d like to point out how misleading those signs are. From a numbers  standpoint alone, vaccines are extremely [cheap](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/index.html). On the other hand, the medical costs associated with getting one of the diseases vaccines help prevent range in the [hundreds](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/6/18-0339_article), [often thousands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1184075/), and sometimes [tens of thousands of dollars](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6809a3.htm). If you really want to “reject big  pharma,” get your vaccines and don't get sick!

Argument 2: ""I  can still get the disease if I get vaccinated, so what's the point.""  I've seen this argument in Op-Eds recently, citing cases in Maine where  people got diseases despite getting vaccinated. As with any vaccination,  you can still get the disease, but your risk is much lower. However, if  you get the vaccine, your body will naturally make it's own antibodies to those diseases so, if you do end up getting the disease, it would almost certainly be less severe, and less contagious to loved ones around you.  


Argument 3: ""Vaccines are dangerous."" [Vaccines are about as safe as they come](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/1201/p2113.html).  It is far more dangerous to drive to the doctor than to get a vaccine.  What is truly dangerous is irrational fear based on emotion rather than objective evidence. 25 years after Andrew Wakefield published a [fraudulent paper linking MMR vaccine to autism](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17057990/andrew-wakefield-vaccines-autism-study)  (he was subsequently sent to prison for making it all up), after the data before and since then has proven there's no link, there remains a deep, pervasive, internet-fueled fear of vaccines. The evidence is rock-solid; vaccines are overwhelmingly safe.   


Argument 4: ""Medical Freedom."" It's ironic that it has taken [medical science 200 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqUFy-t4MlQ)  to advance to the point where people are so healthy and living so long that they can deny science and medicine is what got us here. It's also ironic that, as we are having this debate here in Maine, a brand new virus (COVID-19) is spreading throughout the world. It is the medical professionals and institutions to whom we will all turn (for treatment AND for prevention/vaccination) if and when we have an outbreak, whether it's Coronavirus, Measles or Pertussis. If an outbreak does occur,  whether it's a completely new virus, or one that had previously been eradicated by vaccines, I believe we'll be having a very different discussion of ""medical freedom"" when the hospitals are full and the medical supply chains run dry. In the meantime, let's all agree to do what we can, as an interconnected human community, to protect ourselves and each other. Please vote No on 1.

&amp;#x200B;

(Oh, and as an aside, stop buying up all the N95 masks in the state! They are not effective at preventing the general public from catching Coronavirus, but if healthcare workers can't get them, we're going to have a difficult time taking care of you if you do get sick!)",Maine,My opinion on Question 1.
1013,neurotic_aquatic,1583095572,fc0cij,Nan,"Hey, so here's my story:

I don't have any consumer debt but the car. I bought it new for 20k, knowing that ""new"" is not always the best financial plan but I wanted it, and my plan was to keep it 10-15 years til I run it into the ground. Today it is 3 years old, still in great condition, with only 20k miles. (I barely drive!) I owe 7k left on the loan, and like I said, I planned to pay it off and just keep it forever.

Well... now I'm having to relocate across the country for a new job. I live in the south in a metro city where a sedan is great. New job is in southern Maine, sedan probably not so great.  I'm planning to move this summer, but concerned about my little sedan and how it will fare the winters. My family keeps telling me I should sell it and buy a new SUV/Subaru or w/e to be prepared for the new climate. But the last thing I want is another 20k car loan. If I sell the sedan now its worth atleast 7-10k. But buying something new or even a used SUV can be pricey. Also my spouse has an old cargo van with \~150k miles.. we thought maybe we'd drive that up north for the move but I'm concerned it's seen better days and might not be super safe. Though of course we'd have it serviced before the drive.

Should I.... 

A) Keep the car and get snow tires (and pay atleast $1000 to ship it across the country, leading to now a $8000 debt to the car)

B) Sell it before the move and buy a new SUV to drive up there 

C) Sell the car here, and just live with 1 shitty vehicle for the time being, and buy a new vehicle when we get to Maine? 

D) Other ideas??

&amp;#x200B;

1021,THORICisBAD,1583107458,fc386u,Nan,"My mother Is a nurse practitioner here in Maine. This story is especially important to me because I had a really bad case of pertussis that had me out of school for three months, all because a large amount of the students at my school weren’t vaccinated. I asked her to write a price about why you should vote No on 1, so here it is. 

I would encourage everyone to vote no on one on Tuesday. There is a lot of information out there from the yes side that I believe is clouding the picture. The vaccines that will be required to attend school are basic vaccinations generally accepted by the national medical community as being necessary for public health. We are losing our herd immunity in Maine. This is most evident in the rise of pertussis infection over the past year. The pertussis vaccine requires a booster at around 12 years of age and once more as an adult. There are areas in our state where herd immunity is well below accepted thresholds. Our state saw the highest numbers of pertussis infections over the past year in these areas. The yes voters will point to this and say “but many of those children were vaccinated!” Yes. They were. Pertussis was able to spread in these areas because of the decrease in herd immunity. So when people argue that they should be allowed to make decisions about their children’s health care I do not disagree. However, opting out of vaccinations endangers those unable to be vaccinated or at high risk for complications. If you choose not to vaccinate then you should not be allowed to risk the health of those that spend so much time with your children. No one is taking that choice away from parents. You will still be able to choose not to vaccinate. The only thing that will change is your ability to send your unvaccinated child to public school. The parents and staff of our public schools have the right to expect their children not be exposed to vaccine preventable illnesses at school.",Maine,Vote no on 1

My wife and I have two vehicles but only one EZPass transponder. Most of the time we only need the one transponder as neither of us uses the turnpike every day, but there are occasionally times where we're both driving on the turnpike.  I know that if I go through the EZPass lane and don't have the transponder in my car, the system will scan my license plate and do the proper deduction from my account.  I've done it a couple times accidentally.

Is it okay to do this regularly or will they give me some sort of trouble for doing it?  I know I COULD get another transponder but I'd rather not have to pay to get another one and be forced to put $40 on it every time it needs to be replenished.  $20 always covers both of us for at least a month of usage.

in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

1218,LittleStoriesPodcast,1583955837,fh314v,Nan,"This week, Little Stories Podcast (hosted by two native Mainers) has a special edition episode covering the alleged cult saga in St. Agatha, Maine. 

Since airing our episode about a the tiny town, something... happened. 

People caught on we’d covered the story, and those people wanted to be heard. So we talked to them to hear the story from the perspectives of the people who are in it -- St. Agatha’s town manager Aubrie Michaud, and #CULTure leader, Gary “GD” Blankenship himself. 

We ask them questions you want answered: What actually happened in that house? How do the residents of St. Agatha really feel about this newcomer? And is GD Blankenship actually the leader of a cult, or just trying to spread a unifying message?

Here is the story of St. Agatha, a battle over a house from the Civil War, and the rumors that are still swirling about #CULTure and GD Blankenship.

 I just got off the phone with them regarding the ""Contract Renewal Notice"" I git from them in the mail. It goes on to state that my contract with them will expire on or around my meter reading date of Apr 27, and that they ""would be happy to help me renew at a fixed rate of 10.99 cents per kWh for 12 mos."", and that my ""contract will automatically renew unless we hear from you"".

  This prompted me to review other supplier rates where I found C.N. Brown's offer ofa fixed 6.7 cents per kWh for 9 mos. and upon signing up with them, they told me that they are required to forward my info to CMP and that CMP will cancel me with ElectricityMaine and move me to C.N. Brown and that no further action was required on my part.

 I thought I'd call E.M. as they said that was required, or else they would auto-renew me. The rep then tells me, ""Oh, that 10.99 cents isn't the lowest rate we can offer you. We can give you an 8.?? cents per kWh rate"".  This is where she asked why I'm switching and I told her it was due to their higher rates AND DECEPTIVE PRACTICES. She proceeds to try to confuse me with complicated explanations but could not answer me when I asked her why they told me I could auto-renew at 10.99 cents when they have a better rate...

 I suspected they've been deceptive for a while now, quoting rates to get customers on board then raising (never lowering) them, and threatening their $100 fee for early cancellation...

I work selling wholesale to restaurants in the area, from York to Portland, Kennebunkport to Arundel. Like many people around the world, we are watching what is going on with the Coronavirus. With the latest news coming in that several states around the country have forcibly closed restaurants and bars within their states, one of which being Massachusetts, it makes us wonder how long before Maine becomes another to do so.
That being said, should restaurants be closed, I, along with thousands of others would be affected. Without restaurants we wouldn't have the business to stay open. 
I know it would be temporary but there would be thousands who wouldn't be able to make money. I know it sounds ridiculous given it would be done for our safety, but safety doesn't fill the oil tank, nor does it keep power in the lines, or keep food on the table. I can only speak for myself, but I know it would cripple my life more than the virus would. I feel like there are alot of others in the same boat.
As far as I know this hasn't been brought up in the state, and this is all just hypothetical for the time being, but I think it's going to become a reality that many are going to have to face sooner rather than later. 
I know there's alot of teachers living this reality right now, and while there are many who are on salary, there are just as many hourly school employees who are also out for the time being.
Has anyone heard if the state would compensate workers for any time lost, or would we just have to flounder until things can get back to normal? Would we be able to collect unemployment?
I wish everyone here a happy and healthy good day! We will make it through this and come out stronger on the other side! We are Mainers, and we will survive!",Maine,Quick question about what happens next...

Portland’s city manager announced an emergency curfew on Monday, saying all establishments where groups gather must close all day on Tuesday and between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m. the rest of the week in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The mandatory evening shut-down comes a day before St. Patrick’s Day, when thousands of bar-goers and revelers have traditionally packed city bars and restaurants from morning until late at night.

“The city is also strongly recommending all restaurants close to dine-in customers, or dramatically limit the number of customers, and provide takeout or delivery options only for the foreseeable future,” the city’s announcement says. “While this is the preferable option, the city understands that some restaurants may not be set up to do so. Additionally, the city recommends that all gyms and fitness studios close.”

The powers invoked by city manager Jon Jennings are supported by the city charter, which grants Jennings the power to declare an emergency in all or parts of the city to “whenever a  
disaster or civil emergency exists or appears imminent.”

The emergency declaration expires in five days, but the city council may vote to extend it, according to the charter.

Under the charter, Jennings has broad power to implement regulations prohibiting or restricting the movement of vehicles and people in all or parts of the city and to call on state government or other municipalities for assistance and to access supplies or other vital materials to protect the health, life and property of residents.

The measures are designed to curb community transmission of COVID-19, which is moving through communities in Cumberland County. So far, the state has 17 confirmed or likely cases.

I want to start harvesting shellfish. I live near Brunswick and am hoping you all can provide me with some help. What I am trying to figure out is:

* Do I need a permit and where can I get the permit to harvest all types of shellfish (e.g. mussels, clams, etc.)?
* What gear would I need to get started?
* What are some good locations to do so?
* What time of year can I harvest?
* I am assuming I would need to go at low-tide, correct?
* Are there any clubs or group in my area that are focused on shellfish harvesting?

I know this is a time of chaos worrying about our own health, worrying about health of our loved ones and dealing with the great disruption of normalcy in our daily lives. Please be sure to take extra care of yourselves. Many of us are out of work and are worried about finances over food, supplies and especially, paying for a roof over our heads. COVID-19 is causing a financial hardship for hundreds of people. One landlord in South Portland is not collecting rent for all of April, giving tenants a much needed break during this rough time. Other rental companies should follow his way. Rent should be suspended for everyone to take care of themselves, their loved ones and their community. Although this situation is mostly out of control, please consider signing this petition to bring attention to Governor Mills to suspend rent for two months in Maine.

10%-15% hospitalization rate =\~ 140,000 hospital beds needed (we have 218 ventilators in the entire state)

4%-8% mortality rate = 56,000 - 112,000 dead (\~ the population of Portland)

That's  why mass testing now and isolating people with the virus (with AND  without symptoms) would be the best response to slow the rate of   growth.   Because we don't have enough tests available, the best would   be to isolate everybody until the tests become available.

If  we don't control the spread, the full power of the state will be  attempting to control us.  It wasn't just authoritarian China-- Italy,  France, and Germany are completely locked down.

Be warned that Clynk Recycle is either fraught with incompetence or theft. You are much much better of going directly to a redemption center or store. You will get back so much more money at the same amount of effort. 

On multiple occasions, I have been ripped off when using Clynk to redeem my recyclables. Once, an entire bag was not credited. I often fill my bags with 100 items each, as I crush the cans and bottles and have only received about 10% of what I would have received if I had redeemed them on my own.

Honestly, Clynk is not a novel idea. It is just as easy almost to do it yourself and if you are making anywhere from 90-40% more depending on how short changed your bags are getting, it is totally worth it.

I do, both as an individual, and as a small business owner.  The data on health outcomes is pretty unambiguous.  If we could remove economic outcomes from the equation, and know that everyone would be provided for, then, IMO, it would be a no brainer to shut down all non-essential work. 

From a small business standpoint, I need the paycheck and the guys working for me do as well.  But it is extremely difficult in this environment to set up jobs, budget for jobs, get material on site, and create provisions to keep my guys and our clients safe.  The likelihood that there will be an eventual shutdown is hanging over the business and making all of the small decisions that go into making any particular job profitable extremely occluded.  I could elaborate, but I don't want to bore.  If we are going to shut down (and looking at the map it seems an inevitability, right?)  then as a business owner I think it needs to be **now.**

Finally, how to make this happen.  Renters--legitimately--are calling for a rent strike.  Small landlords fear they might not be able to pay the mortgage.  The only way to actually ensure that everyone can stay home and not lose their home is a **rent + mortgage strike**.",Maine,Shelter in Place for Maine

My grandfather is staying with us, and we've been playing lots of board games, cards, as well as reminiscing through old photo albums and camcorder videos to pass the time.

Throughout it all though, my grandpa has expressed just how much he loved his old Polaroid SX-70 camera and the memories he associated with it. His photo books are filled with Polaroids taken from the early seventies through the nineties. It brings me so much joy to see the sparkle in his eye as he browses through his wedding photos and pictures of my mom and aunt as kids. Unfortunately, he no longer has the camera, but man, he must've been attached to that thing back in the day. 

I'd love to get him a new one for his 80th birthday next month now that we're in the same house and especially because this virus has got me worried. I have explored multiple websites for the best deals and best conditions, which led me to a Craiglist listing in Camden, Maine. Not only does this fit my budget, but it also comes with three packs of film and includes a sleek leather case and has tripod mounting capabilities. In other words, it's perfect. 

Unfortunately I live in Texas, and I've emailed the seller about shipping it but he wants me to send him cash in the mail which is a huge risk for me.

My wife and I are currently self-quarantining in Connecticut to avoid catching coronavirus or spreading it to anyone else.  Although I am still working remotely, we have a fair amount more free time due to not having to commute.  One of the ways we are staying positive is by talking about what we want to do at whatever time in the future traveling is okay and we can get to Maine again (we will not be coming to Maine until it is absolutely clear that it's safe for us and anyone who lives where we would be visiting).  Last fall, we camped on a hill outside of Camden, Maine, and it was one of the best traveling experiences we have ever had.  Thinking about that experience is something that keeps both of us going right now when things are so difficult and we can't go anywhere.  Along the lines of looking forward to camping in Maine in the future, my wife and I have been trying to find somewhere in Maine where we might be able to camp in an ocean cove.  Is anyone aware of a camp ground or hip camp or other place we could do this?  We are very conscious of leaving spaces better than we found them and enjoy peace and quiet while camping.

My husband and I have run a goat dairy for the last ten years. We started and grew the business, Flying Goat Farm, in Acton, ME and at the end of 2019, we moved to New Gloucester.  We bought an old run down cow dairy that hadn’t been in production since the 80’s and have been renovating it and building out our new facility since last August. 

Historically, our clientele has been primarily restaurants, though we were founding members of the Sanford Farmers’ Market and participated in several other York county farmers’ markets over the years. 

We are trying to figure out how we can keep our business afloat and help feed our local community through this public health crisis. We have watched over the last two weeks and our clients and friends have gone from take out only, to completely closed. Farmers’ markets are also up in the air to the best of my knowledge. 

This post is me widening the question- is there interest in home delivery dairy. We are looking at a weekly delivery of 1/2 gallon milk, half pound of cheese and 16oz of yogurt for around $25. We are likely to be able to do this for 100-150 households a week once we finish kidding and are in full swing, probably May. We would be doing all online payment systems, and likely very very early morning delivery.

1819,otakugrey,1585812442,fti0ce,Nan,"Two months ago everyone at my cafeteria job got laid off. We were told to all apply for unemployment and we did. Everyone got it except for me. When I applied to showed me a page saying there's a problem that needs investigating and I have to call them. They told me to call them at 1-800-593-7660 and that is what I have been trying to do. They are only open from 8AM to 12:30PM. What's supposed to happen is that a prerecorded voice menu asks you questions and ask you to type your SS number and then is supposed to hand you over to a human. If you call them during the time they are supposed to be open here's what will actually happen instead:


* Option 1: A male voice picks up and tells you everyone is busy, and then a female voice asks you if you want to hear it again.
* Option 2: A beep tone repeats forever.
* Option 3: Nothing. The call goes through. It picks up and no sound comes out.
* Option 4: The voice menu that *should* be there picks up, but it's spluttering like a CD that's scratched and skipping, and then it hangs up on you.
* Option 5: The voice menu actually does work! It asks you questions and then makes you type out your SS number, says it's about to hand you off to a human, and then hangs up on you.


Now, this is all entirely random. It's not like it does one option sometimes and a different option other times. It's 100% a dice roll for every call. I know this because I've been calling them every day. Starting at 7:59AM I pick up the phone and dial them. I get one of the above options and call again every 5 minutes. I call them every 5 minutes from 8AM to 12:30PM every day and have been doing so for two weeks. (Now that I'm jobless and stuck inside it's not like I don't have free time!) I have not been spoken to by a human once. They are with withholding the unemployment money that all my other co-workers have already gotten, and my rent is past due. They want me to call them, but they're not making it possible for me to do so. I'm pretty tired of being hung up on by robots. And move over I'm sure I can't be the only guy in this boat. What other numbers can we contact them from?",Maine,Is there any OTHER way to phone the Maine Department of Labor?

1826,maineranon,1585846397,ftpu59,Question,"FYI, I am not going to be 100% open about my situation, as Maine is a small world, and I need to be cautious.

I have been deemed essential.  Imagine the Office, but we’re not selling paper.

Our small office is open, allowing customers in 1 at a time, employees are practicing social distancing, and avoiding time in office common areas.  They appear to be following the rules/laws as they change.

I am in sales and have a work laptop with 100% access to everything an in office worker has.  Additionally, I have a work cellphone that the office can transfer calls to.  Part of the job is working outside of the office, this is why I have a laptop.  Everything that I do, and that my coworkers do, can 100% be done by phone, internet, or mail.

I have requested to work from home due to COVID-19 risk, stress and anxiety related to this, as well as a dependent living in my home who is in the high risk category due to an autoimmune disease.  I was also very clear, stating that I do not feel safe in the office, and that I fear for my and my coworker’s health.

Management decided that I am not allowed to work from home, as a majority of their employees cannot work from home as they are not technologically equipped to.   They need to be fair.
I was directed to take my vacation time until, that time is exhausted, or until I am ready to return to work.

It is the beginning of the year and we are on an earned Paid Time Off system.  I have only earned a week...  My PTO has be exhausted, and it is now time to return to work, or discuss alternatives.

At this time correspondence with my employer is getting very official, and I feel that they are not going to offer me an alternative.

I am an employee that has always met goals, never had a bad review, only minor misunderstandings here and there.

I need to know my rights.  

I have called Government departments, Representatives that I know, read through COVID-19 material from the state.  I cannot find any resources for an EMPLOYEE.

I have also reached out to a lawyer that echoed my conversations with State Reps.
No one knows what the fuck to do.  It is very unclear right now.  He said that I appear to be on the right side of this, and that I would have a case if fired.  I’d also have a case if this wasn’t Pandemic related.  But he told me that I do not want to quit.  “DO NOT QUIT!”

What are my rights?  
Is anyone else fighting this fight?
Are any government employees reading this?

PS

Upon entering my car at the end of the day I sanitize my hands with hand sanitizer and lysol the typical spots (steering wheel, stick, etc.)

Upon entering our home I immediately disinfect my boots, strip down and throw the clothes directly in the wash, and hit the shower. 

It may seem a bit extreme but our youngest has had some serious go around with pneumonia due to is weak immune system. I've already seen him on a ventilator once, don't want to go through that again.

Cheese, from which i put my mouth on and try to breathe from. However, that straw is in her vaginal hole, and as for every atom of oxygen i intake, a liter of her pussy juices pour into my mouth. As I shove my way from under her soul crushing thighs, I gasp for the air I so desperately need. She stares down at me with a smug look, saying ""Are you tired? We've only just started"". She pound my face in with her dirty, worn out foot, which she violently presses into my submissive face. I take a hard lick of each individual toe, sucking out all the dirt collected from god knows where. After both of her feet are licked spotless, she holds me down, and crushes my neck with her immensely muscular thighs. I struggle to breath, and I even achieve a point of utter hallucination. As I begin to realize I am horridly close from perishing from asphyxiation, my penis explodes with semen, as if a volcano erupting, yet instead of lava hot, sticky cum poured from my worn out penis.

She lost her job before the pandemic. She tried to find work but couldn't. She's now 5 weeks behind on her car payment and her bank has threatened repossession but not yet sent the 14-day notice. She's paid April rent but will not have money for May rent.

The way she lost her job is unusual and probably relevant to how laws apply. Sequence of events:

* She was employed.
* She found a better job and gave 2 weeks notice at her old job.
* Before her start date at the new job:
   * Her old employer hired a replacement employee.
   * The new employer retracted the job offer and gave that job back to their previous employee.
   * My friend was thus out of a job but had left ""of her own free will"".
* She looked for work diligently but didn't find another job.
* The pandemic hit, and now her chances of finding anything are next to zero.

Several questions:

* Have there been any changes to repossession/eviction law in ME due to the pandemic?
* Are there any such changes on the horizon?
* How likely is it that Knox County sheriff's would assist with evictions during the pandemic?
* Does my friend have any recourse in terms of getting unemployment benefits?

Definition:  A Mainer is someone that was born in the state of Maine.  Period. No exceptions.

I can never be a Mainer because of this accident if birth.  I admire and have a great deal of respect for mainers and the people that live in Maine that are ""from away'.

I think there should be a maine apprenticeship program with very rigorous set of criterion, to allow Non-Mainers to assimilate into Maine life.  

For people like myself that would eventually like to live in Maine but can never never never be Mainers.

This is a partial list of ideas  generated  during ice fishing, from folks in the neighboring ice shacks

1)go Fiddle head-hunting
2)Berry picking
3)Heat your house for the winter with wood
4)Visit lighthouses
5)use the word ""Upta"" in a sentence correctly.
6) go for a Jeep ride.  Off road.  
7) Ride shotgun with someone that is plowing snow with a truck.  Bonus if you run the plow controls
8) Hike to certain elevation (TBD) anywhere in Maine.
9) Visit Baxter state park
10) Hike to chimney pond
11) Gut a deer
12) Drive a snow machine. That's a snowmobile for you folks from away.  
13) Try Dr. McGillicuddy's, Allen's coffee Brandy, fireball or Screwball peanut butter whiskey
14) grow a beard.  This is primarily for men but not exclusively.  
15) you must live in the state of Maine for at least 10 years.   12 years if you move from Massachusetts.  8 years if you move from Texas or Alaska.
16). You must be recommended &amp; vouched for, by a Mainer
17) something with chainsaws.  evidently Stihl and Husqvarna are the Maine chainsaws of choice.   Be safe
18) go to mardens.  Many times

This list is just a start.  if we get a huge list perhaps we have some sort of weighted scoring system.   one would not have to do everything on the list but just pick the ones that they're able to do to get to a certain point value.  

I'd like to hear what people think of this idea. Especially Mainers

I'm not thrilled with the name either

Not funny or inspiring

The stream in reality has not legal or official designation, it's just called that by people from there. So it's not in google maps, we've been trying to find it in google earth by eye, but the lakes huge so it's not really feasible. Does anyone know what we're talking about?",Maine,"Does anyone know where the mouth of Morrill Stream is, or leads to, on Great Pond in Belgrade?"

1940,smurphyemt18,1586261450,fwjfdn,Nan,"Need a little friendly input. My family and I are moving to Maine next summer, and are trying to narrow down an area. We like the proximity to Acadia, and are debating Blue Hill or Ellsworth. We are absolutely not opposed to small towns, however, we do have two young children so good schools are a must. My wife and I are both RNs, so not too concerned about finding work. I’d like to know a bit more about property taxes in the area, and if folks are welcoming to people from out of state. We’re looking to settle down and enjoy life. We’re pretty low key, quiet, keep to ourselves kind of people. Also, any tips on some sweet fishing holes and hunting spots would be great ;)

Thanks everyone.",Maine,Moving to Maine

Approaching the Elm plaza location you might find two employees wiping carts down with Lysol tissues as you enter. GREAT! But... why are they standing 2 feet apart and halfway blocking the entryway? You can't help but breathe their breath while entering. Inside, not one employee is using any kind of protection, no gloves, no masks, no distancing. It felt bizarro.

I learned all this because their ToGo grocery pickup service (only available at the JFK plaza) is bunk AF. Effectively they offer around 6 daily slots for grocery pickup, but on calling to troubleshoot the phone was answered, strangely, by the very attendant responsible for grabbing customer groceries! They didn't know when their online shopping system reset when the slots were available for new orders. This effectively translates into waiting up past midnight and trying to submit an order. After day 4 of none of these lamentably few slots being continuously unavailable, we reluctantly masked up and headed in to the Elm Plaza location.

There is definitely an air of ""Virus? What virus?"" I hope others will add onto this thread to provide some insight for others trying to get their basic necessities.",Maine,Maine Supermarkets not being super. Please add your experience to inform others.
