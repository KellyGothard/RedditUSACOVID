I fully qualify for the Oklahoma aerospace engineering tax credit, which is $5000 a year for 5 years. A coworker said that if you claim that credit, you're very likely to be audited.

The credit itself doesn't scare me, but I accidently claimed myself a student for 5 years when the max is supposed to be 4. So if I get audited, in afraid they'll catch that.

So, others who have claimed this credit, were you audited after claiming it? And what are the odds someone will get audited when claiming this credit?

TL:DR - I want to claim the 5k tax credit I qualify for but am afraid of being audited for unrelated reasons. What are the odds of being audited if this credit is claimed?",oklahoma,What are the odds of getting audited when claiming the Oklahoma engineering tax credit?

Don’t trespass on others property while drunk shooting off guns and fireworks. You’ll be in for a rough time. 

Normally gunshots are normal at midnight here. Fireworks too. 

However, this evening I was on the porch enjoying a cigarette when I heard a gunshot that was too close. And saw a muzzle flash in my field across from me. Retrieved my glock and drove up to see what was going on. I drove because I’m not about to sneak up on people that are armed on my property. 

First, they scattered. Then when they realized I parked behind them, and was waiting by their truck, they approached. I asked them what they were doing on my property, armed, and who the hell they were. 

Turned out to be some 40 something guys and their sons. They lived in town and apparently knew my neighbors (who were not present). 

Turned out they had been shooting at my pond which was directly between me and them. I have two small kids. And two older parents living with me. Any of us could have been hit by rifle fire. 

I was livid, but rather than spoil their new year by calling the sheriffs office I ripped them a new one about trespassing and gun safety.",oklahoma,Just a warning in this happy new year.

* Drive from Dallas to Chickasaw Recreation Area
* Lunch in/around Sulphur
* Stay in Tulsa (any hotel or area recommendations?)
* Visit The Gathering Place
* Maybe: Woolrac/Pawhuska 

It's a short trip (one night in Tulsa) and we'll be traveling with a 4-month old baby. So my questions are:

* Knowing that our round trip route is Dallas to Tulsa are there any scenic drives you'd recommend?
* Any must-visit restaurants? My husband is Danish and we live in Copenhagen, so the more local/authentic—the better! (must be baby friendly or at least acceptable to bring a baby to, he's too young to really make a mess or cause a ruckus)
* Anything I might be missing? Are we packing our trip too tight? Should I choose a different itinerary or detour? 

About us: We love good food, breweries, nature over museums (unless it's a history museum, e.g. Tulsa Historical Society &amp; Museum), and are pretty mobile with our little one (will baby carry and bring him into restaurants so long as it's not a nuisance to other guests).

1) Pay attention and don't drive like and asshole.

2) use hands free or stay off of your phone.

2) a turn signal is to give notice of the intention to change lanes, not as you are already halfway in the lane after cutting someone off. I don't know how many times I observe this on a daily basis.

3) I know there is construction going on but as for as I can tell, they do not rearrange the lanes overnight and never have. The far right lane still takes you to 44, the others continue on down Broadway Ext. Get in the appropriate lane at least a mile before the interchange. Don't be that person that cuts across from the far left lane as fast as possible as we approach the last quarter of a mile to the interchange, cutting off multiple people and nearly causing multiple accidents in the process. the construction sucks, don't make it worse by driving like that.

5) When people are trying to merge onto Broadway, don't speed up just to keep them from getting in front of you. We'll all get there, a little courtesy actually makes traffic flow smoother.

6) Finally, see tip #1",oklahoma,A few pro tips for Broadway Ext. commuters

123,123,Sadmiral_Snackbar,1578705099,en0gte,Nan,"Just had the most mild road rage experience of my life.  I was on a four lane road (two lanes running each running east and west) in the outside lane pulling up to a stoplight about 40-50 yards ahead of me and traveling around 30-35mph while gradually slowing down and getting ready to start the brakes.  I was driving past a pickup in the inside lane who had about 4 car lengths between him and the car in front of him.  

I didn't think anything of it but right as I was about to pass him a car that I didn't see (because the truck was blocking our view of each other's vehicles) pulled right out in front of me to make a turn into the gas station.  I braked immediately and it was a fairly close call, although there most likely would not have been any serious injuries due to the slower rate of speed we were both traveling.  As the truck slowly pulled forward and closed the gap in car lengths, I rolled down my windows and threw my hands up while saying ""what the hell?""

He stopped slightly ahead of me and the passenger window rolled down.  So, I pulled forward to confront him.  As I pulled up, I said ""pretty dangerous, man"" and he said ""yeah.  What were you saying to me?""  

""I said what the hell, man.  I almost hit that car."" 

And then he replies, ""So, that would have been your fault.""

I started shaking my head and then looked forward as he said, ""Don't be looking over at me like that.""

And I said, ""Just keep driving man"" and that was the end of it.",oklahoma,Let's complain about Oklahoma drivers!

The Bible program would be funded through private donations, according to the report.

“It is recommended that both a male and female facility be selected for this purpose, preferring facilities with the hardest populations and where inmates have longer sentences,” according to the report. “Similar programs in other states have successfully trained inmates to be counselors to their fellow inmates, which has in turn decreased violent crime and given inmates something positive to work towards within the prisons.”",oklahoma,Gov.

So then the Bully transferred his bullying to the Victim.     The Victim changed classes to get out of classes with the Bully and avoid the Bully.     Then, in the incident which prompted the suspension,  the Bully sought him out, came to his room, and beat him.       There is a video of the Bully whaling away on the Victim who is just a punching bag.

Sand Springs schools appear to have a policy to suspend anyone ""involved"" in a fight without regard to culpability.  

Is that legal?   Oklahoma law grants everyone a right of self-defense, the right to meet force with force.    Assuming now for the sake of argument that the Victim's version of the story is accurate, can the school discipline a student for appropriately exercising his right to self-defense?

Here is the relevant part of the self-defense statute, Title 21, Section 1289.25D.     

""A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.""

OKLAHOMA CITY — A recommendation by Gov. Kevin Stitt’s criminal justice reform task force for a prison Bible college is unconstitutional and unwise, according to the Freedom From Religion Foundation.

“It is inappropriate to utilize the machinery of the state to promote one religion over another religion or over non-religion,” according to a Wednesday letter from the organization. “The government may accommodate prisoners who wish to worship in a certain way, but the government cannot plan and implement religious schooling, much less a seminary, or a Bible college for prisoners. Courts have regularly found such programs to be unconstitutional.”

Using private donations or running it as a voluntary program does not cure the legal violation, the organization said.",oklahoma,Freedom From Religion Foundation objects to recommendation for Bible college in Oklahoma prison

We enjoy small town living, the outdoors, and love hunting and fishing. We have two children who will be starting school, so a strong public school system is also very important. We are both in the medical field, employed as RN/Paramedics. So I’m assuming it won’t be too bad finding a job. 

The cost of living in Oklahoma is a huge attraction. We live in the DFW area at present, and we’re going to end up spending 300k on a 3br house to living in a below average school district. Also, hunting leases are outrageously expensive here, with public lands being very limited. We’d love to make this happen in the next year or so.

 “Continuing to conduct class III electronic gaming in the absence of valid Gaming Compacts with Oklahoma has resulted, is resulting, and will continue to result, in unjust enrichment to the Tribes,” according to the 41-page response. “Unjust enrichment will continue unless and until a new gaming compact is entered into by and between the Tribes and Oklahoma.” 

“Without an injunction, Oklahoma, as a State of the United States of Oklahoma, will suffer irreparable harm because its sovereignty is not being recognized by the Tribes, who continue to unlawfully conduct class III gaming in the absence of valid and existing gaming compacts,” according to Stitt’s response.",oklahoma,Gov.

Principal Chief Justin Wood of the Sac and Fox Nation interviewed this week gets testy about the language used by Stitt in his court filing.     I have heard his reaction is a common one among Tribal members.

When viewed in light of 500 years of genocide and theft,    Stitt's claim that the Tribes are the ones who are being UNJUSTLY ENRICHED  at the expense of state government makes Native Americans want to scream.

When Stitt says that the problem is Tribes don't respect STATE SOVEREIGNTY it makes Indians roll their eyes.

(Unjust enrichment is a legal term of art for a certain remedy.     It does not necessarily mean the Tribes have acted  with corrupt intent - it just sounds awful in this context.     What Stitt sued the Tribes for was breach of contract.   The remedy happens to be called unjust enrichment.)",oklahoma,What Stitt Sounds Like To Native Ears

 Gov. Kevin Stitt is getting hammered … by his own supporters … for showing Christian charity to people in need.

Since he was elected, no issue has brought more negative feedback to Stitt’s office than his Dec. 18 agreement to allow federally vetted refugees to resettle in the state.

For three weeks since Fox News host Tucker Carlson [**called out 18 Republican governors**](https://dailycaller.com/2020/01/04/republican-governors-refugee-resettlement) who agreed to refugee resettlement, Stitt’s office has averaged 300 calls a week on the issue ... For two weeks the calls were overwhelmingly negative, although in recent days the balance has shifted a bit with 43% supporting the governor’s decision. 

 **1.** They aren’t the asylum seekers you’ve heard about at the Mexico border. . 

 **2.** They have been vetted by the federal government. They aren’t terrorists. Many of them are Christians who are being oppressed 

 **3.** Oklahoma has a long tradition of accepting refugees, and it has made our state stronger and more vibrant.  

(Carlson might want to look at Matthew 25:34-35, “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For … I was a stranger and you invited me in … .’”)

I’m saddened by it but not surprised. Continue to call his office to tell them if you disagree and maybe (doubtfully) he will change his mind. His body language really stuck out to me during the video, constant and quickest blinking as I can recall and touching his face, which if you’re a believer in body language both are signs of deception.

&gt;  
&gt;“My God help, please,” Ellis can be heard on the video at about 8:30 a.m. Oct. 22, 2015. The Washington Post first published the video on its website Wednesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;About five hours later, jail officials called an ambulance for Ellis after he was found in his cell with no detectable blood pressure.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 26-year-old Ellis was pronounced dead at 2:51 p.m. the same day at a local hospital.    
&gt;  
&gt;The state medical examiner later determined Ellis died from septic shock due to pneumonia. 

So a healthy 26-year-old who surrendered to the police for an old DUI warrant (because his grandfather told him it was the right thing to do) died slowly and painfully while the jail staff including the nurse ridiculed him.

In an amended lawsuit filed Thursday on behalf of three plaintiffs, including two Oklahoma brothers who initially filed the complaint, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and a Kansas City, Missouri, law firm contend that the traffic stop statistics show that the Kansas Highway Patrol specifically targets out-of-state drivers, including many on the main highway connecting Kansas with neighboring Colorado, because that state’s legalized marijuana.

You  would be  seen by a second or third year master's student in the  counseling or school psychology under the direct  supervision of a  licensed psychologist and faculty member.

We have an emphasis on evidence-based (read: SCIENCE!) therapy,  assessment, and interventions, particularly cognitive-behavioral  therapy, and see a wide range of clients, both in terms of problems and  ages.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

**The results are particularly timely in the face of Native American protests against caricatures of their culture, including the tomahawk chop — performed by fans of the Kansas City Chiefs, who won Sunday’s Super Bowl — and other sports teams with Native American monikers.**

**The study’s findings, to be published this month in the journal of** ***Social Psychological and Personality Science*****, show that the degree to which those surveyed identified as Native American influenced how offensive they found Native mascots.**

**Of those polled for the study, 57% who strongly identify with being Native American and 67% of those who frequently engage in tribal cultural practices were found to be deeply insulted by caricatures of Native American culture.**    

**....** 

**Eason and University of Michigan psychologist Stephanie Fryberg launched the study last fall in response to what they deemed as “yet another questionable opinion survey” about the Redskins’ name.**

**For example, a 2019 web-based survey of 500 self-identified Native Americans that was reported in** ***The Washington Post*** **found that 68% of those polled were not offended by the Washington Redskins’ name.  Among other things, it asked respondents to identify whether the Redskins’ name made them feel proud, disappointed, empowered, embarrassed, appreciative or hopeless.**

**Moreover, a 2016** ***Washington Post*** **survey found that nine in 10 Native Americans polled claimed not to be bothered by the moniker. It was a telephone survey of 504 self-identified Native Americans, and the results are said to have influenced the decision of team owner Daniel Snyder to retain the Redskins’ name.**        

**....**

**Overall, 49% of participants in the UC Berkeley study were found to strongly agree or agree that the Washington Redskins’ name is offensive, while 38% were not bothered by it. The remainder were undecided or indifferent**

OKLAHOMA CITY — A federal judge on Monday ordered mediation in a legal dispute over gaming compacts between Gov. Kevin Stitt and several tribes.

Chief Judge Timothy D. DeGiusti of the U.S. District Court for the Western District issued the four-page order following a meeting Friday with the parties.

The parties were ordered to each submit a list of three proposed mediators for the court to consider.

 The order said the court will act quickly to appoint a mediator. If none is acceptable to the court, more names will be requested.

Within 21 days of the appointment of a mediator, the parties were instructed to issue a status report on mediation to the court.

The order said the mediation should be completed or substantially completed by March 31.

“The Court intends this date to be a firm deadline,” the order states, but left the door open for a possible extension.

The order prohibited the parties from disclosing details of the process without the court’s permission.

“In addition to any and all other prohibitions against disclosure, no party may make any public statement, media release, or other comment for public broadcast regarding the status or conduct of the mediation or the characterization of any party’s position therein without prior leave of the Court,” the order states.

OKLAHOMA CITY — House Democrats on Monday unveiled a legislative agenda that they say will move the needle for those who are underfunded and undervalued.

It includes more education reforms, increasing the minimum wage, expanding Medicaid and reforming the cash bail system.

“We need to create a teacher pipeline that recruits the best and keeps them in the profession for the long haul,” said Rep. Melissa Provenzano, D-Tulsa. “Then we need the people that wrap around that teacher to help get the job done.”

 School counselors should spend the bulk of their time providing mental health and academic support that gets students on the right track rather than serving as exhausted testing coordinators, she said.

The state also needs authentic measures for school accountability that don’t hang a questionable letter grade on a child or a community, Provenzano said.

“Many of our students are considering college but fear they may never be able to pay off the loans they have or receive a fair deal from our lenders,” she said. “Half the students graduated from Oklahoma institutions carry on average $25,000 in student loan debt. Gone is the notion that one can get a job to pay your way through college.”

 She said increased faith in the lending process will come with a Student Borrower’s Bill of Rights. It would promote higher enrollment, she said.

In addition, the state should be No. 1 in the region in per-pupil spending, she said.

House Democrats have filed 17 measures to improve the economic empowerment of residents, including increasing the minimum wage, said Rep. Mickey Dollens, D-Oklahoma City. House Democrats also support letting cities and towns set their own minimum wage, he said.

 “This session marks eight years since our state’s leadership rejected Medicaid expansion and the $3.5 billion that we would have now had in our communities to make lives healthier for our taxpayers,” Bennett said.

“We have waited far too long along with hundreds of thousands of Oklahomans for that long-promised Oklahoma solution to come along while we watched 36 other states improve their health outcomes considerably as a result of traditional Medicaid expansion,” Bennett said.

Bennett said the state can’t afford to use its most vulnerable population as test subjects for the newest Washington, D.C., effort to gut health care protections. 

Voters will have a chance to decide on State Question 802, which would expand Medicaid.

Democrats also want to increase state funding for diversion programs that have been successful, such as drug courts and mental health courts, said Rep. Collin Walke, D-Oklahoma City.

Fines and fees in the past six years have led to more than $600 million in delinquent court debt, which leads to disproportionate jail stays due to an inability to pay, Walke said.

“If you can’t afford bail and you are in jail for the same reason as somebody who can post bond, the only difference is a matter of wealth, and wealth should not decide justice,” Walke said.

OKLAHOMA CITY — Gaming tribes involved in a legal dispute with Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday asked a federal court to dismiss his counter claims.

The tribes on Dec. 31 filed suit against Stitt, asking the court to declare that its gaming compacts automatically renewed.

Stitt has said the compacts expired on Jan. 1 and that continued operation of Class III gaming is illegal.

. . . .

In Stitt’s response to the suit, he asked the court to prevent the state’s American Indian tribes from Operating Class III gaming, saying it is illegal. He also wants the court to declare that the 15-year-old gaming compacts expired.

“The Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the Tribes are immune from Defendant’s counterclaims under the doctrine of sovereign immunity,” according to the tribes’ response.

OKLAHOMA CITY - Oklahoma’s new state branding website was updated over the weekend to better account for the state’s indigenous history after outrage on social media.

Gov. Kevin Stitt and Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell last week unveiled the state’s new brand, which includes a new logo and tagline that attempt to define Oklahoma.

The brand and the reasoning behind it are detailed on a new state website,  [branding.ok.gov](http://branding.ok.gov/) Some people recently criticized the website for disregarding that Oklahoma’s Native American tribes were settled here prior to the 1889 Land Run.

The website read: “This is a place that was built from scratch, made by people who gave up everything to come here from all over the world to create something for themselves and their families. … We started this place with a land run in 1889 — and honestly, we’re still running, still making, still pioneering.”",oklahoma,State brand website tweaked over Land Run reference

671,671,Ancient_Dude,1582263960,f76ouh,Nan," OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter has been asked for a legal opinion about whether the state can put tribal gaming exclusivity fees in escrow pending the outcome of a federal lawsuit.

Senate Appropriations Chairman Roger Thompson, R-Okemah, asked for the opinion.

Thompson asked whether Gov. Kevin Stitt has the authority to escrow the funds remitted from the tribes and not deposit them in the 1017 Fund, which goes to education.

Thompson said he believes the money can’t be put in escrow and must go to fund education.

The Governor’s Office did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment.

.  .  .   . 

In a Jan. 30 letter to the Comanche Nation Gaming Commission, the state said that it had created two special funds to hold tribal administrative assessments and exclusivity fees until it receives further direction.

The funds received and deposited by the state “will be characterized as being held in escrow and/or a credit to any constructive trust implemented by the federal court,” according to the letter from Brandy Manek, Office of Management and Enterprise Services director of budget, policy and gaming compliance.

In December, Hunter withdrew from tribal gaming compact talks. The action came after tribes declined the state’s request for arbitration.

.  .  .  .

 If the state continues to spend the funds from exclusivity fees, it could be viewed as an admission that the compacts automatically renewed.

Alex Gerszewski, a spokesman for Hunter, said Stitt and Hunter had not discussed the legality of putting the funds in escrow.",oklahoma,Legal Opinion Sought on State's Handling of Tribal Gaming Exclusivity Fees

730,730,big_game_hunter,1582669775,f9ik8k,Nan,"TL;DR 3 members of my family all cannot vote in the presidential primary now because the election board made a ""mistake.""

Essentially this is what has just happened to my family:
My Dad, Mom, and Sister are all registered Independent. (But indicated they wanted to get the Dem Primary ballots by absentee mail)

However, they were NOT mailed the correct ballot which listed the Presidential Primary nominees. Instead, they only received a ballot with the state alcohol question on it. Assuming this was for a different election they filled out and returned the ballots containing only that question a few weeks ago.

Last week I was opening my ballot to get ready to fill it out when my dad mentioned that they hadn't gotten theirs yet. I showed him what my ballot looks like and he insisted that he only had one that contained the question. After calling the election board they told him that all three of them had already returned their ballots for the 3/3 election. Their records showed that they were supposed to receive the Democratic ballot but the official said there must have been a ""mistake."" when they sent it out to them originally.

Now here is the kicker, because they already returned the incorrect ballot the election officals are telling them that there is no way to retrieve them and get a new one and that they are now unable to vote in the Presidential Primary. And they keep insisting that it is not a big deal because they can still vote in the regular primary in June.

While I am frustrated with my family for not paying close enough attention or understanding that this was the Super Tuesday ballot, I am extremely furious at the complete apathy and incompetence of the election officials who have effectively disenfranchised 3 people from voting on Super Tuesday.

So if you or someone you know is receiving an Oklahoma absentee ballot you should make sure they are aware that these fools have been stuffing incorrect ballots into mailers and if you return it there will be nothing you can do.

OKLAHOMA CITY — Separation of church and state does not and cannot exist in the United States, the lawmaker carrying a bill that would require that “In God We Trust” be “prominently” displayed in all state-owned buildings told an Oklahoma House of Representatives committee on Tuesday.

“Our government is based on the idea that our inalienable rights are granted to us by our creator,” said Rep. Jay Steagall, R-Yukon. “It is impossible to separate church from state. And our founders said we should not do that, actually.”

The proof, he said, was on the money in everyone’s pockets and purses.

Steagall was presenting [**House Bill 3817**](http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=HB), by Speaker Charles McCall, R-Atoka, to the House Rules Committee. The bill specifies that the “placement and size of (each) display shall be in keeping with the placement and size of the display of the national motto in the United States Capitol Visitor Center.”

That display is 4 feet high and 70 feet wide. It was installed about 10 years ago.

.  .  .  .

According to reports, the push to display “In God We Trust” on as many government buildings as possible is driven largely by WallBuilders, an evangelical group whose founder, Oral Roberts University graduate David Barton, argued that the religious liberties of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution apply only to Christians and possibly Jews and Muslims.

Historians say the founders disagreed widely on religion and government. Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the phrase to which Steagall referred, also coined the phrase “separation of church and state” and was one of its staunchest supporters.",oklahoma,"Oklahoma Legislature: ""In God We Trust"" Proponent Says Separation of Church and State Is Impossible"

770,770,Iforgotmyother_name,1582847176,falcll,Nan,"An Oklahoma City federal judge has rejected requests by two tribes to join a tribal gaming lawsuit against Gov. Kevin Stitt.

It would be ""neither necessary nor appropriate"" to allow the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians and the Kialegee Tribal Town to intervene in the lawsuit, Chief U.S. District Judge Timothy D. DeGiusti wrote in a six-page order issued Thursday.

At issue in the lawsuit is whether the state's 15-year gaming compacts with more than 30 Oklahoma tribes expired on Jan. 1 or automatically renewed on that date.

Stitt contends the gaming compacts expired, while tribes argue they automatically renewed. The governor has said he wants the tribes to renegotiate the compacts to pay higher exclusivity fee rates than the 4-6 percent graduated rates that they have been paying on Las Vegas-style Class III slot machines.

The Cherokee, Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations filed a lawsuit on New Year's Eve asking Judge DeGiusti to issue a declaratory judgment that the compacts automatically renewed.

Nine other tribes later were permitted to join the lawsuit, but several tribes objected when the Keetoowah and Kialegee tribes sought to participate. The Keetoowah tribe is based in Tahlequah, while the Kialegee tribe is based in Wetumka.

Opposing tribes argued that the Keetoowah and Kialegee tribes did not have the same legal issues that they had because the Keetoowah and Kialegee tribes do not currently have gaming operations in Oklahoma. They also noted that unlike Oklahoma's other gaming tribes, the Keetoowah and Kialegee tribes complied with a request from the governor and signed eight-month extension agreements to their gaming compacts last December.

The Keetoowah and Kialegee tribes argued, among other things, that they should be allowed to join the lawsuit to protect their rights during court-ordered mediation.

""Unless the Court allows the Band to intervene and take part in the mediation, other tribes, some of whom are antagonistic to the Band, could agree to terms that would negatively affect the Band's future gaming prospects against the Band's wishes,"" the Keetoowah Band stated in one court filing.

Judge DeGiusti found that argument and a nearly identical argument by the Kialegee tribe to be unpersuasive, stating that the two tribes were seeking ""to use the declaratory judgment remedy for procedural fencing rather than to settle a legal controversy with Gov. Stitt.""

The judge's ruling cleared the way for mediation to continue. Both sides of the dispute are prohibited from discussing progress of mediation efforts with anyone who is not directly involved. The judge has said he wants mediation to be completed or substantially completed by March 31.

Gov. Kevin Stitt on Friday again raised the possibility of bringing nontribal casinos to the state, telling the Tulsa World, “Let me bring commercial casinos in, give out just four commercial licenses, and it would be $350 million to the state.”

Stitt, who is under a federal gag order, quickly clarified he was speaking hypothetically in response to a question about states that receive nothing from tribal gaming.

Under the scenario he laid out, Stitt said, the tribes “could keep their $150 million and pay zero.”

.  .   .   . 

The matter is currently the subject of court-ordered mediation and the various parties are bound by a part of the order prohibiting them from “any public statement, media release, or other comment for public broadcast regarding the status or conduct of the mediation or the characterization of any party’s position.”

The order does permit comment on “that party’s factual or legal position or any other party’s public statement.”

Later, at a Tulsa Press Club luncheon, Stitt said he is “happy now we’re finally in federal court. We’re being forced to mediate this disagreement. ... I don’t begrudge them for fighting for a good deal for themselves. But guys, this is not a good deal. I would not be doing a good job as governor if I rubber stamped a contract that goes on forever.

“I think there’s a win-win. There’s a win for the casino industry, there’s a win for tribes and there’s a win for the state of Oklahoma and education.”

Opening the state to nontribal casinos would not be a simple matter, however. It would require legislation or an initiative petition, and the disputed compacts, if upheld, require splitting new revenue from nontribal operations with the tribes.",oklahoma,Gov.

 A sixth Oklahoma patient is being tested for COVID-19 amid a global coronavirus outbreak that’s killed six Americans so far.

[**According to the Oklahoma State Department of Health**](https://www.ok.gov/health/Prevention_and_Preparedness/Acute_Disease_Service/Disease_Information/Coronavirus_Disease_2019/Oklahoma_Response_to_Coronavirus_Disease_2019/index.html), test results are pending for two people being evaluated for COVID-19.

Dr. Bruce Dart, director of Tulsa Health Department, said federal HIPPA regulations prevented him from commenting on whether any Tulsa County residents have been tested for the virus.

But he expects it will eventually reach Oklahoma.

“I definitely feel that at some point Oklahoma and Tulsa are probably going to see coronavirus,” he said. “This virus is so new we don’t know how it is going to play out.

“We don’t know if it’s like the flu, if it’s going to be seasonal and burn out when the temperatures warm up. We don’t know if it will be year-round.”

. . . .

Oklahoma continues to send its samples to the CDC for testing, but Dart said the agency announced Monday morning that it would be sending test kits to states.

His hope is that they arrive at the state Public Health Laboratory in Oklahoma City by end of the week but said there is no way to know.

“They are prioritizing states where there are definite cases first,” Dart said. “So we are not sure when, in Oklahoma, we’ll get ours or, really, the number we’re going to get.”",oklahoma,Sixth Oklahoma patient tested for coronavirus; 4 previous cases negative for COVID-19

I fear that if we once again refuse to take a chance, to move forward, to change our politics, we will face 4 more years of the destruction of our basic rights as Americans. 


It's pretty obvious with Pete and Amy dropping out that the moderate faction is rallying around Biden and making the same decisions as they did in 2016. 

I truly do not dislike Joe, he's been a great public servant. I just do not think that without changing we can win. 

If you're a Warren supporter, please know that she is my very very close second, I respect her and appreciate what she's done and what I know she will continue to do for the country.

With the decision to rally around Biden, our only hope of getting a progressive strong and liked candidate through, is to support Bernie. 

Bernie and Elizabeth share nearly all of the same values, truly the only difference in them is one has national approval and can beat Trump.

A jury on Thursday found a 2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial candidate guilty of committing felony assault and battery when he shot a process server attempting to give him legal documents at his south Tulsa home in July.

The jurors deliberated for about an hour before rejecting Christopher Jonathan Barnett's argument that he shot the process server in self-defense and recommending he receive a sentence of 32 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. District Judge Tracy Priddy will sentence Barnett on April 9.

Barnett will be required to serve at least 85% of the sentence on a violent crime conviction, meaning he would likely be in his late 50s before eligible for release.

.  .  .  .

 ""You'd have to disbelieve your own eyes when you see that video,"" \[Assistant District Attorney\] Collier said of Barnett's self-defense claim. Collier also said Barnett made statements to the jury about how he thought the process server ""had no respect for human life"" and ""wanted to know what it was like to shoot someone.""

""He's attributing to (the process server) exactly what he feels about himself,"" Collier said, calling Barnett's posture in the case one of ""arrogance.""

 ""That arrogance is what makes him dangerous,"" he added, saying Barnett attempted to show remorse to the jury by saying he regretted what happened ""but can't keep it together for five minutes"" before demeaning the process server's character.  

.  .  .  .

At one point during his testimony on Wednesday, Barnett said the process server — not him — should be the person who sits in jail because he was ""not exactly a stand-up citizen."" 

.  .  .  .

 Barnett will stand trial again in June on unrelated charges of threatening an act of violence in connection with a dispute involving employees of the University of Tulsa.

The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office went to court on Thursday because it says Epic Charter Schools’ for-profit operator has not been cooperating with the state’s investigative audit.

In July, Gov. Kevin Stitt requested an investigative audit of Epic and all its related entities by State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd. But in a motion filed in Oklahoma County District Court on Thursday, the Attorney General’s Office says Epic Youth Services has been refusing to comply with the auditor’s public records requests or subpoenas for months.

“Our office has been working with Auditor Byrd’s office in her ongoing audit of Epic, and today we filed a motion to compel documents that attorneys working for the school have refused to turn over for several months,” said Alex Gerszewski, communications director for Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter.",oklahoma,Oklahoma Attorney General Says Epic Charter Schools' For-Profit Management Company Refuses to Turn Over Documents in Investigative Audit

Some churches have asked their members to replace handshakes, due to the virus, with things like fist or elbow bumps.

Pastor Jeff Dykes said that's not how they're doing things at First Church of Tulsa Hills.

""We're still hugging people and shaking their hands. We want everybody to feel welcome and feel apart,"" he said.

Dykes said his faith in God will keep him protected.

In 2018, he said he was sick in the hospital for 3 months and technically died at one point.

If God got him through what could've been the end, Dykes said the coronavirus is no match.

""When you talk about the coronavirus, if I believe god can heal me and raise me from the dead, I’m certainly not going to be worried about shaking somebody’s hand,"" he said.

I was working on a story about pickup truck culture in the United States and came across an interesting statistic. In almost every state, Ford or Chevrolet is the most popular truck brand.

NEWS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:    March 13, 2020

CONTACT: State Election Board PIO Misha Mohr, (405) 522-6624 mmohr@elections.ok.gov 

State Election Board Secretary Warns Voters of ""Fake"" Voter Registration Applications
(Oklahoma City) –State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax issued a warning to Oklahomans today to beware of “fake” voter registration applications. Counties around the state have received several invalid voter registration applications, which were generated from a website called Register2Vote.org.

The website allows Oklahomans to complete a so-called “Federal Voter Registration Application” that is not valid in Oklahoma. Under Oklahoma state law, only the National Mail Application and the Oklahoma Voter Registration Application are accepted in this state.

“This is a prime example of an organization creating misinformation that could cause Oklahoma voters to become disenfranchised. The application used by Register2Vote appears to be a document created specifically for the organization and cobbles together language from both the National Mail Application and the Oklahoma Voter Registration Application. However, it is not a valid application under Oklahoma law and cannot be accepted in the State of Oklahoma,” Ziriax said.

Oklahomans who submitted an application generated by Register2Vote.org to their County Election Board will be mailed a letter from the Secretary of the County Election Board explaining why the application was rejected, along with an official Oklahoma Voter Registration Application. Voters who believe they submitted an invalid form or need to register to vote can also download a valid application from the State Election Board website at elections.ok.gov.

The deadline to register to vote for the statewide primary is June 5. Valid voter registration applications received after this date will be processed immediately following the June 30 election.

Voters with questions, should contact their County Election Board or the State Election Board at (405) 521-2391 or info@elections.ok.gov.",oklahoma,"State Election Board Secretary Warns Voters of ""Fake"" Voter Registration Applications (released March 13, 2020)"

WASHINGTON, D.C.On the fourth floor of the Museum of the Bible, a sweeping permanent exhibit tells the story of how the ancient scripture became the world’s most popular book. A warmly lit sanctum at the exhibit’s heart reveals some of the museum’s most prized possessions: fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient texts that include the oldest known surviving copies of the Hebrew Bible.

But now, the Washington, D.C. museum has confirmed a bitter truth about the fragments’ authenticity. On Friday, independent researchers funded by the Museum of the Bible announced that all 16 of the museum’s Dead Sea Scroll fragments are modern forgeries that duped outside collectors, the museum’s founder, and some of the world’s leading biblical scholars. Officials unveiled the findings at an academic conference hosted by the museum.

1123,1123,jhaubrich11,1584419960,fjz840,Nan," Do not live in fear of the Coronavirus. Fear is a low vibration. When you live in a low vibration you become a magnet for what you are afraid of. In times like these, it is important to only think good thoughts, say only good words, do only good deeds - hold only the highest vibrations of unconditional love. If you hold the highest vibrations, sickness cannot enter you. This phenomenon is known as the Law of Attraction.

According to Albert Einstein, “Everything in Life is Vibration”. Nikola Tesla said ""If you wish to understand the Universe, think of energy, frequency and vibration"". Even physical matter is just energy at a very low vibration. Energy can be transformed into matter and vice versa (E=mc2). Sound is a vibration, and so are your thoughts. Everything that manifests in your life is there because it matches the vibration of your thoughts. Solidity in the universe is an illusion created by the underlying vibration and frequency of subatomic particles. It has been proven by the Double-slit experiment that our consciousness can actually change the behavior of subatomic particles and waves such as photons through the mere act of observation. Mind is more powerful than matter, consciousness preceded the material universe.

""Saint Germain has said that, in truth, all one really needs to do to change any aspect of their life, heal any disease, create abundance, or achieve Transfiguration of the physical body into the Ascended Realm, is to raise their vibration and frequency.""

""The human body is really a magnificent quantum physics machine. We are made up of literally nothing more than vibrating energy. Humans are made of cells, which are made of atoms, which are made of particles, and those so-called particles are actually just vibrating energy. Every atom is just a probability wave, and most of the stuff we call physical matter is really made up of completely empty space. We are more empty space than physical stuff; more vibration than mass. Thus, we can be strongly impacted -- either positively or negatively -- by vibrational energy.""

The easiest way to raise your vibration is by thinking good thoughts. As you think, you shall become. If you cleanse your thoughts, your destiny will be cleansed too. This is the wisdom of the ancient magi, the same magi who were sent by Zarathustra to visit Jesus. It is your own personal choice whether or not you choose to follow it.

1128,1128,iz31milk,1584444735,fk3owg,Nan,"As a healthcare professional in Oklahoma, I wanted to emphasize the need for social distancing. The COVID virus has only mild symptoms people infected. Think common cold symptoms for most people under than 40 years old. My point is youth and young adults, you cannot tell the difference most of the time what type of infection is present. Our government will not have wide spread testing available soon enough. The COVID virus from time of catching it to onset of symptoms is usually 3-11 days. How long are you contagious? We dont have a good answer but probably 14 days. There is a more technical answer but that is for another post. Dr Fauci is the small doctor at the administration press conferences, I trust, who said we have 15 days to slow down the transmission of this virus else, we will become Italy. The effectiveness of young people to not obtain/carry this virus will determine the outcome. Look at the virus prevalence of youth in South Korea for my rational. Please stay home if possible. Thinking and reading the news about closures are difficult for all. I honestly feel for those missing a paycheck. Hopefully we can come up with a solution for that issue but we have to stop this virus now. The best day to stop this pandemic was yesterday but today is the next best. 

Thank you. Now wash those hands!

Some of the things that don't seem to add for me so far are...

1) The CDC has stated that 80% of those who are affected by COVID will have ""mild to no symptoms"". At what point have we ever seen such a reaction to such a mild virus?

2) The actions are disproportionate to the impact. For example, we now have officially closed borders, stopped travel, closed any and all social gatherings, closed restaurants and non-essential stores, and even set curfews from being out after certain hours (how is this even related?). These are EXTREME cases for an UNEXTREME virus. Why?

3) The biggest concern here is the impact on the economy, which will have far-greater consequences than the virus itself.

( [https://www.newspin.com/tour/?site=42&amp;scenename=815](https://www.newspin.com/tour/?site=42&amp;scenename=815) )

This was featured (out of everywhere in the USA) in a major news outlet because it is so cool.   You can  tilt the camera to the sky or ceilings and even down right to the ground as if you were standing right there.  

Our parks and nature preserves may not be staffed completely right now or have no services - but YOU, yes YOU, the adventurous Oklahoman who's been cooped up for too long can find your way out there and enjoy some fresh rainy air!

All we need to do while travelling is to stay clean, minimize our visits indoors and eating suspicious road food, and practice ""Leave No Trace"" rules.  Most people in OKC and Tulsa live an hour or less from a National Park, recreation area, or a nature /wildllife preserve. 

So leaving no trace means packing out all the garbage you pack in  and if you have to use a natural area for biological reasons, stay away from water, dig deep, and carry out all TRASH (including fruit skins, peels, and anything that doesn't biodegrade and can make critters sick.)

Finally, hug the wildlife and nature with your CAMERA!  Please, oh please, don't try to pet or feed wild animals or even people's livestock you might see on the road.  Please don't pick flowers as well.  There are quite a few flowers out there if you pick it, that is the end of it, it won't grow back next year.  Cameras are much better!

Respect nature  and know going outside is a great place to socially distance as long as you plan ahead and be safe. 

(It also helps to not take pets off leash in the wilds.  Most of these places have REAL wild animals which you should never try to touch, nonetheless let a dog nearby.  This is not so much a big animal thing (as the small creatures - like poisonous snakes and underground wasp nests in the grass and brush.)

 I don't buy this  at all. Testing has been horribly limited. He's claiming we are  flattening the curve in one week on a virus with a 2 week incubation. Is  he nuts? Plus, only some people are in self-quarantine and many only  started this weekend. Well, need the two  week incubation time to play out.

     I know it seems like Oklahoma is being “spared” from what other parts of the United States are going through, but believing this will last is false hope.  Every hotspot for the virus started with a case or two, but due to it’s extreme contagiousness and variable degree of illness, it gets out of control quickly. For this reason, social distancing is at least a worthy strategy.
     As healthcare workers, we are used to taking care of very sick people, but this crisis is different for several reasons. At the forefront of our concern is the limited supply of personal protective equipment. Nurses and doctors accept risk in what they do, but increasing their personal risk because lack of supplies is not only unfair, it is unacceptable. Our supply chain workers cannot get needed supplies, but get continued calls from people trying to profit during this crisis. Price gouging should be illegal. A mask that we usually buy for 50 cents should not cost $5.00 when we need it most.
    We are worried about you, our patients. Our hospital has 18 ventilators. Some of our epidemiological modeling has us running out of ventilators between 350-450 cases.  As healthcare workers who spend their entire career trying to save lives, having people die because of inability to provide needed care is our nightmare. We have to avoid this outcome.
    The so called “flattening of the curve” is painful.  It will not stop the virus, but hopefully allow your local hospital to prepare and take care of those in need.  In time, I hope we can have needed supplies and treatments improve allowing us to save lives.
    We are in this together.  We are all brothers and sisters. We are all Oklahomans.  Loving kindness goes a long way during these times. Everyone is facing challenges, but pulling together as if we are all friends and family, we will get through. This is a marathon and not a sprint. Thank you for doing your part🙏🏽",oklahoma,Coronavirus in Oklahoma

**Do not seek or give medical advice in regards to COVID-19**

We have no way to vet users to make sure they are medical professionals, therefore no advise should accepted as medical fact in regards to COVID-19.

If you believe you are showing symptoms or believe to have come in contact with someone with COVID-19, **contact your primary care physician** or **contact the Oklahoma State Department of Health COVID-19 Hotline at 1-877-215-8336.** If you are in a life threatening situation and need emergency medical treatment **dial 911.**",oklahoma,Medical advice and r/Oklahoma

Hobby Lobby will be staying open amid the [coronavirus](https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/coronavirus/) crisis after billionaire owner David Green said his wife had a vision from God.

As [*Raw Story*](https://www.rawstory.com/2020/03/hobby-lobby-to-stay-open-during-coronavirus-after-billionaire-owners-wife-had-a-vision-from-god-report/) reported, the nationwide craft and home goods chain sent a letter to employees this week telling them that stores would remain open during the outbreak that has gripped the nation. Many businesses have closed down in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and a growing number of states have mandated that all but the most essential businesses close their doors for an undetermined amount of time in an effort to curb the spread.

Though Hobby Lobby does not deliver essential services, it will not be joining the others in closing down. The letter that Green sent to his employees this week explained that his wife, Barbara, received a message from God explaining why the company should remain open.

 “In her quiet prayer time this past week, the Lord put on Barbara’s heart three profound words to remind us that He’s in control,” the letter reads.

“Guide, Guard and Groom. We serve a God who will Guide us through this storm, who will Guard us as we travel to places never seen before, and who, as a result of this experience, will Groom us to be better than we could have ever thought possible before now,” it continued.

The letter attracted viral attention online, with many sharing it on Twitter and criticizing Green for putting his employees in harm’s way by forcing them to continue working during the spread of the virus. Others took issue with Green’s advisement to employees that they would all need to “tighten our belts” during the crisis. The company has been criticized in the past for its stingy benefits offered to employees, including little to no sick leave or [parental leave](https://www.inquisitr.com/1383107/hobby-lobby-fired-mom-of-two-for-being-pregnant-refused-unemployment-benefits-report-says/). The company’s owner has also pushed back against some health care reform efforts, not wanting to offer employees health insurance that covers birth control.

As [*Business Insider*](https://www.businessinsider.com/parental-leave-for-retail-workers-hobby-lobby-2017-5) noted in a 2017 report, the company instead focuses on a higher base rate of pay and days off for employees rather than paid sick leave benefits. The report noted that the company closes stores on Sundays, and offered a base rate of $15.70 per hour at the time.

Many critics also said the instruction to “tighten our belts” for the store’s hourly employees appeared to ring hollow from Green, whose net worth is estimated at $6.4 billion.

For as much complaining as I see on this sub, I think it's nice to have some positive posts sometimes.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

Best Regard,  
 **The Savior Messiah Mahdi Maitreya Anyname**

&gt;On March 14, Stitt [tweeted](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/15/politics/oklahoma-governor-deleted-tweet-coronavirus/index.html)  a picture of his family eating at a restaurant, as if he deserved an  award for defying the coronavirus panic. “It’s packed tonight!” he  enthusiastically shared, but facing blowback, later deleted the post.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  next day, Stitt declared a state of emergency. Then, the day after  that, the governor’s spokesman said, “the governor will continue to take  his family out to dinner and to the grocery store without living in  fear, and encourages Oklahomans to do the same.” Stitt still has not  issued a statewide stay-at-home order. In the absence of one, major  Oklahoma cities have imposed their own over the past few days.

But Mr. Inhofe  — a top Republican who is known [to swim](https://oklahoman.com/article/3581968/sen-jim-inhofe-believes-swimming-in-grand-lake-caused-his-illness) and [fly planes around the lake](https://www.newson6.com/story/32365650/reports-sen-jim-inhofes-plane-runs-off-runway-near-grand-lake), where his family owns a vacation home — quietly introduced legislation in June that would hamstring that agency.   He added the protections in an amendment to the [National Defense Authorization Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1790),  a military funding bill that is up for consideration before Congress.  As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Inhofe has wide  latitude over provisions included in the 1,700-page bill.

Do you all think this disaster will be remembered by Republican voters then and do you think it will matter to them enough to get him elected out of office? Will it cause a shift to a democratic nominee? Or will nothing change? 

My hope (which, honestly, means jack shit because of this state's history) is that we shift to a democratic candidate and things will change but my guess is that's a pipe dream. If not a democrat, at least a Republican that isn't going to cater to the President and will run the state like a state should be run, without so much damn partisanship.

I realize how far fetched those desires are but there's no fucking way Stitt should get another term. Even before this bullshit, it had become obvious he was Fallin 2.0. Stitt won by 144k votes.

Also I created a chart for OK with a log scale if anyone is interested.  Also it has a Daily Changes bar graph so you can visualize easily the rate of change for positives, hospitalizations and deaths.  The hospitalizations and deaths are probably the most significant.  If you see that hospitalization start growing then you can assume the infection was growing about 7 days earlier.  We seem to be doing good right now as the number has fallen for 4 days straight.  Also there are a couple predictive models.  The first is a basic SEIR model I created and the 2nd Method is from a more sophisticated SEIR model used by epidemiologists to predict disease spreads.  Frankly I am surprised at the low number of cases they indicate to arrive at the number of hospitalizations and deaths we have.  Mine shows about 4000 total cases and the second shows 4600.

Now to present a few facts

* COVID-19 is the disease and SARS-CoV-2 is the virus [source](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-\(covid-2019\)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it)

* COVID-19 stands for COronaVIrus Disease 2019

* How does it spread

It is spread through air via droplets exhaled by infected people.  It is also spread via touching contaminated surfaces/objects then touching your mouth, food and eyes.  [source](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)

Given that the best way to protect yourself is to keep your distance from people, wear a mask, wash your hands frequently (especially when outside your home), don't touch your face without clean hands.  I know the CDC has consistently recommended not wearing a mask, but it goes against all scientific evidence and is likely suggested to conserve masks.  They finally reversed course and now recommend people wear them [source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html)  The true intent of the previous recommendation is revealed in that they are suggesting using cloth or homemade coverings and save masks for medical personnel.  

Also, an excellent read from a good leader, is the recent release by PM Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore which has done an admirable job of containing this virus so far.  Unfortunately they to are moving to lockdowns.  

&gt; &gt;The spirit of these measures is to get all of us to minimise physical contact. If we do not go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus will not be able to spread. It is as simple as that.

&gt;&gt;I know this is very hard to do. Very hard to do as a practical matter, in places like hawker centres and wet markets, it is difficult to practise safe-distancing, especially on the weekends when it is crowded. It will help if we all adjust our habits. For example, do our marketing on weekdays instead of weekends to avoid the crowd. We will also deploy more Safe-Distancing Ambassadors to encourage people not to crowd together, so please cooperate with them

&gt;&gt;Safe distancing is also hard for a psychological and emotional reason: it goes very much against our human instincts. It is in our nature to want to socialise, to be close to those we are talking to, to take comfort in the warmth and company of friends and family. I fully understand this. But I hope you will also understand why we all have to take social distancing extremely seriously in this period. This is the only effective way to slow the transmission of the virus, so that we gradually bring our numbers down. It is also the best way to keep our families safe, and particularly to protect our seniors from getting ill. So please bear with the painful adjustments that we have make. Each and every one of us can, and must do our part, to keep everyone in Singapore safe from COVID-19.

&gt;&gt;I decided to speak to you directly today to explain why we need to make this major move now.

Singapore is light years ahead of most countries in its ability to implement track, trace and isolate suspected cases.  I read a story in the local paper where a cab driver got a phone call to isolate 2 hours after carrying a patient who tested positive.  I think Singapore will be a case study in exactly how effective the measures we are taking are.  Its troubling that they have been unable to contain it when they have so much going for them.

*  It can take 14 days to start showing symptoms

It has in a few cases.  95% of people show symptoms within 5-7 days.  The flu takes about 4-5 days.

* It can be spread by people not showing symptoms

There is evidence that shows this is true.  However, according to WHO, the vast majority of new cases are thought to be from someone showing symptoms.  The flu can also be spread by someone not showing symptoms.  Some are starting to suggest that amount of asymptomatic spreaders could be higher than originally thought.  There is no clear evidence about how much spreading is being done by asymptomatic carriers.

* The death rate is xx

We Don't have a clear picture of the death rate.  The leading estimates place it at about 0.05% - 0.7%, to compare the flu runs about 0.1%.  [source 1](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/)  [source 2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\(20\)30243-7/fulltext) [source 3](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v2) 

The reason your seeing higher rates on media sources and status update sites is because they are simply taking the number deaths and dividing it by the number of known cases.  There are many problems with this.  The biggest is that 80% of cases show mild symptoms and likely aren't getting tested at all.  Another is that testing bias in many locations is restricting testing to severe cases.  It should be apparent that if you have a lot of people that are infected but not getting tested it can drastically change the death rate.  This was noted in recent disease outbreaks where fatality rates were wildly overestimated initially.

There are some arguments that the death rate could be higher due to deaths not being recorded properly or not diagnosed.  Some scientists are claiming that some areas have a large number of excess deaths that can't be accounted for with the normal death rate or with COVID-19 victims.  They are assuming the extra deaths must be from COVID-19.  The only real study carried out on this so far showed no excess deaths in the UK.  There was a study done in Italy where they went through the records of several hundred patients that died due to COVID-19 and found that a large portion of them were incorrectly attributed to COVID-19.  This is an area where more research needs done before we have an answer.

*  Are there any effective drugs

There are 3 promising drugs.

First, Remdesivir has been effectively used on other viruses and is currently undergoing trials in the US and China.  It has shown good results in a few cases.  Its most likely has the best potential.

Second, Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Zinc have shown promising results in several small uncontrolled studies.  A growing list of Drs from around the world are recommending it.  Numerous trials have been started in several countries to test it.  Past studies have shown its effective against SARS.  Spain and Italy have started widespread use of it, its unclear if there are guidelines as to which patients are being treated with it.  It will be interesting to see what happens in Spain and Italy in the coming weeks.  Several study results should start coming out in the next 2 weeks also, but some are only treating with HCL and at different rates.  1 controlled study from China shows it probably works. [source](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v2)

They took 62 patients with mild COVID-19 and gave half a placebo and the other half hydroxychloroquine regimen.  The ones taking HCL showed significant improvements compared to the control group.  Notably all patients that progressed to severe illness were in the control group.  Its a small sample size and has not been peer reviewed.


Third, Favipiravir has also shown promise in a few uncontrolled studies.  Its currently being used in Japan and China.  It was originally developed to fight influenza.  Italy also recently approved it use.  Japan has stated that it might be less effective on severe cases.

* What about a vaccine

There is some good news on this front.  First this coronavirus has shown to be mutating at a slow rate which means if a vaccine is developed its likely to remain effective, unlike vaccines for the flu which mutates rapidly requiring new vaccines every season.  Even more good news is that the University Pittsburgh Med Center announced they believe they have a vaccine.  They claim it has produced antibodies in mice and have requested to move to human trials.  They also claim it is cheap and easy to produce in large quantities.  Moderna has a vaccine already in human trials.  CanSino has a vaccine currently undergoing human trials. Both skipped animal testing.

*  Is A+ blood more likely to get it or die from it

In short, no.  There is a study from China that checked a small group and reported that A blood types are more likely to get the disease and die, while O blood types are less so.  A follow up study on this showed no difference.  Also the original study only indicated a marginal difference between blood types, given the low number of samples its doesn't provide any useful information. [source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/01/fact-check-coronavirus-blood-type-a-more-susceptible/2922465001/)

* Will warmer weather stop it from spreading like the Flu

It won't stop it from spreading but its likely that it will reduce the rate.  There are a few studies which have shown a link between temperature and humidity and the R0 of this virus.  One particular study attempted to predict the possible spread rate in early March, they published a weather map of the globe and highlighted areas that were highly susceptible, according to their results, due to temp and humidity.  Its oddly accurate for the hardest hit locations.  It could explain why major population areas haven't had as large of an outbreak as they are outside the prime temp/humidity band.  Some coronaviruses have shown a seasonality and some haven't.

* Things to watch for

If this virus should mutate into a more contagious or lethal form, we are in big trouble.

When they release the lockdowns, I would maintain your vigilance for a few weeks.  Avoid crowds, wear a mask, clean your hands and be ready for a new outbreak to happen in some areas.

I would expect the deaths and hospitalizations to continue to rise, just at a slower rate.  Watch that rate carefully as its probably the best indicator of how much this virus is spreading.  There is about an 8 day lag on the hospitalizations and 

Also, I would expect round 2 to start at some point.  If it ends up being seasonal then it will be this fall/winter, prepare ahead of time.  

To close, yes this virus is more contagious than the flu and probably more lethal.  It is certainly more medically severe than the flu. 
 Its not the end of the world.  Tune out the news stories and FB posts trying to incite panic.  The vast majority of people getting it recover just fine on their own.  

In my opinion you are safe to go out and get items or do outdoor activities.  Just protect yourself from the unwashed hoard of barbarians out there by wearing a mask, keeping your hands clean.  Avoid being in a tightly enclosed area with people outside your household.  This is much easier to do if you are at home.

Hey all you cool cats and kittens! Recently our friend from Tiger King, Joshua Dial, has started trying to raise some money for counseling and psychiatric meds. Apparently he has a lot of medical debt, and needs financial help to get treatment. I'll note here that as an Oklahoman myself, I know that there is very little help in this state for poor people. Oklahoma is one of the 14 states in the United States that has still not expanded Medicaid, which leaves a lot of poor people without health insurance.

Let me just tell you my experience real quick with trying to get insurance in this state as a poor person, under the ACA. A couple years ago I looked into getting a bronze plan on the ACA marketplace. The premiums I think were close to $200 dollars a month, and there was I think a $8000 dollar deductible before any coverage would kick in at all. Meaning even if I would have been able to afford this plan, which I wasn't, I still wouldn't have been able to see a doctor for things like x-ray's on my fucked up neck, cardiovascular testing, things like this. I mentioned I wasn't able to afford the plan. Here's why: Oklahoma did not expand Medicaid, and as a result, I needed to make at least $11,000 dollars a year to get a health care premium subsidy. Since I made $0 per year, I was $11,000 short of being poor enough to get help with health insurance. I'm not poor enough to help, I'm too fucking poor. Yes, that's a thing. And this, this is maybe one of the reasons everyone in Tiger King looks like they're living on death's door step.

Anyway, that was my experience. I still do not have health insurance, but this is not about me, that's just to give you some context as to my personal experience, and what Oklahomans go through.

Josh Dial is taking to Twitter and Instagram seeking financial help for health care, specifically he says for counseling and psychiatric medicines, which he said are $1000 dollars per month. This is the man that witnessed Travis accidentally kill himself.

"" Anyone’s seen tigerking knows what I went through. I need financial help dealing with medical bills. I have no insurance and no one has ever helped me pay. I’m thousands in the hole. Please help me""

In another thread a couple people mentioned this and mentioned his Twitter account, but they were saying they didn't think it was him and thought it was a scammer. Well this Twitter account has Joe Exotic posts going back to 2017, and he just posted a link to a video of his on instagram where you can see that it's clearly him.

[https://twitter.com/Joshuabdial/status/1247371969437356032](https://twitter.com/Joshuabdial/status/1247371969437356032)

I'm not sure if the issue is on my end or what the deal is, but I tried to watch the video in two different web browsers and couldn't get audio. So there might be an audio issue, but the video clearly shows his face and shows him speaking. Is audio on this video working for anyone???

Anyway, I thought I should post this here because I think he's clearly one of the most sympathetic people in Tiger King, and it sucks to see that he's struggling and can't afford to see his doctor and can't afford medicine. As a poor as fuck SOB myself, I know exactly how he feels, so I felt like I should post this.

**Stitt said hospitals are still preparing for a surge in cases.** 

**He said there are 958 ICU beds in the state and almost 2,000 ventilators, so ""we are in good shape.""** 

**Officials also said the state has purchased millions worth of personal protective equipment from all over the world and has a system in place to distribute those materials to first responders.**

IHME's  Oklahoma Model -  [https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/oklahoma](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/oklahoma) 

Add into the fact that IHME's Model which is being used across the country estimates that Oklahoma will face no shortages related to Beds, ICU's, and Ventilators. This model hasn't taken into consideration the newly acquired PPE mentioned above as well. So Oklahoma should be in good shape on terms of PPE availability. 

Stitt also announced that over 13,000 tests have been provided (which most national media has not accounted for 10,000 private lab results, which is why you're seeing that untrue number of Oklahoma being dead last in per capita testing. It is because they are missing nearly 10,000 private lab results which the state has now revealed. 

Stitt also mentioned as of today their are over 60 drive thru testing locations across the state. 

About a week ago IHME's model showed Oklahoma's peak death rate to be around 50 deaths in a single day. That number today has been updated closer to 30 peak deaths in one day now that they have more recent data. 

Bad news however was unemployment agency official said average unemployment claims are around 1,500-2,000 a week. Past 3 weeks they've seen around 130,000 unemployment claims due to businesses being forced to close/lack of customer traffic/ordering/purchasing.

To preface, I've recently graduated (if you want to call it that, lol) my 10th grade year in one of our city public schools. I've maintained above a 4.0 gpa with my pre-ap classes, and did clubs/activities to get by. But the school has become violent and not focused on learning and teaching the way it should. This isn't an environment that functions with the type of person I am. I'm your average quiet ""nerdy"" kid, and I've felt as if I've been completely overlooked by the whole system in favor of others. I don't belong in this school, and because of that I'm struggling to find what I need to progress in life. I'm probably as much at fault for this by not reaching out, but the times I have tried to take advantage of my resources have fallen flat. I've got a romantic view on life, and my standards are likely rose-colored, but if there is any time to try and find something, now is the time to try my hand.

So with that being said: what options do I have to get out of this experience? I've spoken about it with my parents, and they agreed that as long as I'm taking the initiative to find something outside of private/boarding education, they'd be willing to work with just about anything they believe benefit me.

I'm mature and responsible enough to be independent in my studies, and my social skills are well. I'm not getting any connections out of highschool, anyways, so it's not hurting me to leave. Making friends who would typically be a bit older than myself isn't an issue either.

But I'm struggling to find out how to find my options for getting out of this hell hole. We've tried getting in contact with the Epic school system to see if I can finish up my two years quickly there, but they haven't even responded back to our questions/calls. I'm trying not to give up, but :\\

Graduating early has been the only other option I know of. I would very likely go straight into community college to get my credits, but would it be stupid to do this? I assume I'm still eligble for academic scholarships if I do, but I'm not sure. I just don't know what to do. No one has told me anything and I'm afraid that I've just got some fantasy situation in my head.

So if you can, lay it bare to me. Do I have any inexpensive options for getting out of Oklahoma's typical public school with it not hindering my studies? I've got too much ambition and not enough answers, and I'm hoping that this will help me gain a step in the right direction.

Paint as pictured.  Updates since photo, blackout front aftermarket yellow ground glow LED turn signals below grille midbar not pictured, but headlights still factory incandescent in new buckets.  Bowtie badge is missing with new factory stock reproduction grille.  Rear LED taillights with stock incandescent white tillights not pictured.  Factory stock fiberglas paintmatched runningboards and fender flares.

What makes it stand out:

* It's a GMT400 that has been taken well care of.
* Factory original fiberglas, paintmatched singlepiece runningboards and fenderflares.
* Security cameras behind front mirror and top center rear glass.
* Yellow St John Health System parking pass 5727.

First of all, I'm from Kansas and the Kansas Turnpike Authority (KTA) takes cards. Then on a US highway toward Tulsa, I went up to a toll booth and was informed that I can only pay in cash or check. I didn't carry cash but luckily I had checks, so I had to spend an extra 90 seconds to write it for her.

Thankfully she advised me of a service area where I could get cash back during a purchase with a debit card, so I stopped there to take a break, get a small meal for the road, and $10 cash back. (2 $5's.)

Then I went to a second tollbooth and paid $1.50 and got change back.

After passing Tulsa, I took an exit for Claremore and had to stop at an unmanned tollbooth with a coin receptacle that asked me to pay $1 only in coins. I only had 2 quarters in my wallet but plenty of bills. I knew this was going to be awkward.

I threw a dollar bill in the coin receptacle anyway and moved on. I knew the light was still red, and I knew there were cameras. I was in a rental car with out-of-state plates so hopefully nothing will trace back to me.

WHY DIDN'T THE AUTOMATED TOLLBOOTH HAVE A BILL INSERTER? Why didn't it have a card swiping crevice? (Or a card chip reader?)

I was so MAJORLY turned off by the outdatedness of your turnpike system that I decided my return trip back home in my new vehicle would avoid toll roads, even if it's longer and has more stops and turns than the highways did coming in.

So why hasn't Oklahoma's turnpike system been updated with the ability to take cards by now? Why aren't the unmanned toll stops equipped to take dollar bills?

Until the payment choices get brought up to the times, I'll avoid toll roads the next time I ever drive through Oklahoma.",oklahoma,Your turnpikes TURN ME OFF. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM? (Why are they SO outdated?)

The problem is this whole pandemic has destroyed all of that for me, essentially a bunch of my crew got laid off, and I’m being demoted and transferred to another store as a co manager, technically I shouldn’t know that until tomorrow, but I found out. Anyways... I feel like this company is not valuing me like they should. I have put in SO much work here to be demoted because of money!! This has been my only job. Ever. Leaving will break my heart, but I can’t afford the pay drop, and I don’t know if I can emotionally handle the betrayal I feel, I’ve put in other applications, and I’ve gotten a few calls back that I’ve ignored... I guess I’m hoping they’ll change their mind and give me my job back. I go to talk to my bosses tomorrow, and then I’ll have to decide what I want to do... any advice? Stay and take the demotion?

So the best way to not die from the Corona Virus is to never be tested for the Corona Virus...

&amp;#x200B;

Other states with similar death counts to ours have 1500-3000ish more confirmed cases.         
 (shown below) So either we're doing a terrible job of testing people and actually finding out who is infected ( my opinion) or our state is doing a terrible job of keeping people alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the  [median age of the infected cases is 56](https://coronavirus.health.ok.gov/)  and the  [median age of oklahoma is 36](https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/oklahoma-population/) , obviously there's a lot of infected people not being tested.

last week  I heard that the requirements for the drive in testing centers was that you needed to have a fever and be over 18. as if the virus discriminates by age.  I also couldn't find any information on how much it would cost to be tested there.

Also have seen stories that coroners are being refused testing kits to confirm the cause of death was or was not the virus. We'll never have a true number of how many people die from this virus.

He was sent out of school for the semester because his grades were not good enough and has been staying with different friends since the lockdown. He has currently been told to vacate a room that was previously free in a friends hostel because someone paid the caretaker for the room. He doesn’t have anywhere to go now and he has been told to vacate the premises by tomorrow. Please if anyone knows of a building that has an empty room for rent we would be extremely grateful. We are not very rich but we’re not cash strapped either so we can afford rooms with decent prices . Please any help would be appreciated right now.  Thank you in Advance.,oklahoma,Help. My junior brother is stranded in Oklahoma.
