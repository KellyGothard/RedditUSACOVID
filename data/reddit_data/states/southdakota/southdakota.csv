That dude zoomed past the slowing line of traffic, fishtailing the whole time, and we were shocked to see that he wasn't among the population of cars in the ditch.  


Slow down. That's the most important thing. Take your cues from traffic. If traffic around you is suddenly slowing down and moving into one particular lane, follow suit. Brake way before you think you have to.

SD obviously lacks major cities and large college towns (I guess Brookings is the 4th largest city in SD but isn‚Äôt really a liberal college town), so you‚Äôre really counting on Sioux Falls, Rapid City, and Aberdeen to deliver strong ‚Äúyes‚Äù margins.

129,Brocko103,"Please, if you can go 50+, don't use your emergency flashers. Chances are, everyone is slowed down, and your speed is not really an emergency if everyone is slowed down. Now, if you have to slow down significantly, or you're stuck on the shoulder of the road, absolutely use the flashers. I've seen people drive for 3-4 hours with their lights flashing while they maintain speeds of 65 and better. Same trip, I used my flashers for maybe 1 mile when the car in front of me went in the ditch. I slowed down by 20 mph and hopefully warned the people behind me. The biggest problem is that the flashers nullify the turn signals, so nobody knows when you're turning, and if your brakes and signals share the same bulb, it takes other drivers more time to detect when you brake.

My biggest piece of advice is to watch out when the road changes direction. The road might be good enough to drive full speed until the road direction changes and the wind and snow blow across differently.  [You won't drive through here, but this is a good example.](https://earth.google.com/web/@43.87964064,-99.73979548,531.30590331a,17223.75395326d,35y,-0h,0t,0r/data=MicKJQojCiExNmd0SzBodDJ1S1kwb3ZTdUhuckJ3d2NYYXhscmpBRUg) I don't drive across the state too often, but I've seen more cars go off the road here than any other mile of I-90 (except maybe at the Tilford exit near Sturgis).",1578412281,fdgzu5c

If there are more specific problems in the amendment, then it would be pretty cool of you to list an example or two for the people who won't seek out the amendment and read it.

I agree that amendments are not the best mode of lawmaking, but I acknowledge the necessity when the lawmakers ignore the will of the people. I also recognize that the voting public as a whole is a bit dumb, so creating laws by amendment can be dangerous. Personally, I have to agree 100% with a ballot question, or I vote against it.

In Belle Fourche, we are hoping they can get into the Top 5 and win. They will be giving $500,000 to the winning city and bringing in experts to help the ""downtown small business owners"". This will envigorate the entire Black Hills if they can pull it out which will only increase the property value of our town. The Hospital in Spearfish will be breaking ground on a new facility north on highway 85 which is the 4 lane highway that directly leads into Belle Fourche.

There are, though, a LOT of very vocal wackadoos among the Republican voters, and as a result the Legislators. A guy I went to college with serves in the Legislature and last year he brought a bill at my suggestion ti fix a loophole in our adultery laws because as the statute is written same-sex adultery doesn't count for adultery in terms of grounds for divorce. When it came into a hearing some committee members trotted out the marriage with animals comparisons, so that should tell you something. Quantitatively, the Republican Party has a supermajority in the Legislature and that's not going away any time soon.

Our Governor was our U.S. House Representative, didn't actually show up to do her job (missing a large number of votes and committee meetings, instead going to fundraisers), and in general is basically what you'd expect from the *stereotypical* (‚Üêmust emphasize) beauty queen that she is. She still won, likely mainly because of West River and the other pockets that would vote Republican if Satan himself were running on the GOP ticket.

Likewise, drugs like fentanyl and krokodil are too dangerous to be used accept in heavily controlled, clinical settings.   Having said that, if we're going to allow people to self regulate caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol, it's only fair we allow them to self regulate a drug that falls somewhere between caffeine and tobacco for long-term health effects.  Nothing wrong with debating where the limits should be and making adjustments.

Unless we adopt a Swiss model of providing drugs to people in a safe, clinical environment I do not see how anyone can ethically or morally justify the legalization of ""all drugs.""",1578925081,fe8dov5
237,captain-whamco,"Whenever prohibition is tried it turns out to be a colossal failure, look at the Volstead Act.

Even in the most restrictive Society, maximum security prisons, drug use is still prevalent.

238,hallese,"No problem, you show me how it is going to be done in a safe, clinical environment, and I'll give you my support.  The solution is not to tell people ""Sure, go ahead and make meth in your basement and get all methed out to your heart's desire.""  Your proposal is based on a civil liberties argument, fine, let's go down that road.  But, if we're going to do that, we should no longer require first responders and health professionals to lend aid to these people.  It's known that fentanyl, heroin, meth, krokodil, etc. will kill you very easily.  You don't want your tax dollars going to waste on a War on Drugs?  Cool, me neither.  I also don't want them to go to waste on someone who willingly chose to ingest/inject a product that has a high probability of killing them.  You want them to be allowed to do what makes them happy, I want to let them go out happy, sounds like a good compromise?

There's no half measures if we are going to de-regulate all drugs.  You either go all in and control the entire process from production to user, which means building and providing safe environments to use these drugs or you tell people they are completely on their own.  

Citing the 18th Amendment is a little factious and you know it.  How many of the founding fathers were cooking meth on their plantations?  How many were distilling whisky and making wine?  It's a ridiculous comparison, like comparing a slingshot to a sniper rifle.  Sure they are technically both projectile weapons, but that's about where the comparisons end.  This isn't an unheard of practice, either, we do this with prescription drugs as well.  If Acetaminophen were discovered today it would never be allowed to be sold over the counter because the line between a safe dose and lethal dose (23 extra strength Tylenol is a lethal dose for an adult, FYI) is too fine.  Because it's been around for so long and most people know how to safely use it, Tylenol is still allowed over the counter but Oxycontin is not.  

Do you want no prohibitions on prescription drugs as well?  How about firearms?  That's another form of prohibition.  Why shouldn't I be allowed to build a nuclear device in my basement?  Why can't I pump as much water as I want out of the river to water my fields?

Oh, and back to your maximum security prisons example.  Even the gangs at SDSP recognize that certain drugs are too dangerous and need to be regulated.  The gangs have established rules for when and how synthetic marijuana can and will be used within Jameson and Unit C because it's too dangerous to be unregulated.  In your prime example for why drugs can't be regulated there's an authority that has established regulations for their safe use.

The solution is not no regulation, it's better regulations and better identifying which drugs can and cannot be used legally.",1578929781,fe8rl6t

242,hallese,"No, my solution is to actually allow discussion, debate, and a relaxation of drug laws.  The number of people smoking marijuana is far higher than the number taking meth, there is use for the latter, but should only be done so with a prescription which is currently the only legal way to take meth.  Similarly, I think psilocybin should be legalized and an argument can be made for MDMA.  I'm sure there's more, too, but I've never had much of a desire to try any drugs other than caffeine and alcohol so that's about all I can name off the top of my head for what I think should be allowed.  You'll never convince me, however, that we should legalize a drug that requires a microscope in order to visualize a lethal dose or that can cause your skin to rot and fall off after limited use should be legalized.

As a disclaimer though, I'm also the crazy guy that thinks under our current drug laws, there's no logical reason why tobacco and alcohol are allowed but marijuana is not, so just to be consistent in their application, IMO, either marijuana needs to be decriminalized or those two need to be banned immediately.",1578933183,fe91gmq

247,Obeythelab,"I have a theory on why Noem suddenly changed her mind about industrial hemp only *after* medical and recreational marijuana made it to the ballot.  Unfortunately the industrial hemp market is oversaturated and most first time growers this year lost a lot money on hemp.  

Colorado, Washington, and Oregon have several years ahead of everyone else, therefore they are able to reliably provide high quality industrial hemp to manufacturers.  Whereas most of the first time farmers have over saturated the market with low quality industrial hemp that no one wants to buy.  SD will likely be no different come next fall.  Sure if you give it a few years the market will rebound and become profitable again.  And farmers will have more experience with, and be better at, growing high quality industrial hemp.  

So just in time for the November election, the hemp harvest will be in and is likely to not produce nearly the anticipated profits, or any profits at all.  Noem and others will seize on this and claim our ""experiment"" in industrial hemp was a failure, and try to use that argument to put more nails in the coffin of medicinal or recreational marijuana.  While one really has nothing to do with the other it will make for a great sound bite for those opposed to all marijuana.",1578943827,fea30bh

340,elsolonumber1,"I did something similar a few years back except I moved from SD to small town IA. Lived in Mitchell for a couple of years as well for school shortly before I moved.

When I moved to IA I started out going to the local pub. I know you don't drink but you don't have to. Playing pool or darts are activities that leave themselves open for people to join in. I never used to do that kind of thing but it turned into a great social activity. If you are completely against going to a bar there is the James Valley Community Center which has pool tables, ping pong, and a whole list of other activities.

One thing I did was try to do things with my coworkers. Grab a coffee, run to Walmart together, grab lunch, etc. Many of the people I met and became friends with were introduced to me by my co-workers. I pretty much accepted any invitation offered to me. From going to dinner with a bunch of people I had never met except my new landlord to helping my coworkers buddy move one weekend. Not all were good experiences, but it all worked out. 

The one thing I would suggest is keeping the negative comments to a minimum. From your comments it appears you don't like the town or the type of people in it. Keep that to yourself because in my experience once people find out you don't like the place they call home they likely won't have much time for you. SD people are a different breed (trust me I'm one of them) and many will defend their hometown til their dying breath. Just keep an open mind and try out some new activities.

And if that fails, Sioux Falls is less than an hour away. If you can't find something to do there on a weekend you aren't trying hard enough. Good luck,",1579213886,fel4ilf

Most of the time I do end up going to SF to go to the mall and just be around people or walk around and be near other people and out of my apartment.

409,Goodfri55,"I‚Äôve ended up in Mitchell off and on the last couple of years for work and have spent sometimes over a week there on a couple of those trips, I‚Äôve always rather enjoyed ending up there. My job is fairly social so I end up meeting a lot of different people through the day so by the time I retire back to my hotel room I‚Äôm not really in the mingle mood.  I do spend a lot of time on the road which is normally isolating, which admittedly is sometimes rather nice. Anyway, music is how I occupy my time and my mind. I‚Äôm an avid record collector so I‚Äôm always popping into local record stores, antique stores, or looking in the local news or FB to see if there‚Äôs any garage sales or local listings in different areas. A lot of the times when looking for music you find other people looking for music and you learn so much about others when talking about their music and/or the impact different works have on their life. And if records and the equipment are a little speedy cassettes and CDs can have the same effect and can have a lot more value if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. For instance, some of the best and most interesting people I‚Äôve met have been are owners of record stores/antique stores through ND/SD/IA (I travel between Bismarck and Cedar Rapids frequently for work, but am most of the time between Grand Forks and Sioux Falls) and fellow collectors. Also learning an instrument is very rewarding and I normally travel with a guitar or at least frequent local guitar shops and easily meet people that way. For me, I love it when I end up and a guitar shop or antique/record store and see someone there that I saw there months ago and we start talking again about different music we‚Äôve come across.

No, that is not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 

The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth. For preadolescents it is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.

Any competent doctor or therapist who has any reasonable grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/) than that, but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes, the gender identity expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The gender identities of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender identity, and some of those young kids are trans. A child whose gender identity is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their appearance, will suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.

When this happens, transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is purely social; it consists of allowing the child to express their gender identity as comes naturally to them. If they just have gender atypical interests or clothing preferences, let them have the toys and clothes they want. If they want to use a name or pronouns atypical to the gender they were previously assumed to be, let them do that too. If they later decide they don't want to do this anymore, nothing has been changed that can't be changed back in an afternoon. Let the child explore their gender, there's no reason not to.

For adolescents, the first line of medical intervention is puberty delaying treatment. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment, then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects.

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning, about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition, that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

Transition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/).

And ""regret"" rates among trans surgical patients (who again, are all young adults or older) are consistently found to be about 1% and falling. This includes a lot of people who are very happy they transitioned, and continue to live as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth, but regret that medical error or shitty luck led to low quality surgical results.

This is a risk in any reconstructive surgery, and a success rate of about 99% is astonishingly good for any medical treatment. And ""regret"" rates have been going down for decades, as surgical methods improve.

* [**Care of the Patient Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS)**](http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf) \- *Persistent regret among post-operative transsexuals has been studied since the early 1960s. The most comprehensive meta-review done to date analyzed 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies published between 1961 and 1991 (1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients). The authors concluded that in this 30 year period, &lt;1% of female-to-males (FTMs) and 1-1.5% of male-to-females (MTFs) experienced persistent regret following SRS. Studies published since 1991 have reported a decrease in the incidence of regret for both MTFs and FTMs that is likely due to improved quality of psychological and surgical care for individuals undergoing sex reassignment.*

There is *extensive* research about long term use of puberty blockers, and they have overwhelmingly been shown to be very gentle and safe.

This treatment isn't just used for trans youth - it has been the standard treatment for kids with precocious puberty for decades. Most kids with precocious puberty don't have any underlying medical condition, their early development is just an extreme variation of normal development, but it would still cause serious psychological damage to start puberty at the age of, say, 6. 

This treatment has no long term side effects; it just puts puberty on hold. Stop treatment, and puberty picks up where it left off.

If not desired (which a lot of trans women don't), they will have an 11 or 12 year olds penis instead of an adult male. 
- There have been no serious long term study of the effects of luprone, and [women who were on it as children have reported serious damage.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/women-fear-drug-they-used-to-halt-puberty-led-to-health-problems)

If they go through puberty, permanent changes happen to their body which may make a successful transition more difficult later on. By using safe drugs to block those changes for a couple of years, they get the chance to make the decision with a little more world experience under their belt once they are adults. 

There are not life-altering decisions being made for trans minors, other than allowing them to dress and act the way they want to.  In the case of trans kids that is often life-altering in a very good way (much lower levels of depression and suicide in trans kids that get support as opposed to having to hide how they feel).

&gt; *""Spack, however, is quick to point out that there is no risk of infertility from the hormone-blocking treatment alone. Infertility only comes when the hormone-blocking treatment is paired with Stage 2, the use of opposite-sex hormones.""*

Puberty blockers are 100% temporary and fully reversible.

Hormone treatment, which is only an option once the patient is in their early/mid-teens and the chances of them ""desisting"" are basically zero, carries some risk of infertility, though not a guarantee. For the adolescents who need this treatment, this is an acceptable risk.

* Regarding penile inversion vaginoplasty - this is only one method among many. It's the most common one, but for those who aren't good candidates for it, there are others with excellent results.

Of course, an adolescent trans woman may opt to go off hormone treatment specifically for the purpose of going through male puberty so she can later be a good candidate for penile inversion vaginoplasty. But somehow, no young trans women seem to think that's worth the trade off.

* There have been decades of studies on the long term effects of puberty blockers, and they have overwhelmingly proven to be safe and effective. Every medication has some risks associated with it - asprin can kill you if you're unlucky enough, and antibiotics can lead to [** Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_epidermal_necrolysis) which causes your skin to fall off and your organs to shut down. But these risks are very low, and for the patients who genuinely need the treatment (ie, not giving puberty blockers for trivial reasons, like getting an extra inch or two of height in an otherwise perfectly healthy adolescent) the damage that will definitely be caused by *not* providing treatment vastly outweighs the tiny risk of complications from providing it.

* ""Chemical castration"" is a bullshit term. This treatment does nothing but put puberty on hold. No permanent effects = no fucking castration.

* The lack of consensus regarding early medical intervention is whether the current age limits are *too high.* Meaning that hormone therapy shouldn't be withheld until the patient is 16+; that is very old to not have started puberty at all yet, and most trans youth can be taken off blockers and put on actual hormone therapy several years earlier.",1579552500,ff3zwca

Just to keep stuff fair.
6. [Clinical Trials that are a-ok! Nothing is wrong!](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/07/nhs-transgender-clinic-accused-covering-negative-impacts-puberty/) Don't worry about little Timmy.

517,EggIsMyFriend,"I encourage you to read the above summary that u/tgier thoughtfully wrote. That should answer some of your questions. 

Parents and children do make life-altering decisions in many areas of their lives, all the time. Specifically relating to gender, parents and doctors of intersex children even choose their child's gender, and that is fairly life-altering. They don't always choose correctly. And those kids have to live with that. This bill supports making those choices for intersex children, and those choices include sex assignment surgery on children. Which is something that NO ONE in the trans community would EVER support. 

When it comes to transgender kids, delaying puberty is safe and reversible. Any social transitioning done, which is no more than name/pronouns/clothes, is easily fixed if the child decides they are not trans. Nothing permanent and surgical is done for children. They're children. 

This give them room to just be kids, to figure themselves out without the specter of puberty irreversibly damaging their bodies if they decide they are trans. This gives them room, gives them time. It holds the clock still, long enough. And if they are trans, it makes the rest of their lives easier by such a massive degree that there really aren't words for it. And if they aren't? That's great, too. And us trans folks are gonna be happy for them either way. And these kids get a chance us older trans people didn't. We have do deal with what puberty did to us for the rest of our lives. I'd give so much to go back and have that chance. This isn't a Republican or Democrat issue. This isn't a religious issue.

537,EightyObselete,"&gt;Any competent doctor or therapist who has any reasonable grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.


Hormone blockers are NOT safe as you'd like to believe. They carry a lot of extreme side effects and should not be handed out like candy as you are suggesting. Children are children. They're confused as is. By your logic, almost every child should be given hormone blockers. Plenty of doctors in the transgender/gender dysphoria have been willing to push the boundaries of ethical treatment for trans children. Not sure why you are trying to appeal to authority here.

&gt;According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 

You linked to a paper brought upon by the Human Rights Campaign which is about as far left as the Heritage Foundation is right. Just because a child shows signs of their gender identity at four does not mean you should hand out hormone blockers to those that are confused. 

&gt;But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest.


Citation needed for all of this.


&gt;he only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth, and dramatically improves trans youth's mental health. When prevented from transitioning, about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition, that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health

The first study you linked here was one of self reported anxiety and depression among *children* which creates the most massive opportunity for biases and nonobjective data. This study isn't conclusive and the sample size of transgender children is only 60.

541,Ebincluwne,"&gt;Weird Obsession

I assure you that my weird and unwholesome obsession to read off the back of drug labels and inform you about the side effects is entirely sexual in nature. Class action lawsuits are the only way I can gain an erection ever since the Reagan presidency fell through.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The very low risk 

If you'd actually read any of the clinical trials you'd know that it occurs in 40%-50% of Lupron patients. A 45% risk isn't a very low risk, and it's extremely dishonest for you to portray it as such. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Antibiotics can cause your skin to peel off

Antibiotics which cause significant harm to the human body are only used as a last resort treatment and generally prescribed to cattle instead. An antibiotic that *can* have bad side effects is rarely used. An antibiotic that *consistently has* bad side effects may be banned for human use all together and require permission from a medical commission to be used on a case by case basis.

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly, such an antibiotic wouldn't be sold over the counter as a cure for every single thing - Including prostate cancer, manletism, headaches, back pains and such.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you take testosterone, by the way? And if so, how long? I'm curious if you ignore the debilitating side-effects. I've known like 8 trans dudes who stopped doing that and only tried passing socially since they said it's hell to take it after a while.

&amp;#x200B;

It's kind of funny, every single other group who has been prescribed Lupron, including the prostate cancer patients it was intended for, have rejected the drug or at least filed a class action against it. The only people defending it are you, due to purely ideological reasons. Must be a goldmine these days to synthesize a politically progressive chemical compound like that.

If you're visiting furthur north (Pierre, Aberdeen, Watertown, etc), then it typically gets colder. Blizzards are more common up there than in Sioux Falls that time of year. 

Rapid City is known as the ""banana belt"" of SD. The city can be 50degF highs while the rest of the state is closer to 20degF. Move up into the hills, though, and its colder and more snow. Coldest and snowiest is typically up around Deadwood.

Do you think your dysphoria is ever going to let you lead a happy life? Do you think, that dysphoria would ever let the majority of transgender people live happy lives?

I don't. I've seen the misery you live with, I'm not impressed. You say the surgeries help, but I haven't seen anyone feel less dysphoric afterwards. I've seen people complain about the medical complications, though. Few weeks back there was this case, some famous trans e-sports player had OD'd on painkillers in her sleep. Apparently paid out $5000 in cash to a thai chop doc to get ribs removed and ""shoulders shortened"" so she looks thinner, like an anime character. The surgery apparently left her with chronic pain, partially paralyzed too. 

People were saying, if folk had been more supportive of the surgeries, if they'd given more money for surgeries she might still be alive. I disagree with that. I feel like this dysphoria business might not leave you the best judge of what's good for your health. Or the health of children.",1579782343,ffbtnwc

647,fanofswords,"Sure but we give antibiotics that are big guns and have a high risk of TEN for dangerous infections that could kill you. A large percentage of young kids will  **desist** from feeling like they are in the wrong body. There is a great concern that by giving these kids drugs, puberty blockers, ect, we are prolonging what might just be a ""phase"" and might change. There *may be* an argument for those people who did not desist in their desire to be another gender but that is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. If gender dysphoria is as biological as some claim, how is it possible that the rate of trans female to male has increased so much in the last ten years. What do you make of desisters or those who suffer from rPid onset gender dysphoria.

It is insane to me that young children, whose brains, we know via science, have not finished developing until 25, are allowed to make life changing decisions on what their bodies will look like or seem like at very young ages.

And my other concern is that with the new onset of ""yes means yes"" treatment, without proper vetting or thought, we might be giving drugs to many people who are NOT TRANS. Who DO NOT have dysphoria. We are so desperate to protect those trans people who may commit suicide, we've lost all proportion in the medical community. And many of us in the community have deep reservations about what we are doing. 

Because here is the thing. In the belly of the beast, no one can see the light. 10 years ago, the same way you are arguing for puberty blockers and cross sex hormones, people were arguing that was pain was the 5th vital sign and morphine should be given if you stubbed your toe. The media has painted those who argued for this as evil pharmaceuticals, but they weren't. THey were people like you who believed they were doing the right thing. Now 20 years later, we have an opioid epidemic on our hands and life expectancy is falling for the 3 or 4th year in a row.

I am afraid.

I am afraid that in ten years, people will look at  doctors and ask: ""Why did you let me get on hormones? I just suffered rape and that trauma made me feel like I wanted to be a man. But I'm actually a woman. Or these hormones have ruined my life and made me develop a stroke at 35. Or my kid's IQ never recovered after puberty blockers and now she can no longer have a child."" I am afraid we will read headlines and books titled ""The Gender Epidemic"" and detransitioners will show up on our TV's and newspapers saying that the medical field failed them.

I am afraid that womanhood is now being defined as a feeling. Despite the fact that many woman I know, along with myself, don't have any type of internal feeling of being ""women"". I am concerned that trans kids often say they want to transition because they liked dolls growing up and pink cars but I grew up hating pink and playing with leggos and I'm still a woman. I am concerned that the definition of woman is being collapsed into this awful pink ghetto ""Run daintily. Play with dolls"" You must be a girl. "" Speak loudly and play with cars. You must be a boy"". I am concerned that generations of women will think they are gender non conforming because they don't fit into these crazy stereotypes perpetuated by the media and many trans activists.

When the trans educator came to my school he said. ""What do we think of when we think of a man?"" A sports car. Women, if you were asking, were minivans. Despite the fact that I don't like minivans. And no woman I know dreams of driving a minivan.

We were all afraid to say what we thought. We didn't want to be labelled as evil or transphobic or bad people.

I am afraid that we've jumped on this movement, without thought, without care. without knowledge or concern for the consequence on kids. on boys. on women. and on little girls who are just trying to gather the shattered slivers of who they are and form selves in a society that disdains them.

So yes, I am afraid.",1579799507,ffche8k

Partially the cops, state government, and all newspapers being against it. Partially by grossly underfunding it. Partially by Jackley (who was AG at the time) donating a couple hundred to the opposition. Partially by getting out-funded 2:1 by the opposition. Partially by poor management of the campaign (for a brief period of time, campaign HQ was the Red Eye bar on Cliff)

What recent actions being done by state administrative agencies and what are the ramifications? In general, South Dakota has terrible local news, in my opinion (Kelo and the Argus try, but I always end up looking elsewhere to learn about things going on in the state because those publications are written like blog entries since they cut staff -- a good example is Jodi Scwan's siouxfalls.business).

So they can then buy the skin of that character which is likely gonna cost anywhere between 15-20 dollars. For some kids this game is as addictive as a drug. Sure blame it on bad parenting but seriously this games only success comes from the little kids who have no grasp on the concept of money. Let alone good spending habits.

League of Legends, super Smash Bros and Rocket League are all games that appeal to kids and adults alike. But it's not because you can buy a skin of your favorite streamer it's because the games alone are enjoyable. If you get enjoyment out of fortnite go ahead and play it. But the game has not done anything innovative or unique to capture attention. They get it through marketing primarily of already well established pop culture icons such as Star Wars. So this is just my opinion but I would prefer a game with a better target demographic. Most adults probably dont play interest and have any intrest in it. That's why esports like smash bros and rocket league work well. Kids and adults both enjoy them and it's simple to catch on too. That's what makes sports so interesting.

Since anything relating to trans youth and medical treatment almost inevitably brings out the *""kids are being castrated!""* and *""90% of trans kids desist and will regret transition!""* concern trolling:

No, that is not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 

The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth. For preadolescents it is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.

Any competent doctor or therapist who has any reasonable grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/) than that, but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes, the gender identity expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The gender identities of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender identity, and some of those young kids are trans. A child whose gender identity is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their appearance, will suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.

When this happens, transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is purely social; it consists of allowing the child to express their gender identity as comes naturally to them. If they just have gender atypical interests or clothing preferences, let them have the toys and clothes they want. If they want to use a name or pronouns atypical to the gender they were previously assumed to be, let them do that too. If they later decide they don't want to do this anymore, nothing has been changed that can't be changed back in an afternoon. Let the child explore their gender, there's no reason not to.

For adolescents, the first line of medical intervention is puberty delaying treatment. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment, then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects.

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning, about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition, that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

Transition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/).

And ""regret"" rates among trans surgical patients (who again, are all young adults or older) are consistently found to be about 1% and falling. This includes a lot of people who are very happy they transitioned, and continue to live as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth, but regret that medical error or shitty luck led to low quality surgical results.

This is a risk in any reconstructive surgery, and a success rate of about 99% is astonishingly good for any medical treatment. And ""regret"" rates have been going down for decades, as surgical methods improve.

* [**Care of the Patient Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS)**](http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf) \- *Persistent regret among post-operative transsexuals has been studied since the early 1960s. The most comprehensive meta-review done to date analyzed 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies published between 1961 and 1991 (1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients). The authors concluded that in this 30 year period, &lt;1% of female-to-males (FTMs) and 1-1.5% of male-to-females (MTFs) experienced persistent regret following SRS. Studies published since 1991 have reported a decrease in the incidence of regret for both MTFs and FTMs that is likely due to improved quality of psychological and surgical care for individuals undergoing sex reassignment.*

891,tgjer,"Since anything relating to trans youth and medical treatment almost inevitably brings out the *""kids are being castrated!""* and *""90% of trans kids desist and will regret transition!""* concern trolling:

No, that is not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 

The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth. For preadolescents it is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.

Any competent doctor or therapist who has any reasonable grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/) than that, but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes, the gender identity expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The gender identities of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender identity, and some of those young kids are trans. A child whose gender identity is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their appearance, will suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.

When this happens, transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is purely social; it consists of allowing the child to express their gender identity as comes naturally to them. If they just have gender atypical interests or clothing preferences, let them have the toys and clothes they want. If they want to use a name or pronouns atypical to the gender they were previously assumed to be, let them do that too. If they later decide they don't want to do this anymore, nothing has been changed that can't be changed back in an afternoon. Let the child explore their gender, there's no reason not to.

For adolescents, the first line of medical intervention is puberty delaying treatment. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment, then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects, and it significantly improves trans youth's mental health and [**lowers suicidality**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/01/21/peds.2019-1725).

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression.

I understand after some research that this is the best course of action some doctors will recommend to treat gender dysphoria, it just seems unbelievable to me that the best option to treat gender dysphoria in young people is to artificially introduce hormones that will delay their natural development.

I have no problem with adults doing whatever they please with their body, but we are talking about children here, and many children can be impressionable and think that they are trans when they are not, then they change their minds.

Artificially introducing hormones to stop the natural development of a child seems wrong to me, not only because there's potential side effects to these hormones which include decreased bone density, heart problems, and fertility issues.

In the example that you used that might be a good option, but many trans people decide that they want to have children later in life (part of living a normal life and feeling accepted in a society in which a lot of people have children). I'm totally comfortable with the idea of trans people raising children, but blocking their natural development could potentially deny them this option later in life when they make that decision. This is the same reason young women aren't allowed to have their tubes tied (most of the time) until they reach a certain age - and this is common medical practice.

Another potential problem I see with this is the fact that you have a young person developing completely different from all of their peers. If you block puberty, you essentially have an individual with the mind and body of a child all the way through high school; while their peers develop naturally the way evolution has made us develop for millions of years.

I am all for trans rights, and I'm not a hateful person; I just wonder why this would be the best course of action with all these potential consequences; not to mention the fact that suicide rate is also very high in people with different mental disorders other than dysphoria, but the treatment for that is not to completely block the natural development of their bodies.",1580392793,ffzty2p

Yes, but there are side effects to these artificial hormones, they stop the natural development of people's bodies, and even if no ill side effects come from this; you still have a child with a child's brain, a child's body, and a child's hormones going through middle school/high school while the rest of their peers develop naturally.

This sounds like the most extreme possible measure, what's more extreme than artificially halting a young person's development?

Hormones play a role in body development, muscle growth, bone development, mental development; it's not a trivial thing. It's a very extreme measure.

If you are saying that this extreme measure is what is needed in some cases, then that should definitely be between the parents and the doctors (since the child cannot consent yet); but this isn't something that should be normalized; it is QUITE more extreme than therapy or even psychotropic medications.",1580419937,fg13azq

IMO, putting off puberty for a couple years is really not a big deal. Developmentally there is plenty of range for when it starts for kids anyways. The other option is to hope the dysphoria goes away after  puberty, and if it doesn't suicide rates go way up.

Evil is when you cause irreversible harm to someone. And someone can call protesting on a private person's lawn a threat.

**Province of Silesia**

The Province of Silesia (German: Provinz Schlesien; Polish: Prowincja ≈ölƒÖska; Silesian: Prowincyj≈è ≈öl≈çnsk≈è) was a province of Prussia from 1815 to 1919. The Silesia region was part of the Prussian realm since 1740 and established as an official province in 1815, then became part of the German Empire in 1871. In 1919, as part of the Free State of Prussia within Weimar Germany, Silesia was divided into the provinces of Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia. Silesia was reunified briefly from 1938 to 1941 as a province of Nazi Germany before being divided back into Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia.

But I will say I think your argument against it about Rapid City High being too close to traffic and homelessness is a weak one. A much better argument against is the general hesitation of increasing taxes. Higher property taxes makes housing more expensive and could cause a slump in the housing market due to some moving out and others being more hesitant to move in. Likewise, I question whether the District has actually done the extensive self-reflection to determine if it could cut back spending and perhaps reduce its demand to make its budget stretch farther - something all households do if they have a large upcoming purchase.

On the other hand, if there‚Äôs any good reason to increase taxes and open the pocketbook, it‚Äôs for the youth of today who are the leaders of tomorrow. I trust the District could come up with a good plan without 70k micro-managers trying to dictate every details. Too many cooks in the kitchen and all that.

If you operate like a deli, and customers never touch the food until it's handed to them, then you've resolved most of my concerns. It's just that the definition of clean varies from person to person. Would you wash dishes then dry them with the towel you've been using to dry your hands for the past week? I find that disgusting, but my girlfriend seems to think it's fine. If you found a mouse turd in your kitchen, you'd clean top to bottom, right? The last rental property I cleaned out had mouse poop in every drawer, cabinet and cupboard in the kitchen. That much could not possibly accumulate in the 24 hours the house was vacant. Clearly those people lived in those conditions.

1138,Whyuknowthat,"So, for you, this is mostly (perhaps only?) about RCHS. And that‚Äôs a valid argument that I‚Äôm not dismissing. However, I personally don‚Äôt find that argument all that persuasive. I believe the school district can and will find other avenues and ways to help those kids - Likely through programs at the other two high schools. If I‚Äôm being totally honest, I think having a separate high school for this purpose creates inefficiencies and doesn‚Äôt make much sense. And it‚Äôs OK that we have different opinions on that. 

However, all that said, I‚Äôm still not convinced this bond is best for the school district and the people of Rapid City and surrounding areas. According to the bond fact sheet, the increase in taxes for the average home value of Rapid City, $250,000, will be $212 per year or $5,300 total over the 25 year bond. I‚Äôm not convinced building new schools will proportionately increase the quality of education provided to students at those schools. Will there be an improvement? Undoubtedly. Will the improvement outweigh the additional cost per household for that improved education? Yet to be determined. **That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm struggling to decide and will be basing my decision on.**",1580850931,fgjt7us

Stevens is already expected to be over proper functioning capacity in 2025, per the rcasfuture.org website.  Rapid City could sustain an additional high school, considering the expected base expansion.   I'm glad we could have this dialogue and I think when it comes time to vote everyone will vote yes or no for different reasons.  They are running one heck of a yes campaign; it is important for people to know there are valid reasons to vote no- whether it be taxes, RC High, or doubts on how well RCAS can manage money.

1144,Brocko103,"I'm glad you found the constructive in my criticism. I've never been to a zero waste grocery store, so I could be totally wrong about how the business typically operates, so don't take me too seriously.

Another thought I have is self dispensing bins where the customer pulls a knob to dump the product in their container. Anything that prevents a customer from opening a bin and reaching in with a scoop or tongs or fingers. Eventually, you could maybe consider a container exchange program. You sell the jars and return a deposit when the customer returns a clean container. Then you sanitize and return them to the shelf. I imagine that you'd carry a small selection of containers for people who forget or bring too few of their own, so this would be a way to grow that part of the business.

Most of my thoughts were based on dry goods which impacts my opinion. I think it's a little gross for a dozen random people to scoop pasta or cereal out of a bin, but a dozen people pick through the tomatoes, and that's perfectly normal to me.

1231,tgjer,"This is unbelievably fucked up. They are criminalizing desperately needed, frequently life saving medical care.

Since anything relating to trans youth and medical treatment almost inevitably brings out the *""kids are being castrated!""* and *""90% of trans kids desist and will regret transition!""* concern trolling:

No, that is not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 

The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth. For preadolescents it is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.

Any competent doctor or therapist who has any reasonable grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/) than that, but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes, the gender identity expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The gender identities of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender identity, and some of those young kids are trans. A child whose gender identity is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their appearance, will suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.

When this happens, transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is purely social; it consists of allowing the child to express their gender identity as comes naturally to them. If they just have gender atypical interests or clothing preferences, let them have the toys and clothes they want. If they want to use a name or pronouns atypical to the gender they were previously assumed to be, let them do that too. If they later decide they don't want to do this anymore, nothing has been changed that can't be changed back in an afternoon. Let the child explore their gender, there's no reason not to.

For adolescents, the first line of medical intervention is puberty delaying treatment. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment, then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects, and it significantly improves trans youth's mental health and [**lowers suicidality**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/01/21/peds.2019-1725).

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning, about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition, that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

Transition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/).

And ""regret"" rates among trans surgical patients (who again, are all young adults or older) are consistently found to be about 1% and falling. This includes a lot of people who are very happy they transitioned, and continue to live as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth, but regret that medical error or shitty luck led to low quality surgical results.

This is a risk in any reconstructive surgery, and a success rate of about 99% is astonishingly good for any medical treatment. And ""regret"" rates have been going down for decades, as surgical methods improve.

* [**Care of the Patient Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS)**](http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf) \- *Persistent regret among post-operative transsexuals has been studied since the early 1960s. The most comprehensive meta-review done to date analyzed 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies published between 1961 and 1991 (1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients). The authors concluded that in this 30 year period, &lt;1% of female-to-males (FTMs) and 1-1.5% of male-to-females (MTFs) experienced persistent regret following SRS. Studies published since 1991 have reported a decrease in the incidence of regret for both MTFs and FTMs that is likely due to improved quality of psychological and surgical care for individuals undergoing sex reassignment.*

1254,despoiler314,"I believe this was a mistake. Many tribal IDs are compliant with the federal standard and are accepted under the Real-ID initiative from Homeland Security and accepted by the TSA. If you go to the [TSA web page on Real-ID compliance](https://www.tsa.gov/real-id), the 9th question in the FAQ section regards tribal IDs. There is a link to a [list of tribes and reservations that comply with the Real-ID standard](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/02/01/2019-00897/indian-entities-recognized-by-and-eligible-to-receive-services-from-the-united-states-bureau-of).

On this list you can find all [nine of the federally recognized tribes within South Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_Indian_reservations_in_South_Dakota). A couple things to note on this list are, Lake Traverse Indian Reservation is on the list as Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate of the Lake Traverse Reservation, South Dakota, and Turtle Mountain is a listed as Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians of North Dakota because its capital is in North Dakota but the tribal lands are spread over North Dakota, Montana, and South Dakota.

This is why I believe tribal IDs from these nine reservations should be accepted. To not accept these tribal IDs as valid is to doubt the standards set by Homeland Security, which I believe has a vested interest to set the highest standards. That‚Äôs also why I believe the only reason to reject these tribal IDs with this knowledge and high mark, would be to unjustly disenfranchise Native peoples of South Dakota.

Also, when somebody registers with a SDDL or SSN, it's bounced off a database for each, plus a DOH vital records server. This verifies that they're alive and a citizen. If you fake a SDDL and register, they throw out the reg and investigate. Tribes have these databases too, just not combined in to one singular one.

It's no accident that Section 3 bans all contracts but Section 2 exempts some healthcare. His bill in 2011 got A TON of shit for going after healthcare workers. Section 2 criminalizes those who broker, such as Dakota Surrogacy or anybody who posts an ad for a surrogate. Section 3 says contracts independent of the state aren't valid here, an attempt at stopping out of state surrogacy clients.

The thing that's just funny, and I knew Fred Deutsch is gonna read this cuz he's a Redditor too, is that surrogacies are now MORE likely to end in abortion. Firstly, surrogates will look out of state and literally every state is less strict than us. Secondly, and most importantly, as anti-abortion as most of SD is, most contracts would have specified what situations the carrier mother would be able to terminate. If this passes, it'll happen right the fuck whenever the carrier mother alone should so choose. Not a thing that'll happen, surely not more than fetal reduction.

**Visiting Devils Tower: MUST SEE! Bring hiking gear.**

**Devils Tower:** Devils Tower is nestled among Wyoming's Black Hills near the town of Sundance. It's a mass of rock that rises 1,267 feet in the air above the Belle Fourche River, grasslands and ponderosa pine forests. In 1906, Theodore Roosevelt established Devils Tower as our first national monument.The origin of Devils Tower has baffled Native Americans and early explorers for many years. According to Native Americans, seven little girls were playing in the forest when giant bears started chasing them. The girls ran and jumped on a boulder and started praying. The rock then began to grow up toward the sky, putting quite a bit of distance between the girls and the bears. It's said that the cracks and columns on Devils Tower came from the bears' claws as they were trying to climb the tower. **WY-110, Devils Tower, WY 82714**",1581175923,fgxrkx5

1328,KnightOfAshes,"You sound like a troll and based on your post history you probably are, but I'll bite for the sake of everyone who may not realize what was at stake: hormone blockers are quite literally a way of waiting and seeing for kids. If a kid has been having feelings of gender dysphoria, they get absolutely massive amounts of therapy from trained specialists. If their fear of regular puberty is strong enough that the therapist and doctor both think blockers are warranted, the kid goes on blockers and stays on them until adulthood, or until they decide they want to go through normal puberty after all (which is a very low percentage of cases). Once they're in adulthood, the therapist and doctor in combination can then authorize HRT and the kid essentially undergoes only the one puberty. Not all trans people figure out their gender as children, hell some don't figure it out until their 40s-60s, but for the ones that do, the prospect of going through what they feel is the wrong puberty is overwhelming. If they actually are forced to go through normal puberty, the risk of the kid committing suicide massively increases.

&gt;We have a number of other reports on him - with photos

‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll find ten posts from the previous fourteen months, and the photos include:

3 pics of the Seal of a US District Court of South Dakota

1 pic of the Seal of the United States District Court of Montana

2 photos of US District Attorney Ron Parsons, one with his assistants.

1 photo of a child victim, which is far clearer than any photo you posted of the perpetrator.  (I‚Äôm still trying to wrap my head around this one.)

1 ridiculously [altered-to-be-more-scary-but-won‚Äôt-help-identify-the-pedo photo](https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/sdpb/files/styles/x_large/public/201902/predator-signature-image-5.jpg) that you got from PBS, and is obviously photoshopped from the much better but still crappy [passport photo](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/patrick-stanley-weber-sexual-abuse-pine-ridge-blackfeet-reservation/) you could have used from PBS‚Äôs own FRONTLINE article.

And FINALLY 1 photo of Stanley Patrick Weber, [which is in the ‚Äúradio story‚Äù](https://listen.sdpb.org/post/stanley-weber-trial-retrospective) you linked to, even though it‚Äôs from a *retrospective* from *four months ago* and you had to get it from the Wall Street Journal.

So you‚Äôre trying to make it sound like you have ‚Äúnumerous‚Äù other reports on him ‚Äúwith photos‚Äù, but really you‚Äôve barely posted a photo and a half over the last fourteen months.

When you didn‚Äôt include a photo of Stanley Patrick Weber in this post, it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal.  You could have said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd rather focus on the positive and celebrate our DA‚Äù or ‚ÄúFair point, we‚Äôve added his mugshot to the post‚Äù.  And I‚Äôd be cool with that.

But you ARE representing SDPB as a whole.  You have to understand that, my friend.  This hasn't been a personal attack on you, or Victoria-- on the contrary, if you want to make it personal then I personally *thank* you and Victoria for doing your personal parts in sharing this news.  That being said, if you want to frame this as in ""you"", I understand that it can be difficult to separate one's job from one's self (boy, am I guilty of that one), and I'd invite you to join me in keeping in mind that we're human beings sitting at the keyboards.

It seems you take issue with the word ""protecting.""  I have no idea who Victoria is, and I don't have any reason to believe she's personally protecting this pedophile.  If you're saying she's the one responsible for choosing a photo of the DA over a photo of the pedophile (and I don't want to put words in your mouth but I'm trying to repeat back to you what I'm hearing so we know if I understand you correctly), then no problem.  I wouldn't (and didn't) hold her personally accountable, I'm calling out SDPB.  And if it was an honest oversight, then cool.  If you'd argue that it's not an oversight at all (without gaslighting), then I'm open to hearing that too.  Regardless of where you want to lay the blame, I'll accept your accusation that I was too cavalier with the word, if that's what you mean.  I hope I've helped on that point.

As far as who is the ""us"" that was gaslighted, that would be the readers here on reddit.  Surely you'd have to know that; maybe what you mean is ""I haven't gaslighted anybody""?  Let me know so I don't put words in your mouth.

That last bit about ""we're working on it"" is pretty much what I figured would be the defense to that point, if there were a defense at all.  You do see this looks like you're passing the buck to the producers, right?  If you're the guy (gal?) in charge of /u/SDPublicBroadcasting, then it's up to you to converse in real time.  But it would be absolutely within your right to say that this is the timeline you've chosen to converse on, and I would agree that it's your right to do so.  To wit, let's not let that distract us from the main point here: your response that I dissected was some pretty big BS.

I don't blame you for being upset about your work family being attacked.  I think that's admirable, especially given how many ""clock punchers"" there are in the work force.  Kudos to you for taking pride in your craft instead.

So if I'm tracking correctly, our misunderstanding did stem from me using that word ""protecting"".  I can see your point of view that you felt like I was saying something like ""THERE MUST BE A CONSPIRACY AT SDPB BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY DELIBERATELY CHOSE NOT TO PUT A CONVICTED PEDOPHILE'S PICTURE IN THIS POST SO WHAT ARE THEY HIDING AND I BET THEY'RE THE ONES WHO KILLED JEFFREY EPSTEIN!!!""

And I don't blame you.  I take full responsibility for making you feel that way, and before I explain myself, I apologize for that.  If you felt as bad as I have felt from false accusations, then I really am sorry that I caused that.

I think my mis-step was manifold.  This isn't an excuse-- I hope this breakdown helps you to realize I'm telling the truth that I never meant you/SDPB were actively protecting this criminal.

1) I read the post and figured SDPB neglected to put a picture of the guy in.  Not deliberately chose to, just failed to.  I don't think I thought much further than that at the time.

2) I was disappointed that I dug into the comments, found another reader was also wondering what this guy looked like, and there were no answers.

3) I was more disappointed when I found out the other news stations were posting pics of this guy, plus more information, and special-place-in-my-heart-SDPB was lagging behind.

4) I was a smart-ass when I wrote out my comment, and I never even thought about Poe's law when I wrote it.  In fact, I was more concerned about people thinking I was shilling for KELO, but it wasn't a big deal to me, I figured I made my contribution by providing the photo, and left the thread to go browse some more reddit.

Now I'm not backpedaling on what I wrote.  I stand by my assertion that SDPB should have put a photo in there.  I also reiterate that neglecting to put a photo in there wasn't that big of a deal.  And I would venture to guess that you agree, since you've pointed out that you folks are spread thin, and the reporter probably didn't give it much thought, etc.  And all that's okay, I think.  Like I said, not a big deal.

And if we were to split hairs, ""protecting"" is still an accurate word to have used, even if I could have (should have) used a better turn of phrase.  Not that I thought SDPB was intentionally defending this guy, but neglecting to put a photo in versus putting a photo in protected him versus exposing him more.  You may feel I'm being too literal; but when we're analyzing the language being used we kind of have to be in order to get at the truth.  I do agree it would have been better for me to say ""I don't know why SDPB is failing to take away as many protections as this guy can get"" or something like that, and had I thought it would hurt you I would have phrased it less bluntly.

Are we on the same page so far, or am I failing to consider any aspects there?

Cheers.",1581468844,fhcqugb

1367,squimson,"Her study was published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, a very reputable, peer-reviewed journal in the environmental economics field. 

Yes, she did do this study in one state, but that's typically how economic research is done, using a sample to make inferences about entire population. She obtained observational data, watching what type of bags people used when shopping, from bi-weekly store visits over the course of 5 months. Both before and after bag ban policy implementation. This data was to determine how shopper's behavior changed in terms of what type of bags they switched to using after a plastic bag ban. 

In addition to this observational data, she used scanner data from store's POS systems that track items purchased. Using this data, she could track the changes in the amount of trash bags sold after the policy change. This data included sales from before and after the bag ban. 

The results showed the trash bag sales did spike at the beginning of the ban, as you said, but that increase in sales stabilizes over time to 79% higher. She also found that in all months a year or more after a bag ban, 120% higher than stores without a bag ban. All of these results are significant at the 1% level. 

Regarding the observational data, the results show that, in response to plastic bag bans, customers use 3.7 fewer plastic bags, .5 more paper bags, and 0.9 more reusable bags per transaction. This leads to  0.3 fewer pounds of plastic per transaction, 0.06 additional pounds of paper, and 0.22 pounds of reusable bags per transaction. 

The results are statistically significant. Does that mean this should be the be all, end all of the plastic bag debate? Certainly not. But it is food for thought and motivation for further research. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR you should maybe actually read the study before deciding whether or not to put stock in it.",1581567887,fhgiamt
1368,ncte,"Am I missing something? 40million lbs of plastic offset by 12 million lbs of new garbage bag purchases would still be 28 million lbs fewer plastic bags total. 

The last stat also doesn't seem useful. Per transaction things should net out near neutral because the volume needed to store goods shouldn't really change (0.3 vs 0.28 bags/transaction), but  there is no mention of reuse. Is the same plastic tote being counted in the 0.22 increase or are people buying 0.22 new plastic bags per transaction? The latter doesn't seem realistic.",1581575549,fhgqvm1
1369,squimson,"The 12 million lb offset is only taking garbage bags into account. This study is focusing on ""leakage"", how environmental policy can cause an increase in pollution in other areas (essentially a shift of one type of pollution to another). 

&amp;#x200B;

There are other effects that need to be taken into account as well, like the shift to different bag types. 

&amp;#x200B;

The per use transaction is the type of bags being used at checkout, not necessarily bought. It's looking at increase/decrease *in pounds* of that specific type of bag from before and after the ban. Paper bags and reusable bags are much thicker than a traditional single use plastic bag. So even if using the same number of bags, the weights will be increase. 

The lack of mention of reuse is a problem with this study, but other studies show that cloth bags need to be used 131 times before it's better for the environment than one single use plastic bag. Polypropylene bags need to be used 37 times.  Obviously, both are possible, but consumer behavior needs to be considered. Do people really always remember to use their reusable bags or are they more likely to just buy paper at the store? 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a city with a bag ban and, just from my observation, the vast majority of people are buying paper bags for their items. Many studies show that paper bags are much worse for the environment (in terms of deforestation; processing using water, chemicals, and fossil fuels; and then carbon release as they break down).",1581576602,fhgruqu

There may also be greenhouse gas emissions from incineration of plastics. As far as I know, there is no large-scale incineration of plastics in South Dakota (farmers' burn piles would not count). However, most greenhouse gas emissions come from energy, transportation, and agriculture, not plastics. There are more pressing environmental effects from plastics to be concerned about. Namely, that they interfere with wildlife. 

When making an assessment about if something is more or less envitomentally friendly, there are often multiple factors that have no basis for comparison, such as greenhouse gas emissions and impact to wildlife. At that point, you need to decide what is acceptable. People that want to ban single use plastics believe the impact to wildlife is not acceptable.",1581619508,fhi81nl

1421,Oosamiij,"South Dakota SB 54 - 2020 

&amp;#x200B;

Is something I'm going to try and summarize along with my views on it. South Dakota's SB 54 relates to beverage containers, garbage bags, and garbage can liners, auxiliary containers, and uniform recycling codes for plastic containers. It is trying to pervent a ban on those items. A ban that a few states have already established like, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New York, Oregon and Vermont‚Äîhave banned single-use plastic bags.

The bill gets closer to Governor Noems desk each day. However, If she does sign the bill into law. I wouldn't worry. It doesn't mean the end. We the consumers have the loudest voices of all and our dollars have the most pull. If we keep asking for reusable, sustainable, low waste products, the demand will grow. If we keep asking them to fill our reusable cups, bring our own straws, bag our groceries in our reusable bags. Write to companies about how we will look for alternatives because we don't want our products packaged in plastic. They will start to listen and adapt. Even if our state won't.",1581884004,fhuabve

1567,RockChicken,"A few Black Hills area recommendations:

Around Lead/Deadwood: Look for King's Pasties. They're sold in some local gas stations (Simco, I think?) but are locally made and have a local history as a popular miner's lunch back in the day.  There's also a popular chocolate shop called Chubby Chipmunk in Deadwood. Skip Sugar Shack - They've changed ownership since they got their good burger reputation.

Hill City: Desperados for steak tips (seasonally open). Alpine Inn for desserts (their steaks are popular, but not worth they hype IMO). If you pick up a motor vehicle use map from a forest service office, you can navigate up around Deerfield Rd out of Hill City and find some very pretty parts of the hills seldom visited by non-locals that make for great hiking/camping. If you're up there in early August, be on the lookout for wild raspberries.

Custer: Not really a secret, but Purple Pie Place is worth a visit for comfort food. Black Hills Burger &amp; Bun is also super popular. 

Hot Springs: Wandering Bison is a cute little bistro/coffee shop with good food. I also hear people rave about Buffalo Dreamer (restaurant - seasonally open). Hot Springs also has a trail that runs through town called Centennial Trail - it's very pretty in places. If you go past Evans Plunge out to Hot Brook Canyon, there is Chautauqua park and a few other cute rocky parks on the river. 

If you take Hwy 71 south from Hot Springs to the tiny ghost town of Cascade, about 10 miles down you'll come across a park on your right called Keith Park. There are some crystal clear spring pools in the park that are super neat. Go a mile further down the road and you're at Cascade Falls, which is a popular swimming hole. 

Rapid City's not a small town, but for a food recommendation- Juniper is the best local restaurant by far, and should reopen in their new location by the summer. The Bestro on 3rd Street is also very good and less known. 

If you take Hwy 44 east of Rapid City for about 40 miles, you'll come to a little ghost town called Scenic. It's in the Badlands and is aptly named. Good rock hunting on the forest service land all around the town - use the forest service motor vehicle use maps to navigate. Bring water and snacks - no stores nearby.",1582247806,fi8t868

They advertise ""buy them by the bag!"" and if you did you'd need to take out a damn loan.

as for the Rushmore, that place has changed names so much i had to look it up to see if it was the one i was thinking of. it kind of reminds me of a hotel in las vegas, but not one of the good ones--more like one of the chintzier ones just off the old strip and without all the slot machines. it does have a decent restaurant though, but their lounge is gross as fuck. i think that is what really plays into my las vegas vibe.",1582818166,fixdesp

There has never been much interest in eastern spotted skunks and therefore a basic understanding about their ecology is lacking, e.g., what habitat features do they associate with in the Great Plains? (In the SE it‚Äôs hardwood forests and rocky outcroppings, but those features are certainly not associated with SD), what are the characteristics of their den/rest site characteristic like? What‚Äôs the average home range and what are their daily movement patterns like? What is the population‚Äôs survivorship and mortality like? Do the answers to these questions change from season to season (if so how/what/why?), sex, or age class? The answers to these questions can help guide species conservation and management, though I am not advocating any specific management objective or strategy over another. 

The spotted skunk is generally thought to be rare across its range, and it certainly seems to be in the southeastern US. We have reason to believe that populations in South Dakota are relatively robust, and I think it would be cool to know if this is true and if so then why.",1583006460,fj4el8c

Jo Dee Messina was up on stage singing at this point, and suddenly everyone in the crowd is pointing into the sky. ""Look, the plane!"" people yelled. Jo Dee was confused, asking how we knew. Someone in the front row yelled to her ""Because there's only 2 planes a day coming into here, and that's not one of them!""

In Custer, Black hills burger and bun. In hill city, the alpine inn. They have two options. The big steak and the little steak. Both with a wedge salad(it‚Äôs a 1/4 head of lettuce... and a baked potato. 

Hit up some breweries. Crow peak, miner. 

On the way to/from the hills, stop at the minuteman middle silo museum in the badlands. And for sure drive through the badlands loop. It is like another world. 

If you still need to fish, go to trout heaven in the hills. Stocked with trout, it will amuse you. 

Or Pactola, or one of the places in Custer.

Both spearfish and rapid creeks will be fishable when your planning to visit. The lower elevations will be better though. Spearfish creek in town or the lower canyon should be solid.

Staying for free probably means staying in a parking lot overnight in some small towns, but there's always the chance the business owner or police might not like that.  Some towns might have a city park you can stay in; check Google Maps to find out.  

There are only 2 state parks on 212 east of the Missouri River, and they charge a modest fee of $25 or less for a campsite plus a day use fee for the state park.  There aren't any campgrounds West River on 212 until you get to Belle Fourche, north of the Black Hills.  Check out the SD Game, Fish, &amp; Parks website for information on camping and state parks.  You will probably need to make a reservation in advance for the state parks because they won't have staff working at the entrance station until May.

1785,Krizamer,"Highway 12 is another option, not too far north of 212.  The Waubay/Webster area has a lot of lakes. Pickerel Lake and Bitter Lake both have campgrounds, along with other good fishing spots if you care to look.  That route will also take you through Aberdeen, a decent size town of around 30,000.  Also, 12 takes you through Mobridge, a decent sized town on the Missouri River with some camping and trails.",1583241602,fjczc7b
1786,R1CHARDCRANIUM,"More scenic? No. Much of South Dakota looks the same until you hit the western third. Save for the bluffs near the river. 

14 will bring you through Brookings (SDSU), Huron (World's largest pheasant!), Pierre (State Capital), Wall (tourist trap with free water), and then the Black Hills. Alternatively, instead of taking 14 to Wall, keep going straight and you'll pop back onto 90 at Sturgis (Something goes on here in the late summer). Bear Butte is a nice hike and Fort Meade is a neat diversion. 

Pierre has the Oahe Downstream Area which is an oasis nestled on the Missouri River just below the largest earthen dam in North America. It is holding back the 4th largest manmade lake in the western hemisphere. Lake Oahe stretches from Pierre to Bismark. There is also Farm Island. It has a nice campground. Spring Creek is off the beaten path and should not be too busy in April. Word of caution; it will be windy up on the lake. If you want to avoid the wind, Oahe Downstream is your best bet. There is actually quite a lot to see there. You'll be too late to see the roosting bald eagles but there are trails all over the place. 

There is not a lot up on 212 and if something goes wrong, you could be waiting a while for help. I am a highway engineer so I spend all summer traveling the state (I logged 13k miles on my government vehicle in 5 months of 2019). If it were me, I'd come down to 14 or go up to 12. The state parks are not free, but they are cheap. Go to [Game Fish and Parks](https://gfp.sd.gov/parks/) site and check out the parks. As for public land, there is not much. Homesteading back in the 19th century made sure of that. It frustrates me to no end to drive and see all that land sitting unaccessible. I came here from Wyoming. Before that, I was in Colorado, Idaho, and Nevada. All states with massive amounts of public land. The lack of open and accessible lands here is disappointing. 

One final word here. Pay attention to the weather. April in the Northern Great Plains is hit or miss and can be downright treacherous as you head west into the Rockies. In WY, April was one of our snowiest months. 

Then, if the next leg of your road trip is 212 through Montana (assuming you're heading east to west), you can head north out of Spearfish and catch 212 at Bel Fourche. 1 miles north of Spearfish.",1583243188,fjd1cme

1790,ChuckNavy02,"I-90 is your best bet for a variety of scenery.  Eastern South Dakota is farm country and as you go west it transitions to ranch country, so more pastures and fewer planted fields.  Chamberlain on I-90 is home to the Dignity statue, and you can see part of the Badlands near Wall.  The interstate also goes through the Black Hills, whereas 12 and 212 do not.  Most of my travels through West River are on I-90 or some of the highways south of I-90.  Highway 12 does take you through Lemmon, where Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly bear in the 1830's.  The area around Lemmon is prairie, so it looks nothing like the movie *The Revenant*.

The biggest advantage to I-90 over highways 12 and 212 is the frequency of towns.  The towns along 12 and 212 are small, and few and far between.",1583254083,fjdjyqk

He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county.

That is the reason tuition has skyrocketed. My aunt went to university in the late 60s/early 70s and paid $99 per semester for everything including books and dorms. That was $198 a year to attend. Obliviously free university will not happen anytime soon because moderates and conservatives would rather spend money on weapons and the salaries of close to 2 million people we have in the military than invest in our country. But it actually isn't a pipe dream, we pretty much already did it at one point. 

tuition free public universities is projected to cost $79 a billion a year.

The military budget is $748 billion a year. 

Just dock a couple of the those giant aircraft carriers that do nothing except cruise around the Pacific ocean with 6000 person cruises on them. 

Free tuition would boost GDP (increase the investment portion of the equation because people could actually buy houses after school, and it would increase the consumer spending (70% of GDP) and the government spending side of the equation would increase.

Not only can we have free schools, it would be good for the economy and make many more Americans dreams come true. People could start families again and have more opportuines.

If it is such a good idea, why haven't we? Resentment is one of the biggest factors in American politics.

I might just be making shit up though - I have a feeling most banks and rental companies would throw a fit and would instead do what you say (""deferred payments""). I would hope they'd at least have a clause prohibiting late fees on these payments....but again. We're talking about banks here.

In the end, I haven't really thought about it, because I'm a lucky one whose employer will have customers until they actually force the place to close, *and* I'm 95% sure I'd still have a job even if we had to close the business for those entire 2 months.

2231,IkkunKomi,"I want to put this in perspective for everyone.


We have:

* 11 positive tests 

* 551 (thankfully) negative tests

* 350 pending tests 


That equals out to 912 tests. 


We did not even have 1,000 tests ready. 


The US census from 2019 said our estimated population was 884,659. 


So based on all of that, we had 0.103% the amount of tests we needed for our state population. We could not even get it to one full percent. 


Let that sink in a bit. 


We were the 44th state to get it. We had plenty of time to prepare. And we did not even have enough tests to cover even a HALF of a percent. If you had to make that a group of 1000 people, only ONE would have the capacity to get tested. We need to take this seriously. 


I understand there is a shortage, but let's be honest here. We need to shut shit down if we can't test. It needs to be mandatory at this point (please see my other post on the SD reddit titled Shut this shit down). 


We are so poorly prepared. We need to take every single possible precaution asap.",1584597093,fkwmbis

2234,DrinkLikeAGilmore,"Do you want everything shut down anytime the flu, cold, or any other illness and disease is impacting the population?

This is ridiculous.",1584606665,fkwuq1p
2235,IkkunKomi,"That is a false equivalency.

A flu has a vaccine that prevents people from it, or limits the risk of death from it. We take appropriate measures from that.


A cold does not kill on its own. Only when it is combined with other viruses or infections. 


And for your last issue, as it pertains to the current one, yes. Yes we should. 


The only decrease in Coronavirus cases in the world have been from isolation. Why do you think every other country, state, city, area, flights, etc. are all going on lock down? It isn't because we are all just tired. It is because isolation as much as possible is the only proper way to contain the spread of the virus. And then, once it is contained, it can eventually start to decrease. That is the ONLY thing that is helping right now in the world. We have no vaccine. We have no treatment. We are all in this together and need to each do our part. 


If even just a handful of people have the mindset of 'this is ridiculous' and continue to not self-isolate, it will continue to spread over and over and over. Basically, the longer people draw this out, the longer we wait. It is akin to that one kid in the elementary school class who would never get in the line in the hall and you would just have to keep waiting for recess. Then other kids would get out of line. And then after all of these kids got out of line, you just want to scream that if everyone had been in line or, as it is today, isolated for just a little bit we wouldn't have to be here for so damn long. 


Plus, the human aspect of it. You might think it's ridiculous. But, even if I stay home to the best of my ability, I still have to go to my doctor for my appointment once a month. I have no choice due to my chronic illness. Now, I take every precaution in the world, but if I get this, I might have complications due to my autoimmune disease. Then, not even elderly people, but 60+, are at the same risk factor. They need to get food, and I'm still trying to teach my dad across the country how to order groceries online because he's afraid to go out with his immunosuppressed issues as well. And it's just not about me or him. There are thousands, millions of people who are in the same boat. They have to go out to these appointments, to groceries. Why are we putting them at risk when they don't need to be? 


So at this point, it's coming down to not being 'ridiculous' or anything. People don't even know they have the virus right now &amp; don't show symptoms until later. So its coming down to a problem where people will die if others continue to go out because they think it is nothing and spread it around.

The impact it would have on the state if people couldn't work for weeks would cripple our economy for years to come. Look what happened with all the store supplies when people heard a few asses were hoarding things. I run a small cleaning business and have taken several steps to guarantee our chemicals are up to par with what's needed to kill the virus as well as taking time to make sure everything is sanitized for our customers. A lot of business that can work at home are doing so and the ones who can't are wiping everything down as much as possible and have implemented several new rules and policys to stop the spread of sickness. They have also quadrupled their use of soap so most people are taking it seriously. The problem is people who go out to party in close quarters, eat out or buy anything premade instead of making things at home, and not making sure they stay home if they have symptoms. Most businesses are taking their own safety into their own hands but it's the people who think it's a joke that'll still party and be stupid even if everything is shut down. Make sure to properly wash your hands, stay away from people if you can, make all your food at home, carry hand sanitizer in all your vehicles, and if you have weakened immune systems have a loved one help you shop for the things you need. 

I can see closing restaurants, bars, and luxury business but hopefully if it comes down to that theirs a way they can still make a profit so it doesnt put a lot of people out of business. It's a sucky situation all around.",1584625999,fkxdz16

2255,wdtellett,"I understand your concerns, and I agree with a lot of them. You certainly won't find me in a packed bar anytime soon, that's for sure!

But I also understand how difficult a call it is to make for some people and businesses. You cite Illinois, and that's helpful for me in this conversation, because I'm originally from central Illinois. Many of the businesses that I used to patronize now only offer curbside pick up and the like. That means a lot of my old friends are already falling behind on bills. So what happens to them when they can't pay rent, their mortgage, insurance, etc? 

Here's where a lot of people say, ""Well, they should have saved a safety net!"" And you know what, yeah, we all should have saved a safety net. But heck, it can be really difficult to do. Some people just get by, and that's how it is. Now they're being asked to choose between staying home to keep themselves and others healthy, and potentially losing a home. 

That's why it's a hard call for so many people and businesses to make. Because they don't know when it's all going to end. The sad fact is that we may see people lose their homes or end up in financial ruin before it's all said and done. I hope that's not the case, but I've already seen my income cut by more than half, and I already worked from home!

Of course, this doesn't account for the barhoppers, but there's an emotional component too. Penn &amp; Teller did this bit a few years ago about how people always do what they do. During times of crisis, they continue to do what they do, just more so. Which means that people that deal with stress by heading to the bar will want to continue to do so, just more.

2306,IkkunKomi,"I'll admit, I am not a huge fan of the New York Times, but this model is done very well. 

It is based on the current trend and database of known cases, and Census Bureau Transportation Model. Currently, South Dakota is the 2nd highest rate of change, or the amount of cases that is growing daily, per capita in the nation. While we have had a slow growth in the past few days, this does still remain the same. This also is alarming, due to the lack of testing materials we have. 

The model says it will peak here around May. What is also alarming is that the area in southeast South Dakota is one of the highest concentration of Coronavirus in the nation. However, we do not have a high concentration of hospitals comparative to the nation. This is why isolation is very, very importation right now. If you can avoid going out, please do. 

My intent is not to scare or incite panic by any means. It is to explain where we are as a state, and where we could be heading if we do not take precautions. If I am being honest, I thought that we were fine being in the middle of nowhere, but seeing this did take me back. And while this map is per capita, meaning we will not technically have near the amount of people ill as other places, our medical system will be extremely strained as well (be very kind to all your medical people, grocery people, any anyone who is working so hard during this crisis. They are doing so well!). 

If the model is correct, it says that it will peak here around May. Sometimes models are extremely reliable, and sometimes not. They are a good guide to have, but not something you religiously go by; like a weather forecast. So I hope that eases some anxiety. I feel that this model is more a warning than an ""ALL HOPE IS LOST!"" message.

Before it opened, people were congregating at the front like it was a social club and they were hanging out. They had to be maybe a foot, two apart. After the store opened, it was literally like Black Friday. So many people just packed on top of each other. It was so busy, so I get it. But the nonstop crowding was insane. And it wasn't a panic-buy crowding. It was like 'trying to get on an airplane, so I am going to get as close to you as humanly possible' crowding. I had my hoodie on, my mask on (reusable, washable, N95 that I had prior to this), and my glasses, my hair up in a tight bun with a scarf to cover it, long pants that tuck into shoes &amp; tennis shoes.


I still did not feel safe or clean even with all of that. It was awful. And this is why, we need to shut this shit down. Now. Because I had to stay a bit longer and wait for my medicine after the designated shopping hour ended, and it only got more packed.


I don't know who needs to get their head out of what orifice, but they need to do it and fucking now. My husband still has to go to work with several guys and yell over machines. Because of that, they are sometimes only a foot or two apart. I am petrified every night and every day now (man we *REALLY* need to have some fucking legal pot right now). And obviously due to insurance and wages, I can't tell him to fuck off with his job. I am sure though, I am not even close to the only one. Sorry, I guess I needed to vent there.

Everyone in my town of working age has at least one family member who works in a larger neighboring town. To top it off, my town ""only"" has 3-4 churches and yeah, lots of us go there, but many more drive to a neighboring town. We also do not have anywhere for groceries and one bar where children can enter and eat. That's two more instances where you have to leave. Now, we can assume everyone doesn't work, attends church in town on Sundays, then does their shopping and eats out all in one weekly trip, but that's not realistic. And those wiser people who don't leave because they're disabled? Chances are they have family members shopping for them, visitors, and caretakers. All it takes is one infected visitor at the annual Fire Department Pie and Ice Cream Feed, church, the grocery store, to infect the entire town.

South Korea used their public surveillance system to track people who came into contact with anyone who had covid-19.

I am not advocating a forcible lockdown for over a month or using public surveillance to track everyone. I am just pointing out how pro-active these two countries were in order to drastically slow down the spread. You make it sound like the virus is just dying out on its own, but China and South Korea actually took very extreme measures to slow its spread down. Meanwhile our governor is using the lack of testing as proof that we don't have a problem and our President is just being his normal self. I get why Noem doesn't want to shut everything down: our state may take years to economically recover and many people may lose their livelihood. But this pandemic isn't just going to be wished away with thoughts and prayers or letting the virus take its natural course.

With covid, the death is slow agonizing torture that feels like death by drowning. And the deaths will be in the hundreds. Or thousands. And its not about politics when its clear cut life and death choices. It is about people's lives. There is a point where politics ends, and we have reached that point.

And my point is not about the deaths of the politicians. Them living or dying does not matter in the long run. What matters is that the leadership learns. Preferably with the smallest of pain possible. I don't think they will learn though from the pain of others. Mostly because the republican party are a group of self interested callous assholes that care more about money and political power than the well being of their constituents. Especially if the constituents are not donors to their campaigns.

2424,j0hnnywad,"It‚Äôs my opinion that they could BOTH be doing more. To say the governor can‚Äôt impact business operations while it‚Äôs the state that issues restaurant licenses and enforces health code violations is a total farce. Additionally, to say a city couldn‚Äôt enforce a shutdown is just asinine too, especially when the Governor has already passed the buck on it and said its up to local governments. 

The reality is both levels of government force business closures all the time for various reasons. Counties pull their liquor licenses when establishments become known as a public nuisance for constant police calls. Additionally, To say it‚Äôs out of the mayors hands within the context of a public health crisis / state of emergency is a bit gutless. It‚Äôs his political philosophy and his reputation being at stake that inform this decision. 
The mayor said as much today by clarifying outright that it‚Äôs his personal philosophy that informs his decision to allow business to remain open. He continued by positing that business owners/employees not earning money leads to food and housing insecurity. So is his opinion that those insecurities are a greater risk than community spread? If it‚Äôs truly economics that puts you at risk to becoming exposed to covid shouldn‚Äôt we address that in all areas not just restaurants? Let‚Äôs do just that. 

The housing issue is mitigated by urging state and federal gov action to stop foreclosure and defer rent and mortgage payments. Sounds extreme but other countries have added most public utility payments, student loans, auto payments etc to that list. Ive heard neither our Governor or Mayor mention this potential housing payment solution and would guess it‚Äôs their politics that inform that decision as well... damage to the banking sector . And while we all face potential food insecurity in the future, wouldn‚Äôt the rational thought be to address that with the urging the need for multiple forms of emergency relief rather that insisting that private businesses autonomy paramount ? Is leaving this decision in the hands of business owners really worth risking others with community spread?  Additionally, don‚Äôt all these half measures stand to put a return to normal business further on down the road!?

Would either leader just please acknowledge that the longer we allow these gutless half measures, the more we all risk a potentially LONGER ‚Äúshelter in place‚Äù order. Want to talk about the health of businesses in that scenario? Ask the business owners in California, Illinois, and New York if they would have traded a two week shutdown in early March for the long term shutdowns they are in and at risk of extending now? 

We‚Äôre lucky to be rural enough to have seen this on its way and for our shutdown to truly make an impact on community spread here. Why we‚Äôre still arguing about who is supposed to make the first move is beyond me. I will make this one exception for the mayor before I conclude. He makes a solid point that shutting down Sioux Falls alone and letting the surrounding communities decide on their own is another ineffective half measure. I see his mentioning this as the closest thing to urging the Governor to act without saying it outright and causing a public rift. While protecting the public from that argument spares some panic it may become necessary. I would hope that discussion is more direct behind the scenes. That said I still think the best thing to do at this point is just be a leader and take the express authority she‚Äôs given to make the decision yourself and hope other local governments or even the Governor follow suit and fall in line with with biggest city in the state.  Yes she‚Äôs been totally gutless in sidestepping her own authority to act.

If you think that's bad. Most of those coming in are more on the older side with the ""It's just a hoax"" or ""It's just the flu"" attitude. Most just shrug it off.

It's not ""just the flu"" / ""it's not just a liberal hoax"" ""The young are fine"". Our health care system compared to all first world European and Asian nations is factually and statistically underdeveloped and honestly embaracing and deny millions proper health care across the country.

South Dakota, their's only 20ish confirmed cases as of March 24th. With every one infection scientist predict there are at least 8+ unconfirmed cases. 

The importance of this is we actually don't know even a fraction of the real number of infected in our state and we will never know. As of now we need to distance as much as possible. 

The state government and are representatives at this point have been absolutely useless and passing blame and responsibility between them and the local governments 

""Based on a recent Harvard study, the Rapid City area could experience 40,000 sick, 8000 hospitalized, and 400 requiring a ventilator (*we have fewer than 80 ventilators in Rapid City). Untold will die""

I‚Äôm on mobile right now so I can‚Äôt post the numbers. There are *a lot* of studies to back this up. Dig around on the resources section of the link I provided. The following quotes are from just a quick search. The information and all of the statistics to back up the efficacy of expanding Medicaid are easy to find. Don‚Äôt just believe me, research it for yourself if you‚Äôd like. But make no mistake, not expanding it, is another finger to low income people, under the guise of fiscal responsibility. 


&gt; Most research demonstrates that Medicaid expansion has improved access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population.


&gt; Analyses find effects of expansion on numerous economic outcomes, including state budget savings, revenue gains, and overall economic growth. Multiple studies suggest that expansion can result in state savings by offsetting state costs in other areas. The federal government covered 100% of the cost of the expansion in the early years of the ACA and will cover 90% beginning in 2020. Additional studies show that Medicaid expansions result in reductions in uncompensated care costs for hospitals and clinics, and a growing number of studies show an association between expansion and gains in employment as well as growth in the labor market (with a minority of studies showing neutral effects in this area).

But she only signed an executive suggestion that stated it was up to the cities to determine what was open and shut. So now some cities have things open and some closed. Due to that the spread will happen at such a higher rate because of people going out of town to a bar or restaurant.


Personally, my husband had to quit his job of several years today to protect our family. Me with an autoimmune disorder and his mom who is elderly and with cardiovascular issues. We won't qualify for unemployment, or the unemployment with the stimulus bill. Finances will be beyond penny-pinching tight because of it. But it is better than the alternative, especially when his coworkers go out to those other bars. I feel an enormous amount of guilt and shame, but what is done is done.

I also picked up more groceries the past 3-4 weeks as well in canned and non-perishable items. Not hoarding by any means, but instead of spending $75, I spent $100. So we are good on things like that and have a roof over our head as well. He does also have a second job teaching a 3 hour credit class about video game design and programming at a community college for us to have a small check for a couple of months to bridge the gap until he can hopefully find something online to work from home. He knows a fair amount of computing languages and has a degree in video game design. The plan was for him to work at the factory for a couple of more years for him to fully build his portfolio and get experience teaching, but I guess global pandemics have a way of altering plans. Hopefully it will be for the better this way. I was in nursing for over six years, but my chronic illnesses made my job physically impossible to do, do now I'm studying accounting, which I adore.

2612,IkkunKomi,"My question is this now, who has the connections to make this a big enough deal nationally, along with the 'patchwork quit' executive suggestion of cities making the call independently shutting things down? People will go out of towns to bars/restaurants from infected areas to non-infected areas. This is going to cause a substantial increase in the amount of cases that we will see positive. And from there, it is only going to soar. Add that into the medical insurance issue and we have ourselves (if not already) a verifiable clusterfuck. 


I am tracking to see how many we are testing per day. After I think last week testing roughly 78 on the SD DOH website, today was 143. This is great news, as the Avera &amp; Sanford testing centers opened up. But now, how many will be processed per day? It has been shown today that those within the two centers ARE COUNTED as processed through the SD DOH website. Now we can start to have a base monitoring of test/date ratio and hopefully get a proper rate of change and growth of change figure in place. I feel this needs to be monitored and tracked very carefully independently and by several sources, including medical professionals. Regardless of what happens, we need to minimize the spread of Covid-19 as much as possible, and I am worried it is way too late. 


But hopefully we can track this much better, and put pressure on her with both things combined. Idaho has ordered stricter protections for their citizens. We need to do the same.

1. Self-isolate at home except for essential needs and practice social distancing;

2. Stop non-essential travel: most importantly airline and public transportation;

3. Close non-essential businesses: restaurants and other facilities that prepare and serve food (except for take-away), bars, salons, retail stores, clubs, gyms, schools, daycares, social events, and churches;

2808,ajfjfgdjdjsijxj,"Hey there, first, I do want to say thanks for including sources. Too often, baseless ,wild accusations fly and that's all they can be, so I appreciate the citations. It sounds like ""our coming need"" refers to the condition of the American people, so I appreciate also  the considerations of those near you. I admit that the polarization that has happened over the past few years has caused what would otherwise be apolitical subjects to be seen as a ""red-state/blue-state"" issues. And I admit my complicity in this, as I'm certainly not immune. Finally, you'll have to bear with me as a criticism of too much foreign aid is a novel complaint by someone I assume (yes, assume) is on the left. 


I think that there are a few things that need to be established before making a normative judgment though. Certain criterion needs to be met before qualification. This is just an effort to combat the irresponsibility mentioend in the 2nd sentence. First, is there currently, in the country that‚Äôs giving, a shortage that's being exacerbated? The simple act of giving doesn't necessarily make things worse. The act of receiving doesn't necessarily make them better either. Second, if not, will a shortage be caused by this action? I have 10 pennies and give you 5. Did I make my situation worse? We'd need to establish that. Would I make an otherwise good situation bad?(create a shortage) What if I only need 5? So, a shortage doesn't necessarily follow from the action. Third, is the medical supplies being sent COVD-19 specific? We could send a million band-aids and a years worth of OxyContin, and would be sending ""medical supplies"", but that's irrelevant to the pandemic. Fourth, if this will create a shortage, do we have the ability to create, or at least purchase goods to replace what was lost?lastly, and I guess this is kind of a combination, but, will an American's experience with the Coronavirus become worse, (either be contracting it, or by already having it, but deteriorating) because we sent those specific supplies elsewhere?

I think we should apply this to situations on the other side of the political aisle. Take Trudeau, for instance, who sent 16 tons of supplies to China. The only condition I think it meets is the type of equipment (even if it is faulty). So I can't say this is a necessarily bad gesture because when I apply the same standard, it just doesn't suffice. 

[catch-all source ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.huffingtonpost.ca/amp/entry/china-donates-medical-supplies_ca_5e7fc28bc5b6256a7a2be1fc/) 

If you really wanted to take a utilitarian approach, you could ask if the ""giver"" is receiving or will receive something that might help the general population more than those supplies. That's a strech, so I'd rather not take it to that level. 

I think if those conditions are met, there should be a judgment. And I believe you absolutely have every right to say it,  and I 100% want to hear it. However, having a right doesn't make something true or correct (see burning a flag, kneeling for the anthem or racial slurs). But you should have the choice to. But, I get that you can't do this, either use these conditions or to this extent all the time. This isn't some philosophy crash-course coming from an ivory tower. This is coming from failing.....bigly, to adequately think through what I'm about to say. So I welcome to hear what you have to say about this as the preservation of civil discourse is one of the most important things we can do, especially now. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and consider what I have to say. 

If all else fails, we could always dip into Andrew Cuomo's stockpile

So we‚Äôve established a timeline of hemp-related events when the coronavirus wasn‚Äôt causing the sky to fall. Look I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not a political maneuver. Every elected official‚Äôs first job in office is to get re-elected. So of course it‚Äôs believable. I‚Äôm just staying the onus is on you. 

Second, you would think (and I know, this may be giving the government too much credit) if they wanted to get the corona-stink off them, they‚Äôd come up with something better. With ND having only about 35 hemp farmers, you should distract the voter base with something flashier, or broader. We‚Äôre not Oregon. 

Lastly, I guess these are distractions too:

1. S. 1770 (Obama-sponsored) need to concede its purpose was to appease the Katrina victims through tax breaks. 
2. Congress holding Holder in contempt after Fast and Furious
3. EO-13547 after the Deepwater Horizon accident

I'd recommend learning both.  To be honest, if I were you, I'd focus on learning R, then SAS, and then Python, however.  It also depends on whether or not you'd like to focus on statistics or data science.  Most statistics in public health is still performed in SAS and SUDAAN (due to correlated data in survey datasets and non-independence of error from other study designs).  That's my two cents...

My specialties are in statistical analysis of longitudinal data, survey data, and causal inference and the analysis of quasi-experiments.

I am actually specializing in bioinformatics and will be starting my postdoc here at the end of the month. However, a lot of the statistical stuff that we do for bioinformatics is done in R so that's what I'm proficient in. I have worked with predictive analytics with transcriptome data which is also R, but deep learning clarification are way more flexible in python even if there are packages in R to do them. I think my worry comes from the company that I'm working with for my PhD. They let us come out and said if people know R, that's fine, but they pipe everything over to python for production. 

For my data science cert I had to take a course with SAS and oh man, that in my opinion is a whole different world with the proc and something else (forgot the name but I think it started with an ""m""?) I know for the actual masters they dive further into SQL and python for database querying which isn't too shabby.
