&gt;“Everything on Earth is flatter than the pancake as they measured it,” says Lee Allison, head of the Kansas Geological Survey — including the Rocky Mountains, the Marianas Trench, Mt. Everest and the Tibetan Plateau. The team, Allison says, measured a “pancake plateau” that included the sides of the pancake. That extra height would be equivalent to about 70 miles of topographic relief in Kansas.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;To answer questions from descending news media (even the *Los Angeles Times* wrote an editorial on the findings), Allison and his survey co-workers used a simpler relief ratio that placed Kansas 23rd among all 50 states. The state slopes from a little over 4,000 feet elevation in the west to around 400 feet in its southeast corner. The flattest state is Delaware, says Allison, who has enjoyed the opportunity to discuss Kansas geology the ruckus has provided.

Here me out: the average automobile, according to the EPA, emits 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide in a year.  Since there are 2200 lbs. in a metric ton, that's 10,120 lbs of CO2 in a year. That means that the entire marijuana industry in the US produced less carbon emissions than 39 cars emit in a year!

Rehabbing kids who have violent tendencies need way, way more specialized support and help than having the opportunity to chuck and/or catch a football. They also need to be treated separately and with more protections in place when deal with other students.

Throwing a couple of kids who are already sexually abusive in with other at-risk kids without anyone knowing about it is incredibly unsafe for those nonviolent kids and creates a hazardous environment. It would be like throwing those same kids into a math camp or school program or scout troop without the parents or kids knowing about it. 

It's not about profit (and yes, the coach is making money off of this by himself). The coach is scooping up kids with a lot of talent, but got caught doing something stupid. He's pulling a money ball maneuver with kids who got kicked out of programs/schools for offenses.

But the problem is that he's taken it to the extent where he's not  protecting his at-risk, non-violent offenders by not being truthful about the real situation for everyone involved. Those kids are all interacting together on the field, in school, on the bus, in the locker room with and without adult supervision. There's a lot of opportunity for further abuse and victimization all because the coach doesn't want to ruin his program's success rate and public reputation as a ""winner.""",1578255013,fdb8udl

For Kansas, the real problems are (1) decline of rural population due to shrinking farming/energy sectors and impacts related to that (reduced medical services, etc), (2) decline in middle income jobs in traditional manufacturing centers like Wichita / Topeka / etc, and (3) the overall shift of population within KS to JoCo and related de-population of other areas.

Even within the KC metro, there's a lot of movement between MO and KS sides, but it probably nets out over time.  Johnson County expects to grow from 600k people now to 1.1M by 2050, so a lot of those people are younger people in small-mid size towns in KS who are going to migrate to KC area.  Individual small cities are more or less trying to do new things to stay relevant and attract new entrants, however the state as a whole doesn't seem to have much focus on this population shift problem, or changing the culture in a way that drives more businesses/people here.

I don't disagree with you that it could be a slippery slope not something I want to see the government using to take more of my rights. Agree that this is something that needs to be talked about and thought put into, instead of just a reaction law pushed through. But it you are on a public roadway you should be safe and this is why we have laws like this to keep ourselves and others safe from harm.

very affordable compared to most other states, even in larger cities. 

People are generally nice, polite, courteous 

Lots of small, close-knit communities 

Depending on your field, there are lots of jobs

We are expanding the kinds of recreational activities available-- we have lots of ax throwing places, indoor rock climbing, etc. 

If you're Christian, there is no shortage of options in terms of church communities. 


Bad things: 

There is very little access to nature. Most open land is cultivated/farming. While there are areas for camping/hiking, they are not as accessible as many other states like Colorado. There are no true forests, no beaches, no challenging hiking-- at least not readily accessible. 

Weather is unpredictable and often extreme. Natives are used to it, but I know it's difficult for new people.

We are [near the bottom of the list](https://www.summitpost.org/public-and-private-land-percentages-by-us-states/186111) of available public lands, though. KS has wide open areas, but most of it is locked up by farmers. We travel to CO many summers and having the public lands available for outdoor activities is amazing. My friends with side-by-sides typically trailer them to public jeep trails in OK, AR, or CO. 

We do have a few lakes in the state. Most have camping areas and easy hiking trails around them. Most of them are flood control, none are truly big, and none offer private ownership to build a house near the water (I have mixed feelings about this, but some of both is probably good). All water in KS is a bit muddy. If you want to go diving somewhat clear water or fish a big lake you drive to OK, MO, or AR. 

I grew up hunting, and have a few farming friends still, but struggle to find places to hunt today. My farming friends lease out their hunting rights to people with far more money.

Kansas was established and introduced to the Union as the ""Free State"". We're the home of the Jayhawkers. John Brown fought to ensure that slavery was outlawed from our founding and was never practiced here. The Buffalo Soldiers were based in Leavenworth. Kansas City, Kansas exists because of the division on the subject of slavery along the state line with Missouri (where slavery was legal and there still exist more traditional ""Southern"" opinions).  Brown vs Board of Education was initiated in Topeka. 

While there are certainly anecdotal examples to the contrary, racism has no place in polite society here. Our large cities have large city problems and we definitely have problems but it would be unusual to  experience overt racism in Kansas. Look up the subjects of ""Bloody Kansas"", the Exodusters, and Nicodemus, Kansas on Wikipedia. Charlie Parker was from Kansas. Janelle Monae, Gordon Parks, Langston Hughes, Barry Sanders, and many other brilliant people were too. It's not exactly a hub for Black culture but there are plenty of places where it's quite normal.

Kansas City metro is almost a state in itself too. It's a sprawling bi-state metro with 2-3 million people and the history of Jazz, the Negro Leagues, barbecue, and other important elements of African American history cannot be told in detail without mentioning Kansas City. More recently, it's become home to large Sudanese, Ethiopian, and Somali immigrant groups.

And moving from the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains to eastern Kansas has not been an easy transition in those regards. 

You are moving from OK to KS which isn't a super huge change in lifestyle. Plus you are moving to the one good part of Kansas, I have not visited Wichita or Lawrence so they could be great too. 

If I where you I would seriously consider looking else where in the country. For instance the Raleigh, NC area is a huge tech hub and is rapidly growing and still has a decently low cost of living.

1118,Vio_,"I used to think that Kansas was pretty not racist historically as well, but there was still a lot of racism locally. The book ""This is Not Dixie"" does a great job of delving into racism in Kansas after the Civil War. This state was built on being not as racist as other states (for a lot of reasons), but that doesn't mean there racism didn't exist.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also Kansas City used to be one of the most racist cities in the US to the point where other cities followed KC's racist inventions and precedents including redlining, neighborhood covenants,  the ""Troost Wall"" being a thing, JC Nichols alone was a HUGE racist, and negatively impacted African Americans in KC for decades.

The Department of Children and Families had reportedly lost track of a bunch of children during the Brownback era as well, and they kept it hush-hush until after Brownback resigned. The governor that took over after that made a bunch of changes, but I don't know how it all turned out.

Which of course was seized upon immediately by Republican and Democratic opponents of the tax plan, who in fact turned out to be right.  

Most people around here just called it ""Brownback's tax cuts/plan"", but when it first passed, it was being spoken of by Brownback and the Koch crew as a grand experiment that was going to finally prove that trickle-down economics was our one and only true savior, and not just a massive money grab by a well-to-do minority....

1203,VdogameSndwchDimonds,"Most people will neglect to mention that Brownback's tax plan wasn't what was put into place.  He intended to cut taxes AND eliminate tax deductions and cut the budget, but the Senate republicans pulled a fast one and wrote up a bill with only the tax cuts.  They sent it over to the House with the promise (wink, wink) that they'd make changes after it was passed, but instead they immediately sent it to Brownback after passage.  He chose to sign it because he could see that he wasn't going to get the other 2/3 of his plan and 1/3 was better than nothing, especially when it was the tax cut.

That's what happened, and the effects have been difficult to gauge.  The schools have complained about money, but here in Topeka they've been on a building spree so they've obviously got plenty of cash.  A couple of places where I have noticed the budget cuts are on the roads--the areas around the highways get mowed far less frequently (which is kinda nice, since native grasses are allowed to grow) and roadkill doesn't get picked up anymore on city streets or the highway.",1579631239,ff6nydx

1208,JakeFromSkateFarm,"Depends.

If the area average is (for example) $600/month, and someone builds a new complex that charges $1000/month, it's not uncommon for the cheaper places to go ""oh, we can charge $750/month and still be way cheaper than the expensive alternative"". 

Which in turn encourages the expensive one to go up to $1100/month to preserve the gap and all the ""luxury"" that gap leads people into believing it has over the cheaper places. Rinse and repeat.

Also, you can find rentals in duplexes and the like. No amenities like a gym, but also fewer neighbors.

1218,Plummyr,"Honestly, if you're looking at moving back from another country into a position where $500 a month is too much, I'd just stay where you're at. $500 a month really isn't that bad if you manage your money well. I used to make $10 an hour, roughly $1600 a month, and had a $750 a month house by myself, with all the other monthly fees, phone, internet, utilities, etc, and still came out putting away about $700 a month for whatever I wanted/needed. I'd imagine a college salary job would be much higher than that. It can be done, though not always fun. Or negotiate, if possible, for a higher salary to offset that cost. Or maybe look for a higher paying job in the area.

It's a college town, as I'm sure you know and it's been pointed out already, and that largely dictates a lot of the prices. Landlords know students need a place to stay and can charge higher because of that.

There's also places outside Emporia to live at, such as cottonwood falls, olpe, americus, etc, unless living specifically in Emporia is what you want. In that case, I dunno.

Locals are renting houses instead of apartments, or apartments in the new properties to avoid them. 

The other rental places, including some that were built specifically for HUD/Section 8, have notices that the slumlords are raising rent and all these new complexes have been built that cost more...and they raised their rent as well. Note that they haven't improved their properties at all, just raised rent because they believe they can due to all the other high rents.

So yeah, rent has definitely gone up in the past 2 yrs or so here.

Emporia is a lovely place to live. We bought our home, though, because we couldn't afford to rent. So...if you really want to move back, maybe look into buying instead. It can honestly be cheaper than renting...and you can sell if you leave, which would give you $ back (unlike renting), or you could rent it out yourself if you want.

The building isn't very attractive architecturally and it's kind of in an odd spot (all renovation plans include a pedestrian bridge to get from Docking to their parking lot), so in hindsight it seems like it would've been better to build a new heating/cooling plant and completely tear Docking down and selling the land.

Doing well! Thanks for asking!

&gt;Are you actually back on track?

With the amount of damage Brownback has done, I don’t think state gov will ever get back on track. We still have a teapublican government with some pretty insane people in it. Right now they are seeking to undo the tax hikes and they are trying to shit all over Laura Kelley, by projecting the shit they caused as her fault.

I was a state employee during Brownback’s years and he did a number of permanent changes to the civil service system. Employee health insurance plans have also gotten considerably worse than when I first started. I think the copay to see a doctor is $45. It used to be $25. My premium when I started and left was about $9 per pay period or something insanely low. All the premium discounts are gone. I believe but I haven’t looked at the SEHP documents since I don’t work for state gov anymore.

&gt;	Did it affect anyone’s relationship with the GOP?

I think the GOPers are currently in an identity crisis. Kobach would have been a continuation of Brownback. Actually, what I told people was that he would be someone if Trump had a brain. For the state to vote Laura Kelly, a democrat in, was really big. She didn’t even win by a small margin.

&gt;	Tax deficit problems were overblown in the media, let me know that.

They were not overblown at all. It was really bad. The state was shuffling funds around, robbing funds from the DOT to make up for shortfalls. The cut to employee benefits was significant and at the time, I don’t think anyone had pay raises until after he left. It also was not fun getting a furlough notice while the legislature was battling the budget in 2015.

The tax cuts never did anything. Kansas had the lowest growth rate in the United States in 2015 I think, or at least one of the years the law was in effect.

It was so bad that the conservative legislature overrode Brownback’s veto of rolling back the tax cuts.",1579758027,ffbb08j

1306,cyberphlash,"Just to clarify for people who don't understand, last year the KS supreme court ruled that the KS constitution guarantees the right to an abortion. This now allows KS state courts to make rulings about whether abortion regulations/restrictions passed by the KS legislature inappropriately limit your right to an abortion (under the KS constitution). You are currently also guaranteed the right to an abortion under federal law, however a more conservative Supreme Court (SCOTUS) may eventually overturn that.

After last year's KS ruling, people who are pro-choice can sue under Kansas state law to try and overturn what they view as regulations that make it overly difficult to exercise your abortion rights and get an abortion in KS. Anti-abortion Kansans are highly upset this KS Supreme Court ruling, leading to (mostly GOP) KS legislators proposing this constitutional amendment that would take away your guarantee of abortion rights in KS under the KS constitution. 

*If the amendment passes*, (1) it will mostly shut down the ability of pro-choice people to sue the KS legislature over the state's harsh abortion restrictions, and (2) if SCOTUS ever overturns national abortion rights, this KS amendment no longer allow for a right to abortion in Kansas that exists today in the KS state constitution, so abortion could be easily be completely outlawed in Kansas.

Alternately, *if this amendment doesn't pass*, (1) KS state court can now be used to provide more scrutiny over KS abortion regulations, and (2) even if SCOTUS overturns national abortion rights, you would still have abortion rights guaranteed in KS by the KS constitution, and the KS legislature could not easily outlaw abortion completely.",1579801543,ffckqvx

As you say, it costs jurisdictions money to regulate local businesses that sell you stuff, plus you and the business are also (as you said) using local jurisdiction's infrastructure.  

When you log into Netflix, you and Netflix are both using your state and state and local internet infrastructure, which is regulated at both the state and local level - it costs money to do so.

1399,RikyStew,"First, and let me be very clear on this: Police use their legal powers far too liberally and are not pushed back enough. This is why I support groups like PINAC and KopBusters. We need a lot more Andy Taylors and lot less Barney Fifes. I agree ""driving while black"" is a real thing, so are many other forms of police corruption. In my town police pulled over kids for a variety of BS reasons ... WHITE KIDS .. so racist.  In many areas across he country police will pull over out-of-town people for no other reason tan revenue generation. Having been law enforcement, the corruption and abuses I saw made me sick. I reported every one.
     
Second, the only decent link you had was the first one, but even it stinks. No where in the article does it talk about the methodology of the data collection or the way in-which the data was collated to form the numbers we were shown. How many of the people were from out-of-state? How many from out-of-county? Loads of people from the Dot get pulled over in JoCo (Wyandot county people coming to Johnson County) for no other reason than being from another county. I've been followed and eventually pulled over for nothing more than having MO license plates in KS when I lived in Blue Springs. Blue Springs cops pulled me over more than once for being young. They checked for alcohol and drugs each time. Was this ""racist""? No. It was cops being cops. Cops in each each check the people most likely committing a crime in their area. In Blue Springs, a group of young white boys in a Trans Am are more likely to be committing a crime than others, so they get pulled over more. But more to the point of this link, we have no idea where the data was collected from and which cops were white or black and who they pulled over. How many cops in that study were white pulling over black kids verses how many were black pulling over white kids? No idea, so we cannot draw a conclusion without links to the data. Flashy titles an important sounding credentials won't do it for me.
    
Third, Harley Davidson. I'm not reading that one. It is a private business and does not count towards ""systemic"" or ""instiutional"" racism. Did bad things happen, maybe. Should people be punished for bad things? Absolutely.
    
Fourth, when a bureaucrat draws lines around areas of low investment it is not racism. The low investment is indicative of crime and not race. Concluding that high-crime areas are ""black"" areas is, in your definition, racism.
    
Fifth, I agree that the wording of the concerned sentence is troubling, but the sentiment on both sides is what needs to be addressed. As was said in front of Congress recently in a hearing on racism in America, ""If I had to list the things troubling black people in America today, racism would not make the top 100."" I find it more troubling that a high school student's name was published than what he said. A young ""journalist"" in high school will say foolish things and those things should be addressed in an open a public forum so everyone may learn. However, this is no where near an example of ""systemic"" racism.

Change of subject. Ukraine. Do you owe Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch an apology?

You know, I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran. That's what I intend to do. I know what our Ukraine policy has been now for the three years of this administration. I'm proud of the work we've done. This administration delivered the capability for the Ukrainians to defend themselves. President Obama showed up with MREs (meals ready to eat.) We showed up with Javelin missiles. The previous administration did nothing to take down corruption in Ukraine. We're working hard on that. We're going to continue to do it.

I confirmed with your staff [crosstalk] last night that I would talk about Iran and Ukraine.

I just don't have anything else to say about that this morning.

I just want to give you another opportunity to answer this, because as you know, people who work for you in your department, people who have resigned from this department under your leadership, saying you should stand up for the diplomats who work here. [crosstalk]

I don't know who these unnamed sources are you're referring to. I can tell you this, when I talked to my team here --

These are not unnamed sources. [crosstalk] This is your senior adviser Michael McKinley, a career foreign service officer with four decades experience, who testified under oath that he resigned in part due to the failure of the State Department to offer support to Foreign Service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry on Ukraine.

I'm not going to comment on things that Mr. McKinley may have said. I'll say only this. I have defended every State Department official. We've built a great team. The team that works here is doing amazing work around the world.

Sir, respectfully [crosstalk] where have you defended Marie Yovanovitch?

I've defended every single person on this team. I've done what's right for every single person on this team. [crosstalk]

Can you point me toward your remarks where you have defended Marie Yovanovitch?

I've said all I'm going to say today. Thank you. Thanks for the repeated opportunity to do so. I appreciate that.

In fact, the top growth states over the past ten years seem to have a pretty broad mix of taxes. The 11th fastest growing state, Oregon, also has the 3rd highest income tax,  behind only CA and Hawaii.

What seems far more notable about the top ten or 11 states is that they are somewhat famously the states where people go if they’re trying to find a job outside California (UT, TX, ID, NV, CO, WA, AZ, OR) or they’re retiring from the northeast (FL, SC).

I've never claimed that low taxes are the sole cause of migration, only that there is a strong correlation with little evidence to the contrary.  Taxes can be a key indicator, but they aren't the only indicator.  That's why outliers like OK and WY don't invalidate the correlation of low taxes to net migration.

Your explanation, while plausible, isn't a root cause of migration. Why are these high paying tech jobs popping up in other states that just happen to have lower tax rates?

I agree that people are following the jobs, but corporations (job creators) move for tax purposes all the time.  If the jobs are moving to lower tax areas, it makes sense that the workers will follow.

I won't write the corporate tax rates for each state, click the link below for those, but here are the averages for the top 10 and bottom 10 states for job growth.

They’re moving to areas of high population density with highly educated people, typically large universities, and friendly to business regulations.

This statement is completely false for two reasons: Washington isn't a high-tax state and California and New York are the loss leaders.

Now you're arguing that since most people are moving to metropolitan areas this somehow refutes the link between tax rates and population growth?  The cities that are growing the fastest are the ones in low-tax states.

1430,natethomas,"I’ll cop to being wrong about Washington.  The conversation I was trying to have about all three ended up not really being the conversation we are having. I pointed to those three states, because all three have had somewhat famously exploding populations that are pretty directly connected, not to tax structures, but to enormous industries that power the state engines. California has the tech industry and the entertainment industry. Wash has tech and flight. And New York has the financial industry.  And if you look at the news in each state, typically people aren’t arguing that they need to lower taxes to keep people from leaving. Instead, the most overwhelming problem is that people want to be there, but housing is astronomically expensive. 

So companies and people move out, but typically what they’re looking for, at least from personal experience (this literally happened to my company) is not lower taxes. They’re looking for a location with similar pools of smart people, but cheaper housing. My company found that in Phoenix. I know of several other companies who found that in places like Austin and Dallas. The tax structure did not matter. What mattered was that when they settled down, they could hire a dozen or a hundred employees almost instantly who would know how to work in the company. I know several companies who absolutely refuse to leave California, because they just don’t think they’ll find the pool of workers they’ll need anywhere else.

When I say friendly to business regulation, at least in my experience, I’m genuinely not talking about taxes. I’m talking about worker regulations, warehouse regulations, whether noncompete clauses are enforceable, whether it’s easy to get high speed internet to the building, and how much of a regulatory burden simply building a building would be. 

It is possible that tax drives some of these companies and workers. I have no other explanation for Idaho. But for all the companies I’ve interacted with in the tech industry over the past 10 or so years, the income tax burden of a state hasn’t even been part of the conversation. The companies look for sources of smart workers. And that’s where they go.

Sadly, all that info is based on personal experience, and isn’t really admissible in a statistical argument. I’d be willing to bet a lot of money though that the places that have seen the most growth happen to be places that are a short flight or drive to California or Washington, that graduate a LOT of engineers, and that have (or had) relatively inexpensive housing at the start of the growth cycle.",1579929602,ffhc8tf

1434,cyberphlash,"Thanks for calling me an idiot - you're really elevating this discussion! ;)

I agree with your points here that one can argue these types of purchases are taxed in other ways, gas/energy/utility/etc.  I disagree to some extent when you say that say you don't buy that online purchases are a threat to local businesses - clearly they are.  Also, you never said whether you agree with the point that if Kansans aren't taxed within Kansas, they *should* be taxed, and that money sent to California instead.  I think I have a pretty solid argument there. I'd also respond to what you're saying here a couple other points.  

First, today, on infrastructure, we're *under-taxed* both in the sense that Kansas blasted through its infrastructure rainy day fund to pay for Brownback's tax cuts. We all (well, some of us anyway) had fun and got our tax breaks, but now our infrastructure is going to decay and we don't have the savings built up to pay for it - *so we're going to have to re-tax ourselves to pay for that* because unlike what conservatives thought, *there is no free lunch*.

Second, the shift from brick and mortar purchases to online deliveries should mean we're shifting the tax burdern to tax delivery services more because they're placing an increasing burden on us not just in infrastructure, but carbon emissions / climate change as well - which, by the way, we're doing nothing about and gas taxes aren't nearly covering the externalities there.

To your point, *Netflix* isn't a goods purchase delivered in a truck to my house - but it is a product ordered from my house and consumed by me at my house.  In this sense, it is a product that be taxed *if we all want to tax consumption*.

The larger point I would make is that I think you guys haven't considered that our local and state governments have an existing tax burden that has to be paid for.  The GOP attempted to seriously slash our spending, and taxpayers revolted by kicking out many of the conservatives that did that - so clearly taxpayers want the existing level of spending.

So how do you pay for it?  Generally, I think most people agree that taxing consumption is fair, which leads to today's sales taxes. Catalog purchases were never the major form by which people consumed, so never represented a large lost in tax revenue. However, with the shift to online purchases and consumption of entertainment like Netflix, we're taxing an increasingly smaller share of people's consumption if we don't change our taxing strategy to match.  

You can make all the arguments you want about how Netflix is already taxed this and that way, but what is true is that Netflix is not taxed right now as the consumption product it really is.  Eventually, this situation will lead to legislators either taxing more of these online delivery/consumption products, or raising taxes in other ways (property, etc) because - as I said - *there is no free lunch*.",1579967701,ffi8bsz

This site isn't the official laws, but an organized interpretation.

&gt;You can renew your KS driver's license up to 1 year before it expires, unless you are younger than 21 years old. If you are younger than 21 years old, you must wait until your 21st birthday to complete the renewal.

&gt; Expired Driver's License

&gt; If you fail to renew your driver's license on or before the expiration date, you'll be charged a $1 fee and you may be required to take your examinations again. In addition, you may receive a traffic ticket if a law enforcement officer catches you driving on an expired license.

---

I wonder whether they give 21 year olds who don't renew it on the exact day any trouble (like if you get pulled over) or charge them the $1 late fee. If it's just your county that limits your renewal day (which it may not be) then you could always try a different county. And the actual KS manual doesn't say anything about the 21 year old rules. https://www.ksrevenue.org/pdf/dlhb.pdf (page 13) Just seems like a weird legal hole that is usually ignored but could be a problem for someone somewhere at some time.",1580075024,ffo81jv

However, it seems like we're slouching towards Biden at this point - even though Bernie might win Iowa &amp; New Hampshire, Biden seems likely to gain momentum after that and cruise to the nomination with the backing of the Dem party establishment. 

The thing I'd like to hear some opinions on here is why Biden isn't the most electable Democrat. The electorate is mostly now split between whites and non-whites.  Trump won every gender-age group of whites last time and seems fairly likely to carry that group again, and in the rust belt states that put him over the top. History has also shown that voters mostly judge the president based on the current economy - which is good for Trump - thinking that if there's nothing wrong, don't fix it.

For people who don't like Biden, which other candidate has a shot at disrupting this pattern of all white gender-age groups voting for Trump? What other candidate has a better shot at capturing rust belt whites than Biden?

Again, I'm not here to defend Biden, but just because I'm more with Bernie/Warren on policy doesn't *necessarily* mean I should believe they're the best candidates to beat Trump - which, honestly, is my number 1 priority because *anyone* is better than Trump. Let's be honest - pretty much any *Republican* candidate would be better than Trump.

Anyhow, I think there's essentially 3 modes of how a Dem presidency would pay out.  (1) Outside of Bernie/Warren, all the other candidates are establishment and their presidencies would be attempting to reboot the Obama years, reversing Trump's worst policies (which themselves were about reversing Obama policies), and being what I'd call a 'placeholder' presidency that doesn't do much, but keeps things from eroding further. That's what a Clinton presidency would've been, and really, the last 6 years of Obama's presidency were mostly that. (2) With Warren, you'd get placeholder presidency but a much more aggressive Executive, trying to run around congress making *more* progressive incremental changes than Biden or others would - and she'd be effective at this but probably stymied by the courts. (3) I think Bernie would be effective at articulating a vision, but not actually running the government or implementing the type of aggressive policies he's talked about.  To moderates, Warren is less scary than Bernie, and I think they'd be more willing to work with her.

The difference between Bernie and Warren is Bernie speaks of overarching principles like the value of Medicare for all - which is admittedly more inspiring than trying to listen to Warren explain the 30 ways in which she's make incremental changes that would add up to something similar, but not go quite as far - and that's the two other modes that I think you'd get - with Warren trying to make incremental policy improvements at and Bernie arguing for a larger shift towards socialism but at all achieving that.  In the same vein, Trump is basically doing now for the right what Bernie would do for the left - articulating this big far right vision, but doesn't have the political or management competency to get it implemented.  A smarter politician with Trump's ideas would be *way more* effective at implementing the Trump authoritarian agenda.

So, between Warren and Sanders, I think *she* would actually be a more effective placeholder president, but Biden actually may be the most effective because being the placeholder is sort of what he's promising to do - not rock the boat, reverse Trump policies and go back to what Obama was doing, and just be low key about it. After the Brownback era in Kansas, I think that's why they elected Kelly - she was essentially promising to take people away from the anger and madness, and just go back to running the government competently again.

The basic argument between the left isn't really a difference in principles, it's an argument about what policy goals are achievable, and how far you should try to go to achieve them before things would fall apart.  Realistically, the problem for Dems isn't just fighting to get Ted Cruz on board with your goal - it's fighting to get *other Dems like Joe Manchin* on board with your goal - which is why Obamacare was a sort of disastrous compromise.  Medicare For All was never achievable at that time - people forget that now, and Obamacare was a result of *serious* compromises and policy decisions that seemed like the right thing to do at the time, but of blew up later. But again, Medicare For All was not even on the table, so would you take Obamacare, or no Obamacare?  I think Dems would take Obamacare.

Bringing this back - so to me, even though I don't like the feeling, it feels somewhat that Biden is more likely to beat Trump, and that he'd probably be more effective at achieving overall Dem policy goals than Sanders (but not Warren) as president.",1580222448,fftjuyv

Once in a while the computer out at my dads absolutely lays a fucking egg and takes a minute and a half to establish/reestablish a connection (same issue with wireless, but that's a separate discussion). I do a speed check and the top speed is always fine, but those connectivity issues are annoying.

The European polecat (Mustela putorius) – also known as the common ferret, black or forest polecat, foumart (from Middle English  'Fulmard', meaning 'Foul', and 'Mearth' , meaning 'Marten'), or fitch (as well as some other names) – is a species of mustelid native to western Eurasia and north Morocco. It is of a generally dark brown colour, with a pale underbelly and a dark mask across the face. Occasionally, colour mutations, including albinos and erythrists, occur. Compared to minks and other weasels – fellow members of the genus Mustela – the polecat has a shorter, more compact body; a more powerfully built skull and dentition; is less agile; and it is well known for having the characteristic ability to secrete a particularly foul-smelling liquid to mark its territory.

From the moment of fertilization there is a map to a complete human being, with unique beliefs, desires, needs, and intrests. Most embryologists agree, Life begins at Fertilization.

""Human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception).
""Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.""
[Moore, Keith L. Essentials of Human Embryology. Toronto: B.C. Decker Inc, 1988, p.2]

""The development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.""

[Sadler, T.W. Langman's Medical Embryology. 7th edition. Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins 1995, p. 3]

""Although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.... The combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. Thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. The embryo now exists as a genetic unity.""

Up to 1/3 of all pregnancies end up being self aborted by the body itself. They don't ""die"" like someone in a hospice bed surrounded by family or getting hit by a train. They just get flushed out and/or reabsorbed by the woman.

A lot of things can happen between there and then. Miscarriages, auto/self abortions, monozygotic twinning (Which completely undermines the theory of ""meiosis=creation of a soul""), situations where twins are formed then one gets ""absorbed"" by the other which forms a genetic chimera person...

That also ignores that most living organisms are NOT born via mammal federalization styles, but are developed through other methods like sporing, eggs, pollination, asexual reproductions,  IVF treatments/styles, cloning,  and so on. If you're arguing that ""life begins at conception"" (and not even implantation) as the default for ""start of life"", then the absolute vast majority of living organisms would not be considered alive.


Also let's get one thing right. An ""embryo"" doesn't even develop until about 11 weeks into a pregnancy. A fertilized egg is called a zygote. Then after a few cycles of mitosis, it becomes a blastocyst.

This is what is being discussed.

This is a solid breakdown on the week by week gestation cycle of a normal pregnancy.

Their own homes, towns, etc, so it was perfectly reasonable that everyone would be armed. And they would hold drills and practice with those weapons. They would also drill as a community.

1811,ciaoSonny,"Not the previous commenter, but I suspect that 2015 is relevant because of a Supreme Court opinion issued in April of 2015.

In short, the Court decided that a traffic stop cannot be extended for the purposes of a dog sniff “absent the reasonable suspicion ordinarily demanded to justify detaining an individual.” *Rodriguez v. United States,* [135 S.Ct. 1609](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-9972_p8k0.pdf), 1615 (2015).

In other words, a traffic stop predicated on some traffic infraction, which is itself a detention of the vehicle and its occupants, can generally last for only so long as it takes to collect the driver’s information and issue the ticket.   Without some additional reasonable (and articulable) suspicion justificatory of the continued detention, an officer can not prolong the stop for the sake of bringing in a canine.  

An officer’s authority to continue the stop ends once his investigation of the original infraction is complete, at least without some other independently supported reasonable suspicion— e.g., if the officer were to smell some odor indicative of illegal drugs or discover other evidence that the driver is involved in the commission of a crime, that may serve as a valid basis for extending the stop, but continuing the stop absent the necessary reasonable suspicion just to wait for the dog to see what it may or may not find is not constitutionally permissible.",1580673888,fgcls8h

And I've heard bone density doesn't really decrease either. Now, lets say we do follow the olympic route you've suggested. Does the athlete still bear the burden of providing blood hormone level readings, or is this on the district?

The effect of hormones is going depend on when a person started, what they're taking and how long they've been on them. In a case where someone started hormone therapy at or before the start of puberty there would be no difference between a trans person and a cis person and if anything a young trans person could be at a disadvantage because hormone therapy for people that young is focused on delaying the effects of puberty. For a trans woman once her hormone levels reach the levels of a cis woman the difference in physical strength between her and a cis woman is negligible.

Edit: After reading the proposed legislature  (crazy idea I know) it appears that simply asking a representative to vote NO on this bill would be the right call - if you're pro-choice. If you wrote someone and said ""vote NO on the abortion bill"" it would keep the current bill in place that guarantees abortion as a right in Kansas. If you wrote ""vote YES on the bill"" it would pass, but not necessarily mean that abortion is banned, just that it will be left up to the politicians.

Unless the GOP changes course of dies completely Kansas will be held back from progress even if the federal government follows the years under FDR and Democrats end up with POTUS and 80% majorities in the House and Senate Kansas will be the last Republican outpost and will suffer for it.

“pro-life fuckwad” checking in here. 

I think public school funding is very important and frankly, I don’t see how it contradicts my pro-life views in any way. I care very much about the kids who already exist, including when they are most vulnerable before birth. What you see as a “glob of fragile developing cells” is a human organism just like you and I, just at an early and critical stage of development(this claim is backed by science in the standard medical text “Human Embryology and Teratology” when it states, “Although human life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.”). 
Lastly, I don’t believe it’s the pro-life objective to “force women who don’t want babies to have them.” I’d rather see every child born into a family that is ready and capable to support him or her, but that is not the world we live in. There are infinitely better options, such as adoption, in which the killing of the human being can be avoided. While the failed amendment is disappointing, I will continue to fight “tooth and nail” to protect kids.

And yet there is a significant shortage of said families resulting in a large percentage of kids not getting adopted and eventually aging out of the system unloved, unsupported, and failed by the society that says ""abortion is bad, but so is welfare programs, so lets slash the budget to any support these kids might have had because I'm selfish and want to pay half a percent less in taxes"".

Also, a large part of what adoptions do occur are from a tragedy happening and a family adopting a relatives kid or a family friends kid.  Sure, there are those that go out baby shopping, but just because that worked out for you doesn't make it a magic cure all for all unwanted births.  Minority babies are far less likely to be adopted than white babies, and with minorities being the more likely to be in poverty and more likely to need to give up/abort a child that makes adoption an even less viable solution to the problem.

What's making the world a shitty place is ass-hats trying to shove their shitty morals and ideals on others while simultaneously trying to avoid helping others in society.  So although abortion isn't a great option, the world has enough people living in misery, and at least it prevents adding to a huge list of other societal problems.

""In the U.S., most crimes of violence are covered by state law, not federal law. 38 states currently recognize the ""unborn child"" (the term usually used) or fetus as a homicide victim, and 23 of those states apply this principle throughout the period of pre-natal development.[2] These laws do not apply to legally induced abortions. Federal and state courts have consistently held that these laws do not contradict the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on abortion....

For example, California treats the killing of a fetus as homicide, but does not treat the killing of an embryo (prior to approximately eight weeks) as homicide, by construction of the California Supreme Court.[4] Some other states do not consider the killing of a fetus to be homicide until the fetus has reached quickening or viability.[5]""

On top of that, these laws are being used to target women themselves for ""reckless endangerment"" types acts that also includes having stillborns and miscarriages.

2134,cyberphlash,"Hey /u/plummyr - not sure why you're getting downvoted for this comment - I get it, and I hope you were adopted into a loving family that treated you well.

Unfortunately, we've all seen how the State of KS is managing its foster care system, with kids getting lost, sleeping on office floors, etc. I find it hard to believe that all of these kids are going to have a good outcome like you did - in fact, many will fall into poverty, have unwanted kids of their own in a continuing cycle, etc - as a result of just being run through this system.

Along the same lines, children born to single / low income / teen moms tend to end up in poor households as well, growing up with less opportunities and at a disadvantage. And Kansas isn't really trying to help these kids - in fact, yesterday, in response to the abortion amendment vote fail in the House, Susan Wagle's response is to shut down Medicaid expansion - which, again, will just continue to hurt the families of low income people who need help.

So, to your point, yes, being alive is certainly better than not, and from a societal perspective, I don't really think people of either party like abortion that much, but as an alternative to being forced to put your kid into this foster care system, or raise a kid in shitty conditions in a society that clearly isn't trying to help look out for you *after* you're forced to have the kid, it feels to me like abortion is necessary right now, and it's going to continue to be until the people that would like to force women to have abortions admit that it results in disaster, and propose ways to correct that.

Also, this isn't just about abortion. Many of the same people that want to outlaw abortion *also* want to outlaw birth control, because they believe in a historically religious driven system of men controlling women, and *deciding for them* when they have families, and how far they get to go in life. I'm a middle aged man, some kind of radical feminist, and this is clear to me and many others, and we just disagree with it. So, again, until the attitude about treating women fairly and equally changes, I'm going to have to continue to believe that abortion and birth control are critical tools to the life outcome success of all women.",1581182769,fgyfaj1

Conception does not guarantee life.  Miscarriages happen a lot more than people openly talk about, and can happen at anytime during pregnancy, and can have serious health consequences for the mother.

Birth does not guarantee life.  There can be complications during delivery, or health issues with the baby that are unknown in utero.  I have lived through this myself, and have had a 12 day old child die in my arms, and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.

Pregnancy is not without serious risk.  Women, even in the United States, still die from pregnancy and child birth.  My family is lucky to have narrowly escaped this as well.

Rape, sexual abuse, and incest are things that still happen, and they happen a lot more than you think, because like miscarriages and abortions, people don't usually openly talk about them.

Most ""pro-life"" people I know, think they are being noble and protecting innocent life from lazy, irresponsible women who just choose to use abortion as a primary means of birth control.  They believe that a zygote has a soul, and that their god wouldn't allow awful things to happen to deserving women and children.  Their opinion is backed almost exclusively by religious belief.  There is nobility in it.  This love and respect for life is not something to be lightly brushed off, but....  they are trying to legislate their religious views onto others, which I believe goes strongly against our core American values and beliefs.

Making abortion ""illegal"" does not stop abortions, it just makes it more difficult and far more dangerous.  In addition, you are harming some of the most vulnerable people in our society for the benefit of stopping some possibly irresponsible people and achieving some religious satisfaction in the process.  In other words.  Get in the fucking real world.  These are complicated, serious decisions to be made within the family, and ultimately between the woman and her doctor.  In addition, not allowing exceptions for rape, incest, or life threatening, abnormal pregnancies is morally reprehensible.  Your cause is only noble if you disregard all the good women you are torturing/killing by making your religious fantasy come true.  You want to protect life?  Donate your time and money to adoption charities.  Adopt a kid.  Fight to make adoptions more affordable and common place.  Fight to stop school shootings.  Fight to bring our troops home and stop endless wars.  Fight to stop rape and sexual abuse.

These improvements are not about ""investments"" on a profit level, but on a living level. With investments in fiber and internet, rural communities can better thrive and be self supportive without requiring constant transportation needs. Businesses, schools, and libraries can grow and develop in those towns that cater to their popultions. Things like tele-medicine and tele-therapy can do wonders in trying to off-set medical losses and drug addictions without forcing people to drive hours (if possible) to the nearest treatment center or therapist. Schools and libraries can provide digital resources like books or information without having to invest in physical locations or transporting/storing bulky items. 

Farmers and businesses can engage in their own business needs using digital information, up to date markets, controlling their equipment, and so on.

&gt; Tres Biggs went to jail for failing to appear in court for unpaid medical bills.

&gt; In rural Coffeyville, Kansas, where the poverty rate is twice the national average, attorneys like Michael Hassenplug have built successful law practices representing medical providers to collect debt owed by their neighbors.

&gt; The attorney uses that law by asking the court to direct people with unpaid medical bills to appear in court every three months and state they are too poor to pay in what is called a &amp;quot;Debtors exam.""

2206,cyberphlash,"This seems incredibly unrealistic.

Medicare For All would have the effect of covering *every* American, including all the millions not covered by healthcare now. The basic assumption here is that, for most people, you and your employer would pay approximately the same amount (less some savings Sanders thinks will happen) *through taxes to the Feds instead of deductions paid to private insurers*.  

So if most people are spending around [$5,000 *per person*](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/americans-spend-twice-as-much-on-health-care-today-as-in-the-1980s.html) on health care today, *that will pretty much continue*, and the idea that middle income Americans would only be paying $1-2k sounds ridiculous unless you assume that America will pass massive tax increases on billionaires and corporations - in an era when tax rates on these two have only trended down over the last 50 years.

Even in Sanders's team's [explanation](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/08/the-cost-of-medicare-for-all/), they're saying Medicare For All would save about $2 Billion over 10 years on a total spend of $59 Billion - hardly a lot of savings.  And they're assuming we can get big price discounts on prescription drugs, and that service providers will be willing to take big pay cuts (can't wait to see doctors and nurses like up behind that, right?)

Look, I'm for Medicare for All - I think it would be more beneficial than what we have now, but I think proponents of this should admit that there's no *huge* savings here. It's going to cost *a lot* to insure all the millions of currently uninsured, and under-insured, people out there today - there's no getting around that, and Americans will have to realize that, and be willing to pay for it. 

And while we're talking about it, prepare to hear the response from all the *other Americans* who work in the private insurance, pharma, and medical industries.  Your neighbor the drug rep, or insurance guy, or nurse - may not be excited to lose their job or take a pay cut as a result of this. Just saying...",1581305021,fh6shw1

2214,nonbonumest,"I'm a lawyer who practices in Kansas. This isn't legal advice and I'm not your attorney. But missing a payment is not what causes a person to be jailed. It's missing a hearing in aid of execution (debtor's exam) when one has been served with notice to appear at it, which triggers a show cause order why the person shouldn't be held in contempt of court for failing to appear when summoned. Then when a person doesn't appear at the show-cause hearing, that's what generally is going to trigger the contempt finding and an arrest warrant. Is it an huge inconvenience getting called into court once every three months just to say you have no money? Yes, of course. But that's not what triggers the arrest, it's failing to appear in court twice when commanded to. I'm not trying to say this is right or wrong, but this is literally how debt collection has worked for ages, for all types of debt, there is nothing new here. If someone has a valid judgment on a debt, like say an overdrawn checking account, and a person simply refuses to pay, without a hearing in aid of execution, it's not going to be possible to find out what assets a person has to pay the debt, or where they work to garnish wages, etc. Without this system, it's not really possible to enforce debts and judgments.

My argument isn't that you should rely on the government to lift you up and onward, it's that government regulations should exist to prevent predatory practices like what we're seeing in SE Kansas. People in poverty generally have higher levels of instability in employment and income. This compounds problems like acquiring credit, which can spiral out of control when unexpected life circumstances crop up. Yes, people should be responsible for themselves but government should play a role in preventing the more nefarious tendencies of our litigious society. 

It's also wrong to equate an inability to pay medical debt with something like a high-interest car loan, or racking up a credit card on a shopping spree. Nobody in their right mind says ""gee, you know what I've really been itching for some cancer lately."" But it fucking happens, and no degree of price transparency is going to help when someone without reliable transportation and who might even have trouble making a copayment is forced to choose between impending death or saddling their household with an anchor of debt.

People vote for values *they* believe in, and people who will *empower their values*. If their  values are primarily focused on returning to a perceived 1950's golden era of 'traditional values', they're probably also willing to also support things that sound good on paper, like *big tax cuts* and *cutting spending on people not like them*.

Trump carried all age &amp; gender groups among whites, which was a sign where the re-alignment was headed.

III

One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.

IV

The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.

V

Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.

VI

People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.

Its a shame to hear about the recent health inspection issues pointed out by /u/ingepurl, hopefully they'll take care of those since Papa Kenos has improved a lot in recent years, since new owners took over. When Papa Kenos pizza is good, its really good - massive slices, well balanced seasoning, and the only good New York style crusts I've found in the area. Also for anyone who's still reading, I know some wild stories about Papa Keno's which I've written about below.

I grew up around Papa Keno's, my family &amp; I ate there almost every week since was about 2 (for reference, I'm 30 as of this writing). Despite my love for it, Papa Keno's one of those places with such a crazy history that its astounding its still around. The original owners were big tax dodgers, so much so that the restaurant was eventually seized by the state about 10 years ago for hundreds of thousands in unpaid taxes ([here's an old article on it I found](http://www.kansan.com/news/papa-keno-s-closes-its-doors/article_456d2584-db98-5755-aa33-db0e5ec0244c.html)). There was also a big drug problem, drugs are an unfortunate issue throughout the food industry, but these guys took it to the next level. A friend of mine worked at Papa Keno's under the old owners and for awhile they couldn't pay all employees! One day, my friend was called to the back and the owner offered him a small sack of cocaine as payment (anecdotal story, so take with a grain of salt).

At any rate, the old owners sold Papa Keno's &amp; the franchise to the current owners back in 2012. The current owners seem to have massively cleaned up the place; probably the main reason why it survived. Crazy stuff.",1581541415,fhfdve3

People have (in this county) agency for medical decisions and the right to choose their own medical care whether it's preventative (vaccinations, exams, diet,  exercise, etc) or reactive (surgery, medication, etc).

It IS a slippery slope for a lot of people, because once you start advocating for forced treatment or healthcare on one thing, then it becomes that much easier to do it in other situations. Do we force people to take medication (like an anti-viral) if they had a virus? Would they be considered putting the public ""at-risk"" if they refused or decided on a different course of treatment?

Part of the problem was that the doctor who outed Osama bin Laden's location to the CIA used him giving people vaccinations as a cover story to be let into different locations. When that was publicized, there was a huge backlash against vaccinations and medical people in 
 both countries, and it literally led to a resurgence in polio in the region.  (Using medical care for covert acts adn the ethics involved is a different topic).

Sanders talks in big moralistic generalities; until recently didn't have a quantified plan for M4A because he know that the very idea of how much it would cost turns people off, and it's not really his style to talk about it in terms of numbers.

But Warren, like Clinton, is the type of ""I have a plan for that"" politician focused on what can actually be done given the constraints of both parties and control of Congress.  I think Warren would probably be a lot more effective as a president, and as an acceptable middle ground candidate in the fight between the left and center-left.  Now, Dems end up having to choose between Sanders and one of the establishment candidates, so some half of the party is going to have to choke that one down in the end, which isn't going to get people too excited about November...",1581959283,fhxp3yg

2743,BureMakutte,"First I will address the examples you gave. I will take note that you specifically said in the name of public safety in your original post when addressing these examples.

&gt;Tuskegee experiments

How does this relate to body autonomy or public safety? This was a clinical trial that had serious ethical concerns that actually resulted in much better laws and regulations in relation to studies. This was the exact opposite of public safety because they purposefully did not treat people. Yes it was messed up and related to medicine, but i don't see how this applies here.

&gt;forced sterilization practices &amp; eugenics

So these basically go hand in hand because the forced sterilization was due to the eugenics mindset of the time. So this one has a MINISCULE amount of ""public safety"" as one could argue that eugenics and forced sterilization would lead to a greater safer population. However this effectively goes into the same mindset anyone could make about any specific group that they feel is a drag on society. Overall this was about denying people fundamental right to produce offspring.

&gt;psychiatric abuses

This is very vague, but I assume you are mostly talking about secret programs that the government did. Obviously they were secret because they were doing illegal things that violated laws, conventions, or even parts of our constitution. Passing or not passing a law regarding public vaccination I don't think will affect when the government wants to try and do some illegal shit behind closed doors. I think its definitely messed up but if you somehow think a vaccination law will somehow give the government the green light to do something, you just gave an example where they already don't care. 

&gt;lobotomies (forced or otherwise)

This was part of medical science in history. The early 1900's was rife with medical experiments with little to no oversight. That is no longer the case today. In 200 years we will look back at how our early attempts at chemotherapy were barbaric but now there's oversight. Again another example that doesn't really involve public safety.

&gt;Guatemala syphilis experiments

Experiments on people. Yes this violated their Body autonomy, but it was without their knowledge even. It was also a seriously messed up experiment. It also goes against the idea of public safety because they were spreading diseases.

&gt;radiation experiments done on children,

Medical science in the early 1900's.

&gt;Willowbrook

Again another experiment infecting children with diseases.

&gt;segregated healthcare based on race and religion for decades/over a century, and multiple other instances of abuse done in the US alone.

Do you have anything within the last 40 years? Most of these cases are late 1800's, early 1900's or mid 1900's when medical science wasn't nearly as grown as it is today, along with the regulations, laws, and rules in place now.

What I am getting at is all those examples are indeed bad and messed up but they all involved people getting more than their bodily autonomy being ""violated"" and none of them were for actual public safety. Vaccinations while do violate bodily autonomy, benefit both the receiver of the vaccination and society at large due to herd immunity. They are also not experimental. There obviously is the rare chance they are in the 0.0001% or w/e a vaccination has a worse reaction, but that's the case with anything medical. We have to look out for the people who CANT get vaccinated as a society to help them stay safe. 

Last, if you are against violating bodily autonomy no matter what, then how far are you okay with ostracizing those people until they give consent? Cant attend public functions? Can't leave their house? Forced to go to a quarantine location? If a new major bubonic plague comes about and a vaccination is found, are you okay with violating bodily autonomy then or the above conditions?",1581962596,fhxukbc

M4A would necessarily have to be passed in a similar fashion with reconciliation, giving it the same vulnerabilities - in an era when Trump judges and SCOTUS are already looking for ways to strike down Obamacare (let alone M4A).

Why isn't Sanders spending any time talking about the obvious - that in order to pass any of this meaningful legislation (M4A, climate change, etc) and make it stick, Dems first need to flatten the playing field, which is currently stacked against them in the Senate.

&gt; Peter Schartel, the owner of Alpine Broadcasting Corporation of Liberty, Mo., the company airing Sputnik in Kansas City, said that he started the broadcasts on Jan. 1 both because he liked what he heard during a trial run last fall and because he was getting paid.

&gt; Anyone tuned to Sputnik on 104.7 FM while driving across the historic 18th &amp; Vine district in Kansas City, Mo., will find that it fades for a few minutes of music from KOJH - the call letters refer to Kansas City&amp;#039;s oldest jazz house - before Sputnik takes back over.

OH, THANK YOU, You informed me so much. Thank god you answered my question of ""How does this study violate bodily autonomy?"" with, ""it just does"". I went and furthered my reading on it and found the missing bits that yes I agree it does violate body autonomy because the doctors gave them placebos when asking for penicillin. SEE, WAS THAT SO HARD?

&gt;And instead of censuring and throwing those medical professionals (mostly John Cutler) into prison, the US government shifted him from the Terre Haute Prison Experiments to the Guatemala syphilis experiments to finally the final stages of the Tuskegee experiments.

I know. I read about him and I detailed the Guatemala Syphilis experiments were a violation of bodily autonomy, but you wouldn't know this because you ""stopped here"". Instead of trying to help someone be more informed.

&gt;I'm not going to deal with the rest until you really grasp the deep, deep history and problems of the US government experimenting on different populations both on US citizens and in other countries.

""What I am getting at is all those examples are indeed bad and messed up but they all involved people getting more than their bodily autonomy being ""violated"" and none of them were for actual public safety.""

The city/county would get sales tax revenue and a place for people to hang out, rather than letting it fall into one more desert along with all the other deserted areas of a suburb or small town.

Every morning the utility has to declare to the market how much spare generation it will be able to provide from the upcoming midnight hour to the following midnight hour.  This is called the day-ahead market.  This is done so that Arkansas knows it can buy power if it's hot and they can't produce enough.  Similarly, Evergy can declare that it will need all of its generation and them some, and get an idea of what will be available for purchase to fill the gap for its own customers. This is important to keep the grid stable and ensure that everybody in the country has reliable power.

But, this is obviously based on analysis and modeling and things don't always play nice with those.  Maybe something causes the company to shut down one of its units unexpectedly, or it's cloudier than expected, or not as windy.

You have to do a lot of dancing between baseline power and the more mercurial renewables.  You also need to provide the cheapest power to your customers first, which makes the dance more complex.  Adding further to the complexity, you can shut a coal plant down very quickly, but it takes most of a day to turn it back up.  Gas plants may take hours to get back to speed as well.  And even though you can turn a carbon plant down quickly, they are less efficient at low power so at some point you just have to shut it down to be in compliance with environment regulations.  

And with all of this, you still need to meet your commitments from your day-ahead declaration, even if it means you need to purchase from somebody else to do it.

So there's a lot going on.  From a cost standpoint, renewables have reached parity with carbon fuels.  There are fluctuations of course among all of them, but it's no longer a ""coal is cheap"" argument.  You will always need some kind of baseline utility power.  Nuclear is probably the ultimate answer until energy storage is figured out.

Utility companies are reducing their carbon footprint, though, partially because of regulations, but also because investors now are demanding it, as well as customers.  And some utilities actually understand the importance of caring for the climate.

So that should give some idea of how ridiculous the political situation is:  utility companies recognize climate change and their environmental impact better than politicians do.

It never made sense that Denning - who's been a huge critic and opponent of Medicaid Expansion all along - would suddenly do a 180 and act as the GOP's chief leader for it in an election year *in which he's not even running for reelection*, and when hard line GOP voters would still be opposed to it.

No surprise that Wagle is against it - she always was, and the abortion vote failure just pissed her off further, I'm sure, leading to her bluster about how the Feds or KS eventually having to pay for abortions (which it won't).

However, *not* doing Medicaid Expansion this year was becoming increasing challenging since it was so close to passing last year, and the public has been moving towards increasing support.

*What to do*?  How about we cook up a deal in which the leading opponent of expansion suddenly comes out for it, pretending to make a deal with the governor in which he looks like an actual leader, and the other leading opponent, who's running in the Federal Senate race against some of the state's other arch conservatives, comes out further against it, going so far as to try and poison it at every turn, and use expansion's potential failure it as the chief insurance policy in attempting to amend the state constitution with a controversial hardliner anti-abortion amendment.

When the amendment doesn't pass, *oh no*, we have to poison the well now, and sorry Jim Denning, *boo hoo*, your attempt to appear moderate to appease your increasingly moderate JoCo base is going to fail.

""You can be forgiven for not having noticed, but at the tail end of 2019, Congress repealed three significant components of Obamacare.

The three repealed provisions were all taxes, each of which was included in the initial legislation as a way of raising revenue to pay for the hundreds of billions in spending the law called for. By far the biggest of the three was the so-called Cadillac tax, which was expected to raise about $197 billion over the next decade. Congress also nixed the law's health insurance tax, projected to raise $150 billion over 10 years, and the medical device tax, projected to raise $25.5 billion.""

https://reason.com/2020/01/07/congress-repealed-major-elements-of-obamacare-and-almost-no-one-noticed/",1582302944,fiakjet
2974,cyberphlash,"&gt;Years later, amidst a bipartisan spending binge, those taxes are repealed while the rest of the program remains on the books. The public barely notices, and the lawmakers involved simply shrug and move on. The result is legislation that is fiscally ruinous, but also more popular. There is a reason that debt and deficits have continued to climb ever upwards: That is what the public wants.

The GOP didn't have the stomach to shut down Medicaid expansion entirely - which would've been highly unpopular - so they just repealed these taxes to pay for their tax cut. Makes sense. To your point, yes, Medicaid expansion may begin to flail in the same way that, for instance, the Kansas State budget flailed after Brownback's disastrous tax cuts.  But as we've seen with Kelly and a more moderate legislature, the ship can be righted after everyone has had their tax break fun - all it takes is electing people dedicated to managing it to well again. (Not saying they're all doing a fabulous job today, just that compared to Brownback and GOP hardliners, today is A+ compared to that fail). There's no reason those Obamacaer taxes can't be put back in place - they were enacted once; they can be again.

*However*, I think the real lesson here for Dems - which is why you hear so many people clamoring for single payer now - is that if you take a halfass compromise single-party approach to something like Obamacare, then you risk getting it easily whittled down by the opposing party later, which is exactly what happened. It's not like there's going to be some kind of health care compromise, so now, if you're going to do something on health care, you might as well shoot to enact Medicare for All, rejigger the health care system lock stock, then it's just much harder to whittle that back to nothing later. That's essentially what happened when Social Security and Medicare were originally enacted - people love them, and they can't be taken away now - we all saw what happened when GW Bush tried on Social Security.

Agree with you that I don't think it will happen in KS - Denning / Wagle / etc will continue to fight.  I'm sure Julia Lynn - my own Olathe rep - isn't on board. She was putting up the same anti-Medicaid / pro-abortion talking points as Wagle last week...",1582305585,fiap16n

Both have many sexual assault allegations against them by women. 

Both have mocked disabled reporters.

Both defended the actions of the police in regards to the central park 5

Trump implemented a Muslim ban, Bloomberg harassed New York Muslims, and in general both seem to be fore ethnic profiling.


Bloomberg is slightly better then Trump I guess on immigration, historically has has been for controlling who comes here and said he thinks Republicans are right on this.

I don't see much of an issue between him and trump on lgbt stuff.


Bloomberg said this not only as a horrible example of transphobia its clasism against the folks who live here in the Midwest. 
""In a 2016 appearance at Oxford University, Bloomberg argued transgender rights won’t gain traction in the U.S. Midwest because only the ""intelligentsia"" can understand why ""some man wearing a dress should be in a locker room with their daughter.""""
In 2005 he fought for the right for the city to deny marriage licenses to same sex couples. 
He also targeted sex workers, targeting sex workers disproportionately hits queer people.

Bloomberg comes from a long line of hypothetical liberals who will speak support for queer people, but policy wise will trample all over them because it is just (and I hate this phrase) ""virtue signaling"" in this detached wealthy elite where they shame people in the Midwest for not being as nice to the ""degenerates"" but who are more the willing to leave them dying in the streets from homelessness and arresting them for resorting to sex work.


Bloomberg says the Iraq war was still a good idea, Trump at least thinks it is bad and willing to lie about himself supporting it. 
Bloomberg like Trump was opposed to the Iran nuclear deal and thinks we should have been stronger on it. Bloomberg is also a Zionist, not in a normal like Liberal defense if Israel which is still horrible, but he goes well above and beyond that. He is very pro Saudis as well.

Walter is Oklahoma’s state seismologist, and he is talking about the surge of earthquakes that has plagued his state since its most recent oil-and-gas boom. Production techniques—including hydraulic fracturing, or fracking—led to large-scale underground wastewater disposal, which scientists have tied to the state’s 900-fold increase in quakes since 2008.",1582390222,fifj0sl
3039,Major-Scobie,"I don’t like any of those things, either.

(Disclaimer: I am an unadventurous eater.)",1582393647,fifvjqo
3040,Reeb99,"That says *including* fracking, not *mostly from* fracking. It is well known that some normal oil wells produce A LOT of wastewater.

From the USGS:

&gt;**Fact 1: Fracking is not directly causing most of the induced earthquakes. Disposal of waste fluids that are a byproduct of oil production is the primary cause of the recent increase in earthquakes in the central United States.**

&gt;Wastewater disposal wells typically operate for longer durations and inject much more fluid than hydraulic fracturing, making them more likely to induce earthquakes. In Oklahoma, which has the most induced earthquakes in US, only 1-2% of the earthquakes can be linked to hydraulic fracturing operations. The remaining earthquakes are induced by wastewater disposal.

and then two down from that:

&gt;**Fact 3: Wastewater is produced at all oil wells, not just hydraulic fracturing sites.**

&gt;Most wastewater currently disposed of across the nation is generated and produced in the process of oil and gas extraction. As discussed above, saltwater is produced as a byproduct during the extraction process. This wastewater is found at nearly every oil and gas extraction well.

&gt;The other main constituent of wastewater is leftover hydraulic fracturing fluid. Once hydraulic fracturing is completed, drilling engineers extract the fluids that are remaining in the well. Some of this recovered hydraulic fracturing fluid is used in subsequent fracking operations, while some of it is disposed of in deep wells.

&gt;**Fact 4: The content of the wastewater injected in disposal wells is highly variable.**

&gt;In many locations, wastewater has little or nothing to do with hydraulic fracturing. In Oklahoma, less than 10% of the water injected into wastewater disposal wells is used hydraulic fracturing fluid. Most of the wastewater in Oklahoma is saltwater that comes up along with oil during the extraction process.

&gt;In contrast, the fluid disposed of near earthquake sequences that occurred in Youngstown, Ohio, and Guy, Arkansas, consisted largely of spent hydraulic fracturing fluid.

https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/induced-earthquakes?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con

Now, as you can imagine, Kansas sits on top of much of the same formations that Oklahoma does. Wastewater injection has been around a long time, but the increase in oil production the last 10-20 years means there's more wastewater byproduct to dispose of. So they increase injection rates, and we get more earthquakes. It's all well documented. The rates of earthquakes inducted are going down though, *because of more oversight*.

Now the aquifer contamination cases in other states, ***that's*** fracking related. AFAIK, there has never been an incidence of that happening in Kansas. Fracking isn't necessarily bad, it's when it isn't properly regulated that you have problems.",1582394050,fifx6lz
3041,cyberphlash,"I think we're saying the same thing here, and there was an increase in earthquakes in [Southern Kansas](https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article95006477.html) as well as Oklahoma. It appears KS has done a better job responding to it.

&gt;Earthquakes began occurring more frequently in southern Kansas and Oklahoma in 2013 after an increase of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in which high-pressure liquid is used to fracture subsurface rock to free trapped pockets of oil and gas.",1582394298,fifxyq5

It's likely those earthquakes in central Kansas and Oklahoma would have happened even without fracking, because of increased oil production leading to more wastewater to be disposed of.

Hell, when I was a kid, we lived in SE Kansas and had an old natural gas well sitting on our property. My parents tried to get it working so that we could use it, but it kept filling up with water and kept having to be purged. In the end, they capped the well and went to propane because managing the water just wasn't worth it. This was all before fracking ever became a thing.

For example they come back at Kearney county hospital had a lot to do with the hospital specializing in catering services to Target minority groups and now they have a lot of clientele from surrounding counties. Scott City turned the situation around by bringing more doctors to the community to provide more services.

Liberal, Hays, Salina, and Garden City modernized their facilities while Dodge City did not so that’s gonna be another situation to watch in the future to see whether or not Dodge city finally builds I will give him a treatment center, or will continue to have an ER and a bunch of clinics scattered around the north side of town.

&gt;“Suicidologists have indicated that a combination of factors have increased the risk of suicide,” said Andy Brown, commissioner of behavioral health services with Kansas Department of Aging and Disability Services. They include, he said, “growing isolation among Americans, greater economic pressures, and increases in untreated mental illness.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Brown said access to firearms and opioids adds to the chances of suicide.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Suicide risk is highest when people feel like they are a burden on others, feel outcast or isolated from others, and have ready access to lethal means,” he said.

There's another sentence referencing ""lethal means"" being more successful and contributing to the overall rate, which makes sense.

Obviously not all mountain lions act like this, just a small few. And grabbing a shotgun to deal with a mountain lion is a normal thing to do out here where I live, because we'd rather just shoot it and dump the body than lose farm animals and pets, this isn't a big city, this is a rural town in kansas filled with rednecks who don't care about laws, and a lack of law enforcement. And to say a mountain lion wouldn't go for a human could endanger not only you but anyone who listens to you, the way my family learned there were mountain lions in ks was because one was shot while it was mauling a family friends horse. The body was shown to many people in my town, including me, after that the game warden was called and his response was ""there are no mountain lions in Kansas"" to which the family friend said ""I have its body in the bed of my truck"" the game warden said that shooting a mountain lion is illegal so the family friend just dumped the body near the edge of a river that runs alongside the town, this happened back in 2005. So if you think a mountain lion would go after an adult male thoroughbred horse but not a human then you aren't the sharpest tool in the shed. Now yet again, this isn't every mountain lion, I don't believe they are all like this, but my friends all share the second story with me and no longer hike that trail either. You can believe what you want but don't try to claim my mental trauma is fake, or that shooting a dangerous animal is unjust to do because it hasn't killed anyone YET. The people in my town don't care about the laws on this, the nearest police or sheriff station is 20 minutes away and the game warden is even further. Meanwhile 2 blocks to my west is a ranch that has been reporting missing goats for the past 2 months and 3 blocks south is the elementary school. Now of course you're probably thinking ""wow, you'd shoot a gun in the middle of town with houses and children that close by?"" The answer is yes, there are thick woodlands between my property and the school, and there is a small field and junkyard/wooded area between my property and the ranch. It would be physically impossible for the pellets from a shotgun to leave those sides of my land unless I was aiming into the air. And there's no danger of shooting my other neighbors as they are on the opposite side of my house, where I would never use or aim a firearm. Unless you have personal experience with mountain lions and not just studies then please keep your opinion to yourself. Also... wikipedia as a source? The majority of mountain lion related deaths can't be confirmed due to lack of evidence, as it is with the majority of deaths that didn't have a witness or outright obvious evidence. Sure those deaths could be anything, but that means they could be from mountain lions, bears, coyotes, wolves, or more recently coywolves. The deaths could also be from humans but I don't want to get into my experiences with people on this post as that would be ""extremely hard to believe"". Another major thing I just realized you said, ""humans pose a far greater threat to them than deer"".... have you ever seen an adult male buck? They're large and actually have a built in means of defense, unlike humans. It's not like a mountain lion understands what a gun is but they sure as hell understand that antlers and hooves can kill them, sure the antlers aren't there year round but just hooves alone can cause fatal damage. I get it, not everyone agrees with me or the people in my town, but we'd rather not risk losing money or children, instead we deal with animals that start to become a problem.

There's something liberals misunderstand about Trump. The reason why he got elected is not about right or left, it's about being against the establishment. People are tired of neoliberalism, everything sucks. Politicians are corrupt, and they only serve the ruling class. People vote for Trump because they want to see the world burn. They want someone who goes against the establishment someone who pisses off everyone else, and it's working. Trump, intentionally or accidentally, marketed himself as this candidate, and even though he is just as corrupt as everyone else, with stupid ideas on top, he still pisses liberals off, and that's all they care about. The more you complain about Trump, ready to compromise anything to stop him, the happier they are about their vote.    
Bernie is also going against the establishment, but he has been fighting for the common man for decades, and offers meaningful policies, not compromises. He has the same appeal as Trump, but better policies. People are not going to vote for another candidate who is going to compromise and do nothing.

The Overton window is the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time.  It is also known as the window of discourse. The term is named after Joseph P. Overton, who stated that an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within this range, rather than on politicians' individual preferences. According to Overton, the window frames the range of policies that a politician can recommend without appearing too extreme to gain or keep public office given the climate of public opinion at that time.

I can't stess this enough.

I have an archaeology background so I'm really against amateurs taking artifacts and fossils in general for a lot of reasons (but especially artifacts).


For one thing, when fossils or things are taken from the ground, it loses provenance and context. Archaeology builds on the stuff surrounding artifacts, not just the thing itself. When taken out of a site or even just moved, it loses that stuff. Picking up a fossil and moving it even six inches can shift it millions of years from it's origin. That's an extreme example, but one to show how quickly things can change.

I'm not against rock hunting in general or even fossil gathering for small stuff, but if everyone took something, entire areas would be ruined and cleaned out in a matter of years.

This is why it’s so flat: the limestone layers formed from stuff falling out of the water column and settling on the bottom, then getting buried by more stuff and turned into limestone. There are many more wide flat layers beneath ground level, and many more that used to be above present-day ground level that have since eroded away after the oceans receded.

So what’s this hill? It’s a sandbank from an ancient riverbed that flowed through one of those now-eroded layers. It’s been turned into sandstone, which is much more resistant to erosion than the limestone surrounding it.",1583177851,fjap2f2

3568,cyberphlash,"&gt;What's the ""valid"" reason to refuse an abortion to save the life of the mother? Or the ""valid"" reason to make a woman carry a rapist's baby to term? 

You seem to be putting words in my mouth, but as I said in my other comment, if you're talking about *outlier* cases for why women have abortions - such as rape / incest / life-endangering health risks - then yes, these are clear examples of when abortions should be allowed that *most people* already agree on.

However, these are not how the vast majority of abortions occur - most are in early pregnancy at the choice of the mother, and that's what the real fight is over.  As I said, *most people* don't like abortion, and almost nobody thinks women should be allowed to choose abortions *for any reason right up until the baby is born*. Do you think they should in all cases?

So the debate here isn't just about whether abortion should exist or not - it's about (1) the general limitations on when they should be allowed - for instance, during what months of pregnancy, and (2) what exceptions to those general limits like rape/incest/health should allow abortions at any time during pregnancy. 

&gt;Are you considering personally held superstitions to be ""valid"" justifications, which opens the door to any nonsense at all justifying literally any stance on any topic? Because the are no fact-based, real world reasons for either of these things.

I'm an atheist, and pro-choice, so you don't need to accuse me of using religion to justify being a pro-lifer.

By all numbers and statistics, the number of people who are uninsured has roughly halved in the last decade, although recently that number has increased slightly. I think that would potentially be a good argument for why there’s not a healthcare crisis. People have increased access to healthcare across the board thanks to ACA.

On the other side, one of the outcomes of ACA was a ballooning of healthcare costs. Obscurity, hospital overhead and margin limits has led to the practice of increasing the size of costs —&gt; bigger pie = bigger profit. This is an entirely different discussion, also worth exploring, but it is the current state of healthcare. Because of the swelling in prices, this means people who are unemployed (most of which are frictionally unemployed) or are working in jobs that do not offer subsidized insurance are going to be extremely exposed to this swelling of costs. The people who are most hurt are going to be the structurally unemployed and low wage hourly workers who can’t afford insurance on exchange. These also tend to be the low educated and already low income people so it is society’s most vulnerable who have been hurt the most. There’s an argument being made by both the left and right that the whole system needs to be improved, and it seems like the right think expansion is linked to the swelling of prices and that increasing efficiency would also lead to greater coverage.  

But in a lot of ways I agree with you and some of the other comments. This is money that has already been taxed and taken out of our paychecks. Why should it be going to people outside of our state? But I would also say expansion for the sake of expansion is not inherently good either.",1583901021,fk6fvu6

That said, while you seem to clearly acknowledge the issue and how it affects people, there's still no clear direction about how to tackle the problem.  Your long middle paragraph does a good job of explaining how this is a problem.  But you stop short of any sort of recommendation.

So why is that?  It's clear you're hesitant to support expanding Medicaid.  I can understand why you might not like something that runs counter to your ideology or to your instincts as to how you feel we should deal with this.

So what are we to do, then?  What would *you personally* support as a political solution to this problem?  Because it seems - *to me, and to many many other people* - that this is a crisis and demands some sort of legislative solution.  The free market is doing a pretty poor job of sorting this out.  It is my opinion that we've tried that enough and we need to go in a new direction.  I support expanding of Medicaid as a *first step* to addressing this problem (I want to be very clear that I see that as a *first* step).

A lot of people advocate for things like M4A, but if that's too much for people I am fine with incremental change (see above).

What I'm *not* okay with is people complaining Medicaid expansion won't work and not offering any meaningful alternative.",1583933205,fk7c4ow

&gt;Decisions about school dismissal or cancellation of school events should be made in coordination with your local health officials. Colleges and universities are not expected to make decisions about dismissal and event cancellation in isolation. Dismissal and event cancellation decisions should be considered on a case-by-case basis using information from health officials about the local conditions.

&gt;KDHE is working with the health department in Butlter County where the man lived and CDC to identify and contact people who may have come into contact with him. Officials said they will monitor those who may have been in contact with the man for fever and respiratory symptoms. The patient is in isolation, but officials would not release any further information.

4242,cyberphlash,"Hey /u/Vio_ - I was thinking about this earlier today and have a couple suggestions.

COVID is obviously going to continue escalating for a long time - 1-2 months or longer - *so we should think longer term* now, consider the informational and support needs people will have over that time,  and *set up structure of top sticky posts* around solving it. Here's some ideas for posts:

First, the public will need solid info and instructions for various forms of (medical, supply, temp work, etc) assistance. This can be a place they get it - not just regular Reddit users - but anyone could be directed here (this is how we can add more value). I think one of the best things we could do quickly is sticky one or more posts at the top for important localized guidance - posts telling you official city government info on 'where to go', 'what to get', 'how to get' things locally in the metro for critical items like medical assistance or other government support.

Second, I think the Costco / TP posts demonstrate there will be potentially large shortages of critical supplies as people get more scared and shut in. In that event, we should have posts where people can get location-specific help finding key items, or get donations from others. (*All you wide ass folks can start by donating some of your hoarded TP!* :)

Third, people who are out of work, shut in, have little kids, etc - *will have needs* for food / shelter / assistance.  We probably need some forum where people can request help and get it - post specific needs in specific locations, whether as an individual person/family, or for a group and be *directed to public or private agency resources* by others. I don't think we should allow it to turn into a bunch of people begging for assistance *directly from* /r/kc users, but am also not opposed to /r/kc people directly help people in immediate need.

A fourth one is probably a specific post on getting medical assistance. These are just a couple topic area ideas that are important - I'm sure there's more.  (This whole thing could also be set up as a COVID-dedicated KC sub like /r/kcCOVID or something)

The challenge with using sticky posts is that the info gets stale or incorrect over time, and the longer it sticks, it's harder to find new info - so something would need to be done about that - maybe a new post each week like ""WO 3/13/20 - Medical Assistance Sticky"" - something like that?

I think what's coming is the type of crisis most people haven't ever seen.  /r/kc can be what it always has - a place for people to share random/current info - but I think if we want to elevate it to something more, like a reliably useful resource that the wider area of KC Metro could count on, then we'll probably need to put more thought, work, and commitment into it.",1584131087,fkfbx3l

**What do I need to know about this virus?**

* The virus is thought to be able to be easily transmitted through the air and live on surfaces for several days.
* The virus can be asymptomatic in some people (~80%) for between 5-14 days. That means you may have it and not know it. *During that time the virus is still contagious and able to be transmitted to others. You may recover never knowing you had the virus.*
* The virus prominently kills older people, ages 50+. There is thought to be an **8%** mortality rate in people 70 and older, and a **15%** mortality rate in people ages 80 and older.
* The virus prominently kills people of any age with lower or compromised immune systems, heart conditions, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cancer.
* The virus can also kill people of any age with no known preexisting conditions.

**I heard this is just like the seasonal flu, though.**

No. There a few critical differences you need to be aware of.

* Asymptomatic transmission is the most important of these differences. You can transmit this virus long before you realize you have it. You may even stay asymptomatic, or have very mild symptoms for the full course. This is one reason for the curfews and cancellations worldwide. *Please be aware that you can spread the virus unknowingly, and end up infecting people.*
* The mortality rate is much higher for the coronavirus vs. seasonal influenza.
* There is no vaccine for the coronavirus, unlike influenza. There won't be one for at least a year and a half.

This virus is actually more like the Spanish flu of 1918. That killed 50 million people.

**I thought there was a 98% survival rate.**

The mortality rate per area ranges from 2%-6%, but that's because younger age groups have a small chance of dying. Mortality rates in ages 50 and higher skew much higher. See this graph for a better understanding:

[COVID-19 Mortality Rate By Age](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/20860.jpeg)

**What can I do? Do I need to change my behavior now?**

Yes, please. Now. This means you and everyone you know. Most important is to limit going out into public areas if possible. Wash your hands often. Avoid touching your face. Consider the vulnerable people in your lives. Moms, dads, grandparents, aunts and uncles.

**If I'm going to get it anyway, isn't it better to get it over with?**

No. It is better to delay infection as long as possible, so not to overwhelm hospitals (like in Italy). Millions in the US will likely contract the virus, it might be inevitable. BUT, if hospitals are better able to treat people, then more will survive this pandemic.

[This is the most important graph in the world right now.](https://gab.com/system/media_attachments/files/040/806/229/original/76516924f97f3f33.jpg?1584017917)

**Should I cancel my trip? What about my weekly get-together with friends? The movies? Church? All-you-can-eat buffets?**

For the next few weeks (possibly months), definitely reconsider anything that takes you out of the house and into a public area. If you are exposed, you risk spreading the virus unknowingly for days, and then those people exposed can spread it unknowingly for days. *By exposing people unnecessarily, you will kill people.*

**Should I go to work? School?**

This answer will be different for everyone. Where possible, please work with your supervisors and peers to develop plans to best limit transmission between people.

**Should I stock up?**

[Possibly. A bit?](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/many-americans-will-be-exposed-to-coronavirus-through-2021-cdc-says.html) Some are panic-shopping, worried about price-gouging and shortages, but it's too early to know if this will happen on a wide scale.

**If I get the virus, will I recover?**

Healthy people have a good chance of recovering, but right now please just focus on not getting it or spreading it. Again, you want to severely limit the amount of time spent in public and focus on good hygiene and personal distance.

**Should I get tested?**

Only if you have the symptoms: fever, coughing, shortness of breath. Call your doctor or ER before you go, though. They may prefer for you to stay home instead. More info on 'what to do' will emerge as the days pass.

WHO is saying folks may be asymptomatic and infectious for 4-6 days before symptoms start, and most businesses and schools (that weren't already on spring break) did not start self isolating procedures until yesterday or today, if those have even been started. 

Yes, self isolating will still help prevent further spread.

4249,MzOpinion8d,"I think a sticky about what items people really do need to have in their homes would be helpful. For example, I’ve seen Tylenol (acetaminophen) frequently recommended by people who say medical professionals had said that when they went to be seen or spoke with them on the phone.

A thermometer is important since a fever is part of the illness.

Do we know yet about things like nasal sprays and cough syrups being useful? 

A list of the basics people should have around in case local supermarkets run low...how much they should reasonably have (canned goods, paper goods, medications, etc.) 

How worried should we be about public services going out? Water, electricity, gas? I haven’t been buying any bottled water, but any reusable containers I’ve had (like milk jugs), I’m washing them out and filling them with tap water. My kids have been on a Gatorade kick so we have quite a few of the individual bottles, maybe 12 oz size, and we’re doing the same with them. I figure it’s good to have at least a small supply of clean water, plus it’s about to be tornado season and they always recommend storing water in case of a tornado, so we’re killing two birds with one stone. I’m hoping we won’t need it but just thinking if something went wrong at the water treatment plant due to understaffing, it would be the most important thing for us to have. 

I think a caution about using Tylenol should be mentioned as well...the max is 4000 mg per day for an adult, and overdosing can be fatal and it’s not a quick fatal, it’s an agonizingly slow fatal and people suffer. We need to make sure people understand that taking more isn’t better. Also making sure people understand there are two types of Tylenol (regular strength and extra strength) and that it is often contained in many cold medicines, so they need to be aware of how much they’re taking from all sources to avoid overdose.",1584134926,fkfi5t0

It appears that rising costs and lower revenues due to regulatory and payor constraints make management a mine field of limited decisions.

4263,Mrjustkidding,"People downvote, but it’s a valid point. The entire idea behind price gouging is allocation of resources. If a supplier can make $40 for a pack of toilet paper, they’re going to ship to where they can do so, which means more resources for those areas.

In addition to this, a $40 pack of toilet paper will make hoarders think twice before buying 5-10 packs of Costco TP, which means that resources are used more responsibly as everyone only takes what they need, rather than stockpiling items.

I know toilet paper is an absurd thing to count as a resource, but I think it’s a valid point given the current situation. You can also argue that a lot of people can’t afford elevated prices, which is true - but the way to make the price come back down is to not panic-buy paper products like you plan to be shitting yourself 24/7 for the next 6 months.",1584160347,fkghztn
4264,Vlad_Yemerashev,"&gt; How worried should we be about public services going out?

Not very, though it doesn't hurt to have some extra water just in case. Repairs on things like broken water mains, etc., could take longer than normal with lower amounts of staffing that could arise due to Coronavirus. Same goes for power, especially as we head into tornado season.

Generally speaking, I would imagine utilities should stay on, but repairs may take longer than normal. Wuhan, China and other places that have experienced more severe outbreaks of Coronavirus have not had issues with water or power.",1584162658,fkgkfsd

4413,LewisPaulBremer,"At a Scout meeting in south Overland  Park, the girls are flourishing in their faith and sisterhood. Together,  they are strong. And it’s deeper than selling cookies.

Zainab Attar, 9, almost whispers to me about not wearing her hijab to her public school.

“I like my hijab,” she tells me. “But one time when I wore my hijab to school people made fun of it.”

So she wears it to the mosque and when  she prays, but very rarely in public. When I ask her what the kids at  school said, she shuts down. She says she doesn’t remember, her eyes,  big and brown and hurt with the memory she won’t share.

But things are getting better, thanks to Girl Scouts.

“I didn’t really have that much  confidence in myself before. When I joined Girl Scouts I was really shy.  I am also really shy right now,” she tells me. “But I talk more than I  did before, here and in school. And I have more patience. Patience is  important.”

Heba Aziz, 10, is the only Muslim girl  in her school. There’s no outright hate, but there is confusion and  sometimes fascination, she says. But at her Scout meetings?

“They just understand me,” she says.

For troop leader Saima Imtiaz, that’s  the point. She started the Overland Park troop after years of taking her  oldest daughter over to a Muslim troop in Olathe. When her younger  daughter, Syeda Khadijah, was old enough to join, Saima realized the  Muslim community had grown enough to fill another troop. Now she has 15  girls. They just conquered their first camping trip and sleepover.

It’s not about segregating, she says.  Muslim girls join integrated troops all over the country. But a Muslim  troop, she says, strengthens the girls so they can teach others about  themselves and learn about others as well.

“We share the same values as all Girl  Scouts troops,” Saima says. “But this is good for them, because they all  know what the other one is going through, and if they have a problem we  can work together to resolve things. They are gaining so much  confidence.”",1584409256,fkpfzmm

\-Flint Hills Discovery Center, great for kids but I personally find it a bit overpriced 

\-aggieville itself, there's some great restaurants and shops, as well as a ceramics painting place (however if you're only visiting for a few days then you might not want to do that, as they need to fire the ceramics). Some of my favorite places in Aggieville are: Taco Lucha, So Long Saloon, the Hi-Lo, ACME gifts, Gordos, the Dusty Bookshelf (recently remodeled due to a fire that occurred while they were remodeling, and is back and better than ever), Rock-A-Belly Deli, Varsity Donuts (they have a good selection of board games to play while there, and they also have a late night truck out behind that serves up some fresh made food from 9pm-2:30am, they often have movies on a projection screen to watch while you enjoy a mac'n'cheese grilled cheese), and Auntie Mae's. There's also Yard Bar if you're into yard games like corn hole and bocce ball.

\-Poyntz also has some great restaurants and shops, as well as an axe throwing place, if you're into that! Some of my favorite places on Poyntz: Finns (they have some arcade games, if you like that!), AJs Pizzeria, the Chef, El Patron, Tallgrass Taphouse, and Bourbon and Baker.

\-For outdoor activities, there's City Park, Cico Park, the Linear Trail (great for riding bikes, there are green apple bikes available around town to rent for free), the Konza Prairie Trails (no dogs or bikes allowed, but there are essentially three trails to choose from that are varying lengths, the longest being a little over 6 miles and the shortest is almost 3 miles, all with beautiful views)

\-Brunch options: Little Apple Brewery has a brunch now and I've heard nothing but good things, there's also the Chef (which I mentioned earlier, but be warned, it can get very crowded and the wait can be long if you're going at a usual brunch time), and Bluestem Bistro has a location near the stadium that does a great brunch as well. 

\-There are also a couple of different paint and drink type businesses that could have a class available at the time you would be here, two of them are Uncorked Inspiration and Board and Brush (they do wooden signs, which I think is neat but I haven't gotten a chance to check them out yet!)

I might be missing a few things, but most of the activities in Manhattan are, as other people said, drinking and eating out. That doesn't have to be a bad thing!

Kids whose parents did not work ""essential' jobs would have to keep their kids home with them.  People would have to really think hard about what is really ""essential"".  Its an imperfect solution, but this is turning into a situation with no good choices, only less bad ones.

We've also got staff that are terrified of losing their jobs or not getting paid.  We can only keep paying them if we keep generating revenue, which means either staying open or asking parents to continue paying tuition through a closure.

&amp;#x200B;

AFTER you've had some down time. What you want to do is make a list of things that have to be done, things that can be put off later, and things that might be helpful for the future business and home life. 

Instead of going door to door, call them up and better explain the situation. Ask if texting or email would work for them if they're hard of hearing (btw, texting has become a godsend for a lot of older people I know who have lost severe damage). Tell them that you'll get back to them during set time frames (so that way you're not getting/answering texts at 2 AM) and have them provide you with emergency/non-emergency contacts of their family or even medical people. Reassure them that you're there to help them as an insurance agent and as a support system in your own right. This will not just give you better insurance agent service for your current customer base, but will directly build future clients.  

&amp;#x200B;

Tell them (later when things are cooling off- not during a freak out moment) that you're always looking for more clients and ask them for referrals. Let them help you build new clients from your current list.

&amp;#x200B;

Kids are resilient. They don't need much to keep entertained, so let them have fun on their own terms without ""electricity"" (like phones, video games, tv, etc) during the day. Toys, games, reading, playing outside (away from other kids), biking, old fashioned kid stuff. Go on a household diet of expenses. Take away the electronics for several hours each day.

&amp;#x200B;

This will help cut down on utility expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

For food, there are food pantries in many locations, but I know they're starting to get hit hard. 

Go through your entire pantry and see just how much food you have. Even if it's stuff the kids don't like, start to prepare those foods anyway. If they're hungry, they'll eat it.

5018,saztak,"Closing for the rest of the year is pretty extreme. Although I personally assume a lot of places will end up doing so (remember, many places closed for 2 weeks upwards of a month or so), it is completely fair (and not an 'other' position, aka deserving of being 'you peopled') to disagree or think it's unwarranted. 

I have family in portland, and they closed schools down till the end of April. They're in a far worse situation than Kansas. Places like NYC are closing for two weeks at a time (although it's likely they'll remain closed for a long time). Don't forget that we're smack dab in the middle of a crisis. People saying 'rest of year is too extreme' are not inherently wrong for thinking that. they may be found out to be right, or they may be found out to be wrong. There are TONS of different angles to take. There is a balance to be had between preparedness, intervention, and increasing paranoia. Closing schools for that long can and has freaked people out more. Closing schools at ALL can do that, too, but there's a difference in the mind of people when it's 'ok gotta deal with 2 weeks' vs 'gotta deal until next fall....'. There are no perfect solutions in times of crisis. 

I don't think they are ""complaining"", i think they're sharing criticism. To imply that ANY criticism of a decision makes them an ""enemy"", a part of a singular evil group (aka 'you people'), is far less constructive and more damaging than calling a govenor 'out of touch'. 

Especially considering that they're a politician.....all of which are inherently....out of touch.....

I'm attempting to defend rationality. Try to take a step back and reread this string of comments. Try to look at it from a different point of view than the one you jump to. Closing schools may be the right choice and prevent many deaths. But consider what op was really saying. I'll defend an idiot's right to criticize their govt, for damn sure. I don't care how bad a crisis is. Criticism is valuable and helpful; downright necessary to grow and make the best choices.

Can I also point out, we can't measure suffering (which is the implication behind the idea that closing schools is the absolute right thing to do, or that op is an idiot for their criticism). It's entirely possible that closing schools increases suffering while decreasing death totals. I just find it interesting how quick people are to ignore quality of life to avoid death...

strange how quickly people forget about being humane when something scary comes along. 

-someone calls governor 'out of touch' for closing schools for longer than places worse hit with greater risk-   
-gets called an idiot for supposedly ""putting people's lives at risk"" as if the two are 100% synonymous-  
-criticizing the governor is now synonymous with killing people-  
-you're just as bad as the evil criticizer if you point out how irrational we're being by our sweeping over-generalizations and exaggeration-

mob mentality to the nth degree. fascinating but sad to watch. please take a step back and look more carefully at your thought process and belief system. you're letting fear get the best of you, and fear is the mindkiller. fear makes these kinds of situations worse. show some compassion for the people who are suffering from the closures. there are worse fates than death.",1584726379,fl1co1f

&gt;While there are a lot of things we don’t know, one thing that is very apparent is the push-back over the Governor’s abrupt closing of our schools for the rest of the year.  Indeed, that has been the central theme of recent phone calls and emails all of us have received, with most categorizing it as “premature,” “rash,” “extreme,” and an “overreach of power.”  There is questioning that Kansas would be the first state in the nation to do this, even ahead of places like California, Washington, and New York where COVID-19 outbreaks are far more serious.  This created an extended Floor debate over what could be described by many as an overreach of executive authority of our Governor.

The biggest problem right now is that many Kansans (among other Americans) aren't taking seriously the idea that rural Kansas/America (with its near zero hospital beds in many places) is going to turn into Italy within weeks. And if it doesn't, Lynn and others sure as hell aren't going to be *thanking* Kelly for the decisive early leadership she's shown on this.

Lynn and her ilk were wrong on Brownback tax cuts, and on holding up Medicaid expansion, and *so many* other things because their answer for everything is, ""Well how are we gonna pay for that?????*"" - unless, of course, the question is how much taxes can be cut.

Call his boss up and tell him/her point blank that your boyfriend has all of the symptoms of Coronavirus and is currently running a fever and coughing hard. Bare minimum, he has regular flu and shouldn't be around customers and coworkers regardless.

5439,cyberphlash,"I don't really see what the problem is here.

Kelly's order to prevent water/electricity shutoff and evictions is a temporary measure that *enables people to stay in their homes* - which is the primary goal of quarantining people during COVID. It's also a short term economic relief measure.

*What it is not* is some kind of get out of jail free card. If people think they should just stop paying their rent because of COVID, they're grossly mistaken. While it's nice that many companies are helping people out and being flexible, they're not legally obligated to do so beyond these temporary orders, and these company-relief efforts are primarily to help customers *continue to pay their bills later* instead of fully defaulting on them later.

If people want bailouts in the form of government checks to pay their rent and utilities, they better get their asses on the phone calling their state and federal representatives, because real relief is *not* coming from utility and landlord companies. In two or three months when this dies down, people are still going to owe rent and utilities that were deferred - and this letter is a reminder that's coming not just from *this* company, but from *all* companies.

Note: What I'm saying here is not some kind of endorsement of companies taking advantage of customers or being the bad guy later by forcing them to pay deferred bills. They're going to do that regardless. I'm merely pointing out this is a replay of the 2008 financial meltdown where it was *consumers* who ended up getting screwed with foreclosure, unemployment, accumulated debt, etc. Banks *will take your house* if you don't pay.  Apparently not enough people cared about that to elect politicians who would fix this broken system, or help them out in a crisis, so it is what it is.

My frustration is just that these guidelines seem pretty toothless, and I don't expect that people will be taking them as seriously as the situation seems to demand.  

My sense is that a lot of 'borderline essential' business owners are sitting on their hands and waiting to be forced to adjust their operations to allow for employees to wfh or practice \*actual, appropriate\* social distancing.  Particularly those outlined in sections 1/E/viii and xxi.  I'm curious to see whether and how section 2's guidelines for businesses to encourage social distancing are going to be communicated or enforced.  In my case, my company's policy up until this point has been to discourage the use of masks or gloves by cashiers (as these measures have *questionable* efficacy when not used 100% properly, though they would make a lot of us \*feel\* safer).

And then, there's just those among us who think it's all a joke, won't be convinced of the gravity of the situation, and are just going to somehow stumble through this whole situation unscathed.  those people are *assholes*.  And they abound.

Saying that they ""interpret the law"" is elementary and incomplete. Legal opinions are rationale based in law, not personal beliefs. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_opinion",1585166387,flho8vb
5587,WikiTextBot,"**Legal opinion**

In law, a legal opinion is in certain jurisdictions a written explanation by a judge or group of judges that accompanies an order or ruling in a case, laying out the rationale and legal principles for the ruling.

Opinions are in those jurisdictions usually published at the direction of the court, and to the extent, they contain pronouncements about what the law is and how it should be interpreted, they reinforce, change, establish, or overturn legal precedent. If a court decides that an opinion should be published, the opinion may be included in a volume from a series of books called law reports (or reporters in the United States). Published opinions of courts are also collectively referred to as case law, and constitute in the common law legal systems one of the major sources of law.

It is absolutely possible and expected for a judge to make their decisions within the legal framework without letting their personal opinions and bias get in the way.

Our entire world, all of our knowledge. All of our sciences, math, everything. The collective knowledge of humanity is based on our best approximations, so if you are trying to apply an absolutely definition for nearly anything, it will almost always be wrong.

Test results are taking anywhere from 3-7+ days to return in some places. That confirmed cases number may be a week behind.

Saying ""Spanish flu"" may be indicative of racist ideology, but more often it is not. When another tries to control the ability of individual communiication by imposition of pointless verbal constructs claiming they are indicative of particular ideology, they are attempting to control thought itself, regardless of individual understanding. The United States largely exists to enforce the liberty of the individual, over the collective. 

It's a tough order. Our rights are constantly stripped away, and regained (somewhat). Individuals have an education level and an understanding of everything that is vastly different than their fellow countrymen. This is important to understand; it has brought the US to an exemplary position in recorded human history. 

Without the freedom of speech (and the freedom of thought it implies, if not creates) we would not now live in a society capable of such excellence, and decadence. 

Of course, the map is not the territory. To so simply discount the intellect as ""racist"" is to deny the creative potential of the individual. Thomas Edison was a prick, but he was still Edison. Tesla was an eccentric, but the devices you use hourly you must thank him for. Ford was a ""racist"", but you see his name daily on every other car on the road. Bobby Fischer was ""anti- semitic"", but you can't beat him on a chessboard. The map isn't the territory.

He admonished the American people for such behaviour as well (and rightly so). I believe it was during the press announcements regarding the covid19 task force on Thursday last week. 

The point he was attempting to make by calling it a ""Chinese Virus"" (I believe) was that it originated in China, the important metrics were not immediately disclosed by China, and all the politically correct bullshit surrounding the paramount issue of life/death in our time was just more of the same. Journalists attack him for everything. It only serves to polarize (some say Balkanize, for good reason) our people.

I don't think we have a hate filled leader in our executive branch of government.

They've consistently elected the hardline GOP leaders who've shorted education funding for 20 years, refused to expand Medicaid (which is now the only thing that would keep many rural hospitals open), shorted on benefits for low income people (which these counties are full of), wasted money on tax cuts for the Kochs that could've been progressively spent bolstering the rural economy, etc.

Here’s a timeline of Trump’s statements about COVID-19:


January 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

February 28: “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that, right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa.” “They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.”

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: “Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

Edit: March 9: ""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant.”

March 10: ""It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.""

March 13: National Emergency Declaration

March 13: “I don't take responsibility at all”

March 15: ""TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!""

March 16: ""I give myself a 10 out of 10""

March 16: “I’ve always known this is a, this is a real, this is a pandemic, I’ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic”

None. Race is a not a biological thing. It's a social construct.

And before you start tripping over your own tongue with ""bu-bu-buts,"" I'm going to stop you right there and tell you that I have a master's degree in physical anthropology. You are NOT going to win the ""definition of race"" fight.


To read more on information on ""Race as a social construct,"" please review the American Anthropological Association's [Statement on Race](https://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2583). This will help you understand the context of the history and societal development of race as a social construct.


As for ""tribes"" in China. China is a nation state with multiple ethnic and religious groups. And before its current communist government, China has had one of the longest spanning empires in history.

Are/were there tribes in China? Probably? It's irrelevant. Wuhan, the known point of origin for the disease, has a population of 11 million people. It's not ""tribal"" on any level.


Disease naming systems have historically been used to ""other"" and insult other groups/nations by using xenophobic terms. 

Syphilis alone had completely different origin names based on which country hated which other country:

""syphilis had been called the ""French disease"" (Italian: mal francese) in Italy, Malta,[27] Poland and Germany, and the ""Italian disease"" in France. In addition, the Dutch called it the ""Spanish disease"", the Russians called it the ""Polish disease"", and the Turks called it the ""Christian disease"" or ""Frank (Western European) disease"" (frengi). These ""national"" names were generally reflective of contemporary political spite between nations and frequently served as a sort of propaganda; the Protestant Dutch, for example, fought and eventually won a war of independence against their Spanish Habsburg rulers who were Catholic, so referring to Syphilis as the ""Spanish"" disease reinforced a politically useful perception that the Spanish were immoral or unworthy. However, the attributions are also suggestive of possible routes of the spread of the infection, at least as perceived by ""recipient"" populations. The inherent xenophobia of the terms also stemmed from the disease's particular epidemiology, often being spread by foreign sailors and soldiers during their frequent sexual contact with local prostitutes.[28][failed verification]""

Thanks for the link to your AAA paper. I guess since race doesn't exist according to whoever ""educated"" you, it seems pretty silly to argue about ""racist"" statements made by the media, and then by Trump. Especially in light of the events that have befallen the ""human race"" since that eventful day in China.

People are losing their lives, and their loved ones. My own (I guess not multi-racial, according to the AAA) family is experiencing great misfortune due to this virus. Trump is in charge of my nation's federal response, like it or not. People want to argue silly PC BS rather than focus on that which is killing us.

Better to score political points than to rally together as a nation and resolve this deadly issue, is it? Do you get a heart with that master's degree? 

Did you, perchance learn what a ""double standard"" was while you were getting your coveted degree?

Did they teach you dialectic? Rhetoric? Inference?

If so, then you should be well aware of exactly what Trump was saying when he insisted on naming the virus as he did. To pursue this cheap ""racist"" argument in light of events makes you uninformed at best, disingenuous at worst. It is wilfully misleading- a common artifact of PC culture.

  My husband I moved from large cities to a small town of 400 people  and we started a family here. it was incredibly hard to start over in a town so small and I didn't know anyone. you guys will have a leg up because you should be immediately integrated into your wifes familys friends which is a great head start. I highly recommend getting your wife into a  community club/organization. it will help her make friends and other relationships . I had a very hard time getting used to a small town. weve now been here about 4 years and im very happy now with our decision but I did cry a lot at the beginning.  people can be pretty stand off ish until they get to know you.



on a side note. Hunting and fishing are big in small towns. we usually have turkey/pheasant hunts for kids. Kid fishing tournaments where volunteers use their boat and let families fish. Our community club organizes other kid activities and town celebrations. but depending on how large of a city your from be prepare to be bored and be prepared to drive a lot further distances for goods. Our closest big saving store (Walmart/sams) is about an hour and half away. although we do have a small grocery store close by it can be more expensive.

However, I think that is more my personality type and what my hobbies/interests are. I enjoy being outside in the woods and mountains, neither of which are found in Kansas. I am a very outdoor's oriented person and this state offers very little in that regard. There are state parks located throughout the state, but they aren't free, have very little hiking, and offer little to no off grid/backwoods camping. 

The economy here is also pretty slow, real estate is either super cheap (and it shows) or super expensive. But it all takes forever to sell, there are houses for sale in my neighborhood that have been on the market since before I moved here.. I also don't see the low cost of living here, yes rent is decently cheap but everything else is more. We pay anywhere from the same to 100% more for groceries depending on what we are buying. Taxes are almost 50% higher than what we moved from and the quality of life does **not** reflect that. 

As for things I do like, well there is very little traffic even during rush hour. Our town is big enough to where it offers everything you need but is still small enough to where you don't feel cluttered or trapped. Just wish there was more emphasis on local businesses (beyond bars). My rent is decently cheap, I pay the same amount I did from where I moved for an apartment that is 30% larger and much much nicer. Since the university is here, the public schools are pretty decent from what I understand. And if you like to drink/bar hop well there is plenty of that. 

If you move here, are you sure you can find a job in your field making enough to support a SAHM with three kids? Do you like the cold? The winter is cold here, and the wind is brutal.

If you do not perform an essential function, you cannot leave your home to go to work. If you are able to work from home, you are allowed and encouraged to do so.""

The farmers/ranchers do controlled burns to reinvigorate the soil and burn down trees for the taller native grasses (truth, the tall grass prairie absorbs more CO2 per plant than a tree and the roots are deep), and trees end up killing the grass. We think (South Central Kansas) there are Eastern red cedars popping up everywhere and possibly are an invasive species. We lost a lot of trees due to drought and disease locally. We haven't planted enough to catch up to where we were a decade ago.

There's a park a few hours away which is amazing. There's some native American history there, it's in the smokey hills. Natural juniper trees everywhere, not huge trees but the area is gorgeous.

6247,Sophisticatedly,"I recommend coming up here for a visit and try all of the areas. Kansas is a rather large state and the climate is very different compared to where you are.

If you check the satellite view during the growing season you'll see some green, some grey/green, and brown. Western Kansas is desert like, semi-arid. There's the flint hills (where the ground is rock beneath a small layer of soil) and there's South Central Kansas. This area is sub-tropical, and I'm not sure about southeast or northeast. I visit KC a lot and it seems like it's more humid and that makes it feel more hot. Tornadic activity is all over. 

There's different agriculture zones here as well.

The other plus side is being located close enough to the center of the US you can go just about anywhere. The Ozarks are pretty cool, mountains in Arkansas are also pretty cool. There's a park in Missouri I'd like to visit, elephant rocks state park. It supposedly has the tallest mountain in Missouri and it is close to st Louis. Always wanted to go there to see the arch.

I drove to Georgia a few years back to visit and it was a gorgeous drive. The trees kept getting denser and taller the further west I went. There aren't forests here per-say but the Wichita city parks are pretty good, tons of trees.

I haven't been all over the state but I'm trying to. I'm part of a storm chasing group and I ended up a ways away from where I've ever been. Dodge City was interesting, I didn't hang out there too long though. Little bit sad that there's a hill on the west of the city and they turned it into a feed lot. There's meat processing there too.

Yoder has good food, I'd check them out.

Dairy farm in Alma makes really good cheese. I drove by it one time on the way to KC right as I almost ran my tank empty. Then I found their cheese at Kroger.

Roads are bad. Like, really bad. Be prepared for messed up road surfaces, it's like they haven't resurfaced rural highways in decades. and don't forget bugs on your windshield.

6334,Sparkie86,"No, you are grasping at straws here, because from your perspective, it is no harm no foul, when right now it is anything but.

If it was a manufacturing place, with employees who still come in and run, then I suppose that it wouldn't be a shut down business, would it? Manufacturing places are also not open to the public due to the dangerous environment that requires safety training and PPE.

I can guarantee you it is a restaurant, as those are the only businesses that ever do a shutdown for this kind of deep cleaning, and the owner is taking advantage of this to get their deep cleaning for the year done and not have to shut down later. A very good portion of them have to shut down periodically to move deep fryers, grills, tables, etc and deal with grease build-up. Especially the ones that aren't stainless with wheeled equipment, which is nearly every family-owned restaurant out there, as that stuff is very expensive.

Other manufacturing facilities do it in sections or while they are running. Never a full shutdown just to clean. Retailers do it as they go. Offices do it as they go.

It can also be mitigated by not requiring people to come in as a group, but spread it out over the shutdown so that one person at a time, two tops, is in the building cleaning.

So ultimately, the point I'm making here is that there is absolutely no scenario for any reason, with any set of assumptions or lack thereof,  you are going to be able to produce, make up, or otherwise that justifies an employer requiring a group of people to come in and do cleaning during this mess while the business is shut down.

6336,Sparkie86,"I certainly do. I happen to work in the construction industry servicing residential, commercial and industrial customers as well as doing new construction in all three of those fields and keeping an eye on several job sites at the moment.

Construction is not having people come in and clean. We are minimizing the different crews at sites, keep separated for our work areas, and keeping the same crews together to avoid spreading infection. Under no circumstances are construction companies having groups of people come in to ""just clean the shop"". We have plenty of work going on where we can practice adequate distancing.

In the service side we are practicing hand-washing procedures as well as tool and hand sanitation, and avoiding touching unnecessary equipment.

Grocery stores and still open and open to the public. So are retail outlets.

OP's post is pretty clear about the fact that they are ""still"" having people come in to clean. I don't know about your reading comprehension, but I can deduce without much effort that the business is not open from that.

I’m not saying it is alright they are doing this. Rather that if they are and the employees are going in that is on the company and it’s staff.

First, there's so many Republicans [like this guy](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/texas-dan-patrick-grandparents-sacrifice-lives-coronavirus-economy) saying, ""Well, if we were only willing to sacrifice *thousands of old people* at the alter of the stock market, we'll all get back to our normal jobs and everything will be fine."" Never mind that huge numbers of younger people will also get sick and die too*, and everyone going back to work only spreads it further and faster, making more people die. We're already seeing this in New York and other places. 

Second, 'personal responsibility' as a narrative doesn't work since all the politicians and others who shamed poor people for 'not doing enough for themselves' are now themselves asking for government handouts for their own workers and companies.  Why does socialism have to come around every 10 or 20 years *to save capitalism from itself*? Why are corporations - who SCOTUS told us *are now the same as people* when it comes to campaign donations - excused from this narrative of responsibility too?

What we all need to do is all sit down in our homesfor about 4-6 more weeks nonstop while shaming everyone around us who isn't doing the same. And we need to look out for each other - in the form of the government now paying people while they wait this out, and in the form of person-to-person action to help each other out if needed.  Then, when we come out of this, we should all take a damn hard look at what people were saying about 'personal responsibility' and talk about how that kind of vulture capitalism *completely* fails America, not just during COVID, but the rest of the time too.  

Wage inequality, not having universal healthcare like *every other* industrialized country, our lack of social benefits - it's all adding up to a shit sandwich 99% of us are eating right now, and it's going to get worse in the coming months. And for what? Is taxing billionaires and mega millionaires and big companies to pay their fair share of our country's social safety net *really* that bad of an idea? Is *tens of millions of Americans* not having health care during a global pandemic a situation we should continue? Is having one of our two political parties devoted to the idea of *completely tearing down and mismanaging government* really that great an idea?  

People don't have to turn into socialists or communists to think about these things and come to the conclusion that a bunch of billionaire oligarchs who clearly don't give a shit about 300,000,000 Americans running this country is no longer a good idea.

That's like saying ""well pro freedom whites are in favor of having POC free, and pro slavery whites are pro slaves.""

Going back to my previous metaphor, it'd be ridiculous for a white person to vote for slavery of POC. Why should a person who isn't affected by slavery, have a say about slavery?

Oh, would you look at that.

&gt;Regardless, ones gender should have no impact on who can or can't say abortion is a moral evil, or who's opinion carries more weight. It should be equal, and to say otherwise is sexist.

Actually to think it is equal is ignorant. Do I think men should have a say? Absolutely. Do I think the people who ACTUALLY go through pregnancy, and in that regard the abortion process, have more of a say? Absolutely. I also think scientists and researchers have more of a say as well.

&gt;Please enlighten me on how someone who advocates for the rights of the unborn on a scientific basis supports abortion. I'm all for science, but I'm definitely not for the intentional killing of an embryo, fetus, or baby... and yes that includes the use of abortifacient contraceptives as well.

Unfortunately any arguments I make you will not accept. I hate to say it that way but based on you calling abortions a moral evil and how you call contraceptives abortifacients is clear there's no way from a logical stand point to talk you out of your viewpoint. Just know that when you ban abortions, ban contraceptives, and do everything in your power to force women to have babies, the more women die due to the following. Abortions are still done, but now instead of in a proper facility and safely, its done at less ideal conditions or even worse at home and sometimes kill the woman as well due to infections or something else. Babies are born into homes where they are unwanted. Babies from rape or incest are now forced upon the mothers. Some of these involve insanely young women and threaten the life of the mother. Last you have pregnancies that threaten the life of the mother and either die or both die where an abortion would at least save the mother.

Do you consider a woman who has a failed pregnancy to have committed accidental manslaughter? I mean you are advocating for rights for the unborn and I assume that means in your eyes if any embryo or fetus that is aborted or failed is a death statistic, correct?

Last, what steps are you taking to advocate for proper care of newborn babies to impoverished families and / or foster children? I mean they already are in this world and are getting neglected.",1585860547,fm92mjx

You're right that no arguments you  make will I accept, because I value human life, even at the expense of suffering, be it of the mother or of the baby.  You can't justify killing someone, because they or others may suffer in the process.

There's a big difference between intentionally killing or neglecting an unborn child to try to cause an abortion, and a child in the womb dying to natural causes... it's the same difference as euthanizing someone, or letting them die naturally.

We dont think that, its a moral question for you to question where do the rights of the ""baby"" start and where does it end for the mother. Also when does ""life"" actually start for the baby. It also creates a huge gray area of what constitues endangering the unborn child?

I'm aware of how contraceptives work, and choose not to use them because of it.  

I have no control over if an embryo forms and subsequently perishes before or after implantation, and I have no explanation why God would or wouldn't allow that.

Life and something actually being a human being are two entirely different things. I can call any multi cell organism life, that doesn't make it a human being. A fertilized egg at that point is merely a very complex set of instructions for CREATING a human baby. So when an embryo or fetus actually is a full blown human being in the mother is actually a very contested fact in science. Most of the abortions laws are based off that science and understand that once a fetus is to a certain point of development there is a very high probability it actually has a functioning brain and consciousness. You wouldn't call someone without a brain alive would you?

&gt; It doesn't matter if they can feel pain, it doesn't matter if they are wanted, because they're human and deserve the same rights that you and I do.

Except they aren't human yet. I am done with this conversation after this post because the foundation of anti-abortion is rooted in moral half truths that stroke the egos of the one who advocate for it.

&gt;I have no control over if an embryo forms and subsequently perishes before or after implantation

You misunderstand what happens here. The embryo forms and doesn't successfully implant in the uterus and subsequently dies.

Except no. This has nothing to do with peoples choices, or bad things happening to good people, this is a fundamental understanding of how life is procreated and in the process of doing so, if you equate a human comes into life the instant fertilization happens, its YOU who are determining that millions of babies are dying every year because they don't successfully attach in the uterus and your god determined this was okay. If you are okay with god having such a shitty fucking design, then so be it, good for you i guess. Overall you are ignoring my moral questions and giving me fed lines and false equivalences.

So a human egg and a human sperm come together, and you're saying that is not human organism?  How do you determine when humanity and human rights begin then?  You mention consciousness, is someone in a coma not human?

&gt; You wouldn't call someone without a brain alive would you? 

You stated already that any multi cell organism can be deemed alive, but this seems to imply that life requires a brain... I don't think that's what you meant.  I think what we're arguing about here is when does a human organism have rights.  I'd say from the moment of conception because they have the potential to develop into a fully functioning human.  With regard to brain activity being lost after a brain has already developed, I suppose the brain could be damaged in an accident or something, and I'd say we should do anything we could to allow the person to continue living.  Obviously if it's determined they are entirely brain dead then sometimes a difficult decision to remove life support may need to be made.  Removing life support and allowing for a natural death is not the same as intentionally killing by some other means though. 

Seems to me like the clearest point as to when human rights begins is at conception.  Any other point is arbitrary or could change based on science, opinion, etc.  That's why the whole 'abortion is fine before viability' argument has never made sense to me, because that means that as science evolves and babies can survive outside of the womb earlier, we'll be deeming humanity and rights earlier.  Humanity shouldn't be a moving target.

&gt; You misunderstand what happens here. The embryo forms and doesn't successfully implant in the uterus and subsequently dies. 

How is that different than what I said?  You seem very quick to try to paint me as not understanding human fertility.  I probably understand how human fertility (and contraceptives) works better than 95% of the people that use them.  It's necessary for my spouse and I to avoid pregnancy for health reasons and we use natural family planning to do so, and if you don't understand how fertility works you won't be very successful at that.  We've been successful at both conceiving and avoiding pregnancy.  I'm completely aware that a sperm can enter an egg and then fail to implant and the woman will still have a period and that life won't progress any further.  I don't really get why you're so hung up on this because it's just part of nature... people die all the time and I didn't know them and thus I'm not aware of it, so how is that any different?  I can't explain why nature is designed to work the way it does any more than I can explain why it anything exists at all.

""Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country."" Messonnier  (CDC) added that Americans should channel their concern about the virus, officially called COVID-19, into preparing for its arrival.  ""We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare for the expectation that this is going to be bad,"" said Messonnier. ""Now is the time for businesses, hospitals, communities, schools and everyday people to begin preparing as well."" 

  
""Part of preparedness is an educated population thinking about the future,"" said Azar.  

""The immediate risk to the general American public remains low, but that has the potential to change quickly,"" he added. Azar said that nearly two months after the first alarms were raised, there's no evidence the virus has spread here beyond patients infected overseas and a few close relatives. 

""We cannot hermetically seal off the United States to a virus and we need to be realistic about that,"" the health chief acknowledged. ""We'll have more cases in the United States, and we've been very transparent about that."" If it happens, ""we'll work to mitigate those.""

Basically it has to do with the fact that energy will flow both ways rather than just one way. Solar installations tend to speed up the need for replacement transformers and other infrastructure improvements in areas where they are installed.

On top of this, the utility controls who ties to the grid, they can simply not approve applications after a certain threshold.

With every utility, if you want to tie to the grid, you need to apply for it, and then they send out a tech to look at it and make sure it’s up to their standard, after that they decide if they want to accept your application and approve the power generation.

On top of this, the utility charges more than they credit to any individual who produces solar power, they are *making* money on grid tied solar.

6663,Getmyboot,"You have to understand big utilities like Evergy. I know lineman who work for them and they preform 90% new construction and 10% maintenance. They have a large territory and that is most of there demand. When they have maintenance projects it usually goes to contractors. With such a large territory they usually wait for a large storm to come through and get fema money to pay for the replacement of all those broken pole and down wire. It's how they pass the buck off and keep there rates cheaper. 

Of course they are making money on grid tied solar. Whatever energy they done use goes back onto the system. Which helps with peak demand. Of course no one can control where it goes on the system. The neighbor next door isn't paying for the extra energy. It can only potentially help lower rates. That will take allot of solar. 

I work for a coop and they are member owned. We also have to limit 5% solar on our system bc of our agreement with power companies. We have bought generators to help decrease the cost of peak demand and keep our rates lower. There is a reason your rates as a customer of westar was cheaper. A coop buys the power from westar and they charge us a higher rate for the same electricity they're selling to there customers. Which causes us to charge a higher rate. My co-op has been upgrading the infastructure every year. Personally last year I help rebuild 13 miles of line. We also higher contractors for the really shitty jobs. My co-op cares about the members and we are always upgrading our infastructure.",1586011478,fmeqwnm

Here is a link to the current order:

This means that executive order 20-14 which limited gatherings to 10 people is still in effect until May 1.

You can read a copy of that order here:

Yep, true they do have to still pay a customer charge, but the argument is that solar customers would require a larger customer charge because they cause infrastructure to need to be upgraded more rapidly than regular customers.

With Project Veritas, it seems pretty slanderous to make a video (whether under false pretenses or not) and *then take the subsequent step* of editing it in such a way to add elements of *untruth* to it. In your example with farmers, I agree the same thing applies. If some vegan activist makes videos and *further edits it* to tell a story that's not factually true, then I think it's slanderous in the same way.

However, I disagree that merely showing truthful raw footage from a meat production operation should illegal just because it's upsetting to meat eaters who are otherwise in denial about what happens before meat shows up at Walmart. If the industry is ashamed that disturbing practices are happening, they've had every opportunity to actually stop doing that stuff. 

I've seen those videos, but I also have relatives who raise meat and understand it's their livelihood, and not really as bad as the videos make it seem. While I love meat, I also realize how most of it is produced, and also understand the pretty legit arguments for why one should be a vegetarian - so as a compromise I go out of my way to buy more humanely raised meat - but in reality, that's probably isn't enough, and not everyone can do that either.

To me, it's just like with diamond production.  People can stick diamonds on their fingers mined in countries where it's fueling civil wars and human misery, or they can stick the exact same stone grown in a lab in Miami.  It's the same thing - once people start to care about the ethics of the production itself, the choice is easy. IMO, lab-grown meat alternatives will eventually beat what is mostly inhumane animal production today. When consumers understand the choice between eating two similarly tasting burgers is that one results in the unhappy life and death of a cow, while the other doesn't, the choice seems pretty easy.",1586111501,fmikp1n

6806,rollingintheshallow,"This is a good hypothetical situation to consider. 

I need to run some more numbers and do more research... but I know that the uncertainty of a customer's production comes into play also. But I suppose I'm not sure why, in the grand scheme of things, that uncertainty wouldn't wash out with large numbers of distributed solar.

Let's say during peak hours, the utility can import or 'spin up' power at 0.08/kwh and sell at twice that, so if a customer was credited 0.08 for 3kwh surplus, and was to apply that to kwh they purchase at night time which might be half the cost.. Yeah I hadn't really considered that. I'll do some more reading.

For me, personally, I like the idea of utility scale (or public) solar that I could 'buy into' and get paid dividends on. It is theoretically cheaper for everyone due to economies of scale, and utilities would view it more favorably because they'd be able to control it better.

Overall... solar does not have great ROI in Kansas due to our average surface irradiance being hindered by cloud cover too much. It is better in SWKS though, but we've also got great opportunities for wind generation there.",1586123803,fmj64lq
6807,rollingintheshallow,"Another thing to consider, is that the utility has to 'oversize' the lines for the amount of load a solar house will be seeing. So actually a house that's carried\~70% by solar would need the same electrical infrastructure sizing (same copper, transformers, lugs, etc...) as a house that is served entirely by the grid, and those infrastructure costs and maintenance are no longer able to be recouped in the consumption charges.

Honestly I should've lead with that up at the top of this thread. Because that is significant. If everyone suddenly switched to \~70% solar, the cost per kwh of grid delivery would skyrocket.",1586123985,fmj6fx2
