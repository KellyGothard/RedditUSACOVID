It seems like its just done and I don't have to do  anything, but I'm not sure if its above board and don't want there to be  any negative consequences down the road.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

So some personal information I have experienced seizures for about four years and was diagnosed with epilepsy in about 2017 after a stay with Mayo Clinic in Arizona. BECAUSE I continued to have seizures in Wyoming but the hospital locally refused to medical diagnose me for about a year. While at Mayo Clinic I was told that epilepsy I experience is manageable and we can control it with the proper medicine schedule and possibly other factors such as sleep, food schedule and etc... The seizures I experience are rarely grand mals and I have amazing cognitive ability, memory and rarely lose conciseness. Moving on, The day of my car crash I pulled out of a local coffee shop, was driving down a road and experienced my first grand mal seizure while driving. I don't remember the rest of the day or a lot of that week, up until 02/24/2020 witch is the first day I can recall. The officers told me I did not hit anyone just drove off the road and hit a fence. However, when the medical staff and officers arrived on the scene, I continued to have seizure after seizure in my car. This resulted in the officers breaking the window and sending me to the hospital. After I was in a stable condition I was taken to jail and experienced another seizure at the jail while being booked. I was thrown into a padded room at the jail and experienced more seizures. I was then brought back to the hospital put into the ICU and also an induced medical coma before final be giving medication for my epilepsy. I woke up in the hospital and started recovering from the whole episode. The officers wrote to me three tickets that day 02/14/2020. DUI, Possession, and driving without a seatbelt. Before this episode, I did recently live in Colorado and had a Colorado license. A few questions and maybe advice. Will I get my Colorado license back? Will I get a license back? Was it a legal search? I was not driving and smoking and do not do that. I simply did go to Colorado smoked, followed the law in colorado such as not smoking in public, smoking, and driving and proper packaging while in public(leaving or going back to the dispensary). Forgot 1 gram in my hoodie and it was in the back, I honestly did not try to bring anything into Wyoming and was not smoking that day. I am on bail currently and have court on the 12th of march. Should I get a lawyer? Should I look at this episode as a civil suit and try to sue jail? Thank you to all and any help :)",wyoming,DUI Help ! #LEGAL

I have been on Reddit for a while but do not usually log in or post. I was hoping if those in this subreddit had any thoughts on my position.

I am in my 20s and born and raised in CA (LA and SF). I am getting tired of the density (I ""upgraded"" from about a 250sqft to 525sqft apt), crime, homelessness, traffic, restrictions on gun ownership, and the myriad of other issues in CA. I have never liked CA and have been planning to move somewhere else for a long time. I want to live somewhere which is basically the opposite of CA and where I can have a home with plenty of outdoor space.

My major concern is employment opportunities. I work in the legal profession. Salary is $200k+. With the SO, we make about $300k. We are certain that we will take a drastic pay cut and are  fine with that. Taxes are outrageously high in CA anyway and they take a good chunk of our money. 

What would be the ideal locations in WY for my field? Any constructive thoughts would be appreciated on employment or generally living in WY.",wyoming,Interested in Restarting in Wyoming
