The first time was several weeks ago. I arrived at 7:45am in Grand Prairie and actually obtained a number in line and sat in the waiting room. I was three spots away from getting called but couldn‚Äôt wait any longer because I had an interview at 11am. So I left, after almost 3hrs and barely made the interview. Luckily, I was offered the job so I don‚Äôt regret leaving. 

The second time was yesterday. I arrived at 8:30am in Plano and immediately saw a line a football long. But I assumed a few hours was all that was needed. Boy was I wrong. Someone from the office came outside and said it‚Äôs unlikely that we would even get in the doors before the office closes. WTF! They close at 5pm. Youre telling me that I may wait in line for 7.5hrs and still not get in? So I made the decision to leave cause I had other shit to do, and try again Friday (today) at a third location. I‚Äôd get there super early...

So the third time (today),I arrive at the DPS mega center in Carrollton at 6:30am, an hour before they open. Can you believe that the line is even longer than the one yesterday, even though I‚Äôm there a full two hours earlier??? And guess what, the ‚ÄúGet in line online‚Äù feature isn‚Äôt being offered, even at the Mega centers. 

Texas needs to revamp this shit ASAP, by offering more services to be done online. It would greatly reduce the in-person actions that need to be done and save everyone some time. 

I did overhear one poor soul say he waited four hours, a few days ago, and was just about through the door when the office said the system crashed. They turned everyone away after that, apparently. 

I‚Äôll try again after the kids go back to school, maybe the wait time will only be 4hrs.",Dallas,Every Texas Department of Public Safety is an entry way into hell.

120,120,Aggravating_Lettuce,1578062334,ejg80a,Nan,"I just want to update to people that are heavily involved... Stuff is getting wierd, and I'm being presented with a lot of conflicting stories. It seems like my grandma might have made over exaggerated Hawthornes involvement.  I'm not sure what the real answer here, but I didn't want to let a story sit as fact if there were conflicting details being presented to me. 

To start, I have confirmed that Hawthorne wasn't directly my father's defendent, but my grandma still swears that Hawthorne was of no help to her as a victims advocate and was at least working with the defense and asking her questions during the criminal trial. I'm not sure what to think of that at all. 

I ended up having a phone call with Hawthorne last night, she seemed genuine and told me she did everything she could to help me when I was younger, and felt awful that I felt the way I do. She said she doesn't even recall meeting my father, let alone representing him or assisting the defense. 

I am trying to clarify details with other lawyers and state workers that might have been involved.  So I called this guy who Hawthorne said was my dad's defendent, and he and I talked for about 45 minutes, he told me he doesn't recall the case at all, but did walk me through the fact that accessing expunged records is impossible as they've all been legally ordered to be destroyed, and even if they're shoved in a cabinet somewhere, regardless of my dad being found guilty in 2012, no one would be legally allowed to release the documents to me. 

He did say that he only recalls working with Hawthorne once, and refered to her as ' a nut' but didn't give me much more information than that. 

This is all incredibly confusing.  My grandma is adamant that Hawthorne was the one asking her questions as a my father's representative. I was a little too young to remember for sure.

 I have two people saying my dad's lawyer was a man, the lawyer in question saying ' I don't remember this at all and I don't have any paperwork about it' but I can't imagine than my grandma completely fabricated Hawthorne involvement. 

This has been the story I've been told my entire life about how this court proceedings have gone, and everything I wrote was ' true' to my understanding. I'm just waiting on call backs from lawyers rn to try to iron out details. 

Hoping some one can at least loosely discribe the trial process accurately and clarify Hawthorne's involvement, but I'm basically begging people who have helped clients for over 20 years to remember one little girl from 2003. 

Considering the uncertain nature of the situation as of right now though, presenting my story as fact seemed dishonest. The reality is I'm not sure what Hawthornes involvement was in the case, and it's a he said she said between Hawthorne and my grandmother with a lot of questions marks in-between. 



Original post: 




In November 2003 Theresa Hawthorne was my victims advocate in regards to my court case with my father. My father sexually assulted me for the majority of my life. CPS was involved in my life as young as 4 years old, and likely before. He beat my mother, eventually they divorced. My family has slightly varied stories, but I had been making outcries of sexual abuse since 3 years old.¬†


When I was 5, my mother died, with in a month of being placed in my dad's sole custody I made another outcry of abuse, this¬†time to my maternal grandmother. She had asked me what I learned at school, simple question, I told her I hadn't learned much today, and eventually she wiggled a ' well I learned to make babies' I would go on to tell her about how my father had requested that I strip and sit on the bathroom sink as he jerked off to completion into the bathroom sink.¬†

I believe Theresa was originally assigned to me to help the custody transition after my mother's death, she was the case manager handling visitation with my maternal grandmother, home checks, and the like. 

Theresa was supposed to protect me. Instead, She switched sides and became my father's lawyer almost immediately after my outcry of abuse. My grandmother recalls her pulling my father aside in an early custody hearing, and very soon after I would be assigned a new case manager by CPS. From then on out, Hawthorne represented and protected my father in his criminal trial.  She pushed for a judicial trial knowing that my father would win the case if she took away the chance at a jury &amp; strategically used her inside knowledge of my case to support her defense. 


She guided my father to winning the trial and then she left me in foster care to rot for six months, I can go on and on about the injustice of the foster care system I was put in, but I'll move onto the second part of this story, because Hawthornes decision to let my father go ultimately led to my life being fueled by tauma that she alone could have spared me from.¬†


My grandmother spent nearly 40,000k to get me out of the foster care system after my father was found not guilty. CPS agreed that at the very least, I wasn't going to go back to my father willingly. We lived together, through much hardship, as she had lost my mother and her husband in the span of six months, and I lived with my grandma until I was 12.¬†



This is where Hawthornes decisions started to cause real impact, as by the time I was 12, my father had remarried a 19 year old and had his first son.


¬†Understand for one moment that I grew up mostly alone. I have no siblings and my grandmother was very depressed. When I was offered a chance to meet my father and meet my brother and have a family, it was a no-brainer to me. I quickly moved back into my father's residence on good faith, even if something had happened, I figured he wouldn't do anything again, especially now with a wife and family at risk.¬†


I was wrong.¬†


That's really all I can say.¬†


I was so wrong. I was with my father for less than a year when I confessed the abuse to my English teacher. By this time, I considered being molested .. normal... I wasn't raped by him, maybe I can call that a blessing, but when I finally left. It was close. The last time he had abused me he had desperately tried to convince me to allow penetration, then punished me severely when I rejected.¬†


My life was sad. I had the best grades I had in my life. I felt the most loved I had in my life. I adored my brother and sister. I adored my step mom. I had the structure I so desperately needed to thrive.¬†


Then I walked in on my dad eyeing my little sister. Everything changed at once. It wasn't just me anymore. I wasn't a special victims in my eyes. He was a pedophile.¬†


The very next morning, I walked into my English teachers room and told her. It would be the last time I saw my half brother and sister for 7 years. 


My father made me into a monster to everyone he knew. A master manipulator. A promiscuous flirt. I couldn't even begin to regurgitate the things that have been said to me. Can hardly handle thinking about how my step mom and her family stalked me online and desperately tried to poke holes in my story. I wish I could express further, but when I think about the trauma my step mom and father put me through AFTER I was taken from their home. It was bad.  After they realized I wasnt going to suddenly recant my story, they basically disowned me.¬†


This time though, his personal attacks didn't work, this time I won, this time I was mature enough to articulate the abuse I was going through, not a child who didn't know the word for penis. I put my father in jail for 79 years. It was finally over. This man who was first accused of molesting me when I was there, finally was being held accountable for his actions. He finally couldn't lie his way out of it&amp; he didn't have Hawthorne to guide him to victory.¬†



Hawthorne had a responsibility to protect me as my victim advocate, and when she choose to switch sides and represent my father, she promoted my re-victimization in my teens directly. She used her inside knowledge about my case to sway the courts to get my father aquited. She does not deserve to be a judge anywhere, and needs to be held accountable for letting abusers off the hook. 

When I read that she had cast doubt on other Victims I knew my story needed to be shared. Her actions have hurt me tremendously, and at the very least she needs to have to face the consequences of her actions head on.¬†She gained public backlash in 2016 after telling a jury who just found a man guilty that she didn't believe the victim was really raped and that she didn't think the sentence given was fair regardless. 

I'm of personal belief  when some one gets caught practicing bad behaviors, that it's just that, the first time that they got caught. I believe that many other victims have suffered due to Hawthornes ingrained personal bias in favor of the accused that prevents her from acting impartially, and for that reason should absolutely not be re-elected into a judicial position.  So I'm here, sharing my story. Thanks for reading.

As much as I've enjoyed the past few weeks here, I'm going a bit crazy not having any sort of social life and it's difficult being away from my friends so I figure the best way to meet people is through my main 2 hobbies. 

I tried searching up some places for Salsa dancing but I am not sure if they are places where actual dancers go, or if they are just ""salsa nights"" catered towards everyone which isn't what I'm really looking for. For example in my city there are some bars that have weekly salsa/bachata socials and its pretty much just dancers that go there who are looking just to dance, not to party and get drunk.. So I'm looking for something similar to that. And some previous suggestions don't exist anymore like the one at blue mesa at addison because I called them and they said they don't do it anymore. So if any of you are regular dancers I'd really appreciate some ""in the know"" help. I also don't want it to be too far from where I'm staying which is Carrollton so nearby areas like Frisco and Addisson are fine. 

With regards to soccer, I found a few places like indoor soccer zone and world cup soccer zone and Im wondering if any of you can recommend which places are drop-in and best for someone who doesn't have a team and can just go alone and form a team with other people to play that week.

&gt;Dallas has a reputation for this trope among other Texans. The general attitude in the state (especially Fort Worth and Houston) is that Dallas culture tries a little too hard to avert the stereotype that all Texans are redneck cowboys, making the city and its residents come off as pretentious and bougie instead.

&gt;Many non-natives often have a hard time sizing up Dallas. Dallas sometimes can fit the typical Texan stereotypes (Western and laid-back), and sometimes it may fit the more notorious stereotypes (pretentious, unfriendly, and sterile), but not always. The truth is it can fall somewhere in between.

My grandparents are missing and were last spotted in Southeast Dallas off 175 and Buckner. They were spotted as far north on 75 as Oklahoma. They live in Crowley, TX and have daughter in McKinney, Burleson and Fort Worth. They drive a 2007 beige Nissan Pathfinder. My grandma has Alzheimer‚Äôs and my grandpa has beginning stages of dementia and are 78 and 79 years old. We believe they have been driving around since around 11pm at night. The license plate number is DK6L053.  
There is a missing person report but they will not do a silver alert, so please share. Thank you.

So i originally posted a version of this in r/civilengineering but since i live in Dallas, i'm also reaching out here.  
  
I took a bit of a detour early in my career (to oil and gas, big surprise right?) and came back to civil engineering in my late 20's (when oil crashed and i got laid off). It's about time to take the PE exam, and i've signed up for the April test (here in texas, it's decoupled, so i can take it before my 4 years are up). I've signed up for the TestMasters On-Demand online course and started studying this weekend. Well, i've quickly realized that I'm VERY out of practice with this learning stuff and could really use a study buddy. I learn best when i fully understand a concept and am terrified that i'm lacking some of the basic 'obvious' knowledge due to not having used it for almost 10 years.

I'm taking the Civil Engineering- Water Resources exam. Anyways, if there is anyone out there who'd be interested in being a study buddy, helping each other when we have questions, having a safe space to ask the stupid stuff, please feel free to reach out. I'm freaking out and really dont want to fail. Even if you arent taking the Water Resources depth, there is plenty to help each other on with the breadth part and would be open to a study group of multiple disciplines.

Looking forward to hopefully getting a group together, either to meet up in person or virtually!",Dallas,Anyone else studying for the PE-Civil exam in April? Looking to put together a study group!

No homeless shelters we‚Äôve called can accommodate her, she cannot stand by herself, shower or use the bathroom without assistance. The hospital kicked her out even though she is unable to walk and has no where to go due her not having insurance exhausted their resources. 

It is very possible for her to walk again, she just needs physical therapy. She is desperate for physical therapy or some sort of rehab to get function of her legs back.

 Im a multi instrumentalist (bass, guitar, drums and keyboards) when it comes to performing my own music id play guitar and vocals but if I was to help out lets say someone else in a live setting I could play some other instrument. 

Just for reference Im a big fan of Alternative music and old school stuff. Bands I like include Pink Floyd, Tame Impala, Beatles, and some othet alternative acts like Melodys Echo Chamber, Pond, Mild High Club. I also like the Flaming Lips. There is a lot mote I could list but I guess these are the acts that my music is influenced by.

The company I worked at was purchased while I was on medical leave, and a couple of months after returning to work I was layed off. Money had already been tight and that didn't help any. 

All of this is to provide background as to why I'm posting. i was evicted from my apartment on Monday, and have been staying at a Motel 6.  I start a new job next week, and family had told me they would help out to keep myself and my cat at the hotel until then. I'm not sure of the reasons but that has now fallen through. 

my dilemma is my cat. I can most likely handle having to be homeless for a week or two, but there is no way I can take him with me. I've called all the shelters I can find locally, and none accept pets that are not service animals. I don't even want to think about having to take him to an animal shelter. The furball saved my life at least twice, and I don't want to reward that kind of love with the only options I have available.

I have reached out to everyone I know to see if they can house him for a bit, but am not having any luck at all.  

I have requests in to all the local housing assistance / financial aid programs, and have appointment scheduled with metrocrest services on Monday, but that leaves me getting booted from motel 6 today at 11.

So I‚Äôm currently living in Wisconsin. Fortunately, I have a girlfriend who means the world to me. Unfortunately, she and her family live 1000 miles away from me in the Dallas/Plano/Richardson area. That‚Äôs fine I thought, I don‚Äôt mind moving. That area actually looks amazing for my career!

So I‚Äôve visited 3 times, and I just am having the hardest time adjusting to these cities and their size and pace of living. I live about 45 minutes west of Milwaukee - I‚Äôve been there plenty of times, but Dallas is a whole other beast. Not to mention the city I live in is a population of 10k, it has everything I need but it‚Äôs much smaller and slower. I love it, and I‚Äôm used to it and it‚Äôs making me feel like I‚Äôm drowning when I‚Äôm in Dallas. 

Are there any cities possibly near the Dallas/Plano/Richardson area that are quite smaller and more rural but still within a 30-45 minute commute to most business offices I‚Äôd potentially work at? I know no one could predict where I‚Äôd work exactly but just a general distance from these cities. I‚Äôd be looking to rent an apartment likely between the $1k-$1.4k monthly range so hopefully there‚Äôs a relatively nearby city that is affordable too. 

I‚Äôve moved a bunch and everywhere I‚Äôve gone has some smaller places with more farmland about a half hour from the major city so I‚Äôm hoping Dallas isn‚Äôt too different, but just the massive size and how much space is available in Texas to build and spread out makes me a little pessimistic. If you guys have any ideas I‚Äôd love to hear them.

We were inside, looking out the storefront maybe 15-20' away from the animal.

It was comparable in height and weight to my 85# husky, for sure. 

My curiosity was piqued and after a little research, coyotes average 20-40#, with the record being near 75#. 

I also looked up wolves for the hell of it and saw that the grey/red/Mexican wolves cannot be found in TX anymore, but they average 50-90#.

My thoughts: a virtual 5k w/ a $20 entry fee that gets you a nice T-Shirt (100% of proceeds to the nonprofit through Bonfire, and they will ship to you so I don't have your contact info!); after your virtual race, post a pic in the t-shirt to social saying why you ran; top racers will receive a medal that I purchase with my own savings (i.e., not from your entry fee). 

A week or two after the race I'd love to bring the community together in the name of the charity at a meetup, where I'll have printouts of people's stories for why they ran.

Usually I go to Asia Times Square in Grand Prairie but they seem to have done it differently this year and are only doing fireworks this weekend. Last weekend was the last weekend for food and vendors, which is so weird but that's beside the point.

I relocated to a super 8 in Irving, since this means I can walk to work in 30 minutes as opposed to spending nearly 4 hours in public transportation every day. issue I'm running in to is all the food banks / charities in the area have hours that directly conflict with my working hours. since I just started, that loses a problem.

803,803,theweirddood,1579750407,esnhyk,Nan,"After going to Sears, Super Auto Repair, and Firestone, I have concluded that these places do not know what the hell they're doing when it comes to aligning a car. I will list out what each place did wrong.

Sears: 

After getting new lower ball joints and lower control arm bushings installed, I took my car there for an alignment. 500 miles later the tires had a feathering wear on it and they blamed it on me not rotating the tires when I already rotated it less than 2 or 3k miles before the alignment. They performed another alignment and said it's all good.

Super Auto Repair:

After seeing that the tires were still having the feathering wear pattern, I took it here since my family and friends been here before and had good things to say about it. After aligning the car they said ""Sorry, I have bad news for you. Your inner and outer tie rods are worn so we did the best we can!"" and charged me $90 for an alignment.....$40 for toe and $50 for caster. The before and after caster was the same, so I do not get why I'm being charged for caster. Furthermore, my tie rods have play/are worn. That means you're not even supposed to perform an alignment and charge me for it. This shop is very unprofessional and the interior where customers wait look VERY dirty. 

Firestone:

I took my car here for an alignment after getting new tie rod ends (inner and outer) and installing new steering rack bushings. After 2 weeks of the alignment being done, I went under the car to grease my U-joints and noticed the jam nut for the outer tie rod was 4 threads away from being tightened. I can easily spin the jam nut with my pinky finger back to the inner tie rod.  After calling Firestone, they seemed to not really care and act like it was no big deal. At least they were willing to realign my car without charging me another $105. The toe alignment went from the original .07 to .14 because of them not tightening the jam nut.

TL;DR:

 After having bad experiences with these shops and their lack of attention to detail, I want to go to another alignment shop if I ever need to realign my car after doing suspension work. Are there any good places that specializes in suspension work and alignments in the Dallas/Plano/Richardson area? I don't mind heading out to Wylie or Frisco either.",Dallas,Good Shop That Specializes in Alignments and Suspension in Dallas/Plano/Richardson

My 16 year old niece has run away from home and is likely living with an adult male who sells dope and likely pimps.  Turns out she had been sneaking out of the house regularly and connected with this man in the gas station parking lot near our home.  at first, I could somewhat track her through social media and certain resources.  She has now gone underground and stopped responding to even her friends.  We have reported her as a runaway, but she is 16 so they are not actively looking for her.  she will likely be in the Lake Highlands / Forest Lane (I know) / Forest and Skillman / NW Garland area.  She frequents the New Church Road Chevron, BB Owen park and the Rec Center across from Lake Highlands High School.  


Is there anything more I can do?  Are there any resources I can check?  We found some sites we think she'll end up on if she's being pimped, but don't know if we are on the right track.

Her mom currently pays $500 for rent so slightly over should be okay, I think in total they pay roughly a little over 700.

I don't even remember , but there must have been tons of threatening signs and evil-looking cameras, and I must have thought at the time, ""Shhhtt, Texas kinda looks like a fascist police state.""

That was, back in April.

=== ==== ======

Cut to present day. Going through a giant box of junk mail that had piled up, I open some strange envelopes. This one says it's from ""Professional Account Management LLC NNTA"" in Plano Texas, and says that I owe them forty dollars. They sure do know that the vehicle is registered to me, and they have a printout of my license plate.

The first few minutes are spent in an angry daze. ""What fresh hell is this!?!? Scam artists that somehow use people's License Plate information, to squeeze them for cash?"" Slightly angry, thinking about calling BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU, or something, realizing that it's a futile fight probably

and then I remember the time my girlfriend wanted to go see the Waco Woolly Mammoth National Monument.

=== =====

I dig through /r/dallas for more information. ""Call them! They've always been nice to me!"" chirpy people say.

Maybe I'll do that tomorrow. But right now Im still sore, that I made the huge efffffing mistake of driving anywhere near Texas, because now bills are jumping out of my Junk Mail pile to haunt me.

They would use a single tortilla and fold it in half, the tortillas were flour, and a pretty good size. They also went pretty liberal on the sour cream, I think. I also remember getting a unique bread from there: ""pan de novia"", or also called, ""novias"".

I‚Äôm turning to Reddit because we have been trying to find new places to meet up. What was once a meet up for 20-50 people has grown to 150-200 and it‚Äôs hard to find places that are affordable (we can‚Äôt charge entrance fees, the meet ups must be free - but we can find sponsors or partner with companies to fund these). In our research there also must be alcohol served - and preferably some food options if possible, but not absolutely necessary. 

Does anyone know of any places that could house 150-200 people and fit these categories? Anywhere in the metroplex is fine - we‚Äôve had previous meet ups at places like Nerdvana in Frisco, Free Play in Arlington, and Round One in Grapevine.

I'll be visiting Dallas for the first time this May, my itinerary will have me around for 20 days, I'm really excited to visit and I've always heard about Texas and its red meat - something I really want to try as much as possible. So I'm looking for ideas, recommendations and stuff to do. I'll be visiting my brother with my mom. My brother is a surgical attendent at the hospital and won't be tagging a long frequently.

Things that might be worth mentioning:

* I am a 23 year old, my mother is 53 and my brother is 28.

* I really want to try slow cooked steak and aged steak as that's very uncommon and non-existent in my country, I'm a big beef and chicken fan. Not a fan of pork and most definitely can't have any when mom is around (Kosher)

* I like hikes and have hiked frequently with and without guides. I understand hiking etiquette and I am environmentally aware.

* While I do have access to a car my mom detests my driving and would like to minimize using it, so public transportation is always fun...

* I want to do a fair amount of shopping for clothes and electronics. Any good places? I don't want to use Amazon, as I'd rather help brick and moarter shops were locals are employed and spend my money in the local community not a cooperation. Something my brother pointed out on the importance of. 

* What areas should I avoid?

* What things should I defdintly try? 

* Is it safe at night? 

* How light or heavy should I pack my jackets if any at all? 

* Any bar recommendations (most likely it'll just be and my brother) 

For what it's worth I'm also looking to continue my PhD in the US. So I might be visiting a few college campuses while I'm there, but I doubt that's relevant.

 Up-and-coming artists will have the chance to shine at a new venue in downtown Dallas, and it just happens to be in Mark Cuban‚Äôs parking lot.

Currently, the prospective venue is an empty warehouse on the North Stemmons Freeway. Concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment will convert the space into a 1,000-capacity venue dubbed The HiFi Dallas, set to open in May. The facility, which is in the Design District, sits next door to the Dallas Mavericks‚Äô practice facility along the freeway and is owned by Cuban.

Im not in danger or anything, shes just doing everything possible to make things harder. I need to GTFO. Any ideas of super cheap lots or places to go?",Dallas,Any VERY cheap used cars in dallas?
1023,1023,lostboythrowaway69,1580402383,ew863g,Question,"Hey guys.

So I'm going through a point in my life where I need to make a huge  decision. I need to pick one place to work/live for the long term.

I'm a single 28 year old asian male with a crap ton of student loans to payoff. Currently finishing up a residency program in medicine and interviewing at 2 locations for jobs. Keep in mind, both practices want me to stay long term...like at least 8-10 years or even til retirement. I love going out and ""dating around"" but I feel like I need to start taking relationships more seriously and consider settling down soon.

Here's the downlow:----------------------------------

(1) First Location: Dallas, Tx

* PROS:
   * Great job prospect - possible equity/buy in
   * No state income tax
   * Lower cost of living
   * One of my best friends lives there
   * People seem friendlier?
* CONS
   * Far away from family
   * Less diverse
   * Not sure if I would want to stay here for the rest of my life

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) Second Location: Washington DC (job is in DC but may live in northern virginia (cheaper Cost of living) or DC)

* PROS:
   * Great job prospect - possible equity and complete buy out
   * More diverse/More asians (I don't know ...sometimes I feel more comfortable with more asians around even though my closest friends are white/black)
   * Have a couple of friends here but not as good as the one in Dallas
   * Seems like a more dateable scene? possibly more chance of finding someone to settle down with
   * Closer to family (parents live in southern Maryland)
* CONS:
   * Much more cost of living than dallas
   * Income tax is 8.5%
   * Seems like it is more hustle and bustle/ ruder people
   * Not sure if I would want to stay here for the rest of my life - but could see myself here since it's much closer to my parents (southern maryland)

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm honestly losing sleep from this even though its somewhat of a good problem. What do yall Dallas natives think?

If anyone could give me even a sliver of advice please help me out.

I really appreciate everyone's time.",Dallas,"Super stressed out - Major life decision needs to be made soon - Job, location, dating etc - Details inside"

There is a charge to get into the park, but there isn't any extra cost for the star party.

We will be set up in the northern overflow parking lot (check the map). We will start with solar observing before sunset, and then stay until the last person leaves, so if you want to stick around for a while, you can!

1057,1057,SilverMars,1580493434,ews5xx,Nan,"#Originally posted in /r/Denton. Posting here because many of the same contaminants are present in the similarly extreme quantities across the DFW area.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a scientist, but I've been doing some basic research and am presenting findings here that I think warrants a PSA post in this subreddit. 

My kidneys, testicles, and bladder have been enduring rapid-onset pain, striking seemingly at random over the past 6 months or so. I'm telling you this because it explains why I've taken a personal interest in this issue. My urologist and doctor both don't seem to have any idea of what is going on or why it's happening. Not drawing a definitive link to the information I'm about to share, but again, it's worth sharing so you know where I'm coming from. I never bought a Brita and I'm a broke 20 something, so I've been drinking exclusively from the tap since I moved to Denton 2 years ago. I never minded the taste and thought it was safe.

My water tasted a bit funny today, so I looked up [Denton's water quality from the Environmental Working Group](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/system.php?pws=TX0610002) and the results were completely terrifying. I knew it wasn't going to be good, but I didn't expect this level of contamination. 

There are certain levels of contaminants that are allowed in a city's water supply. Please note, these are not always what is medically *safe* to be in the water supply, these are the government regulations of what is allowed.

With that noted, the levels of contaminants are as high as **75x** the acceptable presence in our water supply. I highly encourage you to click the link and view the details for yourself. Because these high levels shocked me, I dug further and looked into what these chemicals actually do in your body. Here are some highlights:

**BROMOFORM** - Bromoform levels in Denton's water are **2.3x** the EWG's health guideline. Some people who ingested large amounts of bromate had gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Some individuals who ingested high concentrations of bromate also experienced kidney effects, nervous system effects and hearing loss. However, these people were exposed to bromate levels many thousand of times the amount that would come from drinking water at its standard.

Exposure to large amounts of bromate for a long period of time caused kidney effects in laboratory animals. [Long-term exposure to high levels of bromate has also caused cancer in rats. Whether bromate can cause cancer in people is not known.](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/water/drinking/bromate.htm)

**BROMODICHLOROMETHANE** -  Bromodichloromethane levels in Denton's water are **39x** the EWG's health guideline. [Animal studies indicate that the liver, kidney, and central nervous system are affected by exposure to bromodichloromethane. The effects of high doses on the central nervous system include sleepiness and incoordination. Longer exposure to lower doses causes damage to the liver and kidneys. There is some evidence from animal studies that bromodichloromethane may cause birth defects at doses high enough to make the mother sick. It is not known if lower doses would cause birth defects.](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp.asp?id=708&amp;tid=127)

**DIBROMOCHLOROMETHANE** - Dibromochloromethane levels in Denton's water supply are **39x** the EWG's health guideline. See: Bromoform.

These are just some examples and there are many I left out of this post. I Googled the cities with the worst tap water in the U.S. [**DFW and its surrounding cities show up all over the list, especially near the bottom.**](https://bestlifeonline.com/worst-drinking-water/)

I'm not going to go through them one-by-one, but I think I've made my point. This is cause for concern and should be brought to the immediate attention of our local representatives. *Please contact your leaders and demand action.* Considering how these contaminants have been linked to kidney injuries, this is why I personally dove into it. I've contacted my urologist and have moved my appointment up to discuss this with him. If you or anyone you know have been having similar issues, I won't diagnose you, but I do think it's information worth knowing because no antibiotics were helping me, personally. 

**TL;DR** - Buy a water filter if you do not already have one. A Brita is like $15 on Amazon and I will order one after submitting this post. [The EWG has a page where you can find out what kind of water filter may be the best for you.](https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/water-filter-guide.php)",Dallas,DFW and its surrounding communities have some of the worst tap water in the nation.

Just flipping through stations hasn't been a particularly effective way of figuring out what's good since you end up with a lot of ad time, DJs talking between songs, or just morning/evening shows without music.

Since I'm looking for whatever is currently charting, subjective quality of the music is less important than the songs being *actually* what's popular right now (as opposed to some stations that play big songs from the past 20 years, or filter out songs for whatever reason), the quality of the DJs, and fewer commercials if that's the only difference.

1190,1190,vagranteidolon,1580844350,eyvgd7,Nan,"Just wondering if anyone's been through the process. Long story short, I got laid off back in September and just scraped by with gig work and such until I finally completed the arduous onboarding process for my new job. 

They filed on me 2 days after my birthday (yay?) with me being $600 behind (Filed Jan 21, was due Jan 3) and now I've got a court date for this week. They want the money owed (which I have now..) plus court fees. Unfortunately, because the case is set for the 6th, they also want February's rent paid in full. Which brings me up to $1,500 total, and I was told to bring the full amount to the office before the 6th in order to dismiss.

That ain't happening. I get my first check on the 14th, so I'm basically just hoping to go in there and plead my case with the judge and pray he allows me the extra week to get the rest of the money together.

The editorial board at the DMN's reasoning / opinion is her opponents ""do not have a firm grasp on the complexities of governing and legislating"". But apparently she does? Just have a drive through her district. It almost seems as if the DMN has an interest in keeping the voters in the 30th Congressional District down. 

The piece is behind a paywall:

Given her long tenure in Congress, it‚Äôs hardly a surprise that Eddie Bernice Johnson draws more persistent primary opposition with each election cycle.

Johnson, 84, is now in her 14th term in office. Voters would be wise to choose her over the slate of opponents she faces this year.

Against her three opponents in this primary, Johnson stands out as the most informed, the most prepared, the most nuanced and, of course, the most experienced.

Two of her opponents, multimedia firm founder Hasani Burton, 36, and business consultant Shae Cleveland, 47, have the passion of progressives. But they do not have a firm grasp on the complexities of governing and legislating.

Johnson‚Äôs third opponent, former city council member and state representative Barbara Mallory Caraway, 63, is more measured. But she is running against Johnson a fifth time. Voters in the district have persistently made it clear they prefer Johnson.

Which leaves us to look at Johnson‚Äôs record of governing. It is one the district and Dallas can be proud of. Her opponents criticize her because poverty still grips significant areas of the 30th Congressional District, which covers southern Dallas and southern suburbs. But that standard doesn‚Äôt measure what Johnson has accomplished in Congress. She has been on the front lines of passing tough legislation that has helped her community have the safety it needs to be able to compete toward prosperity.

It is popular now for younger politicians like those running against Johnson to criticize laws like the 1994 crime bill. But they did not experience the crime wave of the 1990s that saw politicians of every stripe called upon to do something to stop the bleeding of poor communities.

Beyond that, Johnson has been instrumental in seeing Texas get a significant share of infrastructure funding for water and transportation projects. She has also risen to several leadership positions in the House.

Yes, she has said several times that the next term will be her last, only to run again. And we agree that Congress should not be a forever job. Johnson ‚Äî who says (again) this will be her last term ‚Äî deserves strong challengers. But no one challenging her this time around is her measure as a leader or a legislator.",Dallas,The DMN recommends Eddie Bernice Johnson in the upcoming election

1339,1339,Tweeedles,1581300036,f1j70e,Nan,"Hi all,

I hate to post a 'please help me figure out where to move' thread.....but I'm in a bind.  My company is relocating me to Dallas from Charlotte, NC and I will need to be in place by the end of the month. I have only ever flown through DFW - have never spent time in the city. 

My research thus far has been emailing back and forth with an apartment locator service.  While very helpful as far as sending a variety of properties (all apartment communities), I feel like I need to at least narrow down the specific *region* of the DFW metroplex before looking at individual properties.

With the criteria and random other things below, I would GREATLY appreciate suggestions of neighborhoods/areas all the way down to specific communities. 

\- I'm on the road A LOT.  Like \~100 nights a year in hotels.  So when home on weekends, **I do like to be able to walk to stuff vs. driving to stuff**. I live currently right in the middle of Uptown (downtown) Charlotte, and while traffic sucks it's awfully nice to be able to walk to all-things-city.

\- Having said that, I also have a bike and am comfortable navigating city streets by bike. **So even if it's live just outside and bike downtown, that's cool.**

\- Also very much be open to **living near a rail station and riding it into the city**...

\- When the weather permits, I enjoy **hiking/walking/being in trees and out in nature** as much as possible. Obviously realize there isn't anything like the NC mountains in Dallas, but just throwing that out there.

\- Not majorly into night life...living in Charlotte I enjoy getting home after a long week on the road, walking to the neighborhood bar, having a couple beers and dinner.  **Not into clubs but yes into culture (music, museums).** 

\- I enjoy visiting a **driving range** in my spare time.  So any suggestions of a good range would be great!

\- Due to being on the road a lot - my territory in TX will include Austin, Houston and Dallas - **proximity/ease of access to the appropriate roadways** would be nice.

Again, I know these posts get a lot of eye rolls.  I'm usually doing the rolling.  But since I'll be rolling into town really soon (and traveling a lot in between) I **hugely** appreciate everyone's input. 

Thanks!!",Dallas,Being relocated and it's happening fast. Advice on these communities?

Looking for a DM who wants to run a long term, high level campaign (Level 3-20) that may take a year to complete.

There are 4 of us. The DM we had is moving out of state. We paid him $40 ($10 each) cash per session. We paid four weks at a time ($160). If you average that out over a year, that's $1,920 Tax Free cash!! We play every Thursday night from 6:30pm to 10:30 pm at my house in Coppell, TX. We're an experienced group that enjoys combat and magic more than anything. No, we are not murder hobos, and we don't play evil characters. We just enjoy tactical combat and a great story.

We all use D&amp;D Beyond, and I have access to every manual in the game. I also have 273 miniatures no smaller than Large creatures, and more on the way, over 100 pre-made maps from WoTC and Pathfinder. I have plenty of space, a quiet neighborhood, and great paying players who love the game as much as I do. But we need a DM, since I am already running two home brew campaigns on Sundays. Let me know if you're interested.

Thank you for your time and consideration",Dallas,Looking for D&amp;D 5e DM for a weekly campaign. We pay cash!!

Moving from the PNW to the DFW area with my family. I have no clue where to start looking. Open to living in the burbs or somewhere not too far from Dallas.

Perhaps any locals here can recommend some areas for us to look in? Which areas to avoid?

More about us:

* Mid 30s couple with an 18 month daughter.
* We run our own online business and can work from home.
* Looking for a safe area where we can take our child to a park without worrying about finding  needles or syringes on the playground (a common problem we had in Seattle and we lived in a ""family friendly"" area.)
* Close to great restaurants, coffeeshops, grocery stores, and shopping
* Great schools nearby
* Diversity is a plus.
* A welcoming community. I guess we're not really picky here. I hear Texans are friendly? :)
* Budget: $400-$500K for a house",Dallas,From the PNW to DFW. Where to live? What areas to avoid?

It's also to have one aspect of my life that's positive, and will in turn help resolve this entire situation. but the fact that I'm constantly worrying about how I'm going to continue to keep a roof of myself and furballs head until paychecks start to come in is honestly messing me up pretty bad. it feels like I'm so close to getting back on my feet. well, at least a foot, but that I'm hanging on by the tips of my fingernails.

I was driving to work the other and flipping through the radio stations... Normally if I'm not streaming music I just stick to my presets, so I haven't checked to see if there was anything new in a while.

I stopped on 91.7 because they were playing Michael Jackson... Then they played the Beatles, Iggy Pop, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, Cream, Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder, Blondie, Death Cab for Cutie, Of Monsters and Men....

I've been listening for a few days now and have since heard Johnny Cash, Sam Smith, John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, The Rolling Stones, BB King, The Temptations, The Roots, The Clash, Lorde, U2, James Brown, The Bee Gees...

But none of the songs have been their huge hits... it's a bunch of obscure deep tracks that you might not have heard before. 

On top of the famous artists you have heard about, they also put a huge focus on local music from the metroplex.

It's a great mix of music, with ZERO COMMERCIALS.

Ever had interest in coding but never got the chance? Now's your chance. Treehouse Apprenticeship Program now has open applications for a Full Stack JavaScript program in Irving starting in late April. 

[https://teamtreehouse.com/join/apprenticeship-texas](https://teamtreehouse.com/join/apprenticeship-texas)

You go to the above link, read the details, and if it sounds like the right fit you click ""Start Now"".

The application process is like this:

* Complete the introductory track and mini-project (about 20 hours)
* Receive an application and return said application

Wait and see if you were accepted! The program has a **paid, full-time, 4 month learning phase** onsite at the company. This is where you learn to code with a cohort and have regular check-ins with your Treehouse Mentor. 

After the learning phase, you may have the opportunity to move onto the paid apprenticeship phase as a software developer(3 months). Once you finish the apprenticeship phase, there is the opportunity to apply and be considered for full time employment. Last year, this agency hired just under 30 apprentices into full-time employees between two locations.

*Not everyone who makes it through the learning phase will make it to the apprenticeship phase as this process is competitive;* however, if you have the grit and determination and think this may be the right fit, please apply!

1433,1433,dalansta,1581541312,f2y17t,Nan,"27 y.o California girl from the SF Bay Area here. I spent the last 10 days here in Dallas for work. Just wanted to share my take / recommendations for anyone else that may be visiting &amp; give the locals insight to an outsiders point of view.

\*\*\*Disclaimers:   
\- I do not claim to be a travel guru, foodie or blogger.  
\- I spent a lot of time in a centralized area (Deep Ellum), I'm sure there is plenty more cool stuff out there that I missed.   
\- I worked 10 hour days, so  my experience was often limited to late-night venues.   
\- Just a bored young professional with time to kill before a flight home

**TL;DR**  
\- Roads are confusing / parking generally sucks  
\- Saturdays are way more crakcin than Fridays. Sundays are completely dead.  
\- Good food, but at a much higher price than you would find it in the Bay   
\- Very cool street art in Deep Ellum, full of photo ops if you're into that sort of thing.  
\- Please share more recs, since I'll likely be back here for work again!  


  
**Hotel Situation**  
I had a long stay, so i wanted to pick a hotel that was in the mix. After a bit of research, I found that Deep Ellum was going to be the place for me. I was right. I stayed at the Home2 Hilton Downtown at Baylor, Scott and White. Location is  a 10/10. I was walking distance to all restaurants and clubs in the Deep Ellum district - *the walk was only a little sketchy*. This was especially a plus, because parking can be a pain (more on that later). The establishment itself I'd have to give a 6/10. It shared a parking garage with the neighboring hospital and was very confusing to navigate for a first time visitor. Several people in the hotel lobby felt me on this.  The hotel claims to only do deep cleans every 5 nights and a ""light touch-up"" everyday. I generally did not have a problem with this, however, my room was completely ignored for at least 3 of 10 days. I had to call and request my deep clean on the 6th day because I was out of clean towels. Turns out, this hotel also only has like 2 stars on Yelp for pissing off other patrons for various other reasons. But! the room was fairly clean and the price was reasonable for the quality of room. I would stay here again. Location. Location. Location.

**Getting Around**  
Jeeeeeeze Louise these roads can be confusing. I found myself on the I35E for most of my commuting. Went down to Lancaster for work and used it to get to most restaurants I sought out. FIRST OF ALL, why so many damn directions for one highway?! I check Waze and it says to get on I35E.. okay i make my way there BUT WAIT are you going on the 35E South or North?! This was only an issue my first day, but it was just new to me. The freeway interchanges for Central/75/30/35 can be very confusing. So many times I missed my turn because these interchanges can happen so fast.   
Also, construction. Construction everywhere. Drivers here are not nearly as aggressive at California drivers, so I felt like a speed racer in my little rental Camry. Turns out the speed limit dips down to 55 on some highways. whoops.   
PARKING GENERALLY SUCKS. How is there alllll this space, but the tiniest parking lots at most restaurants in the design district? Deep ellum has plenty of parking lots that you'll have to pay $8 for. Kinda steep if you're just dropping in for dinner. There is metered parking though, which is very cheap. 25 cents will get you a whole half hour! Amazing, considering it'll get you a whole 7 minutes in SF. What I realized later was that most places offered valet parking. This screamed $$$ to my mind, but turns out, it's complimentary. This is something that is worth taking advantage of. I didn't most of the time simply because I never had cash on me and YOU SHOULD TIP YOUR VALET.  


**Food**  
Like I mentioned before, I was here for work so I had a $65 per diem for meals everyday. I spent a bunch of time online researching where to get the best bang for my buck. These are my finds:  
ONI RAMEN  
would recommend. very tasty  / customizable ramen. the taste is comparable to that i've had in Japan and at some of the best ramen places in the Bay Area (Ramen Nagi, Orenchi, etc). it'll run you close to $20 though, which is pretty pricey compared to CA..but hey! per diem. set up is similar to how ramen places are in japan, where you order from a kiosk before sitting down. I went here twice.  
VIDORRA  
would recommend for Taco and Tequila Tuesdays. You get 2 tasty street tacos and a shot of tasty tequila for $8. This place felt more authentically mexican, not TexMex, which I enjoyed. Tex Mex is blah (stop putting corn in everything!!). This place was also super crackin' on a saturday night.  
CAFE BRAZIL  
was meh. not sure why this place is so popular. Went here for breakfast and coffee. the portions were pretty small and the coffee was mediocre. it was cheap though. got breakfast and coffee for 2 under $30. Think Santa Cruz Diner if you've ever been. Same vibe.   
SERIOUS PIZZA  
would recommend. nice fresh, thin crust pizza. open late on the weekends. great drunk food. you'll just have to wait for a while.   
TRIBAL ALL DAY CAFE  
this was a small cafe in north bishop? it was cute. good place for a light and healthy brunch. very friendly staff. their coffee was really good too.  
THE CRAB STATION  
probably my fault for picking a seafood place this far away from the ocean. would not recommend. the food was tasty. but ran me about double the price as the same amount of crab would cost me at Boiling Crab. Hard to beat crab in the SF bay.   


**Coffee**  
I love me some coffee. MERIT and ASCENSION were probably my faves. They do a nice slow pour and was comparable to the likes of Verve and Chromatic back home. Both had cool vibes without being to hipster-y.  


**Clubbing**  
Spent the weekend in Deep Ellum. Saturdays are more crackin than Fridays there. Went to DADA on friday. They played good hip hop music. A good mix of the old and new school. The crowd was casual (a couple girls in sweats) but LIT! I had fun. Saturday started out at PUNCH BOWL SOCIAL. This place was a cute starter. It's huge! with lots of bars and lots of stuff to do (bowling, darts, ping pong, kareoke, etc). My boyfriend and I played darts and had some drinks. Probably stayed there too late though, cause by the time we decided to move on... allll the other bars had very long lines. Most places seemed super crackin, but we opted for whatever didn't have a line. So I landed at BEAUTY BAR. This place was cool, definitely seemed like an older crowd. They played really good rap / hip hop. No mumble rap. People were dressed to the nines on saturday compared to friday. Sundays's are a ghost town. Decided to check out KUNG FU in uptown during the day. It's like a tiny version of punch bowl social w/ giant jenga and arcade games (that are free on sundays, btw) We were the only people in there, which I didn't mind. Seemed we were the only people outside, actually. Walking around Deep Ellum and Downtown felt post-apocalyptic. Felt unusual compared to the busy city I'm from. But it was a nice time to walk around and see all the very cool art around town. From the street art and graffiti in Deep Ellum to the Giant Eyeball.  


I enjoyed my time here. And eventually when I can no longer afford to live in the Bay Area (which is probably soon), I would consider living in this town. BUT! I say that having never experienced the summer heat. I'll have to come back and visit then I guess....  


Anywhoozles. If you read this whole thing, first of all, wow. thanks. seconds, please give some recs on where I should go next time. Work will likely send me back out here again and I want to see what else this place has to offer!",Dallas,From the Bay to the D - Deep Ellum Review from a Californian

I have an IPhone XR, looking for an unlimited data, text and call plan and also to get the cellular on my Apple Watch Gen 5.

As well as a young adult, I like checking out social media and reddit too haha and just surf the web overall. So I really want a carrier that‚Äôs great with streaming.

I‚Äôd encourage all residents of the metroplex to just be mindful- this is a beautiful place but we got some real top notch idiot drivers here that have no regard. The LBJ is hell; change my mind. 

Why do people drive with so little regard? I ask myself this as I dodge someone merging into my lane and barely misses the front or back end of my car.

Moved to Dallas (Plano) from Austin a while back because I got a pretty good paying job up here. Don't wanna say I regret it because truly I haven't given it a real chance yet, but my lack of friends and hermit lifestyle is beginning to take a serious toll on my mental health. I can't seem to find a crowd that I really enjoy being with like I did in Austin. The majority of my coworkers live the yuppie lifestyle and really like going to Uptown. The few times I tagged along I really did not enjoy it.

 I love music and going to see live shows. My 'scene' in Austin was the hippie-esque psychedelic crowd and the emo/pop-punk/DIY scene. Is there anywhere in Dallas where I can find these types of people or venues that usually put on these types of shows?

I am keeping those important to me, but wanted to give the rest away. Though, I can't come around to just throwing them out. Sharing with family is not an option as there are no ties.

The family member/artist was very involved in the local arts &amp; culture community (her pieces were in exhibits, she taught workshops around the city including SMU) but I don't have any contacts anymore from that time to reach out to, to see if they'd be interested in taking her items.

1613,1613,HalfricanAmericanMan,1581961435,f5cf6n,Nan,"I‚Äôve been riding DART for many years. I‚Äôve rode all bus lines, trains, etc. The employees for DART are some of the laziest, angriest, rudest, apathetic, hateful people the city of Dallas has to offer. 

They consistently ignore crimes that happen on the bus directly in front of them. They could give a shit less about any of the homeless falling asleep or doing drugs on the trains. But holy shit will they make sure that fare is being enforced. That is, if you‚Äôre a working class person from morning-afternoon. 

The evening? Not only will there be no fare enforcement, there will be no police supervision whatsoever. The most dangerous hours for DART are the hours in which no law enforcement is present. 

I‚Äôve watched these bus drivers *gleefully* roll past me not even checking to see if anyone as at a stop. Train conductors have sat **idling** refusing to open the doors to let people in. They have zero compassion for the people who use this service. 

And before you say ‚Äúwell they have a schedule to keep‚Äù no in the fuck they don‚Äôt. The buses arrive anywhere from 15 min before the stop to almost 20 min after. There is no fucking schedule, they are basically getting there whenever they feel like getting there. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs hailing outside or 200 degrees. They could give a shit less. 

Every bus driver and train conductor I‚Äôve ever attempted to speak to has been nothing but rude to me. They act like they hate their entire lives and they hate their job. All I ever get is scowls, half answers, and no eye contact. Customer service is not even a concern for DART, let‚Äôs be honest. 

Oh and don‚Äôt try complaining or calling help lines to get any accountability for any of these clowns‚Äô behavior. You‚Äôll just get hung up on, put on hold indefinitely, or get a complaint ‚Äúlogged‚Äù and never see any change. Does it matter they are consistently making you late for work? DART could give a shit less if you‚Äôre fired over their incompetence. 

I just needed to vent on wildly incompetent, uncaring and shittacular Dallas public transit is. It‚Äôs a nightmare. And God help you if you‚Äôre a woman alone trying to use the bus! I‚Äôd bring a gun.",Dallas,The employees for DART are literal piles of human garbage.

## RangeWater Real Estate plans building off Greenville Avenue.

An Atlanta developer is giving a first look at the rental community it will build in Dallas‚Äô Lower Greenville neighborhood.

RangeWater Real Estate purchased a 1.25-acre vacant site last month in the 5700 block of Richmond Avenue just off Greenville. The property is across the street from the Sam‚Äôs Club store and was formerly the site of Pietro‚Äôs restaurant.

RangeWater plans to build an eight-story, 236-unit apartment block on the tract. The rental community will be within walking distance of restaurants and shops along Greenville.

‚ÄúLowest Greenville has experienced great change over the last decade,‚Äù Nick Wilhelmson, RangeWater‚Äôs managing director of Texas, said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now one of Dallas‚Äô hottest places to live and visit.

‚ÄúOur Greenville and Richmond project is well positioned to enhance the neighborhood with its timeless architecture, luxury units and new residents who will enjoy walkable city living.‚Äù

Scheduled to open in early 2022, the first three floors of the building will have apartments similar to brownstones in older cities.

The building will step back above the third floor with a terrace featuring views of downtown. There will also be a pedestrian plaza at the entry and a private pool deck.

Formerly known as Pollack Shores, RangeWater is already building a 240-unit rental community on Ross Avenue just east of downtown ‚Äî the developer‚Äôs first project in North Texas.

‚ÄúOur investments in East Dallas will create experiences and housing options that benefit the entire area,‚Äù said Steven Shores, CEO and president of RangeWater.

Founded in 2006, RangeWater has acquired and developed more than 26,000 multifamily projects out of its offices in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and Tampa.

RangeWater is expanding its operations with new projects on the way in Austin, Dallas, Denver and Phoenix.

1853,1853,JustMeInBigD,1582527130,f8ne41,Nan,"I started a Meetup group called [Making Friends in Big D](https://www.meetup.com/Making-Friends-in-Big-D/) at the end of December, and in less than 2 months it has grown to over 300 members. We've had 6 events so far, with 2 more on the calendar and a couple more will be scheduled soon. I'd really like to take advantage of this momentum, but Meetup requires that a host be present at every event, and I can only fit so much into my schedule. 

I wonder if some outgoing and dependable people would be interested in hosting events for my group. In particular, I'd like to find someone to host in the Frisco area and or other northern suburbs. I also see a need for an (any area) interest group for men in their 20s and 30s with activities that don't center around drinking.

The focus of my group is primarily meeting people and making friends but also has a focus on discovering what Dallas (and the surrounding area) has to offer in the way of entertainment that's not just eating and drinking.

I won't be able to pay hosts, but there are plenty of nontangible benefits to hosting a group. It's not a huge commitment, especially if you plan events that you yourself would enjoy going to.

Ideally, you'd be members and hosts in my group, but my subscription pays for three groups and I'm only running one, so I could potentially ""subsidize"" a second and or third group if you have a clear vision for a group you want to run.

^(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)

I'm freaking out a bit, honestly. I have known about this all day but I spent that time researching before posting. He is located in Dallas, TX.

**He does NOT have influenza** (tested negative for both a and b).

He said the doctor said ""it's probably bacterial."" But the doctor also recorded this impression:

&gt;Patchy, diffuse peripherally oriented ground glass opacities predominately within the upper lobes which are nonspecific but can be seen in the setting of early multifocal pneumonia, viral pneumonia, inhalation pneumonia, and other atypical processes.

He told me he was going to work today and my jaw dropped. He said he asked the doctor about working and the doctor told him he should rest but it would be fine if he went in. He works in the food service industry. I convinced him not to go.

I asked him if he asked about a test for COVID-19 (we have talked extensively about it before). He said he let them know about the possibility of him having it and they did not because his problem is 'breathing deeply and coughs that follow.'

**He was given a CT Scan with the following results:**

&gt;**LUNGS**  
&gt;  
&gt;There are faint mostly peripheral ground glass opacities predominantly within bilateral upper lobes with faint positive ground glass opacities in the lower lobes. Near the lung apices there are patchy peribronchovascular ground glass opacities. There is no mass or overt consolidation.

Pleural spaces, heart and mediastinum, lymph nodes, chest wall and upper abdomen, and bones were fine.

I am concerned, obviously, for many reasons. The CT Scan research I've done on COVID-19 reeks of similarities.

&gt;Typical CT findings of COVID-19 include peripherally distributed multifocal ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with patchy consolidations and posterior part or lower lobe involvement predilection  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/pdf/10.1148/radiol.2020200490](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/pdf/10.1148/radiol.2020200490)  
&gt;  
&gt;In conclusion, COVID-19 pneumonia tends to manifest on lung CT scans as bilateral, subpleural, ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms, ill-defined margins, and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe. Abnormal lung CT findings can be present even in asymptomatic patients, and lesions can rapidly evolve into a diffuse ground-glass opacity predominance or consolidation pattern within 1‚Äì3 weeks after onset of symptoms, peaking at around 2 weeks after onset.  
&gt;

I also thought it was customary to test for COVID-19 if the flu test turned up negative. He gave no indication that that would happen.

**He was treated in the hospital with:**

* **ALBUTEROL (VENTOLIN) 0.083% INH SOLN 2.5 MG / 3 ML GIVEN:** 2.5 mg Nebulization (15:38)

**And was given the following prescriptions:**

* **Omnicef**: Antibiotic¬†in a group of drugs called cephalosporin (SEF a low spor in) antibiotics. It works by fighting bacteria in your body.¬†
* **Prednisone**: A steroid that prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. It also suppresses the immune system.
* **Tessalon**: A non-narcotic cough medicine that numbs the throat and lungs, making the cough reflex less active.¬†
* **Albuterol**: A bronchodilator that relaxes muscles in the airways and increases air flow to the lungs.¬†
* **Ibuprofen**: A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.¬†
* **Azithromycin**: An antibiotic that fights bacteria.¬†Azithromycin¬†is used to treat many different types of infections caused by bacteria.

I asked why he was given/prescribed cough medicine, as I've read you should not take these so that you can rid the lungs of mucus. He said, ""it was because of the collapsed areas of my lungs, or small airways, that would have a hard time pushing air through.""

Anyway, there's not a whole lot I can do. I'm going to ask him again, when he wakes up, to call the doctor to see if they can test for COVID-19, or if they were going to send the samples to the CDC.

# UPDATE

I spoke with him again. He advised that the doctors did not take any extra precautions, mostly just wore gloves. But also shook his hand without gloves on.

**02/16/2020** \- Visited Urgent Care for cough/breathing trouble. They did PFT and CT Scan for lungs. Diagnosed with Acute Upper Respiratory Infection- Unspecified. Gave him a printed wiki document on Pleurisy. He was given medications: **Prednisone** (steroid) and **Benzonatate** (cough).

**02/29/2020** \- Visited ER for increased breathing trouble. They did a CT Scan, IV meds, prescriptions (notes above).

Here is his Chest CT Scan:

***Updated at 8:10 p.m.:*** *Revised to include a statement from the Dallas County Sheriff‚Äôs Department.*

Five Dallas police officers were told to stay home temporarily after arresting a man whom jail officers later reported had a ‚Äúpossible case of COVID-19‚Äù on Sunday.

Parkland Hospital officials also confirmed on Monday they were monitoring the 24-year-old ‚Äúout of an abundance of caution.‚Äù

All five officers who came in contact with the person they arrested ‚Äúwere notified of the potential exposure and given a day off for precautionary reasons,‚Äù according to a Dallas police statement. The officers are expected to return to work at their next tour of duty, police said.

‚ÄúPer our contagious disease policy, all five officers that came in contact with the arrested person were notified of the potential exposure and advised not to return to work until further notice,‚Äù the police statement said.

At about 9 a.m. Sunday, Dallas officers responded to a disturbance call at an East Dallas apartment. When officers arrived, Dallas Fire and Rescue had taken the 24-year-old man to a local hospital for injuries he sustained from an assault, according to a Dallas police statement.

Medical staff treated the man and released him back to Dallas officers, who drove him to jail and charged him with assault of a family member, police said.

At around 10:30 p.m., jail officers notified Dallas police of a possible case of COVID-19 involving the man, who was taken by private ambulance to Parkland Hospital.

A Parkland spokesperson confirmed that the 24-year-old suspect was taken to the hospital. ‚ÄúWe are monitoring the person for symptoms out of an abundance of caution,‚Äù April Foran said. ‚ÄúWe cannot offer comment beyond those facts.‚Äù

The Dallas County Sheriff‚Äôs Department, which oversees the jail, said in a statement that it has ‚Äúan extensive intake screening process,‚Äù which was recently updated over concerns related to the virus outbreak.

‚ÄúThere has not been and are not currently any cases of the Coronavirus in the Dallas County Jail,‚Äù the sheriff‚Äôs department said.

Mike Mata, president of the Dallas Police Association, said Monday evening that the suspect knew he could stay out of jail by claiming to be sick.

When doctors examined him, Mata said, ‚Äúthe suspect had no indication of being ill. His claim had no merit.‚Äù

The squad cars involved in the man‚Äôs arrest were immediately removed from service for cleaning, police said.

Members of the department are currently working with medical professionals to draft a protocol to ensure officer safety.

I also come with excellent references. I have had wonderful and fulfilling relationships with all of the families and kids with whom I‚Äôve worked!

2135,2135,Roorem10,1583208433,fcoy7c,Question,"As a new 18 year old and a soon to be high-school graduate there are a lot of questions for my life ahead. What degree should I pursue? What college should I go to? *Should I even go to college?...* Honestly, for the last year I've been racking my head about my future... I don't want to go into student loan debt, but I also don't want to miss out on a good-paying or entertaining job due to ""lack of education""... 

All this leads into my question for the community; Are you interested in ""Nerdy"" things? 

I've always been a fan of things like Anime, Manga, Light Novels, Video Games, Technology... And it's always been in the back of my mind that I'd want to work in one of these fields... that it would be my ""dream job"". Last night a thought occurred to me; ""I could open a store that focuses on my passions..."" Imagine a place where you could chill out on a beanbag reading a book while the person next to you is  recommending their favorite show to a stranger... a vending machine next to a wall of computers, consoles, and video games. You like that book you were reading? Did that video game catch your eye? you can buy them! 

I've been saving money for years, both from my parents and a part-time job... and it all comes to this; If I were to open a shop like this in the DFW area would any of you be interested? Would I be able to make this my career? Kinokuniya and others exist here so the market is there... but would I be able to get the same turnout?",Dallas,"Question for the community: Are you interested in ""Nerdy"" things?"

No sob story. I made the right decisions to get away from toxic people and am doing the best things for myself long term.

The mods have talked it over and we are going to trial run removing rule 9, the one that talks about posting lost/found pets goes into /r/DFWPets and selling/buying pets goes into /r/DFWClassifieds. The goal of course of the rule was to make sure /r/Dallas was not flooded with pet related posts but there's been fewer post pet posts. Just make sure to post as much details as you can (if they're chipped, what measures you've taken to find them, where they were last seen, etc) to help everyone out. Heads up, I probably won't be able to physically remove the rule from the sidebar until after work, so hang tight. 

Second, here's a friendly reminder to follow to community rules, especially the first one:

&gt; **1.Personal Attacks, Name-Calling, Harassment, Flaming, and Trolling**  
&gt;  
&gt;Personal attacks, name-calling, harassment, flaming, and trolling are not tolerated in this community. Trolling is defined as creating discord on the internet by starting quarrels or upsetting people by posting inflammatory or off-topic messages in an online community.

2164,2164,airb0t,1583270013,fd1mj2,Nan,"First I want to say that I am not looking for anything with this post. I've posted here looking for help, advice and guidance. I am posting this to summarize everything that has happened and to update everyone who has asked that I keep them updated.

 I initially posted on here looking for advice when I found myself in the brink of being literally homeless with a cat that I adore. Last year I was hospitalized for 3 months, 3 weeks of which in the ICU, do to a massive and systemic infection. The infection had gotten into my bloodstream and I was septic. The doctors told me I nearly died twice while in the ICU. The origin of the infection came from a trip I took to the Rocky Mountains on my motorcycle to do some camping and exploring. I slid down a ravine and cut my leg. It was medium severe, but I got it bandaged up and carried on. In hindsight I should have sought medical advice then. 

At the time I had a job working from home and went on medical leave while in the hospital. While I was away the company was sold and a large corporate re organization took place. Upon returning to work I had an entirely new team as well as management. A little over two months later I was laid off. During the time I was in the hospital I was on unpaid leave (after I used all of my available PTO). Things had been extremely close financially and I had just begun to get some of the critical items like rent, utilities, car insurance etc back in line when I was let go. All of this snowballed and I found myself being evicted with virtually no money to fall back on. 

While looking for a job in my field wasn't going so well, I applied for a job that was described as ""loading 16 foot trucks for deliveries"". It turned out that this also involved driving said trucks to make deliveries, they had mistakenly truncated the job description. This wasn't brought to my attention until the second day. Due to an expired driver's license that job expired immediately. I had moved to a hotel in the Irving area that was near the company I had been working for, and immediately went out applying / asking for jobs at any local company I could find that was hiring. After managing to find a job it seemed that things would be getting back to somewhat stable as soon as the paychecks started coming in. 

This morning the manager / director of operations called in all of the employees who are assigned to work on the client team I had been hired into. The companies contract had been under review for lots of performance related issues, this is the reason they had been hiring several extra employees and how I got a job. The metrics that the firm had been required to meet to get the contract renewed and continue working with that client had been missed and the contract pulled. Everyone was told we would receive our final checks at the end of the week and escorted outside. 

I am essentially back to where I was when this entire ordeal began. In a hotel with a cat and no idea what the hell I'm going to do going forward. 

With all of that said, I have been blessed to meet and receive help of all kinds from what I can only describe as a group of amazing human beings. The amount of support and encouragement has been truly mind boggling. I find that people use the phrase ""faith in humanity restored"" quite often, and I had never really appreciated what that could mean. And then I had random internet strangers reaching out to give me, someone they didn't know, and may never actually ever meet in person, a hand up when everything was down. I can say honestly that the amazing people I met because of this subreddit have literally saved my life. 

Thank you to everyone who has commented or messaged with advice, suggestions, help, or just a kind word when it seemed that everything was dark and I didn't have any hope.

2222,2222,itsdrpac,1583410813,fdufs9,Nan,"Red Pegasus Comics should pack their things and LEAVE Oak Cliff.  Especially after the nonsense they put me trough at some point, including Kenneth Denson telling me on my face to ""get the fuck out of his property"" after he goaded one of his little friends to call me one Saturday morning and visit their store just to say that to my face.  All of this after making up lies about customers complaining about me when I don't even work for that store, which was a petty excuse to try and hide any real reason as to why he wanted to, messes with me like that.  In all the times I've visited this store as A CUSTOMER, I have not once ever started anything with employees and other customers alike, and even had bought merchandise they would sell there, being a comic book store close to my own home and all.  

All that was changing once I noticed those two owning that place glaring at me and even ignoring me whenever I visited that place, instead greeting anyone else who visited.  Kenneth would mention that while being an asshole to my face, saying I was saying ""mean things"" about them on facebook when I didn't even followed their accounts and would just check their page about events they would bring up, not once posting anything demeaning in such.

Red Pegasus Comics has lied about such events, even going as far as stating that I ""hate gay people"" starting rumors about such including to members of the Dallas Public Library, on which the Director is supportive of the LGTBQ group.  It was quite relevant when all of the sudden some mock account would include such accusations on a post related to said Library and that was not related to what happened in that comics store.  This let me to believe people owning this store would go out of their way to spread false rumors about me even after the fact they did me wrong to begin with.

The owners of this store also could care less about our community in Dallas, claiming at first that they stood behind the opposition of kicking residents off their homes at the Bishop Arts Area to make way for extravagant apartment buildings and shops, themselves setting in said location shortly afterwards.  They are liars and posers at this point and it‚Äôs obvious if their business isn't affected they could care less about customers living within said area overall.

Some of their friends include a neurotic old man who goes off to just any customer, including KIDS who join in their tabletop games.  When confronted to Kenneth about it he would just shrug and laugh about it.

Mobile once advised them for wrongfully using their red Pegasus logo, to which they quickly complied in changing its appearance.  They could have gotten away with copyright infringement this being the case.  Red Pegasus Comics claims to love Dallas, but the fact is they love money more than anything else and self preservation.  

Many praise them and write positive reviews about their store, some which come out as suspicious, but the point is you cannot ignore wrongdoing from these people expecting anything positive from them after what I presented.  This is not just about me, it‚Äôs about customer mistreatment and indifference towards such, especially we who live in the same area they DECIDED to set up shop in.

They need to claim responsibility for their actions and stop trying to appeal t obeying victims of anything.  They need to move the fuck out our community overall.  And I am quoting Kenneth's own words at me, not being the one using such for the first time.",Dallas,Red Pegasus Comics need to LEAVE Oak Cliff.

His plan is to not come back to the US - so this leads me to the question of how to fill out the following sections on the Application for Travel Document Form. It asks ""Date of Intended Departure"", ""Expected Length of Stay"", as well as ""Purpose of trip"".

As for Date of Intended Departure, that will depend upon when he gets this Travel Document approved and sent to him. For Expected Length of Stay, it will be permanent, but do we state this on the form? And for Purpose of trip, do we state honestly that it is for him to return to Thailand/Myanmar permanently?

For context, he left his country after the police put him in jail for 3 years for protesting for a Democracy in his country, and the US Embassy rescued him from jail, and put him in a Refugee Camp for 2 years, and then he was sent to the US. His family all resides in his home country (mother, father, and 5 sisters), whom he wishes to return to. He is homeless here in the US and was a middle school teacher in his home country. His name is Maung and is such a kind and lovely man who has seen and been through a lot, and his family wants him to come back to his home. His family says that the country is much better now, with a different president - so it is safe for him to return.

* I got there at 10 AM and left at 4:30 PM. (partly my fault)
* The online form I'd filled out was outdated.
* The option to get in line online didn't work. 
*  Allow 3-4 full hours to get this done

Because I renewed online last time, I was notified via mail that I would need to renew in person this time. I began researching my options and found that no matter what address I used (work in Las Colinas or home near Victory Park) the only option near me was the mega center in south Dallas. I decided to take my chances there with a strategy of middle of the day, middle of the week. 

Before going to renew my license, I researched all of the options and required documents online. I found that I could fill out all of the paperwork before arriving, that there was an option to virtually get in line, and that I'd need my driver's license and a birth certificate. I got busy filling everything out, scheduling some time away from the office, and gathering the required paperwork. 

Wednesday morning, before heading to the ""mega center"", I got online and tried repeatedly to check-in virtually. Each time I tried, I was denied access and told no spots were available. I decided to leave a little early (just in case) and that I'd keep trying on my phone. I was never able to use this function. 

I arrived at 10 AM -ish and the place was PACKED. I checked in and was immediately informed that the forms on the website are outdated and that I'd need to get one of the new, updated forms and fill out all of the paperwork again by hand. I'll let you imagine how I greeted that news. Nonetheless, it was a long wait so I didn't argue. I found a pen and place to sit and began filling out the paperwork all over again. 

After I'd waited two full hours, I began getting very nervous. The one meeting I absolutely could not miss that day was at 12:30. I'd been waiting for two hours and was still 50 spots away from being called. At 12:25 PM I went to my car to take my 12:30 call. The call was over at approximately 1:45 PM and, of course, my number had been called. I would add here that if there had been some way to monitor where they were (an app or website or something) I would've excused myself from the call and run inside. Unfortunately, that's not an option. 

I did briefly attempt to plead my case but they weren't having it. I get it, I'm not special and need to play by the rules. So I started over. Just before 2 PM I pulled another number and began the wait again. 

At approximately 4:10 PM my number was called and I left the ""mega center"" at roughly 4:30 PM. I was given a temporary license and told my new DL will be mailed to me in a couple of weeks. 

I will say - anecdotally - that I noticed the closer they got to closing time, the faster that line moved.",Dallas,"I had to renew my Texas driver's license in person this year. I utilized the ""mega center"" in south Dallas. This was my experience."

2308,2308,Rotorist,1583687852,ffflil,Nan,"Besides bashing the government for the incompetency - which we will continue to do. I do understand the rule that any outbreak related topic should be in the discussion thread, but I just wanted to start a separate thread about taking actions.

I have followed the state of the outbreak since January before the Chinese officially announced it, including all the official statements, rumors, first-hand accounts, and everyone's opinions. And I think this is the first thing everyone should do. Right now we are told to only trust ""reputable"" sources, i.e. the government of the US, the Chinese government, and WHO. The problem is that the virus is *new*, so scientist know very little about it - how it transmits, what long term effects it has on our body, how we can possibly fight back. Without concrete evidence and research data, the government cannot irresponsibly make calls and publish statements, but it doesn't mean the information is not out there. With time running low, we have to do more than just watching the news. Educate yourself with whatever information you can gather and use your *best judgement*. 

What both China and Italy have experienced is the biggest impact this plague has on us: the over-saturation of medical resources. Sure, the case fatality rate is very low for young people, but the 20% severe cases that require hospitalization will quickly fill up the hospitals. Moreover, some of the 80% less-than-severe patients may get worse without closely-monitored treatment and move into the 20%. So if the hospitals beds and ICUs are all filled with covid patients, what happens to uninfected people who needs intensive care? It's not just that, once the medical staff is also infected with the disease, that is further reduction of medical resources. With all the strict measures put in place in Hubei and all the medical staff wearing full protection gears, China still has to send tens of thousands of doctors and nurses to Hubei to help, which means everyone else in the country, with the virus or not, would have less medical resources to share. Patients with chronic heart, kidney, blood disorders and tumors were stripped of care which their life depended on. Here in Dallas, I cannot stress more how important it is to keep our medical staff protected, them and their family. We don't want them to be martyrs and sacrifice - we want them to ride out the plague nice and easy like the rest of us. So, if you are a medical staff, please please petition your employer to provide proper training and protection. 

As for the rest of the Dallasites - we should do our best to protect ourselves to avoid further burdening the medical system. 

- DRIVE SAFE. Don't do anything crazy that puts you in harm's way. 

- Stay home. Party less, go out less, and eat out less. Think twice before going to a place with a lot of people. 

- If you can afford to work from home, please do so. 

- Don't panic buy or over-stocking. Unless our government has the power of the CCP and can lock down the entire city with no-one coming in and out, the logistics system won't be impacted much, so goods will continue to come in. But if we all try to overstock then the city stops functioning right away.

- Now it's the time to ramp up on personal hygiene. [Learn to wash your hands properly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IisgnbMfKvI), and be very patient with it. Don't eat, or touch anywhere on your face until you are sure your hands are clean. Treat your hands like how you treat your firearm - always assume it's loaded and has a round in the chamber.

- If you are having any virus-shedding symptoms that produce droplets, try to avoid going out, and [cover your sneeze/cough with clothing.](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/etiquette/coughing_sneezing.html).

- If you have school-age kids, take extra precaution to educate them about hygiene. These kids are still developing their immune system, so if they are infected with the virus, they are much more likely to bring it home and spread across the community. 

- Keep your immune system at its best with proper nutrition, eat healthy, take your vitamins, rest well, avoid fatigue. 

- Finally, again, educate, educate, educate. Educate yourself and those around you, raise awareness so people stop believing it's ""just a bad flu"". 

At this point in time, the containment stage is over. We can't contain it any more. It's gonna spread here in Dallas. But what we can do, through the actions above, is to slow and delay the spread. The key characteristic of COVID-19 is that the survival depends heavily on the quality of medical care. If we manage to smooth it out over time then our city (and probably our retirement account) will likely survival with as little damage as possible.",Dallas,"What we can do today, right now, here in Dallas"

(This trip will be just me, myself, and I). This is my first time flying into Dallas (April 9th AM, fly out April 12th AM), and I am wondering about the cheapest modes of transportation. The main thing I want to see here is the Dallas Renegades game. I don't care about places to stay, I just want the cheapest way to get to the game, while also being able to see and hang out in downtown Dallas. 

I am considering a few options: 

1.) Stay in the Deep Ellum Hostel and just take Ubers everywhere.

2.) Stay in the Super 8 near DFW, while still taking Ubers.

3.). Getting a rental car through Turo (or some other site), and driving either from Super 8 or Deep Ellum Hostel to see the game (while still wanting to experience downtown). 

Any hints, tips, or tricks would be great! I am a 25 year old male, so I doubt walking a fair distance would be a deterrent for anything. As I look into car rentals, are there cheap or free parking options downtown, especially if I am staying at the hostel (which doesn't have free parking).",Dallas,Transportation Costs in Arlington vs Downtown Dallas (Deep Ellum)

Failure to pull the appropriate permits and adhere to building code can result in a difficulties when you go to sell, fines from the city for non-compliance and even potentially the loss of your home's certificate of occupancy!

Hello everyone. It's been a long time since my original post but in case any of you remembered, I wanted to give an update. 

People often give advice but it is rarely taken. In this case, your advice was taken. Long story short, right after the post Chay lied to his mom and came home drunk driving. 

Because of the thread, I had pre-loaded her with the information everyone helped me with on the voluntarily ignition lock system. In a rage, she booked an immediate installation and before my cousin was awake it was installed. Absolutely no drunk driving could happen. 

Shortly after, in a turn of events, he had a child and got his life together in a way people really wouldn't believe. It's been 5 years and a kid and marriage later, he's a different, responsible, hard working, person. 

People change AND people listen to advice. Who would have thought it? 

Thanks /r/Dallas - My cousin is no longer driving drunk! And, to any of you in the same situation, that voluntary ignition interlock thing is AWESOME. He couldn't even go to work the next day if he drank the night before. The embarrassment and the rest really has the potential to work!",Dallas,[Update] How can I stop my drunk cousin from driving around DFW?

My name is Sam. I was recently hired Ford's Recall Specialist team and I am scheduling anyone with a Ford airbag recall to come in to the dealer and have it repaired free of charge.

I can also come out to your home or work place to repair on-site for your safety and convenience. The repairs take about 15 to 30 min depending on the vehicle and once again, this is completely **FREE**.

For more information you can visit
[AIRBAGRECALL.COM](http://AIRBAGRECALL.COM/)
Or
[Fordairbaginfo.com](http://fordairbaginfo.com/)

You can also download an app called Airbag Recall, but punch in your license plate or VIN number and this will let you know if your vehicle is affected by these Recalls. This issue affected all major manufacturers, not only Ford. 

The vehicles affected by this recall that we can repair on site range from:
2004-2011 Ford Rangers
2006-2014 Ford Mustangs 

These air bags, manufactured by TAKATA, are extremely dangerous. They have already taken 15 lives in the United States and injured many more. A quick Google search will show you the results of deploying these defective airbags. 

Feel free to PM me for more information or to schedule an appointment. I normally work the Arlington, Irving and Grand Prairie areas, but can still assist you if you live anywhere else in the DFW area.",Dallas,Ford Airbag Recall - Free at home/work repair

2571,2571,CalicoJake,1584199541,fik0o2,Nan,"After reading the post by @jv360, an idea has been brewing in my mind all morning.

The gist is this: There are likely many elderly people who dont want to risk going to the grocery store (or simply cant go) as well as single parents who dont want to take their kids to the store, but cant leave them home alone either. However, elderly people dont use reddit much, but they do watch the nightly news. So maybe there is a way to set up a hotline for people to call so that someone else can help with deliveries or other things.

I know many grocery stores have home delivery options, but many elderly people dont have computers or may not know how to set up accounts online for something like that. However, a hotline phone number with someone who could help them set it up would work. Also, there are often other things that people need, which are not ordinarily delivered.

Although this virus will likely fade away after a month or so, there are people in the community right now who are vulnerable or will likely need help. With colleges and high schools closing down and many of us working from home, maybe we can put something together. Ideally, we can create a repeatable model that other communities can set up as well.",Dallas,An Idea for the Community to Support the Elderly or Single Parents

Your provider is now able to ‚Äúsee you‚Äù for your visit by having a telephone call as of the Texas Medical Board e-mail sent out this morning. DO NOT leave unless you really need to. This means all people who have refill appoints, general appointments not really requiring physical exams - so all your diabetes, blood pressure meds, psych appts can be done from home for unknown period of time in the next coming weeks or months. This has been done to avoid contact with providers as well as risk to the patients from being outside and encountering covid. PLEASE do not abuse this system. We ask that only patients that really do not need a physical exam during your visit request such changes. It‚Äôs likely your office will be also calling you to inform you that your visit has now been changed into a ‚Äútelevisit‚Äù if we feel your condition is appropriate to be handled with a phone call during your appointment time. 

As a reminder please do not go to ER with symptoms of Covid as the ERs at this time are overwhelmed in the Dallas area already. Please be vigilant and we are facing a REAL horrific threat in the next coming weeks and months. All providers are taking this very seriously and trying our best to take care of you and your family. At this time 2 Emergency Medicine physicians are in critical condition from Covid and this is just the beginning. https://www.acep.org/corona/covid-19-articles/a-statement-from-acep-president-william-jaquis-md-facep/

As someone who has shown symptoms since Friday, and has a test scheduled for tuesday morning, the earliest available to me; I have been waiting for updates from the national and state leadership regarding further precautions. My line of work put me in contact with hundreds of international travelers in the early days of the outbreak. Despite this fact, when I originally went to get tested upon showing symptoms, i was told i would only be given a test if i had, myself, travelled internationally, or come into contact with a confirmed case. The issue here is the complete lack of testing. How is it possible to know who has it if there are no tests being done? The lack of rapid response here in Texas will rear its head once adequate testing becomes available, if it ever does. Call me an alarmist, but this states non essential business should have been shut down already. The fact that 3 days have gone by with no sign of change in state precautions, no new information from state or national leaders, and the persistent lack of testing, raises much concern for the weeks to come. Stay safe folks, the quickest response comes from you; because as of right now it appears our leadership is stagnant on the issue.",Dallas,The silence is deafening.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like, this is all part of life. This virus situation in general will change day to day.

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

2904,2904,D_Z_A,1584676780,flobt6,Discussion,"Can we discuss how isolating the suburbs of Dallas are? i moved here from the east coast two years ago to work for a tech company in the Plano/Richardson area. For a long time, I have wanted to change something about my life situation, as I am not happy and feel very unable to live the lifestyle i want living in Plano. I am active, young, and love going out and being out and about. Its very monotonous the life i live here, often because there is not much to around Plano. My work is very technical so taking breaks and enjoying the good parts of life are necessary to my mental health and what drives me to work. I am no stranger to depression, but living in these suburbs it can be very easy for me to not want to socialize regularly, which is very unlike my true self. It is SO hard to make genuine friends around here and not just a random joe at a bar. Every time i visit Dallas i explore more and more, museums, parks, etc. and enjoy the downtown scene quite a lot/have wonderful conversations. I would very much like to move to Dallas or SOMEWHERE where there is the typical city life and things to do. Dallas sounds like the best option.

I work from home quite often, but now that corona virus is starting to take its toll, i am completely WFH. 

This answers the question i have been wondering to myself: ""can i work fully remote, or 60-100% remote and perform just as well?"" and the answer is yes. As i have been working straight out of college using my degree in my field for the past two years i am very confident i can get my work done without impact to my performance. I have the resources I need to get my work done.

I am also starting to convince myself that living in Dallas would only be positive for my work/life balance if done correctly. The idea thrills me. I don't want to waste away my 20s working in the office and having 0 social life.

I have not had a conversation with my manager about this yet but it is apparent that he knows i like WFH more than coming in office, and i think i might consider forming a plan to let him know this is something i really want to do. Also, WFH in my position is not rare for workers that have families and things to take care of at home, but i am single and have 0 ties besides caring for myself.

Any suggestions on how to go about that conversation, or any tips/thoughts/insight on my situation in general? AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT CANT STAND THIS SUBURBAN HELL? seeking advice.

One idea i am having as i am writing this is: I should be documenting my work and performance as much as i can as a means to prove that i can do my job remote? this would mean proving i can work remotely 100%, how i would be very willing to compromise to even 50 percent WFH if that means i could live in Dallas.

I live in far north DFW close to Plano (not far from Preston/Frankford) and used to live in Allen.

We agreed that they were the best and most-faithful actual-deep-dish-pizza either of us have had outside of Chicago (not that we've hunted super-hard). Most other places seem to just thicken the outer crust and put on a bit more cheese and sauce; this pizza took \~45mins to cook and was like 2 inches thick. Woo.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anywhere around north DFW that does this? Delivery possibility (either directly or through Doordash or whatever) is preferred, since I'll be getting the place/table/stuff ready for her before she gets home around \~5:30p, but I'm also not opposed to going and picking it up, myself.

[5:46 p.m.] The Texas Supreme Court issued an order Thursday halting eviction proceedings statewide until April 19, effective immediately. At the end of the period, the chief justice can choose to renew the order.

There is one exception: Landlords may proceed with eviction cases only if the actions of the occupants ‚Äúpose an imminent threat‚Äù of physical harm to the landlord, the landlord‚Äôs employees or other tenants, or if the occupants are engaging in criminal activity.

Officials in San Antonio, in Harris and Travis counties, and elsewhere in the state have already placed a moratorium on evictions, and some have suspended utility shutoffs. This move by the court is part of Texas‚Äô recent turn to statewide policies in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and stands in contrast with Gov. Greg Abbott‚Äôs previous patchwork approach. ‚Äî Naomi Andu

&gt;
As you all have seen, we are trying to send out as much communication as possible to keep people informed of our ever-changing environment. There are people who still have questions, and I wanted to send out a communication that would hopefully be as clear as possible. There are three missions --and three missions only-- that we are trying to achieve right now. They are:
&gt;
1. Fulfill the needs of the public through this pandemic (it is clear that people are counting on us right now for what they deem as essentials).
&gt;
2. Ensure that we can cover our staff financially and with benefits as long as possible, regardless of how bad this gets. (No one knows how long this is going to last and we are doing everything we can to prepare for the worst.) We believe we will outlast most every other businesses in the long-term.
&gt;
3. Keep our staff as safe, secure, and healthy as possible while we do the first two things.
&gt;
We have been in communication with our local health departments in each region and have followed their guidance directly.
&gt;
We have been in communication with the local governments in all of our regions and the local governments in ***each*** region considers us an ""essential business"" to the community, much like a grocery store because of the items we carry (particularly appliances and electronics). The local government in each region wants us to stay open as long as possible to serve the public. That is why we are working with them regularly on what we need to do to keep people safe. This is a very dynamic situation that has never happened in the world before. The situation changes literally by the minute, and we are staying nimble to be able to react very quickly to the ever-changing environment. We are consistently in communication with other businesses to determine best practices while always trying to fulfill the three missions above.
&gt;
Even in California where they have shut down the state, Home Depot is considered an ""essential business"" and they are open. If any governor in any of our regions shuts down the state, we will make a determination whether we should stay open, but the government up to this point wants us to stay open if that happens.
&gt;
Every decision we make is not made in a bubble or based on social media or what is in the news. It is based on communication with health officials, local government, and at the root...the three missions we believe to be critical above. I cannot thank you enough for helping us achieve these things. Anyone who thinks that we are ""staying open for the money"" has no idea the long-term cost of this. We simply want to stand by our customers and our staff in one of the most critical times in our worlds history. That's it!!!!
&gt;
I hope this communication clears up a lot of our strategy and what your leadership team has been working on literally night and day for the last two weeks.  We are happy to answer any questions at any time. I would ask that you communicate with your specific Director since they have been involved in ever meeting to strategize this mission.
&gt;
Also, please remember that if you do not feel comfortable in this environment, it is ok to use PTO and your attendance will not be held against you. If you choose to stay home and you are out of PTO you will stay employed, but we cannot pay you since we are trying to protect all employees for as long as possible in case of a shutdown. While there is absolutely no one that is without risk right now, you have to assess your own personal situation at home and with your health to determine what is best for you and your family.
&gt;
People are going to take shots at us.
Unfortunately that is the world we live in. I can assure you that I care much more about our employees and the public we are serving that I do about what uninformed people think our intentions are.
&gt;
&gt;
I love my team!!!

Everyone is so panicked about getting what THEY NEED at the store they are rushing by, reaching over strangers shoulders to grab something off the shelf, etc etc.  

Everyone, the supply chain is fine.  Shelves are empty because idiots are buying as if this is the apocalypse.  This isn't a race to get the last roll of paper towels or laundry detergent that will ever be available!

This is where panic and fear do more to spread the disease.  What you should be doing is waiting patiently for that Mom and her toddler to get their fresh vegetables picked out before getting your own.  If someone is stopped in an aisle looking at things, find another aisle to use to cut to the front/back of the store.  Look through the doors before walking through them in case someone is coming through from the other side.  PAY ATTENTION.

I can't tell you how many people I saw yesterday potentially spread or contract the disease because they were (based on body language and facial experssions) just so scared that they were more focused on getting in and out of the store as fast as possible.  That is a dangerous attitude. 

This is also why we need to be wearing masks in public.  Yes, N95 masks should not be bought/hoarded unless you are working in healthcare or a first responder type situation (or a grocery store employee TBH).  BUT,  there are various cloth surgical masks you can make or buy online that will help.  They don't 100% protect you if someone sneezes or coughs on your face but they do reduce exposure to around 70% ([source](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/best-materials-make-diy-face-mask-virus/)) which is enough for things like going to the store.

The more the disease spreads the longer these quarantine orders will be in place.  Stop crowding stores - go if you need but try to limit to once a week (once every 2 would be better but is not feasible for everyone).  Wear a mask (whether you're sick of not) and try to just send 1 person at a time.  BE PATIENT and wait for others.  Be kind.  If what you need isn't in stock- ask an employee if they have any in the back or just try again on another day.  We're low on bread but I can go a week without it if necessary.  Or I can make some.  

If you're really in need of an out of stock item (like toilet paper or paper towels) check places like Home Depot/Lowes, the Dollar Store or even your local 7-11/corner store.  The smaller the store, the more likely they'll have stock and less people you'll be exposed to.  

When you get in the checkout line, leave 6 ft between you and the person in front of you - this isn't 635 where someone will cut in front of you if you leave too much space between you üòÜ.

I know it is scary out there right now, but we'll get through this faster if everyone will just slow down for a few weeks and be careful when out in public.",Dallas,Slow down and step back at the grocery store y'all! (and wear a mask of some kind)

3090,3090,bemba_radio_bemba,1584932847,fncv0i,News," Although the number of coronavirus cases in Dallas is the most common metric we look at to understand if things are getting better or worse in the city, the data can be misleading due to the small number of tests.

It is very likely that next week we are going to see a big increase in the number of reported cases of coronavirus. Although the increase in cases will be driven by the spread of virus, it will also likely be driven by the increase in tests performed, and the time between taking a test and receiving the results.

Texas is testing significantly more now than it did before. On March 16, the first day of public testing data, we learned that the state had tested a total 1,268 people.¬† As you can see in the chart below, over the past three days, we have tested 2,100 on average every day; a huge improvement.

If you combine the increase in testing with the common 3 - 7 day lag to receive test results, it's likely that we will see a big increase in reported cases shortly driven by the additional tests.

But, this is not all bad. The more tests we perform, the more we know who is infected, and the faster we can control the spread of the virus.

If you want more details on testing data in Texas, below is a link to a more detailed write-up that not only digs deeper into the information, but also compares it to other states.

[What 6 days of coronavirus testing data in Texas are telling us](http://guytweetstoomuch.blogspot.com/2020/03/what-6-days-of-coronavirus-testing-data.html)

Don't forget to practice social distancing, wash your hands, and stay home so we can help reduce the impact of the virus in Dallas.

Stay safe.

This order is supposed to last at least 10 days, likely longer.

My company claims that we qualify as an ‚ÄúEssential Retailer,‚Äù as detailed in the order, and therefore can continue to work through this crisis. But when I asked about this, they responded by copying the law‚Äôs definition of Essential Retailer: ‚ÄúFood service providers...Laundromats...Gas stations...**Businesses that supply products needed for people to work from home.**‚Äù

My question is whether this last line refers to retailers that actually sell laptops/headphones/other communication solutions, or whether it would also include AV integrators, live sound, etc.

To my knowledge, my company doesn‚Äôt sell these types of products, but they do ‚Äúsupply‚Äù products needed for ‚Äúpeople‚Äù to work from home, in that they provided a Company laptop and VPN access to the Company‚Äôs servers, which would allow employees to work from home.

Surely this law is not meant to include businesses who simply give their employees laptops and VPN access?

Though technically it may be legal to go shopping for food, the reality is that the risk of being stopped, ticketed for $1,000, or jailed is non-zero right now, and will be until Clay Jenkins and all PDs in the county specifically state they will not be stopping anyone based on the shelter in place order. Since that won't be happening, and for purposes of trying to flatten the curve that threat of law enforcement cannot be removed, the only way to avoid the chance of being ruined by an arrest and fine is to not leave the home at all. Also, even if you go shopping, you're now exposing yourself to infection by asymptomatic carriers, so again, the only way to avoid infection is to stay home. This means that when food runs out, starvation is going to be a real threat, creating a situation where hunger fights fear of SARS-CoV-2, an untenable situation. The only option left as I see it is distribution of HDR packs to people that need food.

I am trying my best to support my team members and other healthcare professionals still in the field, as well as my fellow high-risk folks, by sewing masks. I'm following a combination of sewing patterns trying to fulfill as many features as I can that various hospital systems have requested, eg. Wire for nose bridge, double layer fabric, elastic ear loops, different sizes, etc. Yes, the CDC has said they are not very effective but it's going to be better than nothing when PPE is completely out and days/weeks away from restocking.

I dropped off my first donation of about 20 masks to my work site, a medical facility, yesterday, and am bringing 20 more today or tomorrow. I have requests from retirement homes through friends and family. I am starting to run low on my supply of fabric and spare pillowcases from my and my parents' households, especially as I've gotten much efficient at making the masks.

If anyone can spare sheets, pillowcases, fabric, elastic, ribbon, thread, wire or any other craft supply you think would be useful, I would greatly appreciate you donating it to me and I will come pick it up next time I make a donation run. (I am especially interested in fitted sheets, as those have a lot of elastic in them.) You can just leave it on the porch and we don't have to interact, I wash everything on high heat as soon as I get home anyways. Dm me or comment if you have questions/ have donations.

&gt;In Dallas County, two mobile testing sites are able to process hundreds of tests each day. Anyone with three COVID-19 symptoms ‚Äî shortness of breath, a cough and a fever of 99.6 degrees or higher ‚Äî can be tested at the sites, at American Airlines Center near downtown Dallas and Ellis Davis Field House in Red Bird.

&gt;On Thursday, the site at American Airline Center **reached its federal daily testing limit about noon.** It will reopen at 8 a.m. Friday. County Judge Clay Jenkins said on Twitter that he was requesting 400 additional testing kits per day for the sites.

My question is this: Why is there a federal limit on the number of tests that can be performed at a testing site on any given day?

 Is it availability of test kits or the capacilty to analyze them? (which would be reasonable but tragic after all the talk about increasing testing levels)

 Or is it some bureaucratic ruling on number of tests allowed to be performed for reasons known only to the bureaucrats? (Which would be totally **not** reasonable and even more tragic).",Dallas,Why are there limits on testing?

However, her leash got caught on the sliding door, causing it to fall which intensified her reaction. She slipped out of her collar and would not come back to me and began to make a run for safety toward our house which is down the road. 

This is where my heart sank. She began running towards Park road and managed to somehow (miraculously) cross it without anybody hitting her. She continued down Plano Parkway where numerous individuals saw her and stopped their cars and blocked oncoming traffic. One kind lady was able to wrangle her and eventually my dog calmed down and allowed me to get her back on her leash.

There's...a lot going on right now. I just wanted to put encouraging words out to all of you, even if I dont know you.

&amp;#x200B;

Its ok to be scared. There are a lot of unknowns, and fear speaks the loudest in the unknown. Adding to that is the frustration that all our questions may not be answered. This is a **hard** place to be, no doubt about it. Living in a world without explanations is an immense challenge. 

Voice those fears. Bring them into the light. Talk to people, tell them what makes you nervous.

Fear is most powerful when it keeps us hidden and isolated. While many of us are physically separated, everyone still has a voice to be heard. If someone isn't asking how you're doing, ask someone if you can tell them how you're doing. Dont stop speaking. Don't hide.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is going to be ok. The world still functions. Farmers are still farming. Doctors and nurses are still need healing. Broken things still need fixing. We are going to be uncomfortable, but we are going to be ok. As a society, as a species, we are smart enough and strong enough, collectively, to make sure we have a future.

But individually, people are hurting and they need help. We cant get through hard times like this ""together"" unless we are reaching out. Share the pain. Pay for someones groceries who can't afford them. Donate sanitizer or toilet paper that you know will last you way too long. Send a funny video or song to someone with kids and give them a 15 minute (virtual) break.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have some stories of how theyve been helped? How have people handled their fears during this time? What can family, friends, strangers, Reddit, do to help you right now?

I took my wife to a Dr. Appointment that just happened to wind us through downtown.  What a surreal experience.  Everything closed, lots of friends wondering how they're going to pay rent this month / next - or if they'll even have a place to go back to when this is over.

I've been wracking my brian on how to help out a bigger audience than just the people I know.  I came up with this idea to build a budget to help people pay some bills until those ""government checks"" start coming.

100% of profits go directly to helping out of work retail/service workers.  If it takes off I'll stay up night and day to kick these out.  Right now I've got enough supplies in my shop to kick out 70.
We'll send one of these to your loved one, one of those out of work retail friends and I will handwrite a note on each jar.

Today distance means love!

&amp;#x200B;

The big difference between a hotel and a short-term rental apartment -

&amp;#x200B;

  \* You have your own AC not like in the cruise ships or in the hotels that the AC is for several rooms                 together

&amp;#x200B;

   \* You keep a safe distance not like in a crowded hotel with employees and guests

&amp;#x200B;

   \* You got your own washer and dryer inside the apartment

&amp;#x200B;

  \*  You got your own kitchen so you can stay home and safe

&amp;#x200B;

  \*  cleanliness of the unit is no doubt much higher than hotels

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any thoughts about other differences I will be happy if you will comment or I will add them to this post

&amp;#x200B;

I recommend using Airbnb oh my way to find the place you want to stay in

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not attaching this referral link cuz I'm not trying to make money! I'm just trying to make a point that it's better to stay in an apartment and it will be great to support the short term rental

Dear Resident,

This crisis is testing, but we are in this together. We understand that many of you are facing financial pressures as businesses have been forced to scale back or close; we are committed to help support you in every way that we can.

WE‚ÄôRE HERE TO HELP

If you have suffered financially because of the outbreak, please bring it to our attention. If you are working from home and it is not customary for you, please let us know if there is anything we can do to make the transition smoother.

RESOURCES

We encourage you to identify resources offered by federal, state and local governments ‚Äì as well as community organizations ‚Äì to help you secure financial assistance, food and healthcare.      

The federal government is committed to providing an extension of unemployment benefits, direct payments to Americans and assistance to select industries to get people back to work. We hope that these support mechanisms will help make your household finances work. Helpful resources from the CDC can also be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.

It‚Äôs important to know that the eviction moratoriums put in place do not relieve residents of paying their rent or complying with their lease. Again, we are committed to helping those directly impacted by the pandemic.

For those of you not financially impacted by the pandemic, it is critical that timely rent payments continue so we can continue to maintain the cleanliness and safety of our community and meet our other financial obligations like tax and insurance payments.

We want to thank you again for choosing this property as your home. The steps we‚Äôre taking will safeguard this community and we appreciate your willingness to help.",Dallas,Dear Resident

Dearest Family, friends, and well-wishers,
It is my fervent prayer that you‚Äôre all taking care of each other and protecting yourselves during these trying times. It is with despair and intense anxiety that I share the trauma that my family is undergoing right now. My beloved husband, Rohan, has been severely stricken with the dreaded Covid 19. He is desperately ill and has been hospitalized for the past week. His condition is dire. I want so much to have him return home to me and our three beautiful young children, all of who are under eight years of age. 
On behalf of my babies and me, I urgently request the support of the community in helping him make a full recovery. We are looking for a plasma donor with blood group A or AB. The donor cannot be currently actively infected (must have recovered). 

The ideal donor is someone that has recovered from COVID-19 infection in the last two weeks and is willing to donate plasma. We will be forever grateful!

It could be all legit and I'm just freaking out but here's the story!

So I recently applied for unemployment. Today I received a call from someone wanting more information. They provided upfront information about people at my last job, where I was working, and dates I was terminated etc. It seemed legit. They asked for the last 4 digits of my social to verify and answer other questions about my last job. 

They concluded with that was all the information they needed but the payment I requested for the dates had issue. They had the correct dates.

They transferred me to another department. I waited about 10 minutes. A guy with a quiet voice answers and ask for my social. I was hesitant at first but everything seemed like correct information up to this point. So stupid me gave it to them. Follow up with my name then the line disconnects. 

Maybe I am over thinking this and the line just happened to disconnect or maybe I got scammed. But everything seemed very legit. They were giving me dates that line up with what I submitted on TWC earlier in the day. The number even seems to trace back to an old page of www.workforcesolutions.net 

Been stuck in the infinite loop of trying to get back in touch with someone there and havent had any luck.

3622,3622,Inquirewithininc,1585780200,fta6l0,Nan,"""Me and My Uncle"", often also written as ""Me &amp; My Uncle,"" is a song composed by John Phillips of The Mamas and the Papas, and popularized in versions by Judy Collins and the Grateful Dead. It relates the journey of a narrator and his uncle from southern Colorado towards west Texas, involving standard cowboy song themes like a poker game in Santa Fe, accusations of cheating, gunplay, gold, and death.

The earliest commercially released performance of the song by the Grateful Dead is from the Electric Theater in Chicago, on April 26, 1969, and is available on Dick's Picks Volume 26. One of the earliest performances at the Matrix is available on [archive.org](http://archive.org/) , recorded on December 4, 1966. The song continued to be performed regularly until Jerry Garcia's death and the end of the band in 1995. Since the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, the song continues to be a staple of the surviving members' performances.

The lyric, ""One of them cowboys, he starts to draw"" fits in nicely as a ""draw"" is also a term used heavily in the sport of American football.

The song, ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again"" is a song written by Bob Dylan that appears on his 1966 album Blonde on Blonde. The album version also appears on 1971's Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II. An early studio take, done in a faster cut-time, was released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack in 2005. As the recording indicates, Dylan had difficulty fitting the words to the tempo, and evidently this led to its rearrangement, as heard on Blonde on Blonde.

The Grateful Dead covered the song in their live shows during the 1980s and 1990s, and performed it when Dylan himself toured with them in 1987.

The full lyrical line reads, ""The one was Texas medicine, the other was just railroad gin.""

I was offered a new position during a few weeks back with this virus being in the horizon and known.

I left a good job in hopes of starting something better and bigger and things have not gone as planned. There‚Äôs no way I can go back to my old job or would ever want to.

The coworker said nothing is being done, they aren't shutting down, they aren't cleaning the place, it's business as usual. 

Then the coworker told me that when getting a test done for another job (not a Covid test) he mentioned the work situation to the test-taker, and was told that he should also quarantine just in case.

My coworker can't afford to do this, and has chosen not to. When he told his boss at the food delivery restaurant that he'd been advised to stay home, the boss said not to worry, if anyone asked he'd say the co-worker was staying home.

3778,3778,DWKTEXAS,1586044695,fv43f6,Nan," It seems to be business as usual at the Iglesia Universal del Reino de Dios, a downtown church located at 1508 Cadiz St. despite the city, county, and state orders.  

Last Sunday, it appeared that the were having regular services which I thought was odd.

On Wednesday night they were open for services - parking lot full of 30+ cars.  I reported them on 311 and a city inspector contacted me the next day and told me he went to the church and told them to close to the public.  

However, on Friday night around 7PM, I noticed the church put up blue tents outside the building and seemed to be having a service for what appeared to be indigent, possibly homeless, people.  The attendees were sitting on folding chairs right next to each other.  There was zero social-distancing being practiced.  I contacted 311 again and made my report (the operator said that it had already been reported).   She told me that Code Compliance was closed for the evening so nothing could happen immediately.  The operator suggested I contact Dallas Police non-emergency.

Dallas police said there was nothing they could do as far as enforcement since this was a ""civil matter"".

I wrote an email to Councilman Medrano and have not heard back yet (in fairness to him, I wrote it Friday night).

Tonight the church is at it again with a ""homeless service"" under their blue tents.  Again, 20+ people standing next to each other like it was a month ago.

The problem is that their services are in the evening and on Sundays when Code Compliance is unavailable so it's impossible to ""catch them in the act"".  I don't think it's hyperbole to say if we have an outbreak in the downtown area, Iglesia Universal del Reino de Dios might be one the reasons.   

Any suggestions?",Dallas,Iglesia Universal del Reino de Dios - COVID 19 violation?

We know that you‚Äôre suffering from cabin fever being cooped up at home all day. While most of us are really glad to see you on a regular basis, this is the time we encourage you not to come to the store  because you‚Äôre bored. Coming to a retail store and hanging out there is probably not the best idea right now simply because of the amount of traffic that is in and out of the store on a regular basis. 

We are all working super hard to make sure you have what you need, but constant exposure is making the retail staff drop like flies. 

Instead, try this... FaceTime an old friend, play a game with your family, plan a marathon of movies, write a letter to someone, clean out your email inbox, donate old clothing, reconnect with someone you‚Äôve lost touch with.

I had a car that I swear I watched drive off, but maybe two minutes later it came back to the same one way street I was on and it did a circle as if they saw me and pulled up real close to the curb.

Cities currently announce their COVID-19 numbers and basic data about the infected individuals minus the identities thanks to HIPAA and other laws.  Could hospitals not partner with local cities/towns to give pamphlet information that encourages them to enroll in wellness checks with their local government or a local charity managed by officials?   This would include volunteers and charities to delivery food and supplies on their doorstep and wellness checks via phone?   We don't need people wandering around their street and deciding they have had enough of house quarantine cause their symptoms are mild so they go for some ice cream.    

$1200 stimulus isn't going to last long for lower income households or those that no longer have income.  We don't need desperate people leaving their house to try and find supplies and food if they are infected.  Nothing is preventing anyone from leaving their houses as it is.   So anything that incentivizes people to stay home should be explored.

District 7 Senior Affairs commissioner, Cannon Flowers

Description of program-
This is a program that builds community and provides a fulfilling opportunity for both the volunteer and the recipient of the work of the volunteer. The program provides a critical resource in response to the COVID-19 virus by bringing together, a vibrant pool of volunteers that will establish and maintain a telephonic/electronic connection with older residents in the City of Dallas. Each volunteer will maintain connections with no more than 3 individuals (from a provided list) to provide welfare checks, social engagement, a remedy to isolation, and referring individuals to program coordinator when social/medical assistance may be needed.  While the program will run through the quarantine/isolation period, it is hoped that these friendships and connections will last for years to come. #inthistogether

I need some advice regarding this, if anyone can offer some clarity.  

I was laid off due to the virus and applied for unemployment prior to April 5. I have not yet received the ""Determination on Payment of Unemployment Benefits"" electronic correspondence, but in my Statement of Wages, the ""you did not earn enough in your base period"" box is checked.  

The Virtual Assistant on the website says ""If you applied for unemployment benefits but did not monetarily qualify, no action is needed. We will determine if you qualify under the new Federal stimulus bill and notify you by mail or electronic correspondence of your eligibility.""  

Obviously, I don't want to contribute to tying up the phone lines if it can be avoided, but I'm not sure if I should reapply as suggested (since my application was submitted before the 5th), or if I should wait for correspondence regarding the CARES bill since my company laid me off due to COVID-19.

I live in Lewisville and the venue is located in Valley View. At first the venue suggested that I reschedule the wedding to another date. Unfortunately because I will be starting my surgical residency this coming July in a different city, I am unable and unwilling to reschedule to another date that may or may not work for me. She then suggested I find another bride who may want to buy the wedding date from me given that she can schedule her wedding on a date within the year if it is still available. I posted on a few websites and I could not find a bride and my posts were removed claiming solicitation. So I finally told her that I want a refund because none of the other options work for me. I have talked to her for hours telling her the force Majeure clause gives me claim to a refund. And she and her husband have been extremely unwilling and are trying to force me to reschedule even though it's not a valid option for me. And they are claiming that because this is not their fault, they get to keep the money paid thus far. The retainer was $1000 and the first payment was $1025. So we are talking about a total of $2025. I have stopped making any more payments considering everything. I also think the Force Majeure clause rids me of any liability for not making payments. 

The two clauses that are being referenced back and forth between us. 

1. Event Cancellation. If your event is canceled due to no fault of [venue name] the entire retainer or any money paid to that
point¬†will be retained by [venue name]

2. Force Majeure. ¬†The Parties shall not be liable for failure to perform under the terms and conditions of this Agreement if such failureis caused by or due to the acts or regulations of public authorities, labor difficulties, civil tumult, strike, epidemic or any cause beyondthe control of the Parties, excluding economic hardship, changes in market conditions, and insufficiency of funds.

Her and her husband feel that they've done everything to accommodate by allowing me to reschedule. I feel that because I'm not agreeable to a reschedule, I am entitled to a refund. And I should not be forced into something I don't want. I have even considered a partial refund but she is not okay with it. 

Realistically, what are my rights and what am I entitled to? Should I invest in a contract lawyer to fight this? Does the Force Majeure clause trump everything else in the contract? 

Considering lawyers fees, I figured I'm better off negotiating a partial refund with her, even though it's not my ideal conclusion to this. But she is definitely not okay with a partial refund and if I don't do anything, I'm out $2025 for something that's not in my control. 

Thanks. 

P.S tried posting this on r/legaladvice and it was removed because they referenced it in their FAQ. But I wanted a deeper discussion than what was said in their FAQ so I thought you guys might have something to add.",Dallas,Forced to cancel a wedding due to COVID-19 and venue unwilling to uphold the Force Majeure Clause

It‚Äôs on the tip of my tongue. However I just can‚Äôt seem to lodge it from the depths of my mind. If I remember correctly, it was upstairs in a large building and this building had circular type ‚Äúdormers‚Äù that kind of stuck out into the roof. This place had laser tag as well. The arcade part just blew my mind and I was in love with this place. Not sure about this I could be wrong but I believe there was a movie theater in the building as well that may or may not have been part of the arcade laser tag place. I remember that I had to go there to see black beauty, that stupid horse movie, with my grandmother and was disappointed I couldn‚Äôt go to the damn arcade. It wasn‚Äôt tilt, I don‚Äôt think.

178,178,ApexTankSlapper,1586403518,fxl4lc,Nan,"Hello,

For some reason lately, with all this time sitting around my house, my thoughts have been drifting back to when I was young, in the 1990s. I still remember a good part of that time in my life, thanks in part to how great of a place that Dallas was back then. I will try to post more stuff like this if you guys enjoy hearing my thoughts. The main reason I‚Äôm here is because I wonder what happened to Loma Luna on Preston rd in the sherry plaza shopping center. When I was young, my family and I would eat at this restaurant very frequently. I thought this place was super cool to be in. The food was excellent as well, but it had this feeling like you were in a cave or something. Back when I was a kid I watched a game show on Nickelodeon called Legends of the Hidden Temple and this place resembled the set of the show in a way, with the adobe walls and dim lighting. It was a great place to go to escape the heat or cold and have a great meal. At one point, I believe around 1995 or 1996 the place just shut down for no apparent reason without any warning at all. We found out that they might have moved to Greenville or something at the time. We went to the address we posted or had found somewhere, don‚Äôt remember how, and couldn‚Äôt find it. What happened? Anyone know? Anyone remember this place? I‚Äôm hoping someone does. For what it‚Äôs worth, I found an old article on the D magazine website. It‚Äôs pretty cool to see this stuff years later. Thanks for reading. Sorry it‚Äôs so long. I really really miss this place and that time period. Hope everyone is safe and well.

The current hospital policy mandates that everyone wear a mask for the duration of their shift, as in, every single person that shows up to work every single day is issued a surgical mask literally the minute they walk through the door and that mask has to stay on the entire time they're there (up to 12-16 hours depending on the shift). Keep in mind, this includes the staff that aren't even in direct contact with COVID patients/units such as environmental services, dietary, security, unit secretaries, pharmacy, and everyone else that can't work from home but are crucial to help the hospital run. The ponytail-minded among us have enjoyed these especially as the ear saver can rest on top of the ponytail and keep the mask ear loops well free of the ears.

To anyone that has been making ear savers/masks/etc., thank you for your time, your materials, and for thinking of us. Your efforts are greatly appreciated!

I FINALLY was able to login to TWC and apply for benefits. My employer gave us a layoff date of March 17th.

Questions:

1. Will our retroactive pay start on your lay-off date, if the reason was COVID19? As I said, ours was March 17th but I swear I read the earliest they‚Äôd go is March 29th??

2. My benefit amount doesn‚Äôt show the $600 per week. Once the government gets things up and running, will that section on TWC be the place to see a confirmation that it will be deposited?

3. Did anyone else receive the email to approve electronic correspondence so you don‚Äôt have to wait for snail mail, but the link won‚Äôt open?

PS For those of y‚Äôall having trouble logging in-

I had the same issue for 3 weeks on Safari. It kept saying my email was already under another account (it wasn‚Äôt). I went to Chrome and got in last night. Maybe try that if you get that message!",Dallas,Will the additional $600 show up on TWC‚Äôs website under ‚Äúweekly benefit amount‚Äù?

Look forward to hearing your questions... AMA!

367,367,virtuossaint,1586895756,g1d4fe,Nan,"I briefly went to the Walnut Hill and Forest Ln areas today for the first time since I moved here last year. The areas are VERY nice and I can‚Äôt help but think without all the homeless people, drug users, and crime I keep hearing about, this would really be the perfect area for me to live for the rest of my life and purchase a condo. It was difficult for me to walk down the street to my doctors appointment without noticing a homeless man following me and me feeling uncomfortable. I live closer to the park lane area and it‚Äôs the same problem there. You are walking near the path and admiring the trails and nature and suddenly your being harassed by someone lingering around. I‚Äôve seen condoms littered on the street right where children get off their bus after school and a man did a line of coke in the same exact spot in broad daylight.

The ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people I‚Äôve been around haven‚Äôt been so much better. A lot of people I see interacting with each other are rude and completely disrespectful to each other. The behavior is so shocking because I was under the impression that southern people had great manners. 

For some reason, it‚Äôs very common here to be harassed when walking down the street. I‚Äôm from the city of Chicago and I feel more comfortable walking down the most dangerous street there than here. I constantly have men following me in their cars and slowing down to stare at me. I really hope this type of behavior that‚Äôs apparently normal in Texas fades away soon.

Also, when a home builder states a home starts in the 400s, 500s, etc, I'm seeing info about how this is for a bare bones house (I think one of the examples I read was about how it literally includes a mirror slapped onto the wall for the bathroom, vs something with a border, etc).
