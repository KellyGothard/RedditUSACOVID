The oil heat company came out two months ago to fully fill up our 250-gallon tank. They came again last month to fully fill up the tank again. Aside from the crazy amount of money that we’ll have to pay ($700/each time yikes), is this normal monthly oil heat consumption for folks??

A few notes:
1) The house is about 3000 sq ft, but neither the attic nor basement are heated. 
2) We have a Nest thermostat that keeps the heater running at 54 degrees when we’re not here, which is at least 10 hours a day when we’re at our worksites.

There was talk that it was closed down because of stealing which I honestly believe. Beckley has had a lot of businesses shut down because of the employees.

&amp;#x200B;

* Date of Birth: 1974 - 1980 (22 to 28 years old)
* Sex: Male
* Location: Hattiesburg, Mississippi
* Date of Death: May 1, 2002
* Body Discovered: December 1 or 12, 1998
* Manner of Death: Complications from a hit and run accident
* Height: 5'9"" (1.75m) - 5'11"" (1.80m)
* Weight: 170 lbs (77kg)
* Race: Caucasian
* DNA: DNA, dental records, and fingerprints available

1. Artistic renderings of the victim by Barbara A. Martin: [1](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/649UMMS.jpg) and [2](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/649UMMS1.jpg)
2. [Actual photo](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/649UMMS2.jpg) of the victim while still alive

Notes:

* In December 1st, 1998, a man was struck by a drunk driver while hitchhiking on I-59 just north of Highway 49 on the ramp to I-59 northbound in Hattiesburg.
* The drunk driver left the scene but was later apprehended by police.
* Before losing consciousness, the victim told responding paramedics that his name was Steve Hex (Hicks) and that he was from West Virginia.
* Earlier reports stated his height as 6’2’’. It was later changed to 5’7’’-5’9’’. I suspect this is because coma patients are at a higher risk for osteoporosis and can be hard to measure due to the way their limbs contract. They may have measured him at over 6 feet at the time of the accident, and under 6 feet after three and a half years with a brain injury. The redditor who suggested this case says he has sources stating the height is definitively 5’7’’-5’9’’
* DoeNetwork had the date of discovery as December 1, 1998 in December of 2008. DoeNetwork then changed it to “December 1 or 12” NamUs has it as December 12. It is unclear which one is correct. The redditor who suggested this case says he has sources stating the date is December 12th.
* He had red hair.
* He had hazel or blue eyes.
* He wore a red mustache and beard.
* He had freckles.
* His blood type was B negative
* He didn’t have any scars or tattoos.
* He passed away on May 1st, 2002, from complications that were the result of the hit and run accident.

274,pacocase,1581026999,f003jc,Nan,"Back when I was growing up in WV in the eighties, it was as blue a state as they come. 

From Wikipedia:
&gt; ""West Virginia was once a solidly Democratic state; it voted Democratic in every election from 1932 to 1996, except for the Republican landslides of 1956, 1972, and 1984. However, in recent years it has drifted to becoming solidly Republican, and has stayed that way since it was won by George W. Bush in 2000. Barack Obama, for example, failed to win even a single county in 2012. West Virginia is one of the two states where Hillary Clinton did not win any counties, the other being Oklahoma, which last voted for a Democrat in 1964.[8]""

I was there during Bush/Gore in 2000. It was the first presidential election I was old enough to vote in, and I did so happily and with confidence that my state would join me as it had historically been blue.

As fate would have it, though, that election was the turning point for WV and it has been solidly red ever since. I have always attributed this to the Republican party fully embracing the ""Christian Right,"" realizing that there was a huge untapped market for them that could potentially tip elections. 

A good article on this: https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/religion-gap-republican-democratic-voters-polling/index.html

Anyway, I posted the following on an old high school friend's Facebook wall today. He has yet to get back to me. All he does on Facebook is post Pro Trump and Anti Pelosi memes. I genuinely want to know how he arrives at his opinions, and that prompted me to ask here.

&gt; XXX, and really any other Trump supporters, may I ask a serious question?

&gt; Are you are getting your news from any sources other than here on Facebook, which uses micro-targeted ads based on your ""likes,"" or from Fox News, which edits video clips down into out-of-context pastiches that support the right-wing narrative?

&gt; Did you watch any length of the impeachment trials live or unedited by any source?

&gt; I ask because there is a massive, and I mean absolutely staggeringly huge disinformation campaign that is already underway which is going to be so much worse (or better, depending on your perspective) than 2016, and diversifying your news sources is the best way to combat it.

&gt; I fully believe that reality and the truth matters. If your child lies to you about something, do you not demand the truth from them? Why would you not from your news source or from your president?

&gt; Thanks for your time and have a good day

&gt; If you'd like to read it, this article breaks a lot of this information down.
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-2020-disinformation-war/605530/

American politics has always been a game that plays fast and loose with the truth, but we are entering a new era of propaganda with the modern disinformation campaigns that are possible with 24 hour television, social media and other websites. The problem isn't going away any time soon.

It continually flabbergasts me to see my home state vote against its own self-interests. The only thing I can figure is that because WV is such a deeply religious state, that when the GOP tied themselves to religion, Christianity specifically, a lot of folks began voting red in 2000 and never looked back. 

I realize that Reddit may not be the most bipartisan platform on which to ask this question, but how has your family voted in the last several elections? Go back to the fifties or sixties if you know anyone who was voting back then. Ask them who they voted for and why. I'd really like to see the history behind a state transforming politically as completely as West Virginia did.",WestVirginia,A genuine question about how WV turned into a red state.

I struggled through classes but had good grades. My first job, accounting assistant, paid under $5. Claims manager, paid $6. Both jobs I hated. I HATE numbers!!! I just can’t grasp things with numbers. I could never focus on my work. On a whim I applied for a job at a radio station &amp; was hired.   I became really good and was among the employees at the station. A few years ago, I left a job in radio broadcasting to take a job with the state.

I think I’ve worked every lunch for the past 10 months. I stay over &amp; work at least 2 - 3 hours every. This isn’t overtime pay. I just do it to keep my workload under control. I’m truly thankful to have a job and I’ve had some day’s off because of state holidays. It’s not worth the stress level though.  After a year at my present job, I was given tons more work and responsibilities.  The days off I was looking forward to haven’t come. The job is a grind. Every week my boss gives me additional work. Now, I miss my old job. It was simple &amp; not demanding but I was usually content. I had no upward mobility but I really don’t have much now because my experience is so lacking. My boss provides me with no direction and I had to rely on another employee for all my training. He’s way up the ladder and really doesn’t concern himself with whether I know anything. Just get it done. I’m also the only employee handling the work I do. I’m swamped.

Are most state jobs like this??  I don’t mind working hard but there’s no way I can get control of my job without putting in extra hours every week. I’m literally afraid to get sick because my work will build up.",WestVirginia,Working for the State

I haven't had a lot of opportunities to explore your beautiful state but I'm trying to plan a memorial day family vacation to West Virginia so I'm hoping someone here might have a good suggestion for me! I've been doing preliminary research but a little overwhelmed with requirements and options.

I'm charged with trying to appease multiple family members and so I had requests to **find a good place to stay where we would have access to onshore fishing, we have a toddler who would like a beach to swim at, and also we have people who would like to either seem some national park or historic sites.**

**The priority is to find a place where we have easy access to fishing/beach. A bonus would be having some historic sites, national forests, or nice towns near to visit as well.**

I've been looking at all the national parks, there seem to be tons of great options. I'm just not really sure what's a good place to home base for fishing/beach. It seems like to have easy access to fishing we would have to camp at most of these spots.

Any advice or suggestions are very much appreciated!",WestVirginia,"Vacation Advice Needed! Fishing, Beach, and History?"

I’m attempting to get broadband service for my family who live in a holler in rural Lincoln County. They’ve had dial up/expensive satellite internet for years and it’s become unusable. While folks living on the main road and a few adjacent hollers have Frontier broadband service, my family’s holler of about 20-25 families do not. 

Apparently there was a work order set about six months ago to finally bring lines down the holler to make the holler ‘broadband capable’, but haven’t heard anything beyond that or seen any workers. I’ve called their offices multiple times and the poor customer service folks seem just in the dark as I am and I hit a brick wall. I’m aware Frontier is a hot bankrupt mess and can’t even seem to keep their phone lines in working order, but I’m wondering if anyone knows if Frontier is still proceeding with new work orders to lay down lines, and if anyone has dealt with this before and knows who in the company to contact. I no longer live in the area, but hoping some local folks have some insight. Thanks ya’ll!",WestVirginia,Getting Frontier Internet Service in the holler

(Paraphrased from the article) 

Third ward councilman Zachary Cruz says the ordinance really doesn't go far enough. 

Councilman Dave Harshbarger explains that the ordinance does not actually decriminalize marijuana, but rather gives police ""another option at their discretion to issue a lower level penalty"".

This alternative penalty would include zero jail time and a maximum fine of $15 for possession of less than 15 grams.

Councilman Barry Wendall cautioned WVU students about the ordinance. ""If you're a WVU student you could still be arrested by WVU police and sent to magistrate court and you could be jailed for six months and kicked out of school. That's WVU's policy and if you're a WVU person you need to work with them to change that policy because we can't do it"".",WestVirginia,Morgantown City Council votes unanimously on an ordinance to effectively decriminalize marijuana

1. How's racism in the rural areas? I'm not talking about the big cities, I'm looking to live very rurally and offgrid, probably up in the mountains and have people coming with me who are not white. Will this be an issue? 

2. What other issues might I run into in rural, remote, isolated places? Opiod abuse? High crime or poverty rates?

3. What are the building codes like in rural areas? Strict? Nonexistent? 

4. Bonus question for anyone that knows the answer: How's the soil quality, particularly in the mountains? I'm from East TN, and the thing preventing me from moving back there is the leached out, acidic soils making it impossible to grow anything without industrial/chemical inputs. That being said, does anyone know if WV mountain soils suffer from the same problem? 

5. Anything else I should know or be aware of?

""Some personal news:

This morning I resigned my position at The Charleston Gazette-Mail.

After more than 28 years, it's time for some new adventures.

Working to carry on Ned Chilton's legacy or ""Sustained Outrage"" - the Gazette of Don Marsh and Jim Haught and Paul Nyden and Eric Eyre- has been my great honor.

It's been a privilege to have so many of my neighbors trust me to tell their stories. Thank you.

Thanks also to Doug Reynolds and other local investors who bought our company out of bankruptcy and supported so many newsroom efforts.

My Gazette-Mail coworkers are amazing people - talented, dedicated, tough and kind. And success I've had I owe to them. Take care of yourselves, my friends.

My beloved home state needs great journalism. So I hope the community will continue - as I will - to support the paper.

Please subscribe - and maybe drop off some donuts or pizza to the newsroom once in a while.""

According to this article, he resigned ""...just days after Greg Moore, the Gazette-Mail’s now-former executive editor, announced his job had been unexpectedly eliminated Thursday. Media trade publication Poynter reached out to newly-hired regional executive editor Lee Wolverton regarding the decision to eliminate Moore’s position. He had no comment.

569,barbourcountybandit,1583721289,ffnsv6,Nan,"Ive been studying the history of Barbour county recently, and came across some information in book published by the Barbour County Historic Society.  In this particular section about the area none as Volga, Which I currently reside there is mention of ""an Indian burial ground, and a cave over a mile long"" which the native Americans commonly used as a tactical advantage during the time of the settler's. (I'll upload a photo ,or just type a paragraph from the book later.)
That being said, geology says Barbour county is not ""cave country"" due to sandstone and lack of limestone. That didn't stop me from exploring this mystery. I found multiple intriguing stone fixtures. The older generation I spoke to informed me that these were in fact stacked by Farmers . However, I disagree after reviewing this source. www.stonestructures.org .  (I'll upload photos when I figure out how) 
To make things even more believable, I located a native American Axe head underneath a small overhang! No digging required! 
The hunt for the cave is a different story. I believe I have found both entrances but I suspect they have collapsed at some point. One side looked promising but had a layer of water in it, too cold for that right now. Once again, the older generation told me the side with the water was a hand dug mine. I'll upload photos instead of rambling about this cave.",WestVirginia,Lost Appalachian Native American History

571,Stratiform,1583722842,ffo56q,Nan,"Hello r/WestVirginia! I'm asking that same question I suspect you get all the time, so my apologies in advance. I actually have looked at your [WVTourism](https://wvtourism.com/) site and the [EverythingWV](https://everythingwv.com/) too, but sometimes I find nothing quite gives advice like an actual person, so I wanted to drop a post here.

My family and I are planning on visiting West Virginia because we've never been there and it's a short-ish drive from Detroit, where we are. I have two young kids (i.e. under-5), so that limits some of the more adventurous stuff we can do. While rafting and skiing are definitely on my list of things I love to do, they're not really pre-school appropriate, at least not for us -- (*it works for others, I'm sure, and that's awesome*).

**What should we do?**

They love interactive kids museums and short hikes on developed trails (*not paved, just.. maintained*). My wife and I love craft beer, and I hear West Virginia has a bit of a craft beer scene. What are the must-try breweries, preferably ones with kids menus? Speaking of which, I know nothing about West Virginia. Can I even bring my kids in breweries? We also like history museums, but since sometimes the attention span of smaller humans isn't great, I try to avoid ones with high ticket prices. Any suggestions? Also, I'm a geologist with a family heritage of coal miners, and even worked in coal myself for a while (*see username*), so if there's like a .. I don't know .. coal museum..? Definitely hook a fellow redditor up. 

**Finally, where should we stay?** 

I'd like to stay somewhere that's like a nice, safe, walkable downtown. I know West Virginia has an image of having some dangerous areas and drug issues, but I suspect that like Detroit, it's all about where you are and what you're doing. Still, that being said, if you could point me at the safer walkable-downtowns closer to the western half of the state (*we plan to visit Kentucky too, so Martinsburg and Beckley are probably not on the agenda*), that would be super cool. 

Also, while I'm not a fan of redlining, if there are any areas we should avoid taking walks at night, that would be helpful too. If that doesn't exist, and I understand West Virginia isn't going to have too many cities, any cool Bed and Breakfast spots that are going to be kid-friendly would be helpful too. 

Thanks!",WestVirginia,"Another ""Tell me what to see in West Virginia"" post -- visiting this spring with young family"

However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent social distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [150,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf))

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article)

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients. [Toronto Star soberly warns hospitals can’t cope if coronavirus outbreak worsens in Canada: March 6th.](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/03/06/hospitals-warn-they-cant-cope-if-coronavirus-outbreak-worsens-in-canada.html)

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

* People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html))

* **Update:** ""Any country that looks at the experience of other countries with large epidemics and thinks that it won’t happen to us is making a deadly mistake,"" [warned the WHO](https://twitter.com/reuters/status/1238560462524035073?s=21).

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. **Update:** [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca).

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* Practice [social distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/).

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing social distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

* [Source](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) / [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fg4a74/covid19_median_incubation_period_is_51_days/) with regards to this section.

#**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS:**

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) of source)

* People with weakened respiratory system due to smoking/vaping ([source 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)), ([source 2](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/Abstract/publishahead/Analysis_of_factors_associated_with_disease.99363.aspx))

* Lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function or that require home oxygen (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf), last page)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""**

UPDATE: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds)).

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

679,ghostofwiglaf,1584445419,fk3toh,Nan," One of the reasons coronavirus is so scary is that it is possible to  be a carrier for the disease and not know it. Some people are  asymptomatic and some people have mild symptoms. But [as of Monday](http://coronavirus.wv.gov/), West Virginia has only tested 84 people for coronavirus – out of a state of 1.8 million. Critics say that’s not nearly enough.

If  you wanted to check to see if you had coronavirus so you could make  sure you’re in the clear before going to visit an elderly relative –  could you? 

The short answer? No – not in West Virginia, at least.

It's going to hit WV really bad. [Read what the WV Governor is telling people](http://wvmetronews.com/2020/03/16/justice-act-as-if-its-here-testing-capacity-is-frustrating-no-need-yet-to-shut-down-bars-and-restaurants/)

&gt;The state leaders expressed frustration that only 500 testing kits have been available in West Virginia so far — and those have only been made functional by jerry-rigging some flu test kits.

Right now WV has no testing kits from a national level sent to help. The hospitals in the state have figured out how to test using existing flu test kits and information available on the COVID-19.  [16% of the state is over 65](http://censusviewer.com/state/WV), and most of the over-65 are *over 75*!

Compare Italy, right now with 7.7% mortality rate, much of which is due to the [aging population with a median of 47.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-deaths-from-coronavirus-are-so-high-in-italy/) Then compare small towns in WV like [Grafton, WV with a median age of 45](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/grafton-wv-population/). WV is sprinkled with small towns with similar demographics.

Now combine all of this with the [worst state for opioid deaths and prescriptions](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-summaries-by-state), the [bias from conservative news on corona virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-conservative-media.html), and that [Trump won WV in 2016 by over 40 points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_West_Virginia).

707,brentfield,1584564423,fkwuog,Nan,"Whether you call it nCoV-19 or COVID-19 or just “The Coronavirus,” it is here in West Virginia and, undoubtedly, a hell of a lot closer than that.  More reports of confirmed cases in this state and others are coming.  Just keep clean, stay clean, stay home, minimize any contact with others, and you may be OK.

First:  80% of people who DO contract this virus will get sick.  It will not be bad, any more than having the flu or a chest cold might feel.  Those are mild cases.  Isolate yourself.  *Do not have contact with anyone* if it can be avoided.  If you NEED to have physical contact with others, assuming other people in your home, put yourself in a bedroom with bathroom access and lock those areas off.  You have become part of the problem.  

No medical intervention is required with a mild case of COVID-19.  Repeat:  **No medical intervention is required for a mild case of COVID-19.**  but you DO need to keep from giving it to your loved ones or roommates.  Restrict your movements to the two rooms.  Do not let anyone inside those two rooms but people sick with this virus.  This is now your own, personal hot zone.  If you have to leave that room to go to a communal bathroom, wipe down anything and everything in that communal bathroom that you are certain you have touched AND the areas you MAY have touched after you are finished.  Use a clean cloth or paper to touch sink knobs, or toilet handles, or door handles.  IF your skin meets physical contact with a surface, it should be wiped clean as soon as possible.  Have others bring you food if you can, but remember that you are “hot.”  You can be shedding the virus.  That means don’t touch *anybody*, and your plates and silverware and cups are all going to be “hot” until they are adequately cleaned.  **This is only if you believe that you or another has the virus.**

If you are certain you do NOT have the virus, you MAY still have it.  You are just not symptomatic.  But your body is reproducing the virus and putting it out of your body in a solution of droplets:  a sneeze, sweat, snot, blood, anything.  Those droplets are “hot.”  One of the many problems with this particular virus is that you can have it for days and not be aware you are contagious.  Yes, you can be contagious and make others sick without knowing it.  Think about that before you need to leave your house for anything.  
**Do not interact physically with anyone if you suspect you MAY have the virus.**  

If you get to a point where going somewhere else is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, you need to think as if everything you touch, or somebody else touches and then you touch, is contaminated until it can be verified clean.
**Again:  outside of your personal space, consider anything AND everything you touch, anything and everything someone passes to you, contaminated until you can clean it.**  YOUR HANDS will be most of the problem.  They will come in contact with surfaces that may have live virus on them.  Even if you wear gloves, if you touch something with live virus, you can infect yourself if you touch yourself in an area of broken skin or moist mucosa like your eyes, nose, or mouth.  **YOU MUST BE ALERT TO EVERYTHING YOUR HANDS ARE DOING AND WHAT THEY TOUCH.**  

If you contact anything you are not absolutely certain about, wipe your hands clean before you touch yourself anywhere.  This means things you never consciously think about:  **your cellphone.  Touch screens.  ATMs.  Door handles.  ANYTHING YOU TOUCH THAT YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN IS CLEAN CAN INFECT YOU.**

Does all of this sound like crazy paranoia and the rantings of an OCD lunatic?  Welcome to the party.  Because you need to be that way in order to keep yourself and others well.  

I know people want to think a barrier like gloves will help.  Only if you changed gloves EVERY SINGLE TIME you touched something or before you touched your face.  That is patently impractical and would destroy resources you need to keep and others need to have. 

If you choose to wear a mask of any kind:  understand that it is largely a barrier to keep YOU from shedding it nasally or orally, or to KEEP you from infecting yourself nasally or orally.  That’s all it can do.  I can explain micron sizes of viruses and masks.  Doesn’t matter.  Those are the only two uses for masks.  If you don’t need them for those reasons, don’t use them!  Don’t buy them!  Others will!  Not just doctors, hospitals, first responders, but people like cancer patients, others with weak or compromised immune systems and countless others you are not thinking about.  But you cannot feel safe wearing ANY kind of mask.  You can still touch your eyes, or other things can touch your eyes unless they are sealed off behind a face shield or sealing goggles that would then need to be disinfected before being used again.  

**WASHING YOUR HANDS AND STAYING AWARE OF WHAT THEY ARE TOUCHING AT ALL TIMES IS GOING TO HELP YOU STAY WELL.**  Wash under warm water for 20 seconds, scrubbing your hands completely.  If you want to feel like a doctor doing it, more power to you, as long as your hands get completely clean doing it, because the very next thing you touch, a towel or a door knob, or a box of Rice Krispies, can expose those clean hands to virus again.  I can explain lipid layers and viruses all day.  This is what you NEED to know:  *Wash your damned hands the way you should have always been doing it anyway.  Then keep them in your pockets (assuming they are virus free) or away from any surface.*  **20 seconds is about how long it takes to sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to someone twice.  Depending on how quickly you sing it, THAT will not make your hands cleaner.  Only the 20 seconds of warm water and soap can do that.**

TRY to keep a clean bottle of hand sanitizer and use it liberally, as if your life depended on it.  **This virus can live on certain surfaces for up to 9 days.**  Alcohol can kill it.  Isopropyl or rubbing alcohol can kill it, but if you can avoid retouching surfaces, do so.  ANY contact with a surface can expose you.  

**DO NOT SHARE FOOD OR DRINK WITH ANYONE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.**  YOU might have it.  THEY might have it.  Sharing just means you can have it TOGETHER.  Don’t do it.  Don’t eat out of communal containers like popcorn or other snacks.  

We need to take care of ourselves first, if we want to help anyone else, AND WE NEED TO HELP OTHERS, TOO.  If that means NOT HOARDING TOILET PAPER, then don’t be an idiot and get only as much as you are going to need.  Don’t buy face masks or gloves if you don’t need to.  Keep to yourself, don’t go to public areas, don’t physically contact or even come within spitting distance of other people if you can avoid it in any way.  As a t-shirt I saw yesterday said “You stay in your holler, I’ll stay in mine.”

[Here is a great write up](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/coronavirus-pandemic-immunity-vaccine/2020/03/12/bbf10996-6485-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html) on what sort of relationship we can expect to have with this virus going forward, written by an epidemiologist, so a studied, educated, and thoughtful perspective.


[Here](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/how-many-adults-are-at-risk-of-serious-illness-if-infected-with-coronavirus/) is a study showcasing, how in fact West Virginia is the most vulnerable population in the country. And it's not exactly why you may think, so it's worth checking out. Numbers and data for your viewing pleasure are there.

Please feel free to share any good information! As you all know, let's be reasonable, well-informed, rational, and thoughtful. Love you all!",WestVirginia,"Welcome to the exponential growth club! Be careful out there, and here, take this..."

___

####Know How it Spreads

* There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
* The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
* The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
* Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
* Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
* These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

####Take steps to protect yourself

* Clean your hands often
* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
* If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

####Avoid close contact

* Avoid close contact with people who are sick
* Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
Take steps to protect others

####Stay home if you’re sick
* Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.

####Cover coughs and sneezes
* Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.
* Throw used tissues in the trash.
* Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

####Wear a facemask if you are sick
* If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.
* If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.

####Clean and disinfect
* Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
* If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.",WestVirginia,/r/WestVirginia Coronavirus (COVID-19) Megathread

He has always had car insurance, but he’s only had a policy in VA.

841,ThatICUNurse,1584998047,fns3xf,Nan,"The Governor has ""urged"" only essential businesses to stay open. What does that mean? 
In reality, nothing. There will be no enforcement of this and non essential businesses will continue to operate. Your local Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Garage door companies, and any other company that is not essential to our communities survival will continue operating. Germs will continue to spread, Covid-19 will not slow down. More deaths will be the end result of Gov. Justice's lack of leadership seen today. 
I work in an ICU in our state that has been declared my unit as the Covid ICU unit of our hospital. We are preparing for the worst. 
I absolutely love my state, I've lived here my entire life and have no plans on leaving. However, it's not uncommon knowledge that we are an elderly, unhealthy state. The comorbitities here are intense. Travel nurses that come here are often suprised at just how sick some of our patients are. COPD, CKD, HTN, DM, Multiple heart caths, it's just a typical history of someone that lives in this state. It will hit us hard. With no real action from Gov. Justice to flatten the curve and not overwhelm our healthcare system, I am scared. I'm scared we will run out of ventilators, I'm scared we will have to try to put multiple patients on one ventilator, and I'm scared members of the state I adore will die needlessly because our hospitals will be overwhelmed. 
To end my rant, please stay home unless it's absolutely necessary that you go out. Please don't be the young people who spread this to our elderly. And please remember the ""$64 dollar question"" when it comes time to reelect Gov. Justice. Just don't, my state deserves so much better.",WestVirginia,So we need a new Governor.

905,majoses77,1585321325,fpyedp,Nan,"West Virginia is particularly vulnerable with some of the highest prevalences of risk factors in the US

 I’m worried for West Virginia, we have ~40% obesity rate (highest in the country), 15.3% have diabetes, 26% smoke, 41% have hypertension, and 7.6% have coronary heart disease, the highest in the country. I fear we will be absolutely shafted. It is very likely that these people would die. I think it is gonna be really bad in WV.

However, I read that we have the second highest number of ventilators per capita in the country. Does anyone know the number? I assume it’s concentrated in Mon county or Kanawha county. Kinda glad I live in Mon right now lol.

Currently we have 76 cases in the whole state but likely we have a significant amount of people infected who are undetected. I’ve read that usually the actual amount of infected is more like 10-50x the number of confirmed cases, likely somewhere in the middle like ~760-3800 (2280 avg) so 0.04%-0.2% (0.12%) of the population infected. 

Where I live in Monongalia county, we have 24 cases, and a majority of them are from a nursing home. I imagine that we likely have 240-1200 (720 avg) infected and 0.23-1.14% (0.658% avg) of the population infected. So I imagine that a grocery store worker who checks out ~200 people a shift would likely encounter 0.5-2 (avg ~1) people.

What do you think will happen to West Virginia? We have a stay at home order. I hope our hospitals don’t get overrun and lots of people die. We are a very unhealthy state. 

Yeah where I live we have 117.000 people. Morgantown is a decently populated city and we have 26,000 students 14,000 of which are from out of state and the statistics say that the majority of our out of state students come from hotspot states and they likely visited home over spring break. That is not even counting how many of the 27,000 students went on vacation over spring break to tourist areas. I fear that the students may have brought a shitload if the virus to our town. So now it will infect the vulnerable people when they go to the grocery store or other ways of getting infected indirectly from the people who traveled.

I wonder what the number of ventilators we have is. Also I hope our hospital workers have adequate PPE. We have a really good hospital in my town I hope they are prepared.

However my psychiatrist is a complete dumbass; I have been warning her about this for over a month and telling her how scared I am and she made it so I don’t have to go in physically for my controlled medications, which I was worried about, but while I’m in the room with her a few weeks ago, she tells me that she has been taking advantage of the cheap group tours in DC and went to the cherry blossom festival and shit and I was thinking  fuck you know how scared I am why do that to me when I’m near you and you are gonna get infected you dumbass. Plus she is obese! 

Sorry I’m ranting lol.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and West Virginia’s shelter in place order, classes for the rest of the semester have moved online and, as you all know, West Virginians are self-isolating. As a way of bolstering spirits and promoting our Morgantown community as well as the broader West Virginia community, the other class officers and I launched a fundraiser using a t-shirt my husband designed for the sale.

I’m posting today because I’m trying to get the word out far and wide about the fundraiser, so I reached out to the mods and, with their support, thought I’d promote it on this subreddit. 

100% of the proceeds are going to Morgantown Area Meals on Wheels, and the shirts are being printed by a local Morgantown business, Underground Printing. Neither I nor the class of 2022 will be profiting in any way off this sale.

In addition to contributing to a cause that is serving some of the most vulnerable among us during this crisis, purchases also support a West Virginia business. This is a tough time for everyone, but we felt as a class that it was important to give back in some way.

The sale ends April 12th, and the shirts can be shipped anywhere. They’re not law-school specific, but a recognition of how West Virginians are staying together by staying apart.

Links to the sale: https://pogo.undergroundshirts.com/collections/country-roads-keep-me-home
