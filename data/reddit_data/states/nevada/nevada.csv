Honestly, as a homeowner with a really nice house paid off, I'm looking forward to leaving Vegas in about 5-8 years and going to someplace with less people, better political ideology and less traffic.

Vegas has AMAZING food and entertainment. But if that's not something you're really into then relax we have a solution to ANY vice you might have and that's pretty dangerous so if you have a drug, alcohol, sex, gambling, etc addiction DO NOT MOVE Here.

Bonus: We have excellent 2A laws for now anyway and Democrats are quickly trying to get rid of those too. We also have one of the worst public school systems in the country. You can easily validate all this info I've included here. Good luck!",1578095466,fcz7wor

If money isn’t an issue and you find a job that will allow you a good standard of living, you enjoy the outdoor lifestyle that Denver provides, and don’t mind terrible traffic, I would definitely choose Denver.

If you want to save some money, don’t mind homeless people living right outside your neighborhood, and don’t mind terrible drivers, consider Vegas. There is a lot to do here and the outdoor scene in the winter is pretty good. It isn’t easy to make lasting friendships, though.

51,B_J_J_Panda,"Correct, I do not have homeless people living outside my Las Vegas neighborhood. Anyways, a more accurate statement you could have made would have been that there is a homeless encampment by your neighborhood, so they can then avoid that neighborhood if they have an issue with that. That would have been much more helpful then the generic statement you originally made.

84,drot525,"It's a combination of bad engineering, bad construction practices, bad construction management. I'm a union pipefitter that only got on that job because the non-union ""pipefitters"" from Utah and elsewhere were fucking awful, and the contractor, Brahma got work taken away from them. 

We took pictures of pipe fit up for weld that were atrocious. Poor fits means more maintenance later, or failed xrays that require rework. For example, they were using nuts for bridge tacks (pieces of metal meant to hold the pipe in place while the root weld is made.) Those are required to be the same metal as the pipe, so you don't use just any bit of metal you have laying around. You order some plate of the same type and cut it up and use that. 

What was frustrating was that was a job 250 miles from Reno and Vegas manned by people mostly from out of state if not the US (for the engineering at least). And it was one of the highest paying jobs for pipefitters in North America. So at the bottom of the Great Recession, in a state hit the hardest by it, we had Nevada pipefitters working thousands of miles from home, whilst incompetent assholes were coming to Nevada to make 4k or so a week. Millions of dollars a month if not a week were leaving Nevada from a job meant to employ Nevadans. Even if you're anti-union, this is a prime reason why you should at least on some level support unions. Had we had more support we could have kept more of that money in Nevada, improving our economy, saving families and marriages and lowering the social cost of family and lives being destroyed by the GR.

It's deeply personal to me; I've rode shot gun to my traveling partner's divorce, watching him trying to save his marriage by phone. I've had coworkers who died or committed suicide because they couldn't find work nearby and couldn't leave to go to Oregon or NY or wherever else the work was. I got about 10 weeks out there. I think the most time out of the Nevadans I know that worked out there, they got about six months, out of a years long job. I always have a well of anger about this job and this issue.

A plant like that, it requires economies of scale to make it truly cheap. I think they got beat by other tech, PV primarily, but a one-off solution is always going to be pricey. It's when you build a dozen that it gets really worth while. Which is why US nuclear sucks; all our plants are pretty much custom designs. In the 50s and again in the 70s, they should have had one design contest, built them all the same, all the same size, if you need more power, add another unit.",1578353160,fdf4kh5

Reno has been one of the faster growing cities of the past decade and real estate values will be more resilient and have more promise but as far as cities go, it’ll feel more like a town to you. Still, it has a lot of big box stores and an active entertainment scene so it’s not like you’ll be out in the boonies like most of Nevada. Carson is better than it used to be but is pretty podunk compared to Reno (despite being the capital of the state), it’s a good place to live if Reno is too expensive. Avoid Clark county, you’d be better served moving to California unless you really want to avoid a state income tax. 

Reno is kind of the best NV has to offer because it’s got the functional practicality of a city while still being much more chill and you’re a mere half hour away from Lake Tahoe and even closer to some other lakes and rivers. SF is a mere 3.5-4hr drive away if you ever miss dense city life and need a reminder of why you left. Or if you just miss access to Michelin Star dining.

Having lived here almost my whole life, I love this state.  But if you get outside of the 2 main population centers it can be very isolated; Nevada is not like a lot of states back East where it is a few miles to the next town.

132,mattiecasey,"Hi! I’ve lived in Reno since I was 5. People seem to complain about it a lot, but it really does have everything. We might not be what you consider a “big city” coming from NYC, but Reno has definitely grown in the past decade and is continuing to do so in almost every aspect. I like living here because there’s an insane amount of variety in the geography, weather, and things to do. Summers are real hot and winters are real cold, although winter has been coming later in the year. The Sierra Nevada mountain range and Lake Tahoe are 30 mins away, great for both winter sports and beautiful summer hikes/beach days. Washoe Valley is in between here and Carson—if you’re looking for more rural, spaced-out living, that’s a super great option as it’s smack in between two more developed areas but doesn’t feel like it is. It’s also absolutely gorgeous, it has smaller lakes and huge fields that make for great scenery. 
If you want nightlife, a music scene, or just something fun to do for a day, downtown and midtown Reno have been really stepping up their game to provide something for everyone!

Vegas and Reno are definitely Nevada’s hubs—I’m not as familiar with southern Nevada, but I’ve heard Clark County can be iffy sometimes. Either way, NV has so much to offer and I wish you the best of luck building a life here!!",1578794129,fdzrjtg

I've been in Oregon Caves on the Southern OR border, and Lehman Caves are right up there with that tour.

If I was doing that trip, I'd go up to GBNP, on the way (you'll be N on US 93 (because the road might be closed for the race, more later.) I'd stop in Panaca, go out the north side of that and hit the spring about a mile outside of town, do a little nostalgia swim with the lily pads. (Gramps used to live there). Stop in and eat lunch in Cathedral Gorge state park, stretch the legs and explore those cool little slots in the rock/mud/mesa. Drive through Pioche, maybe get a Coors in a bar, gawk at that old mining shit around town.

I'd hit the national park for a couple of days. We fished it back when it was a state park (they still stocked fish, they don't now that it's an NP) and SLAYED on brooks and browns. Then I'd hit Ely up. The car race is the same weekend as EDC (I checked) so you can check out some of the race cars will be pulling in all week long, so you'll see some classic muscle and race cars. They close NV Hwy 318 (which is the easier way to get to Ely, but 93 is doable, just one of the grades/hills is steeper, which in an RV or with a trailer can be a bit of a drag) for the race. Maybe camp at Cave Lake just south and outside of Ely, you can fish there, they stock it. It's tiny lake but I've always loved it. 

After Ely, I might head west on US 50 (loneliest road in America) cruise over to Austin, which is a neat little place too. I dunno why it's not yet a downhill mtn bike spot given it's basically in the hills itself. 

Go south on NV hwy 376, there's Kingston Canyon on the west side just south of Austin. There's some small lakes and casual camping there. I'd stop and look at old Round Mountain, which is on the east side further south. And not to be confused with new Round Mountain. The mine, an open pit mine, got so big they moved the whole town to the other side of the road. So it's a modern day ghost town, there might still be people living in some of those houses. And you can, at least in 2014 or so, get close enough to look down in to. It's crazy big. 

And then for sure, I'd hit Manhattan NV, and hope that little crooked bar is open. We had an absolute blast drinking in there when the miners got off and started filling it up. I think it probably holds 30 people. I bought a round for the house and it only cost me like 40 bucks. lol. It's high in the mtns, cool, and trees. You can probably camp there too. Just ask if you're not sure, it's mostly public land in Nevada, so unless it's posted, it's probably allowed. I always operate as if it's allowed and if it's not, well then someone better be nearby to tell me so otherwise I'm just going to do/go pretty much what/where I want.

Cruise back through Tonopah, which probably the only thing worth a picture of there is that scary ass Clown Motel sign, and head back to Vegas. Not a lot between T-pah and Vegas IMO worth seeing. I've driven through Silver Peak because US 95 I've done a 1000x at least and got bored; there's nothing out there. A bunch of lithium mine leech ponds or some shit. Don't bother. Goldfield is always a trip and a speed trap so keep it down through town.",1578888788,fe6etw5

Reno/Tahoe area could be a reasonable day trip.,1580232033,ffu0swg
278,MiryahDawn,"Dude...I wouldnt. 
I havent lived in Hawthorn since I was 5 so it could be different, but I wouldn't ever risk it. A lot of my family's heart ache and skeleton's in the closet started when we lived in Hawthorne ( 3 generations lived there). Just from what I remember there is rampant drug use and sexual abuse in that town. 

Even if the lifestyle has improved, it's such a small town there is nothing to do. We frequently would visit during the summer to fix up a house we owned there when I was a teen, and I spent most of that time lapping the small town becasue there was no one to hang out with and no where to go unless you have some type of recreational vehicle.  You are also hours away from the nearest decent hospital. Armed forces day weekend is a fun time to be there, but honestly that's the only time I'd recommend Hawthorne.

Edit: foodwise you have an over priced grocery store, the casino, McDonald's, a pizza place, and I think I remember a Chinese place that I never saw open. 

They have a park with a pool which was always fun as a kid, but both I and my uncle were stung by a scorpion when we were there. 

They have a huge horse stable area, that was always fun to visit as a kid though, and I remember a class field trip where we got to ride one of the horses. 

Theres also some pretty cool places to go hiking and rock hounding in the surrounding area. Walker lake isnt Tahoe, but its decent and always welcome with how hot it gets there. 

There is also the indian store in Schurz where you can buy fireworks which was always fun.",1580232103,ffu0wzs

282,SilverSierra601,"I would use your opportunity to buy a home. A nice house with decent renovations could gain a lot of value as you live in it. Just slightly more productive than paying rent to a landlord, I suppose. The issue is, Hawthorne is not exactly growing at the rate that other Northern Nevada cities are. So, do expect to double your profits or anything.

Recreation will depend on what you're into exactly. It is a great area for outdoor activities, with several lakes and reservoirs around, as wells as some rivers and fish-bearing creeks. ATVing is very popular in the surrounding desert and there are good seasonal opportunities for upland game and deer hunting. If you're not used to the Nevada desert do not expect a lush wilderness. The desert is an aquired appreciation; however, Westward, into the Sierra Nevada ranges will find you in beautiful conifer forests with Yosemite and Mammoth (great skiing) not too far away.

 Considering you're moving with a new family the nightlife might not interest you, but it is notable for such a small town, I'd say. On the positive, there is a considerable amount of young people living in Hawthorne and it is a tight-knit community in which to grow up. As such, I would expect several options in terms of daycare and pre-K education. The town is quiet enough that people of all ages could feasibly bicycle across it safely.  

In all, Hawthorne is a small - somewhat isolated - town. It is what you are willing to make it. Just be sure to have realistic expectations and you will not be disappointed.",1580233508,ffu370v

I have a hard time believing that the cost of that program would be well and truly funded given the attacks the right makes on ""welfare queens"" and other ""entitlements"" while they, in their continual bad faith, completely ignore the welfare being doled out right now to ~~farmers~~ Big Ag food growing corporations. Which mind you has gone up by billions as Trump's trade war has decimated the soy farmers ability to sell to China. That soy export business in the post-Trade War period is never going to come back. Once Brazil and other countries generate the capacity to meet China's demand, US farmers are going to have the devil's own time regaining that market share there. And all that went on the US credit card, so it's Americans and their kids, grandkids, and greatgrandkids that will be paying for this redistribution of wealth upwards from the regular class of Americans to the rich classes of Americans. And again in the bad faith department; deficits and debt only matter when the GOP is not in control.   

Back to voting though, it's a bad faith argument being made because it completely ignores the actual scope of the ""problem."" It's basically an (expensive) solution looking for a problem to solve. Vote fraud, of illegal or someone casting multiple votes is actually a pretty rare problem. It's a bad faith argument because it pretends to be about ""election security"" meanwhile actual election security especially the e-voting fiasco that is electronic balloting and maintaining the right of all people to vote is curtailed in pursuit of these tiny numbers. Ya'll would rather purge tens of thousands of citizens and their right to vote to catch tens of fraudulent voters/votes. Ya'll engage in redistricting/gerrymandering to maintain a power base that you've no right to.

1) Are you an anti-capitalist? Because without the growth of populations and markets, capitalism fails. Check out the struggles of Japan when their population growth flat lined. They basically lost a decade and a half or more because of it. They call the 90s the ""Lost Decade."" So what's your plan to fix that little problem?

2) Aside from that, pretending it's not a factor or you know a way around that major conundrum, are you a free spending fascist? You don't have to force the illegals to do shit. When the economy tanked in '08, they left. Immigration was net zero. The real ""solution"" is just arrest the people who hire them. Only a fucking idiot would try to round up millions of illegals, many trying to hide, so it's expensive af when you could just arrest a couple hundred thousand at most of the people who hire illegals. Problem solves itself. Ike did it in the 50s. Of course every farmer in America just gets further and further fucked, but fuck them too huh?

But the reality is, it's not that big a problem. It's not a problem at all. It's a challenge. We need more people. More workers. More consumers. If all the people in the world with some get up and go want to come here; let 'em. Sucks for the countries who are letting the brain and motivation drain happen, but /shrug. It's how we'd stay on top of the economic pile. I'd damn near take any person who walked here from Guatemala over most born here Americans; lazy, stupid, entitled, born on third thinking they hit triple. And we get better food out of it. Man America without Mexican, Italian, Asian food, is a shit show culinary wise. We should have a legit guest worker program that works.

Early voters who supported a non-viable candidate will then be allocated to their top viable choice (if any).

She had a little trouble finding my name in the massive list of voters that I guess is not searchable. After that she handed me the iPad to fill out my information. I thought it was fast and easy but a little repetitive since I also had to fill out 3 other things with my name and address and then we had to match numbers across everything. 

The older gentleman who was also doing check in next to her could barely operate the iPad. The elderly woman who was first in line was still searching for her name by the time I was checking out. 

My friends were about 10 people back and the said the woman was checking in 3 people for every 1 the man did. (They we’re taking disabled people to the front of the line)

I think the app is going to cause a lot of issues like this. An older volunteer who is not comfortable with technology rushing to finish things on the app are going to make mistakes. Generally slowing down the process for everyone. If they have just not been using the app they could have really been moving that line through even with everything you had to fill out.

713,Darth_Ra,"&gt; One said choosing one candidate then ""uncommitted"" for the rest would count for all three rounds, then I saw a tweet saying these ballots are going to be thrown out.

Well, tweets are a horrible place to get information, and there are people out there stoking fires right now for political purposes. [Candidate, Uncommitted, Uncommitted] will definitely be counted for all three rounds, unless your candidate of choice does not make the 15% threshold, in which case you will indeed have thrown away your vote.

&gt;I've also heard we can pick the same candidate for 1 - 3 and that's the most correct way, but also that if a ballot doesn't have 3 different choices (at least) it will be thrown out.

Everything about how the Bernie campaign has run their social media stuff has been about as divisive and full of misinformation as possible, to the point where it seems like the popular viewpoint among his supporters at this point is that they'd rather not vote at all or vote for Trump if he doesn't win.

In short, there's a lot not to like about Bernie supporters right now. Certainly a lot more than there was before they all decided that Iowa meant that they had a God-given right to ensure that Bernie would get the nomination by any means necessary.

I'm sure none of this applies to you and you're just a progressive who wants healthcare and an end to corporate rule... but you might have also noticed these posts:

813,Therealbigteddy,Ok thank you,1582229754,fi7x8vi
814,lewdite,"The answer is “maybe.” Nevada is a one party consent state so it’s perfectly legal for your employer to record conversations between you two. The catch here is that if your employer is recording audio of a conversation that he/she is not a party to and the conversing persons have a reasonable expectation of privacy, recording that conversation is illegal. So your employer will need to post some kind of notice that audio is recorded on premises in order to legally capture audio inside your place of work.",1582238529,fi8e3k9

821,indigostartiger,Rent in Reno has doubled in the past three years and that’s because of all of the people moving from their trash state and pushing gentrification all over the city.,1582243596,fi8ml5p
822,jojofroyo,"Don’t you think the people moving here might have something to do with all the companies and jobs that moved into the state? 

Rent going up is cause of greedy landlords. Not necessarily people coming to Reno. 

But you can blame California and I can blame greedy people",1582245065,fi8oygi
823,indigostartiger,I see what you’re saying and I’ll blame both. The fact that there are more people living in Nevada that were born out of state than people born in state bugs me. I love this state with all my heart and don’t want it to become a mess. Bad ideas and higher taxes are coming from our neighbors and we can’t do anything to stop it.,1582246135,fi8qo3r
824,jojofroyo,"Not like you have to worry about higher taxes that much. It takes constitutional amendments to raise our taxes now (besides county sales taxes I guess)

I'm not going to comment on the rest of your post history that I checked to see where you're from other than to say you might be happier if you got off Reddit and shit and into the real world for a while.

As far as the caucuses go, I would have a hard time voting for anyone who didn't care enough about my home to pronounce it correctly, either out of ignorance, or just to be a dick, like when Trump came here in 2016 and told us that we pronounce the name of our home incorrectly.",1582295942,fia90dz

834,MyronLake,"People who’ve been here awhile, yes, undeniably. It’s a source of pride. That being said... A lot of people in Nevada currently have moved here only recently. I’m guessing they don’t care as much.",1582295983,fia92of

&gt;In 2016, Donald Trump told the state’s constituents that they were using the wrong pronunciation at a rally in Reno. George W. Bush and Michelle  Obama have also gotten it wrong.

Nevada's early / caucus voting = Iowa's caucus system. It's like saying in Iowa you'll caucus for Pete, but if he's not viable you'll caucus for Marianne Williamson, only if she's viable and you're 2nd choice candidate isn't. It's just not gonna happen.

Reposting most of the thread below, with some edits for brevity. 
&gt; It works like Iowa but with some crucial differences. Voters assemble at precinct caucuses and pick their candidate. This is the initial count. If their candidate doesn’t meet the viability threshhold (usually 15%) they can realign to viable candidate. This is the final count.

&gt; The final count determines how many county-level delegates each candidate gets. This total — and not the popular vote — will be used by the media to determine who “won” the Nevada caucus. Like the SDEs in Iowa.

&gt; Like in Iowa the county-level delegates are weighted towards rural areas. In the most sparsely populated counties, 5 voters earn 1 delegate. In Las Vegas, 50 voters earn 1 delegate. Kind of like in the electoral college, it’s possible for someone to get fewer votes but win.

&gt; The county-level delegates vote for state convention delegates who vote for the national convention pledged delegates who pick the nominee in Milwaukee. There’s another 15% threshhold statewide and by Congressional district that candidates must meet to be eligible for these.

&gt; NV has early voting for the first time. 75,000 people cast an early ballot. To put that in context, 84,000 caucused in 2016 total.

&gt; Each ballot has a first choice and two ranked second choices for realignment. The Nevada Democratic Party has until Saturday morning to count all 75,000 ballots and transmit the results to over 2000 precinct caucus locations. If they fail at this there is no caucus.

&gt; [T]hen every single precinct chair has to correctly use these early ballots to tabulate the initial count and realignment. And campaigns can challenge rejected early votes.

&gt; The other thing is there are satellite caucuses called strip caucuses. It’s good in the abstract: strip workers with shifts on Saturday morning can go caucus and get paid. But it’s also shady as hell. If you want to go to a strip caucus you have to ask your manager or union rep. A lot of the workers aren’t even aware they have this option.",1582401677,figncku

I’m 19 and was born, raised, and currently reside in Vegas. This is a no brainer, but make sure your Air Conditioning is always in good shape in both your house and your car. Constantly wax/seal your car’s paint with uv protective wax or better yet, buy a cover for your vehicle, as the summer sun just EATS through car paint. If you have pets, don’t leave them out too long in the summer and keep them hydrated. In Vegas, there is no “roll down windows to cool down” in the summer, AC is a must. Keep an eye on traffic details and announcements as Vegas and Southern Nevada in general suffer from constant accidents and road closures. While it may be hot, the weather is very bipolar. During the fall and spring, it’ll be freezing in the early morning, cool weather before noon, and then hot af later in the day, so always carry a sweater/hoodie just in case. It rarely rains, but when it does, it can causes flooding and such, always make sure your tires are in good condition and slow down. Coyotes can be a problem at times. Housing is fairly cheap here compared to other places, and there are MANY jobs here in the casino/hotel industry.",1583133732,fj9648w

u/CBeitz, the average *low* in Vegas in October is 14.7° (C).  The average high in October is 27°.  You're not going to need a sweater.

In practice the employer does not have to inform you of the reason they decline to hire you so it doesn't do much. The only time I would expect it to help you is if you were applying to a state job. Even then it is as dependent upon the personality/whims of a hiring manager more than anything else. This bill has not been tested in court so the power is still very much in the hands of the hiring company.

As you probably know: drug testing works by looking for the presence of thc metabolites in your urine (or hair blood etc). A person who regularly used cannabis for 1 year should expect to pass those metabolites in urine for somewhere around 2 months, +/- a few weeks. Blood test has shorter window of detection, hair much longer.

So while influenza killed more people so far, that won't be the case if we take too long to react to it. Considering it's 20x deadlier while being much more contagious, you can see why we want to limit it.

Think of exponential growth like this. You have a lilypad that sprouts one lilypad every day. Today, you have one. Tomorrow, it's 2. The next day it's 4. Then 8.

If it covers the whole lake on day 60, do you know what day the lake was half-covered? On day 59.

And do you know what day the lake would be filled at 1%? Day 54. That means from day 1 through day 54, the lake only filled up to 1% of lilypads. Then it took 6 days to fill it completely.

That's just to give you an example of what exponential growth looks like. So just because everyone around you isn't sick yet doesn't mean it won't happen considering how highly contagious this is.

We had bird flu, swine flu, ebola and more. But none caused a pandemic like this. This is something that we should obviously take much more seriously even if you don't personally know anyone that's sick or died or lost a family member from this.

I'm fact, it was the Republican president that said to listen to your local government for orders since he didn't want to have the burden of doing this himself. So listening to Sisolak is listening to Trump. The person who declared this a national emergency.

He plops down in the middle of nowhere, Nevada and literally cements his trailer into desert land. Then he grows the trailer in to a cult like colony of 40+ people at its peak with multiple structures made of collected materials found in neighboring ghost towns.  It's so beautifully crafted my description doesn't do it justice. It's a bit of a relic, if you peak inside of some of the trailers there are logos from companies frozen before and writing's from people who seem to have just vanished. Whenever I stop theres no one there and it's got a spooky feel to it. Lots of sculptures and structures made of found trash, including the original trailer that was built onto into a giant tower so that the great spirit could take the chief away in to the sky when it came back.

Sometime around 1985 (give or take a few years), local authorities found out that Chief Thunder Mountain had two “children” living with him that weren’t attending school.  They were began attending PCHS, one in Jr. High and the other a Sophomore, despite being around 17ish(f) and 22ish(m) years of age.  Looking back at it I always wondered why the 22 year old, being an emancipated adult, was attending school.  I always assumed  it was his choice.  Both of them were very shy and socially awkward.  They were not in school for very long and I never heard about the family again.  

My memory of this isn’t that clear - if anyone else has info about the place or the family I’d love to hear more - but that’s how I recall the situation.

The point I'm trying to make is that Nevada is a unique state during all of this quarantine. We have thousands of people just in Reno alone who survive on tips or working with their hands. The bill's that have to be paid from these tips is going to be tough to gauge since a lot of owners do not report tips to the IRS. Meaning that to the state, those people might not have made over a specific amount to be eligible for more assistance. They were just making 8 bucks an hour to the state instead of their normal living wage.

Here's is Declaration 3 by the governor:

&gt;Non-Essential Businesses, as further defined in regulations promulgated under this Directive, that promote recreational social gathering activities including, but not limited to, recreation centers, clubhouses, nightclubs, movie theaters, massage parlors, adult entertainment establishments, brothels, and live entertainment venues, and any other such Non-Essential Business shall close effective March 20, 2020, at 11:59 p.m., for the duration that this Directive shall be in effect.  
&gt;  
&gt; Non-Essential Businesses that promote extended periods of public interaction where the risk of transmission is high, including fitness establishments such as gyms and studios; aesthetic services such as beauty shops, barber shops, nail salons, tanning salons, and wax salons; and any other such Non-Essential Business shall close effective March 20, 2020, at 11 :59 p.m., for the duration that this Directive shall be in effect. 

If the company you work for is one of the above, the directive seems clear about the necessity of closing?

However, if the company you work for is not one of the above kinds of businesses:

&gt; Businesses not delineated above or in regulations promulgated under this Directive may continue operations, not to include retail sales, if they are able to implement social distancing safeguards for the protection of their employees and:  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Perform operations without contact with the Nevada general public; or  
&gt;  
&gt;\-To the extent practicable, provide services without causing members of the Nevada general public to congregate in a manner contrary to social distancing goals of a minimum of six feet of separation for more than incidental contact; or  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Provide services without causing more than ten members of the Nevada general public to congregate. 

Hope that helps.

However they think that since they're closed to the public, they meet the ""legal definition"" of closed, and that therefore they're fine forcing us to continue coming in. So basically its still open to employees but closed to the public.

There are usually 8+ of us in there at a time (fairly big place), and it sounds like they have no plans for the social distancing thing (and the way the law worded it, only 'essential businesses' have to practice it).

Sisolak's order is to stop people from taking it home, just in case they get sick. I know someone who did this. Here's the situation:

Karen runs into the doctor's office, screaming about covfefe 19 and how it's going to kill her family. She demands SOMETHING be done. The doctor says they're are no treatments available and that she should isolate. Karen keeps yelling non-stop about the murder virus. The doctor finally just gives her a prescription for hydrochlorothiazide so she will leave. If this happens enough, the supply is exhausted and people who actually need it don't have it.

1600,Throwaway16252,"There's a military base in Nevada that plays host to a pretty ridiculous program/experiment that in these times, seems quite on the nose. I won't say which base nor will I give too many specifics. 

A few years ago I took part in a program that essentially put kids ranging from 17 to 22 that were either recommended by significant figures that were in the US Armed Forces or had connections with. I was recommended by an ambassador to an overseas country I was living in at the time.

The experiment was to see how well kids that harboured some degree of knowledge of military and modern weaponry could function in a high tempo bootcamp experience. Essentially seeing if it was possible to train youth as quickly as possible if ever the US government needed them to. Some of us joked around and called it operation red dawn.

My CO thought it was ridiculous, calling it a spawn of paranoia, but it was an interesting study nonetheless.

The program started with around 300, and after 3 days dropped to 120, then 60, then 30. I was part of the final thirty. I won't say much more than that, but I stuck around for the long run and I am proud to say that I've come to look at the people I trained with like brothers and sisters.

The things we trained in, well, our drill sergeant from hell could sum it up better: ""You impubescent fucks are about to get 20 weeks of training down in 5."" I'm paraphrasing it was years ago.

But what we got was wild. As in I'm confident they hadn't shipped this shit out to regular bootcamps or whatever. Like we were guinea pigs on top of being guinea pigs. We used simulated ammunition, essentially paintball bullets most of the time, save for the range and killhouses. 

One of the worst experiences I've ever had in my life, and by worst I mean traumatising, for a recently senior kid who already had a lot of issues. It was a hyper realistic simulated warzone that took place, at a massive set, in the middle of the desert. It was designed to mimic two scenarios, a Taliban incursion, where we essentially play defense and manage medical, or skirmishes.

The problem was that the guys behind this hyper realistic set were really fucking good at their job. I've seen grown men vomit at the sight of the shit they put on display. It was the way of breaking the barrier of reality so soldiers are not only physically, but mentally prepared for warfare.

I grow anxious typing this.

I totally get your concern for your parents. 

So imagine how horrible it would be if your parents went to an outpatient urgent care with a fever and cough, took a test, and was positive for COVID. They are prescribed the malaria drugs.

So you and your parents go to the pharmacy,  and are told,

""Sorry, we're all out.""

""How could you be out?""

""Only about 2,000 Americans a year get malaria. And only about 16,000 Americans a year get lupus. We only carry enough of this medication to handle about that amount of people. They're diseases that don't really 'spike up.' So when doctors across America began prescribing the same medication for the 85,356 COVID patients in America (as of March 27 per the CDC) we quickly burned through our entire supply.""

""So what do I do about my parents?""

""Hope that she continues to have mild symptoms that don't require her to go to the hospital, just like the ~80% of patients that we prescribed this drug to.""

""But that's crazy. You're saying you gave this drug to a lot of people who probably would have recovered on their own and now there's not enough for my mom?""

As in living, Las Vegas is huge and driving across town (which you hardly have to do since there is so much that can be near you) can be 20-30 mins or 40-45 if you have to drive far with traffic. Reno on the other hand is very small and many prefer that. driving somewhere can be 10-15 mins 20 tops.

With the weather, Vegas summers are a killer 100+ degrees most of the time and mild winters. Reno has the typical perfect weather like 80-90 summers and gets cold with snow in the winter occasionally but it melts fast. 

Housing can be an issue. Vegas is fairly reasonable if you have a decent paying job and you can get a nice house in a good side of town for not too much. Reno, as far as I know, has many growing industries such as Tesla that have some factories out there and it is drawing more people to the area and it can be fairly expensive to find a place to even rent.

1760,DC1346,"I used to be Republican but when Trump ran for office I bailed and became an independent. I just couldn't bring myself to vote for him because of all of his bankruptcies and the fact that he screwed over several contractors by withholding payment in a blatant effort to ""renegotiate"" terms even though they had a signed contract. Since he had an army of lawyers at his beck and call, his attorneys filed appeals and stalled for so long that some of these guys went out of business. 

It really rankled me to realize that the GOP was rallying behind a liar and a thief. When the Stormy Daniels pay off came to light, I thought for sure that the evangelicals would drop him. I can't understand why they remain among his most devoted supporters.

Last April I registered as a Democrat but consider myself more of a blue dog Democrat who leans right (or at least moderate) instead of left. 

Under the Trump administration the disparity between the haves and the have nots have become much more graphic. This on-going pandemic has really driven this home.

Not only have tens of thousands of hourly wage earners in Nevada been laid off but despite Governor Sisolak's executive order to suspend evictions, landlords continue to evict their tenants. 

We are setting ourselves up for a perfect storm. This pandemic has been accompanied by widespread unemployment, homelessness, and hunger. Food banks across this country are being overwhelmed, some with as much as a 600% increase in demand at a time when donations are down. 

While the Federal stimulus package was well intended, the IRS won't deposit checks until April 15 ... and they'll only do this if a taxpayer has previously filed an on-line payment. Anyone who HASN'T will eventually get a check in June, July, or August. 

There are a lot of people out there who need help NOW!

Our social services are also being overwhelmed. I read in the Las Vegas Review Journal that unemployment compensation is still being processed for the 96,000 or so applications that came in at the end of March. As more and more applications come in, the state office is falling further and further behind with processing these applications.

The poor (through no fault of their own) are being screwed over and while help will be forthcoming, these people need help NOW not in 3-4 weeks for state assistance or 3-4 months for Federal stimulus checks.",1586153633,fmkfy8x

The only people currently allowed on campus are: district maintenance, school custodians, and cafeteria workers who continue making to-go lunches for our students. Teachers are not allowed on campus at all. If we need something from our classrooms, we have to ask for access from our principal who has to then ask the area superintendent for permission.
