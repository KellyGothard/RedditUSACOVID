I am so honored to have amazing neighbors that have GAVE &amp; offered help with my daughter and I with our house fire this last week. Words cannot express the gratitude and kindness that we have received during this devastating, horrible, &amp; sad experience we have endured.  Basically all my life I have never asked for any help and it has taken all of me to accept and ask that I need help. I don't have a place for my daughter and I. I am desperately looking for a place.  However it has not been easy. Being that I assumed debt of my past marriage &amp; credit isn't great.  Finding a place has been a challenge. I work long and hard for my daughter and I and I make great money, I have 2 jobs. I have great rental, employment,  and personal references . But the credit is standing in my way. I am doing all I can to not break down because I have to be strong for my daughter and of course for myself. I am not a lady to make anyone feel pity for me, as I am a strong women who can hold her own.  But this fire has pushed me up against a wall.  I am just reaching out if anyone has a home that is safe and clean for my daughter with a yard &amp; laundry facilities that I can rent. Please let me know. I don't know else to do. Im looking on Craigslist,  Facebook Market Place, Zillow.  I am at this time staying in a air BNB and also hotels which ever is more reasonable in price.  So if anyone of you out there know of something can you let me know I am not trying to be picky as I am thinking long term. I am not looking for a Room to rent.

I’ll keep a “long story” short and get to it - I’ve been having some shit luck lately, health hasn’t been stellar, income hasn’t been fruitful, and I find myself at the end of my rope this NYE. 
I’m fortunate enough to be on food stamps, but they don’t re-up until the 5th, and though I thought I could wait it out, between the storm and the uncomfortable hunger, I was hoping someone could point me in the direction of something that Google may have missed.


It seems from my searching that there isn’t really anything available late night, so I’m probably out of luck for food this evening, but I would love to be wrong if someone knows of such a thing that exists - soup kitchen? Is that what they’re called? - that can provide a meal in these evening hours to those down on their luck. 


I know there’s a lot of food pantries around during the day but unfortunately I am not very mobile so many aren’t doable. I guess I’m probably looking for something that doesn’t really exist - as I’m pretty bound to SE and not able to get out of my home safely until my medical woes calm a bit - but I’m feeling a bit desperate tonight and figured I’d give it a shot and see what’s available. 


Wishing all of you folks a beautiful New Years and a wonderful decade to come! Sometimes life gets tough and feels hopeless - believe me, I know! - but there is always better around the corner. Life is always worth living, and even in the darkest, stormiest nights things will be okay. The holidays can really isolate people and bring out a lot of depression, but you’re never alone.

First off, thank you all for all the suggestions and everything. Sorry I wasn't responding, but when I had made the post, the cat was kinda freaking out a bit more than it had been. We were trying to call places while also trying to calm it down. Things were obviously frantic.

Fortunately, we finally got someone to come out and help. The cat wasn't injured fortunately, but it did escape into the crawl space. It has multiple exit routes from there, though, and we've put out some food and water. We'll be keeping an eye (and ear) out for it, but are pretty sure it will just take it's chance to disappear.

If the mods approve, I'd like to just give a shout-out to the company that finally helped (and the owner, who was the one who came out to check out the situation and ultimately freed the cat).

I've been looking all day for topics related to this issue and most of them brought me here, where it looks like quite a few Portlanders have already dealt with this for the last few years. A friend was recently victim of a car theft - right outside their house - that is now stuck with a towing company charging more than $500 for retrieval. This sum feels more like a ransom than fees for a service. They don't even know where to file a complaint because the issue seems to be mishandled by every agency, so I'm hoping someone here can provide some suggestions.

The police found the car within hours, but the offhand suggestion to get a tow didn't come with any kind of warning about associated fees or info about where it would be going - they called the next morning to let my friend know where the car was (which ended up being the right company, but the wrong lot). Had they known that the car was going to a tow yard instead of being offered a tow to their home, this whole racket could have been avoided. 

The tow company is maybe a bigger problem. We went to go pick up the car together and the towing company had its doors closed and locked during business hours. Only after calling and leaving voicemails (the only option on their phone line) did someone call us back from their other office to let us know that the person overseeing that lot is sick today and had we scheduled an appointment (not indicated as an option anywhere), they would have sent someone over. Their receptionist was extremely rude and cavalier about the fact that their office was closed without any indication as to why, as well as the fact that it took them TWO days to call my friend back after the first voicemail. They ended up sending someone which took about 35 minutes from call to arrival, and once there, they could not find the car or paperwork - it is apparently in one of their other tow yards. At this point it was after office hours, so we could not get ahold of anyone at those offices to confirm where the car is. 

It's been a lot of trouble, and even worse than the car being stolen is that it feels like the towing company is gouging the \*victim\* for money. PPB is, at best, neglecting that issue and should absolutely not be contracted to work with this company if so. It's bad enough to have to pay that amount to get back something that someone's livelihood depends on, especially since it's being held like they left it in a private parking lot or something. It just doesn't seem right.

[**Vote here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/ejksn8/new_year_new_mods/)

I will answer reasonable questions about my candidacy ITT.

Here is my extended statement on why I think I would be a good fit for modding /r/Portland:

* I am one of the earliest users of Reddit, recently celebrating my 13th Cake Day.
* I grew up in Portland and have lived on both sides of the river.
* I have contributed many solid posts and comments to the sub, including a gilded post.

**A Sample of my Activity in this Sub**

Most recently I [led the early and effective protest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/dfirgl/rally_and_march_against_obstruction_of_justice/) against Gordon Sondland's hotel management company [planned entirely](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/df334n/march_against_obstruction_of_justice_the_heathman/) in /r/portland.

I [do stuff in Portland](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/dqtu1e/our_interactive_burning_man_art_is_on_display/), in scenes that may add perspective or create a bigger tent for this sub.

Not all my posts are serious. [My leaf day post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/9xyybl/leaf_day_on_se_salmon_banana_for_scale/), my [murder in SE post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/9t2sf4/murder_just_now_in_se_real_halloween_scare/), and [Portland's biggest puddle Nominee post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/71facp/portlands_biggest_puddle_nominee/) all illustrate successful efforts to bring simple joy to the /r/Portland's community through observations as I go about my day.

**My Feelings on Moderation of** /r/Portland

I understand how reading content on the web can impact people's days and will use my own moral compass to help moderate in a way that reduces the impact of brigades and unnecessary darkness. I also recognize not everything is sunshine and rainbows and will do my best to ensure Portland is reflected as it is in reality.

I have not agreed with every moderator in the sub. However, I've also engaged in civil discussion with moderators when there are differences of opinion.

I also have not agreed with every decision, such as the controversial banning of the word that shall not be used. However, in time I did come to agree with the reasoning of it and avoid its use everywhere now.

If another issue like this were brought up to vote on the mod team, I would engage in civil discussion with the team, vote my beliefs and follow through with the decision of the entire team.

Most recently I had a positive PM conversation with /u/Fyzzle regarding possible doxxing as a result of linking my identity to my username in my organizing of the Sondland protest.

**I'm asking for your Yea!**

Please [**vote**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/ejksn8/new_year_new_mods/) for me. I'd love to join the /r/Portland moderation team and thank you for your consideration.

235,235,Seirin-Blu,1578090927,ejn0ek,Nan,"Hey, r/Portland. We live in a nice city and I want to make the sub for even better than it already is!

I'm running to be a moderator of this sub because I live in the greater Portland area and I love helping people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who am I?:**

My name is Seirin (well, my alias is) and I've lived in the greater Portland area my entire life. I've seen ups and downs that the city has experiences. I've experienced its food, its art, its architecture, and the people who live in it.

I'm interested in horticulture, math, science, film, and food.

I'm also working towards a major in engineering, so I hope to contribute greatly to the economy of the city and help to keep it beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Experience:**

Currently I, am moderating two other subs

* r/Gresham another local, regional sub
* r/NoteTaking an in-progress sub that will hopefully be able to help other students take notes quickly and effectively

&amp;#x200B;

**What have I contributed to the sub?:**

I'm not going to try and sugarcoat this. If you look through my profile, you'll mostly see plant stuff. So why so little r/Portland posts? Well, as I stated above, I've lived in the greater Portland area, not in or especially close to the downtown area. This means I have less interesting or topical post that would contribute to the sub. I don't want to post posts on the sub that do not contribute to the discussion enough or just seem weirdly out of place, so I don't. I did post a graphic of [Portland in the the style of the Patagonia logo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/7z970d/portland_styled_patagonia_logo/) a while ago.

I do comment more than I post on the sub though. If you look through my comments you still wont see a lot and those comments seem to be a bit political because I believe political issues to be important.

I do fairly actively report post and comments that violate the rules to the moderators to try and help keep the sub the way that the mods intend it to be.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why should you vote for me?:**

While I do hold personal values that others that others may strongly disagree with, I am able to respectfully have a conversation with someone who does not share my values. I feel that removing other's content based on the fact that it does not align with with my values is something that should not be present. Comments that are hateful should be removed however, and I am able to separate those which are just a different opinion than my own and those that needlessly attack another or group.

I have moderating experience. While I haven't been on Reddit as long as some of the other candidates, I know how it works and I know Reddit as well as r/Portland's rules. The two other subreddits I moderate are small, but they are still active and I have worked and am currently still working to make them the best they can be.

I may not agree with all of the moderators, but having diversity of thought in a set of moderators is important. I can bring out different ideas an can allow the best one to succeed.

I used to write notes down every shift about memorable folks or memorable moments that I’d want to remember later. A lot of those notes, looking back on now, mean nothing to me. “Dude with a fucking audiobook” is one of those notes. I can imagine what this could have been, but I remember nothing of that evening.

However this one I remember clearly. It was on July 5th, a normal Friday night through downtown on the 4, but with incredibly memorable bad traffic. Not slow, backed up vehicles, but just folks being idiots. It felt like the entire city was drunk and I was trying to get from point A to point B without harming myself, my passengers, or anyone outside of my bus. 

As soon as I left my layover, it became clear to me that it was going to be a shitty drive through downtown and I made a mental note of every stupid thing I saw until I crossed over the Steel Bridge, quickly writing everything down at my break in St. John’s. I’ve held onto these notes for a bit, thinking I could make a visual of all the stupid commuters in less than a mile stretch, but I haven’t gotten around to it. I’m also not a very good artist, so it would probably come out looking like an illegible child’s drawing. So here we go, with a list of crazy shit I saw in 20 blocks. That’s just about 9 minutes of my schedule, between SW 4th/5th and Jefferson and the Steel Bridge, leaving City Center on the 4. 

-2 scooters traveling down Jefferson, in the middle of the road, going the WRONG WAY. 

-3 bikes traveling on the sidewalk off 6th Ave between Jefferson and Taylor, weaving in and out of pedestrians. 

-Car in service lane behind me at the 6th and Taylor stopped, waiting to turn right at a “NO TURNS” intersection. Yes, they did end up turning right.  (Edit: it couldn’t have been Taylor....that’s a left turn. Maybe Yamhill?)

-Lyft car in service lane parked on the corner of 6th Ave and Salmon at a 45 degree angle, blocking auto and pedestrian traffic around the corner. 

-Lady standing on the corner at Alder, watching the crosswalk count down from 10 and then proceeds when she had a red hand and I had a green. This happens a lot!!  I don’t understand. 

-I’m about to pull out from a service lane at 6th and Harvey Milk and as I’m scanning my mirrors, I see some dumbass on a scooter, in the bus lane, his right arm outstretched at leaning against my bus. Dude, wtf?!

-A couple, licking ice cream cones, jaywalked in front of my bus at Pine, with their tiny child (under 10 years old), at their heels. They didn’t once look back at their child as they ran across my path. This really gets my blood boiling. I have no words for these parents. 

-Car blocked the intersection of 6th and Burnside while traveling East and expecting too much of his green light. The max had to wait for this turd. 

-Car took a left turn onto 6th from Couch—GOING THE WRONG WAY. I flashed my brights and then laid on the “asshole horn”.  He didn’t stop until a bouncer from Silverado walked almost in front of the car and yelled “WRONG WAY, MOTHERFUCKER!”  Thanks, bouncer dude. You’re awesome and your arms are huge. 

-Car decided that they didn’t want to wait behind me when I was at a stop on Everett  and 2nd and gunned it around my left side, took a sharp right through a solid red, almost hitting a cyclist. The car had no lights on and the cyclist was traveling the wrong way on 2nd. It was a perfect recipe for disaster and that moment made my heart almost jump out of my chest. I’m so thankful that no one was hurt or killed.

Let me remind you:  this is less than 10 minutes worth of driving in downtown. That’s how many asshats not doing what they are supposed to do?!  I understand that a lot of folks may be from out of town or just confused. We all make mistakes.  I continue to make driving mistakes all the time. Just because I’m a “professional driver” doesn’t mean that I’m without fault. But this is just ridiculous!!  I wish there was a button we could push that would take a quick snapshot from all of our onboard cameras and we could write tickets at the end of the night. Especially to those hurried folks that like to cut off or dangerously drive around stopped buses. Geeez!!

And as a side note:  if you ever have a grumpy bus operator, it very well could be that they just had 9 minutes (or more) of witnessing crazy drivers and apathetic pedestrians that caused them to be on edge for a moment. It happens. A lot.",Portland,9 minutes of Portland Traffic

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a volunteer tourguide at the Blueback for the last 5 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

In case anyone was wondering, this is the scene where Blueback is featured in the movie ""The Hunt for Red October"":

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsC2ETsZL0g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsC2ETsZL0g)

&amp;#x200B;

Occurs at about 1:43 into the clip.  At the time the film was made, Hollywood wanted actual submarines to film some of that movie.  Those three guys in that super short clip were actual Blueback service members.  They were ironically playing members of the Russian crew, supposedly at twice the hourly rate that the US Navy was paying them.

&amp;#x200B;

If you ever take the tour, the tourguide might point out a picture submarine performing a blow-out procedure (located in the Officer's WardRoom).  That's also a scene from the film, but it is *not* the USS Blueback.  It's the USS Houston.  Common misconception.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, if there are any other questions let me know!",Portland,OMSI USS Blueback: Hunt for Red October Scene

(This person is a saint for walking them all the way to my building.) Then it gets even weirder because when I opened the sealed contacts box, inside were several weeks worth inside a sandwich baggy among the regularly packaged contacts!

I thought it might be interesting to have a broader conversation around protesting in general.   


For those of you who regularly attend or support protests here in Portland....  
1. What do you feel is the primary function of protesting? (Raising awareness, community building, affecting change etc.)  
2. Who are you tailoring your message to? and why? (other activists, liberals, conservatives etc.)  
3. Is there concern amongst the activist community that an increased frequency of protests might reduce their effectiveness?  
4. What are your thoughts on violence/vandalization/destruction of property during protests?  


For those who do not care for protests in here in Portland....  
5. Do you dislike the protests because you disagree with the politics of those protests or do you not like protests in general?  
6. Is there anything that could be done differently by protesters that would make you more open to their messaging or make you think of them more favorably?

395,395,Patrickperks,1578337902,ekynne,Nan,"I’ve been driving in Oregon for 6 years and it’s apparent that most people don’t know what the left lane is supposed to be used for.  You should only be in the left lane if you are passing someone and that’s it.

The ONLY time I am ok with someone slowly passing someone, is if the vehicle is an 18-wheeler or is hauling a trailer.  It isn’t safe for those vehicles to speed too much because of the increased momentum.  Physics 101: Vehicles with a greater mass are harder to stop.

If you are doing any of the below, YOU ARE WRONG:
- Trying to pass someone that’s going 65 MPH and you are going 66 MPH, while in the left lane
- Cruising in the left lane when the right lane is open
- Moving from the right lane to the left lane when someone is obviously about to pass you in that lane
- Being in the left lane but going the same speed as the person in the right lane

If you are doing any of the below, you’re doing it right:
- Using the left lane as a passing lane only
- When using the left lane to pass someone, you are going at least 10 MPH over what the car in the right lane is going
- You’re in the right lane needing to pass someone, but you see someone speeding up in the left lane. You wait for that speeding person to pass, then you move over to the left lane
- You’re in the left lane passing someone and you see someone speeding up behind you.  After passing the car in the right lane, you move over to that lane so the speeding car can pass you.

If you are in the left lane, even if you are going a reasonable speed, and you see someone behind you do any of the following, move over and let them pass:
- See them turn on their left blinker.  This is not a mistake, this is them asking you to move over because they want to pass you.  (I believe EU uses this more the US)
- See them flash their lights at you
- Hear them honk their horn at you
- See them riding your bumper

When driving on the freeway in the left lane, look in your rear view mirror.  If someone is riding your bumper, you are most likely in the wrong.  There are always going to be exceptions where someone is going an excessive speed and being obnoxious, but if you are using the left lane correctly you shouldn’t have any problems with these people as you are out of there way.  For the people that say someone is always riding my bumper, YOU are in the wrong not the people riding your bumper.  Those people are riding your bumper to tell you to get out of the way!!

I’m so tired of getting behind someone in the left lane that doesn’t know how to use it.  Those same people act like they are the victims when they are the ones not following the rules of the road.  Please learn how to drive, it makes it easier on everyone.",Portland,"Dear Portland, please learn how to use the left lane."

Don't know where else to go with this so I'm asking for your guys' help. I am really trying to move to Portland from here in Denver but I am having trouble locking down a job before I move. Are there any local land organizations or conservation groups that I should reach out to in search of employment? With that said - are there jobs to be had in Portland in general? If I were to pack my things up, find a place to live, but with no job - would I be able to find a full-time job quickly in the area? Whether that be at a brewery, retail, outreach, etc. I have a degree in Ecology and curently working towards my Masters in Environmental Policy - I have several years experience working with natural resource groups here in Colorado and I am looking to get out of this state and into beautiful Oregon. Any advice or direction would be helpful, thanks guys!",Portland,Jobs in Conservation/Natural Resource - or just general jobs!

[A Tak board](https://preview.redd.it/grwuj027ve941.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b206bdf695dae503bb6cd87fb1434dff2fa881c1)

## Who are we?

Just a random group of Tak fans from the area. We're not professionals.

## When/Where?

Nothing is set in stone, so far it’s been every other Thursday at Sellwood Public House, join our Whatsapp group for more info.

## What is Tak?

Tak is a two-player abstract strategy game. It was designed based on a description of a fictional game in Patrick Rothfuss' 2011 fantasy novel The Wise Man's Fear.

The objective of Tak is to be the first player to connect any two opposite edges of the board with your pieces, called ""stones"", creating a road. To this end, players will take turns blocking and capturing their opponent's pieces while supporting and connecting their own pieces to build their road. When a player ""captures"" a stone, the stones stack on top of each other and this creates a three dimensional element to the game play.

## Is it hard? How do you play?

The rules are relatively simple, but the strategy has the potential to get complex. It's a beautiful game.

We had settled here because he couldn't find a good software engineering job in Portland, and landed one in Florida instead. Long story short, we really don't see ourselves settling here. We visited Portland several times when we lived out west, and absolutely love it there for so many reasons. 

I have a couple of questions. 

First, my husband and I are curious about job prospects there. We struggled to find him a tech job when we looked last year. Are there any good companies that you're aware of we should be focusing on for software/electrical engineering jobs? We aren't really familiar with some of the smaller companies there and were just curious if there was any to keep an eye on. I thought maybe residents might have some suggestions.

Second, what are some neighborhoods that are ""affordable"" in the area and somewhat safe? We have been living in a more suburban area, but we're open minded. I did a little research and houses seem to be priced significantly higher than we are used to (we lived in Utah and Florida). 

Third, just out of curiousity, what do you like about Portland? For us, it just seemed to fit our vibe. We love food and coffee, and Portland certainly had a lot of it. And it reminded us of Louisville, Kentucky, where we were born and raised, so that was a benefit too. Plus the nature... Wow, you guys have beautiful country around you. I was just curious what some of your favorite things were. 

We are looking forward to visiting again here soon, hopefully to get an idea where we could move to and see places my husband could work, too.

As the title suggests, I won in small claims court, and, as often happens, the asshole who lost has decided he doesn’t have to pay/respond to attempts to collect. 

The internet is full of “information” on the matter, but I was hoping to hear from someone who actually has experience doing this, and doing this here in Portland - as other states info can potentially be irrelevant. 

For some background: I cannot garnish his wages/bank accounts because I do not have that information. As far as I’m aware he’s an independent contractor - although there could be an official “wage job” as well I don’t know about - and I don’t have his social or bank account numbers. 
He has declined to take responsibility for this debt, but he is not in the least bit broke, and I can see he’s having no trouble sending money for all kinds of recreational nonsense over Venmo - which he kept public - as well as prior knowledge of his financial situation - so this isn’t a “blood from a stone” kind of thing. 

I’ve heard mention of selling the debt to a creditor, but I have no idea how that works, if it’s an option, or who to contact. Google has many results, but most seem to be targeted at business - which I am not - or shady. 


Part of my drive to collect is that I do very much need the money, but I knew going in it would be unlikely to see an immediate return - if any. A larger part is the principal, as the situation surrounding this was incredibly fucked up and malicious, and I don’t think he should get off free while enjoying nice nights out - for which he publicly Venmo’s someone $250 for “steak dinner” and the like. 


Anyway, I digress. 
If anyone has any experience with collecting on small claims, dealing with creditors, or anything helpful in this scenario... I would be greatly appreciative!",Portland,Experience collecting on a small claims debt?

Yeah. It's been going like that.


I have ""price for life"" at $85/month minus $10/month customer loyalty, so $75/mo.


I guess the $65/mo, at least that I can tell, is a slightly different offer - not guaranteed as a ""price for life""? And pre-paid?

668,668,asian_guy_at_work,1578609373,emhac6,Nan,"Hello,

The place I work is located in Clackamas, Oregon.

This year, they changed our sick leave/time off policies. Below is for non salary, full time, personnel. 

Previously, for new employees,  you had 10 vacation days to accrue with a max of 15.

Separately, you had 12 sick days to accrue with a max of 30. 

Minimum total is 22, maximum total is 45.

The policy changed as such. There is no more sick time, instead it is all Paid Time Off (PTO).

New employees can accrue 15 days off in a year and have a max of 20 total at any given time.

Oregon Law states: 

""Employers with 10 or more employees provide 40 hours of paid sick leave to full-time staff each year. 

Employees may rollover up to 40 hours of unused sick leave a year.

Up to 40 hours of unpaid leave must be made available to all full-time employees.

FAQ from oregon.gov: Q. Is “front-loading” sick time or paid time off (PTO) allowed?
 
A. Yes. An employer is allowed to “front-load” (give 40 hours of sick time or PTO all at once at the start of the year or when the employee becomes eligible to use sick time) instead of using the accrual method.""

Q. Is it permissible for an employer to use the front-loading method for full-time employees and the accrual method for part-time employees?
 
A. Yes. An employer may award sick time on an accrual basis for certain categories of employees while front-loading sick time hours for other categories of employees, as long as any distinctions the employer makes are consistent and unrelated to the obligation to provide sick time. For example, an employer may award sick time on an accrual basis for part-time or temporary employees, while front-loading sick time for full-time employees, if it customarily maintains different employment conditions for part-time, temporary, and full-time employees.

So my current situation is that, I don't have any time at the start of the year that I didn't carry over from the previous year. All the time I have accrued is PTO. I do not have a bank of dedicated sick time hours, nor was I front loaded 40 hours for sick leave or PTO. Any time off I earn is accrued by working.

Is my company complying with Oregon State Laws regarding sick time?

Employees here do not accrue any sick time nor is any front loaded and all accrued time is classified as PTO. Also, I do not believe our employee handbook talks about our unpaid sick leave benefits, but I will double check.

What are your thoughts? Also, my company has offices in WA, Alaska, and elsewhere but I am not sure if it is classified as a different company in those states.

“Much Ado About Nothing!” is a Shakespearean favorite, and Magenta  Theater’s intent to bring it to the Vancouver stage ‘with a twist’  should interest both Shakespeare aficionados and those who claim to not  be fans of the playwright.   
 

What’s it about?  Beatrice and Benedick are adamant in their mutual  dislike, while Claudio and Hero are deeply in love. The two stories take  an unexpected course when their world is shattered by a scheming  malcontent who makes a shocking accusation.  Throw in some ""helpful""  friends and relatives against the backdrop of WWII Europe and you have  the ingredients for a comedic romp, with a hint of romance and betrayal.   
 

Auditions for the 20 roles and understudies will be held Monday, January  27th, 2020 at 6:30pm at the theater   
A lot of great roles for men and women.  We especially would like to  have a nice turnout of men since there are many parts available.   
 

Magenta Theater embraces non-traditional casting.  English accents will  be used where applicable.   
 

Ages are fluid but age appropriateness will be considered.  18+ Adults,  unless pre-approved.   
 

No Pay.  All volunteer.   
 

ROLES:   
 

Don Pedro         Colonel    - British – Male   
Claudio             Lieutenant - British – Male (role requires on-stage  kissing)

A Messenger      Base Messenger    British – Male / Female   
Leonato              Base Commander    British – Male

Hero                  Young daughter to Leonato – Nurse  British –  Female (role requires on-stage kissing)   
 

Beatrice             This role will most likely be cast by a known  quantity within the company, so if it   
                     is the only role desired, you have been warned.   Do not want to waste your time.   
 

Margaret            Hero's friend – Nurse    British – Female (role  requires on-stage kissing)   
Ursula                Hero's Assistant – Maid    British – Female

The earliest people to leave make it just fine. The people that wait a little too long might get lucky.


As a little bit of snow accumulates, the first victims are at the hills in the higher elevations, places where cars bottleneck even at the best of times. A BMW slides sideways on the on-ramp in Tigard and then I5 gets slower and slower, and progressively more slippery. Conditions worsen by the hour.

The grocery stores are packed full of people, panicking. For some reason they buy gallons and gallons of milk and tons of bread. I've never figured this part out. All the grocery stores will have only raisin bagels and challah left. One big sedan gets stuck in the parking lot and everybody's there for over an hour while some Good Samaritans push it out.


Meanwhile, the cars stuck on the freeway are running out of gas as they run their heaters. A California escalade and a giant brodozer pass everybody on the shoulder at 55 miles an hour. All the drivers see is a huge cloud of diesel and the fading ""Oregunian"" decal as they blast past.


A panicked woman abandons her car on a major boulevard in southwest and forces all the cars to stop behind her to go around the bus. A minor fender-bender turns into a hellacious traffic jam.  The ubiquitous Subarus do well but even with traction the major hills become impassible as the snow turns to ice.

People who have never used chains in their life install them on the wrong wheels of their car. They put them on loose and you can hear them slapping the side of their car, destroying the wheel well. 



Smart people take the bus, although that's not always reliable either. People get on the bus by the hardware store holding giant heavy grave digger shovels, sheepishly explaining that the store had sold out of snow shovels. 



The lines at the liquor store go out past the tequila aisle.


 My neighbor gets his quad out, and after drinking a couple of suitcases of Coors light, he blasts up and down the street doing cookies and turnin brodies like a psychopath. 


Painfully, dog owners feel like there's a moratorium on scooping after the snow shows up.

They are usually pretty tame but I feel like every single time I walk out of my building to grab lunch or run an errand I’m heckled for change/ smokes even while I’m on the phone or walking with a coworker by numerous bums. Even ignoring them doesn’t work now. 

A few times this week while waiting for the max I’ve been cornered and felt super uncomfortable/ unsafe with how close they got to me. One even tried to steal a cigarette right out of my hand and the other acted like they were going to assault me when I told them I don’t have any money.

Buses are Big Things^tm. Please give them extra stopping room and let them out when they’re leaving a stop. You should be leaving extra room and traveling safely anyway but it bears repeating. 

Schedules are right out. Buses and trains cannot run early but odds are they will be late.  You may even see buses bunched up together, two or three in a row although we try to avoid that. We do our best to stay on schedule but it’s difficult with ice and snow.  Plan for this. 

Buses may be on snow routes, meaning some stops may not be serviced. Last year on the 72, at certain points we weren’t serving the Sandy stops or the stops going up the hill to the 82nd max stop, due to sliding concerns. When in doubt, call or text 503-238-RIDE for information about closed stops. 

We are told not to go to the curb. Snow gathers in the curb, buses tend to slide, and chains can break if we curb it. We are told to stay in the street and have passengers walk to the bus. 

*WAIT FOR THE BUS TO STOP MOVING/SETTLE **BEFORE** APPROACHING*. I can’t tell you how many people started surging forward and my bus was sliding just slightly. Be safe and wait. 

I’ll be out driving this year like I was last year. It’s challenging to drive in ice and snow, but we can be safe. I hope y’all get to enjoy it and everyone is safe.",Portland,"Using transit during ice and snow, a how to"

2. Ride the bumper of the car in front of you. Makes it more fun when you can tap into them and synchronize slide.

3. Be sure to take your insta pics mid spin.

4. Don't bother with those headlights. And no, getting that broken tail light won't be necessary.

5. When coming to a stop, don't bother; stop signs are optional in snow.

6. Be sure use scalding hot water on your windshield when it's iced up. Works like a gem.

7. Never driven in the snow? Be sure to head up to Mt. Hood for your first driving lesson. As a woman said on the news, ""Everyone I talked to said we won't need chains or anything."" They're totally right. Totally.

8. When parking on a hill, but close to as many cars as you can. That way when you start sliding, you take the rest of them out.

9. Pack a lunch and a sled for getting stuck. And some Husky's, too.

10. If you get stuck on the side of the road, find a pole and lick it for good luck.",Portland,10 tips for driving in the snow...lol. Feel free to add to the list.

836,836,adamwelshhh,1578768277,enbbg8,Nan,"Portland has arguably the slowest drivers and the most hesitant drivers in the country. I’ve driven in many other cities where the drivers are more fast and aggressive, but they completely know what they’re doing for the most part. That doesn’t exist here. When driving here, especially in the left lane on freeways, so many people drive so ridiculously slow. Like I’m talking 5 MPH under the speed limit. People in Portland don’t understand that the left lane is for passing, not for slowing down traffic. With hesitant drivers, it blows my mind on how slow people pull out in front of people. It’s not hard to accelerate to get in traffic. Merging is also a pain in the ass here. So many people either wait until the very last second to merge, or drive 35ish on the entry ramp. Speed up. Another reason why drivers here piss me off is due to not knowing what to do at 4 way stops. If you get there first, go! It couldn’t be anymore basic to understand. A lot of the times, when turning, people almost come to a complete stop for no apparent reason. I have to leave way more space than I want to. Signaling at the last minute is also very frustrating, and that’s a very common occurrence here. I prefer aggressive drivers over hesitant drivers any day if they week because most people who drive aggressively know what they’re doing. To add onto hesitant driving, so many people brake check when it not needed. If it’s a green light, or if the flow of traffic is moving at a good speed, just keep going. I hate it when people brake check when the person leaves a lot of space behind them. 

Thoughts?",Portland,Driving in Portland has made me hate driving.

That said, there's just something screwy about this whole ""pronoun revolution."" Case in point: I went to a large ""intro to improv comedy"" class thingy last year. There were at least 40 people in this huge circle. Everyone was told to state ""your name and your pronouns."" Try to imagine a group of 40 people, stating their names, and then, ""he"" ""her"" ""him"" ""she"" whatever. There wasn't a single non-male/female pronoun. And the larger point is that no one is going to remember what each person said anyway, and almost no one in the group is going to see each other again! It was literally ridiculous!

I share the above example to make a point, but it goes deeper than that. There's something screwed up going on when someone who is, for example, *literally* female (i.e., has female reproductive organs), not simply wants to be called ""they"" instead of she (I roll my eyes a bit at it, but okay...), but when one is essentially *corrected* when referring to this obviously female person as ""she"". And this is the most ridiculous part: one is effectively, if not literally, told by the ""pronoun police"" that they are *discriminating* against this girl/woman by referring to her as a girl/woman. That's just going too far.

It feels like being at a party, and someone's daughter (can one say ""daughter"" anymore, or is that, too, discriminatory?...) is dressed up like a princess, and she wants everyone to refer to her as ""Princess Unicorn"" instead of her name, and you have to go along with it. *But in the real world, with adults*.",Portland,"Anyone else irritated when you're essentially forced to ""name your pronouns""?"

I had my car stolen out of my driveway Friday night, and I’m hoping you can help me. It is a blue, 2018  Kia Forte, license plate 388KWF.  It doesn’t have anything to set it apart, no stickers or anything identifying.  It was seen right off of Oak and 181st Saturday morning, and again at Halsey and 181st that afternoon, so I’m Hoping that it hasn’t gotten too far (it had less than 50 miles worth of gas in the tank as well) 

The only thing I can think of is that my spare key, which was lost was picked up by someone, who decided they needed my car more than I did.  

If anyone sees it, please please please call the cops and report it.

I grew up with hummingbird feeders and a bunch of hummingbirds around. I was changing my feeders this morning so I thought I would chime in.

Oregon has year round hummingbirds and seasonal ones. With the weather coming up make sure to check on your feeders. A lot of people think the feeders are cute but don't properly maintain them. 3 to 1 water to sugar is a good ratio. Only white sugar, no brown sugar, sugar substitutes or molasses. All that stuff makes the guys sick. You can get hummingbird food but that's just kind of a waste in my opinion. Make sure the feeder is clean. They can get gunked up with a black type of mold. A small pipe cleaner and rinse/scrub will work well.  Feeders in the summer should be changed every couple of days with the heat. Winter time you can go about a week or so, (in my experience), before changing. No need to fill it all the way. Unless they are draining it, get a feel for what they eat and fill accordingly. If you think you don't have any birds then odds are you aren't changing the water enough. It can go rancid quickly and then they will avoid it. A new guy may stop by, try it and bounce quickly. If the food is good they will stick around.  My friends went from a bird in occasion to having to refill every couple of days. Word spreads if you maintain the feeder. Also, keep it high off the ground. Cats like easy pickings.

Thats all I know. Feel free to chime in with your own advice. As I said, I'm not an expert and am not claiming to be one. Good luck out there everyone! And does anyone have a good kale recipe?",Portland,Let's talk about our hummingbird friends this time of year

Sadly, my buddy's work van was stolen early this morning (Saturday 1/11). It was parked on a side street outside his home in the Roseway neighborhood, not too far from Sandy blvd &amp; 68th. It has been reported to the police, but I'm hoping to reach out to as many folks as possible to help find it. He has his own business, and without his van, things are going to be tough. The license plate is: VRK 600. A photo is attached below. It is a 1997 Chevy Astro with black and gold pinstripe around the whole body. The pinstriping is unique for this van, not many have it.

I am in the very early stages of exploring a relocation with my job to the Portland area, presumably later in the year.

My wife and I have about a half-dozen small reptiles, none of them snakes, and the largest among them being a Blue-Tongue Skink.

For the past couple of years we've been running a non-profit to train and supply service dogs for lower income individuals, we're ending the endeavor and returning to the ""regular"" workforce. Over that time we've inevitably taken in a few dogs who washed out of service dog work due to health issues or inability to grasp the training. As such we currently have five dogs (a Great Dane, two retired Malinois, and two chi-weenies both of which are under 11lbs). All are well behaved and house trained. 

We've been looking for something within an hour or so of the metro area for under $1700 a month, preferably at least 2 beds and 1 bath. After contacting multiple ads on Craigslist and a rental management companies we've had no luck. Obviously our situation is unique and we're more than willing to pay a larger deposit or a couple extra months up front.

Does anyone know why I might be getting charged sales tax on an online retail transaction? I will avoid saying the company's name in case this is a temporary/technical fluke on their end. I'm not trying to call anyone out here. I will just say that they are a bigger corporation, not a small business.

The item being purchased is just clothing - a straight up physical goods purchase (i.e. not travel/hotel/rental car, nothing medical, nothing special by any means, etc.).

As far as I know - and not that this makes a difference, unless I'm unaware of very recent changes - the company is not based in Oregon, but I do know that they have physical stores here.

I've heard inklings about companies imposing trickle-down fees to their customers in order to offset their own corporate taxes, but for some reason I pictured that being specified at the time of purchase as a ""processing fee"" as opposed to just ""sales tax"", which it is being called in this particular case.

I'm not looking to make this a debate about whether or not we should pay sales taxes, I'm just looking out for proper discourse of laws, and for my own educational benefit in the case that I am missing a newer law that went into effect (again, Google failed me, so that's what brought me here).

1254,1254,Bigred503,1579230604,epuh0h,Nan,"Good afternoon Portland. So I live in a duplex in Multnomah county and recently we had a moisture problem in my bedroom. I woke up and pulled my bed away from the wall and the paint was bubbling and I could pull my hand away from the wall and it would come back wet. Oh and mold on the baseboards and also the ceiling has bubbles on the paint! So I immediately called our emergency repair line and they brought some people out to look at it. I had a dehumidifier running in there for about four days and pulled roughly 20-25 pints a day from the corner of my room. 

it has been two weeks since I reported the issue. They had two companies come out for estimates but I have yet to hear from my landlord about the fix. Because there is no way to get in the attic to fix it they'll have to cut open my walls and ceiling to find the issue. Looking at landlord tenant laws if I file a written repair request (which I've done online on their repair website they use) and give them thirty days to fix it can I legally withhold rent if they do not repair it on time? I'm confused reading the laws 🤭 

I found this in the habitability section,""If the landlord fails to supply any of the things in the list above, or fails to fix or replace any of the things in the list that break, a tenant has some important legal rights, including:
The right to break the lease, if the rental agreement is for a fixed term. 
The right to collect damages for reduced rental value.
The right to vacate the unit and seek substitute housing.If the unit is not habitable, to withhold rent.

1258,1258,BridgeCityBus,1579232271,eputcl,Nan,"Just recently, I had a meeting with a manager. I got my first SIP. SIP stands for Service Improvement Process and we get these when someone calls in a complaint on the operator. It can be things like passing up a stop, driving too fast, driving too slow (you’re always late), making someone feel uncomfortable, being grumpy, doing something you’re not supposed to do, or not doing something you should be doing. It can be anything, really. Whatever you can imagine complaining about, we get those in our mail. 

I got to the garage and grabbed my mail early the other morning. I had to sign for this piece of mail because a manager had written it. It was a SIP. For a moment, I was a little proud. “You’re not doing your job unless you get a SIP,” is what went through my mind. I opened it expecting a passed-up stop. There have been several times where I’ve looked for customers and they weren’t at the stop, only for me to see them running for it beyond my point of “stop”. I have to keep moving because there is no safe place for me to meet them.  It’s unfortunate but it happens. I’d be okay with a SIP like this, because I could own up to it. 

But no. This SIP was a serious accusation.  It was from someone who took the time out of their day to write a letter and mail it to TriMet, stating that I acted on racism. They felt, in their heart of hearts, that I kicked a man off my bus because of his race.

I remember this evening pretty clearly. It was the same evening that I wrote up “The passengers (and more!) of TriMet, part 1”. I had two men on my bus who got into an argument about space in the priority seating area. I first pulled over and told them both to knock it off or I would ask them both to leave.  Soon after pulling back out into rush hour traffic, I heard one man continue on about it so I asked him to leave, kicking him off the bus two stops before he had planned to disembark. Between me telling him that the next stop was going to be his and getting to that said stop, he stood behind my right shoulder and said some pretty mean things. I don’t remember what he said exactly, but he was angry and did not want to get off the bus. It rattled me a bit. I try not to take mean words personally, but it’s hard to just continue on like nothing happened. I was shook. A few stops down the road, I turned around and asked the other man if he was alright. In retrospect, I did this for myself. I needed a little breather and a welfare check, of sorts, as I was almost in tears. Also in retrospect, I made a big mistake by doing this.

Just to be clear. I’m not writing this story up to defend myself and my actions.  I can’t take away the feeling that the complainant had: that I was being racist. How do you defend yourself from such an accusation?  “I have friends who are black.”  “I have family who is black.”  “I was married to a man from the other side of the world, from a tiny little country that you have likely never heard of.”  “I’m not racist!”  You know these little anecdotes don’t work when you clearly believe that someone is racist. We all have to check our biases. None of us are perfect. I’m not perfect. But I can tell you, without a doubt, that I do my best every day to treat everyone equally, no matter who they are. I believe that race, religion, sex, gender, disability and age don’t define who you are or how you should be treated.

There has been nothing that has hurt and angered me more than being discriminated against or abused because I am a woman. I was passed up for a promotion once because I am a woman (that was a reason they actually gave me, so I didn’t even have to wonder why), I’ve been grabbed and groped at clubs like Dirty and Dixies, I was raped by a man who walks free on the streets of Portland, who I am constantly worried about running into. I KNOW that anger, yet I can only imagine that anger if I was a woman of color and felt discriminated against by this society when it came to housing, or work, my daily commute, or any other thing that some asshat decided they wanted to be a dick about. 

Portland is a very white city. We have a very recent history of terrible racism here. This is something that we should all be sensitive to, and we need to stand up and speak out in times when we witness an injustice. I’m not mad at the person who wrote this complaint. He’s doing his part to make our city better and to hold TriMet to high standards of not tolerating employees who are going to discriminate against the public because of their color of skin or any other reason. 

TriMet takes these complaints very seriously, as they should. In my meeting with the manager, we were able to go over the video and audio of the incident. The manager had taken a lot of time to transcribe it before the meeting, clicking “play” and “rewind” and “play” and “rewind”, over and over. It took him over an hour to transcribe probably 8 minutes of video.

As we are watching this video, I get an interesting view into my bus. I see a face I recognize from an angle I’ve never see them from, and I get to watch the passengers of my bus for longer than I am normally able to. It’s kinda cool, except I have to watch and listen to myself, which is just weird.

I watch as the men get on at separate stops. I watch as they begin their initial argument, followed up by my awkward voice of telling them both to cool it.

This is when I only heard one man continue on. In the video, however, you can see that the other man is actually continuing this argument quietly. He’s basically egging on the other guy, who I eventually kicked off.  My actions follow, and this is how the witness came to believe that I was being a terrible, racist bus operator.    As he saw it, a white man and a black man get on the bus. They are both assholes to each other and, by default, to everyone else on the bus. The bus operator, who is white, kicks off the black man and then asks the white man if he is “okay”. Yeah, that looks bad. 

It definitely didn’t help that I “checked in” with the man who I did not kick off.  It looked bad. I get it. I fucked up. I didn’t know at the time I had fucked up, but I did. According to the manager, I should have kicked them both off the bus at separate stops. They were both part of the problem. And I agree. 

My worry is that if this exact situation happened again, how could I do better?  I couldn’t hear everything that was happening from the driver’s seat. I’m worried that I’ll end up kicking off an innocent bystander next time “just to be fair”. Obviously, I won’t “check in” with a specific person next time. That was unprofessional on my part to begin with, since I didn’t have a clear picture of what was going on in the first place. 

I guess what I’m trying to share here is that it can be very difficult dealing with the public and all the arguments and crap that comes up at the same time I’m driving a bus through the city. The manager gave me some good tools and ideas for next time there is an argument like this, but I could also use your help.

You, as a passenger on a bus or max train, are able to observe the inside a whole lot better than the operator is. Our attention is mostly on the road. And as my manager pointed out, when there is an incident on the bus, we tend to drive a whole lot slower, sometimes by 10 mph, because our attention is now divided between the outside and the inside. If you see something that is worrisome, please let the operator know. If you feel uncomfortable doing that, you can always call, text or even tweet TriMet. If you feel that the operator is making the wrong call in a specific situation, let them know. They could be missing an entire part of an interaction.

I know, this is a lot to ask of you. In all honesty, I don’t know if I could be that passenger that speaks up. We’ve seen what can happen when someone speaks up. The trial has begun for Jeremy Christian, and the news is a constant reminder that there are very disturbed, violent people in our midst. All it takes is being in the wrong place at the wrong time and any one of us could end up killed by a sick individual.  So I understand if you’re thinking “Ha!  You’re nuts, BridgeCityBus!  I’m not putting my nose where it doesn’t belong!”  That’s cool. But please understand that I’m doing the very best that I can. I’m forced into this weird role of “authority” that yes, is required by the job, but I really don’t like.  I hate having to remind people to behave for the next 10 minutes. I hate having to kick people off my bus. It’s the worst part of this job. But I gotta do it. And with a little bit of help from you, it could be so much easier with a lot less fallout. Just sayin. Thanks for riding!  Y’all are fantastic people!!",Portland,BridgeCityBus’s first customer complaint

First off this is my first post so please forgive me if this has been covered and feel free to point me to any recent relatable subjects for me to review. 

I have an opportunity to move to Portland from SD where the cost of living is low. I currently make ~60k a year and have $1,000 in expenses a month (no rent or home ownership). What I’m needing to find out is the cost of rent/home ownership if I would make 81k (90k but 10% which is a non negotiable expense for me). I’m single with no gf or family, but I want to be able to plan and save for a family as well as enjoy my time there (have $ for entertainment, outings, etc). Also, I would work in the heart of DT so while I don’t mind transit I’d prefer to not have more than a 45 min commute one way.

Yeah, I stroked a puddy tonight.  Go ahead.

I spoke with one of the employees about the business.  She said overall, the business was doing fine.  The ""cat side"" is outshining the café, but they're considering increasing their food offerings to bump café sales.

And the cats were all super-chill.  We got to meet 4 of them.  There was a family there when we arrived and they had 8 cats available, but the parents were there to help their kid choose a cat.  So when we left, only 7 cats available.

And speaking of the café, the sandwich I got was great.  I think it's Little T bread, and boquerones, arugula, pickled peppers, and house-made aioli.  Really delicious.

This post is not about me, it is about my brother and millions of people like him. His life started out great, but when struggling and making minimum wage he got a speeding ticket. The fine was $280, he could not pay it, drove illegally got a few more and it became insurmountable, he took a 357 to his mouth. This is where I am going, think about that when you write that ticket LEO's. Yeah you should get fined for speeding but $280 for a minimum wage earner; it is just wrong. BTW - don't give me that shit about going to court and getting it reduced. I have done it and as a white guy - it is a waste of time.

Fines are way too high for the infractions, $280 is like a week of work for what? One of my employees got pulled over and got a $180 ticket for a headlight out during the day. This has to stop this is the public employees needing so much cash they crush citizens for no reason.

1324,1324,fidelitypdx,1579290119,eq5agk,Nan,"This last Wednesday morning at my bus stop I came across a neat pile of abandoned paperwork. At first it just appeared to be discarded litter, but my eye caught the recognizable blue trim of an Oregon DMV vehicle registration card. The paperwork was a bit soggy, but still firm enough to sort through. I found Acura maintenance paperwork, vehicle insurance cards from Geico, change of registration DMV paperwork, and several other papers. 

My heart sank, my first inclination was that one of my neighbors had their car broken into, as this pile of paperwork is exactly what someone would keep in the glove box. The name and address was all over these documents, a house about a mile away from the bus stop, so it definitely wasn’t the owner on their way to the DMV who walked out of their way to this bus stop, then left these behind. On the Acura maintenance documents I found a phone number, called and texted them. 

We connected over text message and the person verified their vehicle had not been broken into, and I agreed to drop off the paperwork afterwork that night.

When we met in person they confirmed that they tossed their paperwork out in the trash. His trash day was that morning, hopefully whomever took the documents took them that morning and had not held on to them for long enough to do any identity theft.

I’m sure it was a wakeup call for this person to shred or destroy documents. 

But another important lesson is that the people digging through your blue bin will try and steal your identity. They’re not *just* looking for cans, they’re looking for anything of value, and that includes your documents. Within the tweaker community there is a marketplace for stolen documents to assist with identity theft.  

I’m not far enough into the tweaker community to know the threshold of which particular documents are necessary to try and steal someone’s ID or impersonate someone, but generally speaking they’re looking for bills, they’re looking for official documents, they can take these legitimate documents and combine them with forged documents. Even if on the first raid of your bin they only get part of the documents they can remember whey they got that score, come back and keep looking. They want to apply for credit cards, they want to get fake IDs through the DMV.

TL;DR: tear your documents into a few pieces before recycling, or better bet: shred them.",Portland,Don’t throw out your papers in the blue bin.

We figured that they were a few rich/bored nerds with fancy drones, but the flying in formation in thick fogs seems a little weird.

This year I've started a new program I call the Free Gutter Cleaning initiative, I go out to the homes of those in our community who either can't afford it, are senior citizens, or are disabled, and I clean their gutters for free!

If someone can't afford it or would rather not risk the dangerous task of climbing on a roof or ladder to clean out their gutters, they can get ahold of me and i'll gladly do it for them rather than them risk a potential serious fall and injury.

I'm also doing it as a way to give back to the community, to try and motivate other local companies to give, and because it feels really good to help those in need!

I initially got my signups through craigslist and facebook groups and recently a local news outlet clarkcountytoday has run a story on my program.

https://www.facebook.com/ClarkCountyToday/posts/869689076794087

https://www.clarkcountytoday.com/business/safer-better-brighter-fostering-community-by-cleaning-gutters/

When I first started doing the gutter cleaning I had limited the work to Clark County, but in the recent weeks I have opened it up to our neighbors in Portland, OR. 

Since I do most of my work in Vancouver, it's not much of an extra for me to hop over one of the two bridges to go help someone in need in PDX.

Since I love what I do so much and have invested thousands into the proper professional gear, for me to take on free jobs to help keep people safe and save them a few hundreds bucks is a privilege.

If anyone on R/Portland has a home in dire need of getting its gutters cleaned and currently aren't in a financial position to pay for it, or you're elderly, disabled, or have other hardships in life (cancer/disease suffering) then I will come out and do it free of charge.

To get ahold of me for the gutter cleaning for Vancouver residents (or elsewhere in Clark County) just send me an email on my website with the subject ""Free Gutter Cleaning""

You can read more about the initiative and contact me here

If you have an issue with it, you will be cancelled on and likely assessed a $5 fee. It is actually in the Uber terms of service and I can get reported for unsafe pickups/drop offs.

I believe the real objective is measurable results: testing, graduation rates, completion of college/top schools, good jobs for life, and even alumni contributions to the school as a result. 

Architects are architects so ask users. But that is not funders. 

It's proven money is better spent reaching back from high schools to middle and elementary schools and preschool-0 to K along with a strong engagement with every, every parent, every every day. 

The architects followed architect plan - ask the building users their dream. But the Portland School Board Chair Julia Brim needs to recontextualize the project. It's not about how much money you can bond. It is about student results. 

Dream school building is a false objective. Dream student outcomes are not a dream, they are what we pay for.

Well if you answer ""Yes"" to any of these I'd first like to start off by saying I know personally what you are going through. Also lets not blame the P.P.B. necessarily Oregon law is worded very atrociously. 

I've had nights where I have caught people in the act of breaking into cars and dispatchers don't take the calls as serious as they should because the one thing I tend to hear is that since the vehicles are not mine and say they do catch the thieves since an r/O (Registered Owner) is not around it's usually pretty hard to press charges. 

I also lack certain other things such as equipment (Cameras) when I catch them and if their is a group of people catching everyone is very difficult lucky I can catch one and keep them on scene till police arrive. 

My proposal is pretty simple looking to find a group of people who have time to volunteer and patrol neighborhoods that are impacted the hardest. Also taking request and inquiries from others in the future who would like for us to simply check the neighborhood a few times and help everyone restore not just a sense of community but also restore your peace of mind that your vehicles are alright. 

If you are interested in volunteering or if you have a part of town you'd like for me to occasionally patrol on foot let me know. Even better if anyone wants to be kind enough to donate equipment I can use to catch people in the act and turn over to police to help identify car thieves that would also be appreciated. I know this is a far shot but I do not mind helping my community feel at ease if I can.

The company is taking on water very fast. The new CEO has purchased the Coco's and Carrow's brand of restaurants that he previously worked at, soon after replacing the previous CEO. In addition to this happening, he has also, very ambitiously, slated remodels and and a rebrand (dubbed Shari's 2.0) that you can already see floundering on Halsey. There has been new computer/PoS system that is currently being implemented, and floundering miserably as it doesn't report between other software that is currently in use. Before this happened, the sum of our accounts would typically total over $2 million in liquid assets; now that is just simply not the case.

As a result of buying on the additional restaurant chains, and throwing money at a remodel in the middle of the slowest time of the year, many of our vendors haven't been paid for invoices dated as far back as Nov'2019. If you are one of these vendors, I am terribly sorry. I understand many of the landscapers and such that service our more-remote locations are single-operators and depend heavily on their month-to-month cash flow. Many locations are having their rent/lease payments withheld, to create more cash to move to other vendors, and are literally days/weeks away from a property manager showing up and simply locking the doors and putting dozens out of a job.

All of the in-house IT members have been fired, save for 2 people. The CFO quit because he didn't want to be involved in other unscrupulous goings-on, and the other two members of the financial team have also abandoned ship, as they were being instructed to do shady things, as well. The company is no longer PCI DSS compliant; so if you are using your credit/debit cards at any of our locations, your information may be at risk. If you work in the chain you may already be aware of the issue that happened with Direct Deposits, and the many people who tried to cash their checks last pay period. Our previous bank has *fired us* and we didn't have the appropriate team members present to quickly fix the problem, soany big strings were pulled *by the new bank* to ensure paychecks went out that day.

Just this last week, our previous investors have backed out and we only managed to procure a new Letter of Intent with new backers, otherwise the Great Closure would have happened already. I'm trying not to rant, as much as paint a picture of what is happening in the inside. I have enjoyed living in this area, and Shari's is personally part of my history as I am sure it is for others. Or maybe it's just a paycheck for you.

Regardless, if you rely on Shari's (or Coco's or Carrow's) for a paycheck, I **highly** advise you to prepare to land on your feet, financially, within the next few weeks/months. There's no telling when the hammer will fall; we are literally struggling day-to-day here.

A friend has offered to cater for free (100+ people). However, the venue says that since meat will be served as a main-course meal scenario, only a licensed caterer can prepare and serve the food. Mostly they are concerned that the kitchen (outdoor smoker/grill) he will be using has not been inspected and licensed by the state or what have you. 

I am confused by this - He has food handler certification, we are not using their kitchen or kitchen staff, their staff will not touch our food (buffet-style) and it will only be our close friends and family - not any of their patrons. They have said that homemade baked goods and desserts are fine to make at home and bring in. I don't know the law well enough to understand the difference. The venue is ""new"" to this also - only having rented the space for one similar event in the past.

Don't know where to begin looking. What are the laws about this? Can you inspect and license and outdoor smoker? They are concerned about litigation of some sort. Are there any workarounds like a licensed kitchen you can rent for a day if you have a food handler certification?

1686,1686,fidelitypdx,1579736066,eskalw,Nan,"I emailed this to TriMet recently and figured it might be useful to share my gripes more publicly. 

Dear TriMet,

You have a back door problem. Every day that I ride I see people struggling with them. They press the yellow strip, they push on the door, and nothing. I'm not sure if you're collecting data on this, but about half of the people I see trying to exit through the back door struggle with them. 

And we've had this new door system [since September last year](https://news.trimet.org/2019/09/video-trimets-bus-fleet-gets-bigger-and-better-with-the-addition-of-71-new-buses/) and the problem doesn't seem to be getting better.

Your latest attempt to fix this problem, an audio recording stating, ""Press the yellow tape to open the back doors"" every time the bus comes to a stop is incredibly annoying and woefully inadequate.

This morning I heard this audio recording for the first time and thought ""That's new, maybe it will help."" Until the next stop where someone tried to use the back door, and the woman attempting to exit I don't believe spoke English, nor do I think she spoke Spanish. Your own documents acknowledge at least [12 different languages spoken](https://trimet.org/meetings/board/pdfs/2016-09-28/res-16-09-60-a.pdf) by transit users, and your audio announcements on the Max are bilingual in Spanish, but this new system on the bus is only English. 

How did someone, or likely a team of people at TriMet, approve an audio recording that was only in English? 

At the next stop, a middle aged man dressed professionally pushed on the yellow strip. Then pushed again, then pushed again, and again, until he grabbed the bars and shook them. There was a desperation in his eyes, I imagine he feared the cue of Portlanders judging him for failing to operate what should be a simple system - a system with one line of instruction - and that this man in the peak of his professional career could be defeated by a bus door. The moment he gave up in humiliation, and with his hands on his waist like an upset school teacher, the doors opened. 

And if you ride the bus long enough each day, a person struggling with the back door will do what they've learned to do, ""BACKDOOR!"" ""*DRIVER, BACKDOOR!*"" ""CAN I GET THE BACK DOOR PLEASE?"" As these people are assuming this is no fault of their own. They're left wondering, ""does the driver not like me?"" Every time a person fails to operate the back door, not only are they met with humiliation of failing in front of everyone, but then they have to swim up stream to the front door, which is sometimes no easy task as other people are trying to board.

Personally, the only solution I've found to semi-consistently open the back door is to push the yellow strip with one finger and relatively lightly, then, with a bit of luck, it will take a moment for the doors to open. Meanwhile, I feel like everyone is looking at me like a crazy man.

How many people are dealing with this every day? I understand that this might have been installed in an effort to increase accessibility for people who have struggled to force the older doors open, but I don't think this is the right system. The next iteration of buses need a new system. Can we get a big red button that says ""Open""? Can we go back to having the back door being operated by the driver? Can we have them open automatically if the request stop button is pressed from the back half of the bus?

A new audio recording, even if made bilingual, is not going to solve this. The audio is also super annoying, I put headphones in - which by the way, a significant number of people who use transit aren't listening to the ambient noise. For all I know, this audio recording has been on the buses since September, this was just the first time I've heard it. 

Fundamentally this system is finicky and frustrating. A new approach is needed.

Sincerely,

Rumpelstiltskin",Portland,"""Press the yellow tape to open the back doors"""

I live on 7th and Belmont area where there is a massive amount of housing being built and no parking accommodations. In fact we are loosing parking. My building has a parking limitation of 1 spot  per unit and my bf rents out his monthly for an additional 200 whilst I park on the street. This is where the daily battle ensues. I have accepted this however and many times I end up parking blocks away from my building which is fine but even then I’ve had to park almost by white owl or further. The issue however that I have noticed lately is the overwhelming amount of inconsiderate “ Parking spot loitering “ or whatever. Here’s what I mean I circle the blocks sometimes over 30 mins even an hour at times. Finally I see someone leaving and so I place my blinker on and wait polity. The other day a woman got in her car and turned it on. I signaled and reversed and waited she sat in there for a while finally at the 10 min mark I pulled up along side and rolled down my window and asked “ are you leaving “ she said she was and then I said”  ok I’d liked this spot I live in the building. “ She nodded then I reversed and she STILL proceeded to take her time! Finally another  several mins later she left. 

This is not the first time this has happened plenty of Uber /Lyft drivers that also take up parking and place their hazards on and then wait. People are coming home from work it’s a busy street and it all one way so circling takes time and can be frustrating and risky when it’s pouring and it hard to see oncoming traffic. 

Sigh I’m sorry to be a brat but just be considerate if your getting in your car and it’s going to be on either wave people on or leave ASAP. People want to get home and you sitting in your car just hanging out or waiting for someone with your lights on is confusing and rude.

We sadly don't really have a budget to come visit beforehand, so I was wondering if anyone had good suggestions as to how to find a place to rent without seeing it in person.

We were thinking we have two options:

1. Find a place online and do all the paperwork remotely. Have our stuff transported and move in right when we arrive, a bit of a leap of faith.

2. Don't commit to a place, and instead rent a place short-term (3 or 4 weeks perhaps). Use that time to visit apartments and find a place that merts our needs (mostly a quiet place). We have a friend living in Portland but asking to stay with them that long is not something I'd feel comfortable with. 

Option 2 is more stressful in the short-term (and would require me to take some time off) but we'd be more likely to find the right place for us. Getting electricity, Internet, and such would take longer as well, but would be worth the trouble, I suppose.

This is coming from a homeless person who thought there would be a lot more compassion/support/empathy/openness for those who've fallen on hard times. I thought businesses would be more welcoming, the general public would not be prejudice because ""hey, it's a very progressive city, people understand how this economy is leaving a lot of people out and how quickly someone can end up poor/homeless at no fault of their own""  but man there's a lot of discrimination/prejudice/disdain/etc. for those who are poor/homeless here.

Contributions must be dated no later than December 31st, 2019, to receive the credit on your 2019 Oregon tax return.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\\\*Please note, due to a recent change in Oregon law, individuals with adjusted gross income over $100,000 or joint filers with combined income exceeding $200,000 no longer qualify for the Political Tax Credit.\*

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Here's some more information regarding the Oregon Political Tax Credit.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*No carryforward.\*\* The credit cannot be more than your tax liability for Oregon. Any credit not used this year is lost.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Which contributions qualify?\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Candidates and their principal campaign committees.\*\* You can claim a credit for a contribution to a candidate for federal, state, or local elective office, or to the candidate’s principal campaign committee. To qualify, at least one of the following must occur in Oregon the same calendar year you made your contribution:

&amp;#x200B;

\* The candidate’s name must be listed on a primary, general, or special election ballot,

\* A prospective petition of nomination must be filed by or for the candidate,

\* A declaration of candidacy must be filed by or for the candidate,

\* A certificate of nomination must be filed by or for the candidate,

\* A designation of a principal campaign committee must be filed with the Oregon Secretary of State’s Office. \*\*Note:\*\* The designation must be made in each year a contribution is made to qualify under this provision.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Political action committees.\*\* You can claim a credit for contributions to political action committees (PACs). The organization must have certified the name of its political treasurer with the appropriate filing officer, usually the Secretary of State for statewide or regional elections, your county clerk for county elections, or your city recorder for city elections. PACs registered with the Federal Elections Commission may not be required to register in Oregon.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Political parties.\*\* Political parties can be national, state, or local committees of major political parties.Oregon also allows a tax credit for contributions made to minor political parties that qualify understate law. Contact the Oregon Secretary of State’s Office in Salem at 503-986-1518 to see if a particular party qualifies.

My question to those who have lived, live, or visited Portland:

What is the city like? Wages, weather, quality of life/standard of living, job market and prospects, things to do and see in the city.

Some of you might be familiar with this intersection. I'm in the left turn lane and I have the right of way since there are no turns on red and I have a PROTECTED green light turn. Pedestrians are facing a do not walk sign (basically the same thing in the attached picture as you can see the signs for no turns on red and you can see the protected green light turns). The guy decided to be a dick when I confronted him and even his lady said I had the right of way (she stayed at the curb while the guy walked in front of me, enough said). I understand the frustrations that pedestrians might have with drivers not following the rules, believe me I do. But contrary to what some believe there are a lot of drivers in this town (myself included) who are trying to look out for pedestrians or cyclist so that we all can be safe and get to our destinations. It is just unbelievable how some pedestrians act when they are called out for doing something wrong. The fact that this guy was 0% apologetic and claimed I was in the wrong just really angered me.

I live at a complex were first come, first serve open parking spots and covered spots that you pay extra for. Those are not the ""reserved"" spots I am about to vent about.

So, there's a tenant at my apartment complex who sucks. She yells at her dog for running off because she never puts it on a leash, she yells at and kicks out her (ex?) boyfriend(s), and a year or two ago she somehow got the apartment complex to create a ""reserved"" parking spot right in front of her apartment. Not a ""disabled"" spot, which she claims to be despite not having a disabled sticker or tag on her car, but a reserved one. The reserved spot is just a painted ""RESERVED"" sign at the foot of the spot, and a green sign in front of it (on the wall of the complex) saying its reserved and threatening towing, blah blah blah.

My apartment is close to hers and thus I park generally in the same area. I parked in her spot when it was freshly christened way back when, only to have her knocking at every door on our end of the complex, until I opened mine and she asked it if was MY car in HER spot, I said yes and moved it. A couple of other people have parked in her spot since then and she always, despite her ""disability,"" seems to be able to hoof it up the stairs and wander around the complex knocking on everyone's doors until she finds the culprit. 

My question really is just: can you ask your apartment complex to make a reserved spot just for you, with no seeming reason for it? If she really was disabled, and had proof, wouldn't they make a ""disabled"" spot instead? Or did my complex just do this for her because she's a horrendous bitch who kept complaining?

Also just to get ahead of these comments: OF COURSE I am aware and understand that not all disabilities are physical and some disabilities you would never know about unless told you, but regardless, if she was disabled, whatever the disability, wouldn't she be able to get a handicapped tag? They're free according to the DMV website, all you need is a doctor to sign off on it. Again, this really wouldn't be such a big issue if she didn't suck to fucking bad.

I'm really just wondering about the legality of it all. I reckon apartment complexes can do whatever they want with their parking spots...",Portland,"Legality of a ""reserved"" parking spot at an apartment complex?"

\- The article says the increase in rent should has slowed down (note: not decreasing) and lots of incentives are being offered in new apartments

\- As far as I can tell, apartment rents have not come down in the last 3 months or so, which normally happens from Nov to Jan.  Not that I've been looking that hard, but I did not even see any normal seasonal decrease in rent in December.  Perhaps I missed something?

\- I had a long conversation with a friend whose side job is a landlord.  He said for all the complaints people have about how much it costs to rent a place, Portland metro actually isn't a very good place for homeowners who rent out their houses.  His point is that if you look at how much a house costs and how much you can collect if you rent it out, rents in Portland and surrounding areas are lower than most other cities.  He calls it rent-to-property-value ratio.  He says that ratio is quite low in and around the Portland area, and that does not even account for the higher property tax in Oregon and anti-landlord laws that have been passed in the last several years.  This is from someone who has rented out his places for the last couple of decades.  I actually had a hard time believing that at first, and ending up fact-checking it after the conversation.  It's actually true, which somewhat surprised me, but that means many Porltand landlords would/should consider putting their money elsewhere...   
 The places he rents out are single family houses, so it may not be the same as apartments though.",Portland,"Are Portland renters getting a break now? Also, other thoughts..."

I recently graduated college and moved to Portland for a high paying job as a software engineer. Every day, on the commute to my office in downtown, I see large amounts of homeless people. I carry some cash so I can give directly to them, but I also want to find effective methods to help solve the problem. There are some resources I've looked at online to find good non-profits, but the more I talk to people the more mixed opinions I hear about them. It seems like there is a lot to research. For example, I've heard that some homeless people find the shelters here to be somewhat unsafe or scary. I don't know how true that is, but if it is then I would instead redirect my efforts to food organizations like soup kitchens.

My living expenses are cheap, so I've given myself a lot of extra money to spend. I'm a fan of [effective](https://www.givewell.org/giving) giving, which means using evidence and research to make the most of my donations. Any help is much appreciated.

# We need a FAIR TRIAL.

Come and voice your outrage about the GOP cover-up and demand Trump's conviction and removal from office. To uphold our democracy, the American people need to see all the documentary evidence and hear from all potential witnesses. Trump is guilty, and the more evidence we can get out, the harder it will be for Senators to vote to acquit - which is exactly what they are afraid of.

Join us TOMORROW (Wednesday) for a protest in Portland hosted by Indivisible Oregon and Stand On Every Corner PDX, and help call for #NoCoverUp in the Senate Impeachment Trial.

However, this driver proceeded to follow me for eight blocks, laying on their horn the entire time. When I hit a red light, they got out of their car and approached my driver side door and yelled at me to get out and threatened me, screaming that I had almost caused an accident.

My question is if this is a common thing here in Portland because I’ve lived here for six years and this seems to be a story I hear a lot. Much more frequently than bigger cities I’ve lived in where one would think violent confrontations over traffic would happen much more often.

So  the whole point of me joining reddit was to share my honest opinions  and hopefully save someone the pain of moving to this awful place called  Portland, OR. My goal in posting this is to save someone the problems  of moving to a city that just won't meet your expectations. Unless all  you prefer to do is drink craft beer, sit inside for over half the year  until you get a glimpse of sun. Please try to understand everyone has  different experiences. My experience with this town compared to others  is quite different. The area can trap people into thinking you can find  your dream here. Whats so funny is there really is no marketing for this  place like you find in NYC, Texas, Cali, even Florida.There is no real  reason for people to feel they NEED to move here. Take it from someone  who moved across the country to find a better place. Only to see it be  worse than where I left. (Florida). I hear Daniel Tosh echoing a joke he  said once that he was from Florida, so he knows a things or two about  shitholes. And I feel the same.

Any  OR natives can take a hike if offended. You are not so special. Sorry  to be the one to say it. But pretty much anything offends them so go  figure. Seems like everyone from here feels it was so great only a few  years ago before the popularity caught on. Most of the natives here are  always making comments about how the traffic was non-existing only five  years ago. Really??? five years ago?? I find that hard to believe. I  find it hard to believe that only five- ten years ago this place had  none of the issues that plague it today. In every part of town, the  issues are abound. Drugs, property crime, no improvements to roads,  (some of the worst Ive seen in the nation), No plans to improve  infrastructure, horrible education (public schools), over taxed on  normal utilities, no nightlife, no sense of FUN, no real energy to the  city. It literally is covered in a green slime (moss and algae  everywhere). Nobody here finds it important to have curb appeal. The  layout of the public transportation system is actually good but its a  SCARY experience to use it. I have been on trains in NYC many many  times, been on trains in DC, Chicago buses in Miami, Dallas, Atlanta and  many other places. But I never had the sense of anxiety from the other  people riding the train like Portland. There is supposed to be transit  police here but I have only been on a train maybe 3-4 times where I saw  them. And they do not check to see if people pay to get on board. Most  places will not even allow you in the boarding area until you pay( NY  metro, DC, Chicago.) It reminds me of a John Carpenter movie----in every  part of the city.

Yes I moved  here in hopes of finding a better path after living in the bustling  areas of the east coast. In the south on a peninsula and in the  northeast. While I visited this area two decades ago while I was a kid, I  fell in love with it. Or maybe the idea of it. Actually to be more  precise, I visited the Seattle area. And PDX is NOT anything close to  being Seattle. You see, Washington state has its shit together. Yea,  Seattle has a lot of them same issues the rest of the nation faces  (traffic/crime/drugs/gentrification etc.) but it was set up the way a  normal city should be. Not a fanboy for Seattle but visiting there in  comparison to PDX is really no contest.  Back to PDX issues. There are  many.

When  I visited here 5 years ago, it seemed like a decent place to call home.  So my family and I moved here after figuring it was a safer, friendlier  area that offered more career opportunities for us. Quickly after  getting settled in-- none of those held true. I will give you an honest  play by play about why we fell for the bullshit dream of moving to this  toilet called Portland.

Get settled in cause this will be a long rant. And I will pull no punches about anything.

First  off, after finding our town home that we rented sight un seen ( A quick  lesson learned and will never do it again) We quickly found that the  homes built in the area are of a lesser quality. Prob since a long time  ago there were not enough people moving here to raise a stink about  something like that. And also the area we started off in (Beaverton) was  mainly farms and agri-based. The rental was built in 1997 and the homes  that I was used to in Florida that were built in that era had normal  cookie cutter set ups. But the builders did not seem like them were on  crystal meth while building the houses though. In PDX, that seems to me  what most of the builders were doing. Cabinets that were not measured  properly, pieces of siding that were cut too short, the rear ""deck""  looked like it was held together by termites, the air conditioner was  pathetic, never cooled off the home. And yes, you need AC in Oregon, who  woulda thought??? Then came the logistical issues.

Our  internet was supposed to be turned on prior to us moving in. When we  called the provider, they said that they would have to run new lines  under the sidewalk and/or rip up the sidewalk to see if they were  already there....HUH???Wha???Ok......Never heard of such BS before.

Next  came the fact of our water bill and utilities. When we got the first  bill it was close to 200 bucks. I was sure this was a typo. In  everyplace I have lived at the most I have ever paid was 35 or 40. And  that is when I had 3 roommates. And I got some BS explanation from the  water company that there is a charge for accessing it from the source.  Excuse me but doesn't it rain here 7 months out of the year&gt;?  Whatev!!! Next came the issues with parking. And this is where my  anxiety went through the roof. My wife and I worked different hours so  naturally, we both we leave at different times. But the thing is when  renting a place in Oregon, esp the PDX area, you dont get even one spot  for any vehicle. What absolute fucking bullshit! I guess Portland  eventually will get its way of ensuring nobody will use a car or if they  do, it will be hell to use it. We had two vehicles and I mistakenly  purchased a small car for weekend use and as a hobby. Which brings up  another issue with homes in PDX. Growth boundaries. This creates a very  claustrophobic environment. Condos, houses etc are almost so close you  can touch the next building. I dont know who the heck designed these  communities but they had no idea people would actually live in them!!!!

This  created issues with the garage and parking. The car that we put in the  garage was a miata. And IT barely fit in. Never have I seen such  idiocracy anywhere. It got so bad there that when I got home after work,  I would have to park almost half a mile away sometimes. And this did  not make me a happy camper. Esp when that old man winter rolled around.  So after attempting to reason with the HOA and county, I started parking  on the street wherever I could. Mind you we were right across from  Nikes main campus. The vast difference between what was across the  street and where we lived was insane. It was like development stopped  after the orange swoosh. I got a ticket one night for parking the wrong  way (w/o a sign stating so). I fought the ticket and told the judge this  is worse that the Andy Griffith show. Thankfully, he had a sense of  humor and threw it out.

Now  it starts getting interesting. After having interactions with several  of the neighbors, I learned fast that the PDX warmth is again bullshit.  Dont watch Portlandia and think everyone here wants to ""put a bird on  it"" or let ""you go"" at a 4 way stop. No. Most of the people here that  are from here have just as much piss and vinegar as people from NY. So I  dont buy into the warm and fuzzy shit that people think happens here. I  have had better interactions with people in Chicago, Milwaukee, New  Jersey, Pennsylvania, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Texas, Tennessee and NYC. I  have to say that it has to do with being a product of your environment  to some degree. When you dont see the sun for over half the year, it can  get to you. Vitamin D does effect mood and being that OR does not get  much sun, and most people think they can just take a capsule of d3 to  get the essential amount, most people have low d3 here.

I  have had notes left on my truck more time than anywhere else in my 20  plus yrs of driving. The little passive aggressive behaviors here are  just hilarious. It got bad when our next door neighbor made threatening  acts to my wife. Once when I was out of town. Turns out he was a  functioning alcoholic. I wont go into everything that happened with that  guy but he was a real piece of garbage.

After  living in our place for just over a year, we chose to look for another  place. And there is not much to choose from in this area. Being that  NIKE, Intel and others sell the dream to potential workers, they move  here faster than national debt rising. We found a place that seemed ok.  It was built a little better. Seemed cleaner. But again no real sense of  what you should get when you live in a community. Same issues.  (Parking, no room for dog walks, ""friendly"" neighbors that dont want to  be your actual friend. If Seattle has the freeze then PDX has the Ice  age. The people here are so fake nice if it was sold as plastic surgery,  everyone here would have the botox resting bitch face. I started  feeling like it was a mistake getting out here and it feels more so that  way right now then ever.

Here is an idea of what happened in  over 3 years of being in PDX--

First  few months---logistic nightmare of utilities and overpriced important  services..(who pays to rent a fucking garbage bin at 100.00 bucks??)  Water bill avg 180 bucks, potential natural gas leak in condo, smelled  like that for a couple months. No worries though...they all smell like  that (prop management company words), no parking, no walkway to doors,  overgrown green slime everywhere on pavement which can make you feel  like you are ice skating, over crowded stores that close at 8-9pm, ( I  guess if you work until then tough noodles). First interactions with the  PDX fake niceness starts to become evident. Figuring out that NIKE is  only really a marketing company...and a company that owns most of the  PDX metro area.

Next few  months---the ""seasons"" start which only really rain and gray sky for 6-7  months. Interacting with people out here still with an upbeat attitude  only to find out more of the fake nice bs with most of them. Some of the  people, dudes esp, have this weird 1000 yrd stare that has never been  experienced anywhere else before. Effin creepy. Figuring out that this  place has a lot of people who think that running = fitness/wellness. Yup  they do this thing called ""jogging"" I think its a soft J---everywhere  and at anytime of the day. Also started figuring out that this city  really does hate cars. Weird being that most places....even po dunk  towns still acknowledge that cars are a necessity. Period. Also starting  to have the things that appear funny before moving here are becoming  annoying...things like beards, beer, bikes, overpriced used  clothes/furniture, hipsters....hipsters, hipsters, HIPSTERS!!!! Fuck  they are everywhere!!!!! And man has any of them heard of deodorant??? I  like the bohemian lifestyle too but man.....for hygeines sake...take a  shower!!!!!

First year- 3 year  recap---after seeing pretty much everything in the area many times over,  I was ready for a vacation. I took a trip to the SW and man it was  tough to come back here. I felt like my body was craving the sun --even  if just for a few days.....The vacation helped but once getting back  into the swing of things, PDX showed me its ugly side. In the next few  months, my truck was stolen while at work. Had more interactions with  pretentious PNW natives, started seeing the place with different  glasses, like Roddy Piper in They Live. It really became evident that  this city is hopeless. Saw the first few actual syringes on the ground.  Thought that was just a thing people talked about in hyperbole. No,  after being here for close to 4 yrs now, its a regular thing. Starting  to feel like it was a real mistake to relocate here. This created issues  with my wife. (I will not put our issues into just moving to a city but  it def changed us) I started feeling like I did not fit in, even as  eccentric and ""weird"" its difficult to fit in to this place. Being a  fitness professional with a degree and several certifications, the walks  of life in those professions in PDX are ""self proclaimed"" holding  little to no actual education. But they ""look good so they can make  other people look good right. Started realizing that Oregon, esp the PDX  area does a great job of selling the ""environmentally sound"" city. Its  total BS. I mean charging for bottled drinks AND charging for recycling.  Oh yea heres a question, why charge for 10 cents for a soda can but not  charge for a can of beans/sardines/glass jars of food?? The wool has  been permanently pulled over everyone's eyes. Oregon might be the worst  offender of having a captive audience. Nothing here makes sense for the  environment. DEQ inspections for certain cars but if a car is too old,  then its exempt. Those are EXACTLY THE CARS that should be inspected.   Not letting people use a gas nozzle so it creates lines and lines of  cars idling---For Real? Being from New Jersey, the only other state that  still does not let people pump gas, I have never seen lines like OR.  And people are stupid enough to wait in them here!!!! Learned that  things like street signs should not be taken for granted. Take a ride  through PDX ---or when I say that, the eastside. At least on the  westside, there is SOME hope of things being updated and maintained. But  on the eastside, its a whole different ballgame. It honestly looks like  the city is stuck in the 50s. Or thats the last time anything was  maintained. Again, I have been in some of the toughest places in New  Jersey, NYC and many other big towns and PDX makes them look like  Waikiki. PDX is in need of a serious make over. But it will never  happen. Cant tell you how many times I have got lost looking for  somewhere bc a simple street sign has never been cleaned or changed.  There are some streets with no signs. I can honestly say that after  being here for a decent amount of time, this city is horribly  depressing. Not bc of the weather so much but bc of the sheer lack of  happiness and brightness this place is without. Metaphorically. Theres  nothing like seeing slime on the ground everywhere, sludge left over  from leaves that have no where to go since the sewers are  clogged.....since the utilities companies dont clean them on the reg. If  it snows, stay at home..everyone else does. No plows, no de-ice. In a  town with crazy hills and shit roads, good plan!! The roads here are  prob just as bad as any rust belt town. But they dont salt the roads.  How is that? Its bc they've never been maintained. There are roads in  PDX that literally stop and turn into dirt...in the city..not out in the  country..right in the middle of town. And to give an idea of how much  these roads have been maintained, there are parts in town where you can  see where they left the iron rings on the curb to tie the horses up. It  changes you when you see actual human shit and piss on the sidewalks day  after day. It can make you feel un easy when you see used needles on  the train, ground or anywhere else. Especially since the entire area  turns a blind eye to all of these things. There are parts of highways  that have actual rocks for pavement. Not like a side street. Like a main  highway that 90% of the people use here daily. Whats more crazy is the  fact that people find this ATTRACTIVE. I chose to move here but we all  make mistakes. Moving here was one of the biggest mistakes ever. And I  realize why people can get stuck with the feeling of not being able to  escape that. I feel that if you learn from them, all the better. PDX has  some of the biggest hypocrisies  you can find in any city. On one side  of the street you can see houses that look like a set of a Wes Craven  movie and across the street is a mid century industrial ""raw"" treated  home for half a mil. On one side of the street you can see a global  company's headquarters. On the other side of the street you can see a  group of people smoking meth or shooting back tar. PDX will ""eco bro""  you into thinking that cars, toilet paper, washing your hands and eating  animal protein will create the next ""big one"". Its all so places like  New Seasons can charge you 40-50% more on the same product you can get  at Wal Mart. So who really is worse?&gt;? PDX will lure you into  thinking its all about getting outdoors. But if you like snapping an  ankle on a lichen covered rock, its the place for you.And a brief  reminder, wildfires are not just for Cali. A few years ago, OR had them  so bad people were going to evacuate also. So fires, floods, hail, ice,  snow, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain and yes its gets  hot as fuck here also. The hottest day I think I ever experienced was in  OR. It was 109. Just sayin if its that hot, might as well be in a place  that has entertainment. PDX does not care to much about its image. Take  a walk in the high end areas like Laurelhurst, Pearl district etc and  you can find the same trash you see in the not so nice areas. Its like  the city is constantly shrugging its shoulders or saying the millennial  phrase--""MEH"" all the time.PDX has no nightlife. Never have I  experienced a town that on a Friday or Sat night, turns to a ghost town  after 9pm.  As one of the people I met when I got here said, ""theres no  buzz""--so true. Its pretty boring here. Cant seem to figure out what  people actually DO here. Seems like all anyone cares about is being  perpetually intoxicated. Be it beer, pot, opiates, meth or unhealthy  ""foodie"" food. This place flat out sucks. If you do choose to move here.  Please take my honest advice..THINK IT THROUGH.. Go visit several other  places. I mean a google search could change your life if you let it.  PDX tries hard to make you think it will be an easier version of Seattle  or San Francisco. It will never be that. It will only be the step child  to those places. From hippies, hipsters or even worse yupsters to  everyone in between. This place NEEDS to have the ""big one"" happen. Its  tough to share such negative feelings of just one place but hopefully  this saves one person from making the mistake of moving to PDX. This  place is so bad, my dog passed away after living here for just two  years. She was only 6. She was active, fun, bright eyed, affectionate  and loved walks. After being here for a year, I saw the changes with  her. She hated going outside (cant say I blame her being that she  couldnt put on a rain slicker and boots), she became picky with food. We  lost her the next year. There are other personal reasons why I can seem  bitter about this place but I feel that it can change you. It can  change you in a not so good way. I find myself being distant more so  with people than what I would consider normal. I dont trust people the  way I used to. I dont have patience for the slow pace PDX has. I like  good food--thats healthy. PDX sells the idea that its a healthy place to  eat but most of the joints are food under the guise of conscious eating  but contain trans fats, wayyyy too much of the wrong carbs, little to  no healthy fats or protein. PDX COULD  be a decent place. Most of my  friends who are from Portland hate it here also now. They mostly hate  how most of the stereo typical people in PDX are not from here.

I  can say that after all of the things experienced here, I should have  left way earlier. But in attempting to give this place a chance, I felt  that would be fair before making any choice to get outta dodge. Every  place has its shortcomings and issues but I have to say this place just  saps the energy out of you. There is no joy or happiness here. If there  is, its from some over joyed newcomer who is in the position I was in a  few years ago. I know the feeling. Please DONT let it get you thinking  you will find a good change of pace. I will say a few things that I  REALLY  do love about the landscapes and area I feel are a good choice  if you HAVE to find out for yourself why PDX is shit.

First,  the coast is FANTASTIC. The only state I have seen where properties  near the coastline are less/cost the same as Portland, Beaverton,  Hillsboro or Tigard.But honestly the coast has spillage from this area.  Drugs, trash, crime. Thats what this area does best. Creates a sense of  gloom. Not from the weather but from the pure lack of care the local  gov. has for each area.

Next, I  think areas like Forest Grove, North Plains, Sherwood or anywhere near  there are actually not that bad. This is basically wine country. Which  is why it seems to be kept up better than most areas in PDX.

Next,  PDX airport is actually really good. I have been to almost every big  city airport and PDX is easy to deal with. It is NOT easy to drive to.  Its on the only area that had any land left. Why they chose to use that  airbase instead of making one that is more central to all the areas is a  good question.

Last, the summer  is actually quite great. It does get very hot also. And most places in  the eastside dont believe in Ac so be prepared to sweat. But all in all  you get plenty of sunlight---actually this was shocking when I got here.  In June, the sun doesnt go down til almost 10pm. And it comes up at  4am. So its like polar opposite of the rain season. Almost like its two  different places.

Be prepared to  sit in traffic longer during the summer since school is out and EVERYONE   here is a weekend warrior, going to hike, attempt to summit a rock, or  make a drive to the coast. It would not be such an issue if this place  had normal highways. To get to the coast there are two roads. Both are  one lane. To get to the Mountain, same issue. So come weekend mornings,  stop and go the whole way..which makes the fun and plans to relax  challenging.

To  wrap up this cathartic rant, I tried to give this place a chance time  after time. And I just dont see it being a home for myself and my future  plans. Its a shame bc there IS potential. Its just not worth trying to  wait to see if it will be the utopia that everyone craves. Today it  literally rained for 14 hours. I actually like an occasional rain  shower/storm but when it becomes this soggy mess everywhere, its too  much. Says a lot I guess about the people who are drawn to this area. It  takes a certain personality to deal with not only one thing that can be  depressing (weather) but seeing the sights and feeling like it makes  places like New Jersey, Cleveland and Detroit look good is concerning.  Take a long time to think about it if you are headed here. For your  futures sake.",Portland,READ BEFORE MOVING TO PORTLAND

2287,2287,J-_-K,1580416541,ewbt7o,Nan,"With Artist’s Repertory Theater’s (ART) space currently undergoing a renovation after a 7.1-million-dollar gift, the organization has been renting out space all over Portland for their “ART on Tour” season of shows. One such show is the upcoming production of Paula Vogel’s Indecent, which will be performed at Portland State University’s Lincoln Performance Hall. Typically, a student production would be taking place in that space, but this year students get the opportunity to work with professionals on a large production. This sounds great for students in theory, but in reality it was a move of financial genius for ART. Lincoln Performance Hall is a union hall, typically requiring all labor to be done by union contractors, but with the current contract between PSU and IATSE Local 28 (the union for stagehands and techs) allows for students/faculty in addition to union contract workers to work in the space. In order to run a show in Lincoln Hall,  ART would either have to hire laborers out of a union contract, or get students to do the work. With the current rates negotiated between PSU and Local 28, ART would have to pay union workers $24.76 an hour. Out of ten students working on the production crew (running lights, sound, scene changes, costume changes, etc.) the average number of hours each student is working is 80.4 hours over the entire run of the show, including pre-production, from February 13th to March 8th. The move to use student labor saves ART at least $19,907.04! One would hope the students would get some sort of compensation, but all they receive is a single class credit. For reference, the average class meets 40 hours total over 10 weeks and grants four class credits. The cast of actors that students will be working for doesn’t include a single student. For the students wanting to act this quarter, they only get to perform twice, both times on a Monday, and the existence of a student shadow cast is not advertised or even mentioned on the ART website. When asked for a comment, the PSU administration simply said they are ""not familiar with the issue."" Students working on the production, when told of the amount of hours they were working and the amount of money ART was saving by using them, were understably upset. One such student said, ""I'm grateful to have an opportunity to work with ART, but one credit is the equivalent for about 10 hours over the term and I'm putting in 85. That's more time and less credits than any other class I've taken.""  For a single credit and no guarantee of continued collaboration with ART, this deal is a classic case of large institutions putting finance before education. Although it would be easy to blame the PSU theater department for this exploitation of students, the department is forced to agree to these detrimental deals as they have no leverage with an ever shrinking budget, despite the $27 million dollar budget surplus that PSU has currently has. As for the student workers, in order to get the credits required for their degree, the show must go on.

Step one is to give a meaningful compliment to someone you interacted with in a retail sense. This could be anyone, really. A bus driver like me, a fast food worker, the person who pumps your gas, anyone who helps you, even if ‘they’re just doing their jobs’. But, the catch is, send the compliment to their corporate office.  You can give it to them directly, too, that’s always awesome.  

Many people don’t realize if you tell their direct manager something nice about them, they may never hear about it. It doesn’t get recognized. But by sending a compliment in to corporate, it goes in as an official ‘kudo’ so to speak. People are quick to criticize and complain. Compliments are so much rarer. 

Step two is to do one random act of kindness this week. Again, it can be anything, big or small, costing money or not, just so long as it helps someone else and you do it expecting nothing in return. 

My random act of kindness this week was tipping the cost of my sandwich to the lone subway worker. I’m lucky I was able to (some months are leaner than others) and she was by herself, handling a rush so I know she got to keep it all. 

Anyway, this may go over like a lead balloon but I just wanted to spread some kindness. Too often people are impatient and quick to judge. If I can make someone smile, I count it as a good day. 

I hope y’all are doing great!",Portland,I have a challenge for y’all

There's a bezel set stone pendant where the loop connecting the bail to the pendant has broken off.

The hardest piece is a sterling silver ring setting. It used to have a stone, which fell out when one of the posts broke. We were able to find a bezel set pendant that fits exactly. It would need the bail removed and the bezel smoothed, and then set into the setting and soldered onto the mounting.

I’ve done my research and plan to graduate with an AAOT degree and transfer to either UO (main choice) or OSU. The community colleges I currently have/applied on my list is:

Lane Community College (LCC)
Clackamas Community College (CCC)
Linn-Benton Community College (LBCC)
Mt.Hood Community College (MHCC)
Southwestern Oregon Community College (SOCC)
Portland Community College (PCC)

I’m going to be moving from another state (Hawaii) so out-of-state tuition for UO or OSU is way to expensive. I believe going to a CC then transferring will save me and my parents a ton of money. Although, housing and transportation is a little difficult to plan out. Tuition for all these colleges are generally in the same range. The location of these colleges are around Portland and in the south and west. My concern at the moment is about the life outside of school and academics.

We parted ways. I didn’t ask him where he was before he returned to Portland or if he grew up here, but I am curious about his take on Portland now.  I wonder what he will think about this city after a few weeks of walking around downtown.  He’s got to have an interesting perspective after leaving in the late 90s/early 00s and returning 20ish years later. I wonder if he thinks “the 90s are alive in Portland.”",Portland,A fun conversation with a stranger who just returned to Portland after about 20 years.

lovely senior woman who has been living in her 30'trailer in a residential driveway for past couple of years has to move. the house is being sold. she is self sufficient, has a little dog Dan, and two cats. would need a hose for water hookup, an electrical hookup and wifi access if possible. able to pay $300-325 a month, but that is it due to being on social security. she has good references, pays her bills on time, not a wild and crazy gal. she has lived here in portland most of her life so if possible it would be best to keep her here in portland so she has what support network she has around her. regular trailer/rv parks are not the answer as they won't take a trailer older than 10 years (hers is older but not a piece of crap or  falling apart). she is a smart, energetic senior who needs a break. please, anyone who has a driveway or piece of land adjacent to the necessary amenities - reach out to me. i sincerely want this woman to find her new home. thanks for reading and any suggestions, i am grateful to this community for the past suggestions, hoping we can fix her up.",Portland,SENIOR WOMAN LOSING HER LIVING SITUATION - HELP PLEASE

That is how we got Nazi Germany, by too many people ignoring the danger of white supremacist and nazi sympathizers.

As far as crime is concerned....

Violent crime has ticket up slightly in the past several years, but is still below 2010 levels.

It does seem that auto thefts are out of control, though still on par with the early 2000's.

&amp;#x200B;

Homelessness is a much harder beast to quantify. The methodology for counting homeless people is not an exact science. Understandably it was hard to find some pretty and convenient graphs to share. For anyone interested on the subject I would suggest skimming through the [2019 Point In Time Report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566631e8c21b864679fff4de/t/5d434f685800cf0001847e20/1564692373569/2019+PIT+Report_FINAL.pdf) put out as a joint effort between Portland, Gresham and Multnohmah County.  


[Graph from 2019 PIT Report](https://preview.redd.it/e74xsks2ume41.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93c9264700b95f3699497e5328cc1eabced1f681)

This report claims a slight decrease in homelessness overall, with an increase in unsheltered individuals. The general decline seems dubious to me, however more unsheltered individuals are more visible and would give the appearance of an increase over all.  


[HUDs Anual Homeless Assessment Report](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2019-AHAR-Part-1.pdf) Also is some good reading on Homelessness for a national perspective. Portland doesn't make any of the top 5 lists for for homeless rates or the increase there of. However Eugene does come up multiple times in the report with one of the highest homeless rates in the country. Oregon did see one of the largest year over year increases in homeless, though it does not specify how much of that is Portland.

&amp;#x200B;

[From HUD 2019 AHAR Report](https://preview.redd.it/9rtacwj4xme41.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c2cc552781e38b3100734cea4a21c1d706531b1)

How about that traffic? As someone who commutes via walking/transit this one doesn't affect me too much. With traffic the only way to win is not to play.... but I digress. Once again it was a little difficult to find good data. However from most sources, Portland tends to live somewhere in the 7-10th worst traffic in the US range. For context Portland is part of the 18th largest metro area by population.

&amp;#x200B;

[2018 INRIX Infographic](https://preview.redd.it/yzx2itgqzme41.png?width=2514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d913d673b402d9b4520b99cd9366a7d86d251c17)

How about those rental prices? The current average rent in Portland is $1535, compared to a national average of $1472. That makes Portland the 14th most expensive city in the US for renters. From the various sources I looked at Portland rental price **increases** peaked in 2016 and have essentially flatlined since, with units at the high end of the market coming down in price while units on the more affordable end of the spectrum have some increase in cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the cost of purchasing a home? This seems to have also peaked. Still not affordable, but not increasing out of control.  


[Zillow](https://preview.redd.it/6lr0zru85ne41.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7a8ea0d6a59dbbfa95a7cfe4001fd64a4f5f7f8)

&amp;#x200B;

Hows unemployment doing? Looks like there is a lot of work out there, though how far those wages go is questionable.

Speaking of wages the Median Household income in Portland is $73,097. That's 6th out of the top 25 Largest cities.

Over the years since leaving fundamentalism, I’ve been fortunate to build a large friend group (ages in 20s and 30s for the most part) and by pure chance it seems that almost everyone has been affected by fundie Christianity. Some people have left religion entirely, others remain in much more progressive Christian traditions, others like myself have migrated towards more alternative spiritual practices. My house parties tend to end up as impromptu sharing circles, with people making connections &amp; supporting each other through the deconstruction process, dealing with nonsupportive family members, etc. It’s made me wonder if there might be local interest in some sort of more formal meetup to make connections, share experiences, and ideally perhaps eventually form organic communities around more specific interests. I’d envision this including folks who’ve left LDS, Catholic, and the whole spectrum of Protestant fundamentalist groups, and including the range from atheists to liberal Christians and anywhere in between. 

 I’m especially interested in ways that people build community &amp; find meaning, once they’ve left a religious tradition that taught us that we could only find our life’s purpose inside the church. 

If any of this sparks an interest, perhaps to eventually do a meetup at a cafe or bar sometime, please drop me a line!",Portland,Ex-fundamentalist/exvangelical meetup? Looking for community post religion?

I have a Viet nam veteran as a roommate. Who in the last few months who is behaving very rash and erratic now that the collective group of roommates have openly acknowledged his behaviors as problematic. We've explored many avenues to address our concerns involving multiple instances where his behaviors have shown that he isn't committing to the simplest agreements we all are held to(assigned chores, common room cleanliness and useage. And more of recently, theft).

At every addressing him of the issues we see problematic he eludes to..

 ""I'm a Veteran"" and if that doesn't suade you, he turns around and gets loudly vocal about how we're disrespecting veterans and the nation by holding him to the obligations he signed up for. And nothing changes after.  He threatens lawsuit for veteran abuse.  We all give the same respect that's given at our place,  but this guy demands it while disrespecting everyone. 

I understand the commitment and sacrifice veterans have made. I truly do. Plenty of active service members in my family. I just have never faced someone who has felt so entitled that he's willing to berate people who hold him accountable. As that's the case if anyone holds anything to him.

* My favorite thing: overall, y’all are friggin’ NICE. Nice to strangers...I can’t tell you how many of you smiled or said hello as we walked by you. You hold doors, you make small talk in lines, you answered our likely annoying questions about where to go, what to do, etc. Someone even bought us a local beer at a bar so we could experience it.

*You have real neighborhoods that all offer different experiences.

*Things are much cheaper than Seattle.

*People seem for the most part, pretty damn happy.

*You have delicious, diverse restaurants ranging from dirt cheap to pricey.

*There are tons of opportunities to explore local culture.

*Your city is clean.

*Portland is gorgeous

*The murals everywhere are amazing

*You support feminism and sex workers 

*We bought donuts for a construction crew and they were genuinely elated, surprised and thankful

Need to get your teeth cleaned and get a dental check up?

I’m a Pacific University Dental Hygiene student in Hillsboro. It’s my last year and I’m looking for patients to see in order to graduate. Appointment hours are Wednesdays at 6pm, Thursdays at 8am or 1pm. We accept most insurances, and if you don’t have insurance the costs are already extremely reduced. 

We do: 
-Cleanings (normal cleanings or “deep” cleanings)
-Xrays
-Dental exam by a dentist (we do NOT charge for this!) 
-Fluoride application ($5) 
-Some dental fillings, depending on how deep the decay is 

If you haven’t seen a dentist in years, don’t be shy! Majority of my patients are in their 40’s and have NEVER seen a dentist. I would *love* to see you. 

If you’re interested, please call 503-352-7373 and request an appointment with LINDSAY! If you do not say my name, you will be getting scheduled with a random student. If you have any questions feel free to PM me!

2643,2643,tehdimness,1580843602,eyv8xd,Nan,"If you feel like you've been finding endless needles near the red dots in this map, you're not mistaken. Every weekend, a group based in St.Johns called PPOP come to these spots and hand out large quantities of syringes like they're pamphlets. A ""need based"" is euphemism for anonymous needle handout. On the St. Johns neighborhood association Facebook page, they say their volunteers pickup syringes, but it is uncertain which medical waste providers PPOP have a contract with. It appears a considerable amount of their supplies and disposal service maybe coming from the Multnomah County Health Department.

The health department says PPOP is not operated or funded by them. One thing that citizens do have some level of control is what MCHD is doing. Write your representatives and ask that health department take measure to identify and deny supply or disposal services to middleman organizations, enforce 1-for-1 rule strictly, strictly limit the number of syringes that a person can receive during the visit and get rid of syringe ""IOU"" banking that allows someone to bring thousands and withdraw from their virtual account.

St.Johns Neighborhood Association is furious over this organization wanting to setup shop in their neighborhood, but it's not just them affected. That maybe where they have their office, but it's only one of nearly ten locations they go. On the west side, Downtown, Goose Hollow, Northwest District, Pearl District and Old Town Chinatown are affected. On the inner east side, Buckman, Kerns, Hosford-Abernethy, Hollywood, Sullivan's Gulch and Laurelhurst are affected as you can see from the map.

For me, what happens is that they, upon setting up service, sent me the modem \*which I purchased from them\* and then promptly started billing me for leasing it. For months, I would have to call/chat for \~45 minutes to have the charges reversed and (more importantly) have the recurring item removed from future billing.  


Every month the lease returned; every month I would go through the same routine. After 3-4 times, it finally stuck.  


Then, we decided to upgrade the service. Despite already owning the correct modem, CenturyLink \*refused to \_not\_ ship a modem to me, saying to just ship it back\*.  


I promptly shipped back (and kept the tracking number, thank goodness). And as everyone would expect, they immediately started ""erroneously"" charging me a lease for it. Now, I'm back into the same ""prove I shipped it back"" routine every month (I'm on round-three this time).  


I expect that the majority of folks would either miss the bogus 10$/mo billing and/or give up with fighting them, which means that it could be a reliable way to just pad all their bills by an additional 10$/mo per customer . . .

I would like to talk about ableism/audism in media. I have discussed this before but this time, I’d like to address the fact that ableism/audism runs deep not only local media here in Portland but also major media across the US.

I just want to be clear that I do not watch NFL or support NFL as it is racist money machine.

For years with NFL during Super Bowl, we always have “celebrities” who are Deaf appointed by National Association of the Deaf to sing the National Anthem in ASL. Marlee Matlin was the first and only Deaf woman to get full air time, live. Over the years after her, major media gave Deaf people less than 3 seconds to none of air time, live, even though they were assured they will get full air time, live.

I had interview with Wweek and few other local Portland media but they didn’t publish or offer interviews. This greatly impacts on my campaign especially for a person who is Deaf.

They are two major Deaf news who does cover big news across the US.

10% of people with Disabilities in average are currently running for government offices this year. We are very under served and under represented which explains the huge disparity of people with disabilities when running for elected offices. Last time I checked, I am the only Deaf and Queer person running for office in the US. We had four Deaf people who ran last 2018, besides myself. We face barriers, discrimination and oppression as we run our campaigns which makes it more challenging for us to win the election.

With me being elected, I want to change this by raising voices, raise awareness, and give support for any Deaf people running for elected office. Once elected, I will be opening doors for more Deaf people to have the opportunity to run for elected office through my example.

The most recent issue is that I put my money order with my rent in the dropbox on the February 1st but today received a bill for next month  saying that I still owe February rent and also a $100 late fee. 

After both emailing and going in to the leasing office they insist they have no record of the checks being deposited and that they don’t have the checks anywhere in their office. They tell me to contact Western Union to get refunded and next time ask for a photo copy as a receipt 

I get this could have been solved by me getting a receipt from them in the first place but I honestly thought the WU receipt itself is what I needed. This was dumb of me and I have learned but also this is extremely frustrating and stressful for me. So this is more a vent/rant. Living at this complex has led to more issues than I have EVER had in any living situation in my entire life. 

Anyone else have this happen with or outside of Wimbledon?? Any recommendations or tips? The website says WU can take 30 to process my request to refund and I also have to pay $15 to have it refunded along with the $100 late fee from Wimbledon.

I welcome all who may have an option on this topic. So I’ve had a very well paying job for about 3 years now in Virginia. I have family that live in Portland and on a recent trip in November I absolutely fell in love with the city. I could go on forever about how much I love this city and for those who live there I’m sure you all love it to. I knew I wanted to live there immediately. But doing what?? My current job is Groundhog Day each day. Same thing over and over. I know I want to do something new, something for the greater. I have a passion for community outreach and love being able to do something new each day. And I have always wanted to do something that some may view controversial. I come from a family of service men and women. Military to firefighters. And I’ve wanted to be a police officer for a LONG time. Here in northern Virginia there is a lot of violence. I have lost friends to to that s***. It’s sad. But the combination of an open door to Portland and a career in what I want to do most almost seems too perfect. And I know the relations between cops in Portland and the community are not there best. At least that is how I observed it while watching the news while there a few months ago. I really do believe I can make a difference in the communities and help restore their trust and faith in the PPB. Gosh, I hope that didn’t seem like too much to absorb. 

To shorten it up, is becoming a Police officer in Portland a good career move? And before you answer please read the top portion.

We’re a military couple, I’m a veteran and she’s active duty. In April we’re moving to the Seattle area, and are trying to save money for an apartment. At the moment, I only bring in maybe 1K dollars a month, so most of our saving comes from her income. 

At the moment I’m just sitting around the house, doing school online maybe two hours a day. I’m looking for any general labor or whatever unskilled work I can do to help us get enough money together to make the move smoother. 

Does anyone have anything they need help with, or have any leads on simple jobs like that? Any amount helps, and I’m really quite agreeable to any sort of work, so long as you’re okay with me only being available until early April. 

I’ve already started searching on the usual job boards, but I am not comfortable applying for work that doesn’t explicitly wrap up before April, I’d feel bad taking an opportunity for long term work from someone who genuinely needs it long term, especially for what is in essence just extra to me.",Portland,Looking for temporary work!

2876,2876,Things_Make_Me_Sad,1581099887,f0ejkx,Nan,"Good morning, Rose City!  I attended the Portland Winter Light Festival last night and was not disappointed at all.  The weather was perfect for a long walk with only an intermittent drizzle of light rain and a temperature around 50.  If you did not make it out last night, I can't recommend it enough.

I saw so much and may have actually seen most of the festival in one swoop.  I left my house right at 6 and had seen pretty much everything on the east and west sides by 10.  My biggest regret is not taking down the names of exhibits or artists that I thought were noteworthy so I could suggest them to redditors.

As predicted, the Eastbank Esplanade and area around OMSI had the largest concentration of exhibits.  Many were interactive and a lot of fun for families with kids.  Every year, it seems like the artists contributing to the festival take their game up a notch, and this was no exception.  There were more interactive displays this year than ever before, and I want to take a moment to publicly shame the person who broke the xylophone at OMSI two hours into the first night (unless you are a small child, in which case all is forgiven).  Be gentle with the displays that you're supposed to ""play"" or ""strike"" please!  The World Trade Center had some fun pieces, as did the area around Tom McCall Park.  

My advice is as follows:

* Start at the north end of the west side and walk towards the Hawthorne Bridge.  You'll be able to check out the Tom McCall exhibits and will be right across the street from the WTC.

* After you've seen pretty much everything on the west side, cross the Hawthorne Bridge and you'll get dumped out on the Eastbank Esplanade in just a few minutes.  Walk south towards OMSI and you'll see the majority of the east side exhibitions.

* Make sure you stop by the Oregon Rail Heritage Center!  They have exhibits too and the museum itself is a treat, especially if you have a kiddo who likes trains.

* Take the Tillikum Crossing Bridge, which is beautifully lit up in color, back over to the west side and walk along the waterfront to catch the last few exhibits you may have missed and maybe warm up again at the World Trade Center.  Or, join in the Silent Disco there!

I'd recommend packing up a few drinks and snacks as well.  I didn't see as many food or drink vendors this year as in previous years and I didn't see anyone walking around selling drinks out of a cooler either.  Plus, the water fountains are shut off for winter, so you will probably get thirsty.  There are bathrooms and a water fountain for free usage at OMSI if you need relief.

Hope everyone makes it out in the next two nights!  Thank you to all the artists and city planners who have made this possible for the last five years.  It's the winter event I look forward to the most.",Portland,The 2020 Portland Winter Light Festival Is Great! Please Consider Going (And Donating)!

I just came across this local organization [outspoken](http://www.beoutspoken.org/) trying to bring together Portland's differing communities to have a nuanced conversations about controversial topics, but I'm wondering if this can work here? I mean, we all know Portland is pretty homogenous, and when it's not it's often violent (ie: antifa vs proud boys, even when they're just drinking at cider bars). If anyone was tracking when Jordan Peterson made plans to come to town and when the documentary about him was being shown, it was boycotted and rallied against. I personally think there needs to be a place to have nuanced discussions but I wonder how readily the Portland communities will accept something like that. 


The first event taking place next week (Feb 11th) is more light-hearted (about Polyamory and Monogamy), and maybe I just live in a bubble, but I'm genuinely curious if Portland leftists can tone down their radicalism enough for something like this, especially if they get into more controversial topics.

2945,2945,badcpa,1581195101,f0xj3b,Nan,"I got a job offer in Portland, which would be in the Pearl District.  I already know that's out of my range as far as my desired housing situation and what I can afford.  In the past, I've liked living in the suburbs and working in the larger city and visiting there on the weekends when I feel like it.  I'm in my late 40s and not really interested in doing stuff all of the time, but like having the option of easy access to the city.  

I was really wanting to commute through MAX.  My budget is probably around $1100-$1300 and I'm thinking of 1 bedroom apartments or possibly a small condo/townhouse.  I don't have any pets and it'll just be me.  I do have a car and would prefer to have easy parking, where I live though as I said I don't have any interest in driving to work.  The car is more for errands and travelling outside the area.  

It seems like my best options are Beaverton or Milwaukie.  It seems like the MAX commute from Milwaukie might be a tad shorter.  Are there any advantages or disadvantages that one place has over the other?   Are there any other places I should be considering?  Hillsboro maybe?  I'm fine with doing park and ride or whatever, I just don't want to drive into the city for work.   

I've searched on here a while but my info may not be up to date.  Are there any areas/management companies I should avoid?  

After I've been here a while I might consider moving somewhere in actual Portland, but I feel like the suburbs are my best bet for right now as far as gradually getting acclimated.  I've visited Portland a few times over the years but that's it.  I've always loved visiting though and plan to remain here.  My job is relatively stable \[federal government\] and pays pretty well so I intend to eventually put down permanent roots here.",Portland,Middle aged guy moving to the area---thinking about Beaverton/Milwaukie.

*Coming off a performance on NPR's Tiny Desk Concert series in Washington DC, a live KEXP In-Studio session, and a national tour, Seattle band Among Authors are on an upwards trajectory. Their debut album 'I AM BECOME' which was recorded, mixed and mastered in the band's basement, has received critical acclaim from NPR and KEXP, along with many other press outlets.*  


*• NPR’s own Bob Boilen said: “I was stunned by the rock band Among Authors and its original take on music that’s akin to Radiohead and explosive art rock.“*

*• KEXP wrote: “If you haven’t heard the name Among Authors yet, you’re about to hear it a lot. The Seattle-based band are on a hot streak after the release of their debut album, I Am Become, last year. Thanks, in part, to Kevin Cole’s support of the band but, mostly, from the incredible music they make. Their take on atmospheric art-rock is something few are doing at the moment and they are doing it very very well.”*

*Larsen Gardens, aka Seattle-based songstress Sarah Edmonds, delivers an intimate and deeply personal experience through the wanderings of voice and nylon-stringed guitar. Inspired by eternal aesthetic longing and the archetypal quest to uncover the essence of the thing, we are asked to witness how one might go about revealing just below the layers of the bud of the flower waiting to bloom. Melancholic layers of folk-driven electric and acoustic guitar and cool vocals reminiscent of ‘50s era jazz stylings remind the loud to listen and give voice to softer dreams. Yet the sounds are a far cry from American ‘50s cultural sentiment, and instead reveal a longing for feminine independence. Where worlds of softness are often distorted to shrivel in sultry obedience, a new voice has lassoed feminine intimacy back to where it belongs, as something sincere and much more intrinsically powerful. Prior to moving to Seattle, Sarah lived in Nashville where she performed primarily covering the American Songbook, working with producer Billy Adair and pianist Beegie Adair. Performing her own music under various monikers, Sarah has recorded/shared the stage with Jen Gunderman (Sheryl Crow, The Jayhawks, Dag), Joe Pisapia (Guster, K.D. Lang), Fred Eltringham (Sheryl Crow, The Wallflowers, The Dixie Chicks), Molly Jewell, Goffrey Moore, Joe Andrews (Old Crow Medicine Show), Mike Rinne (Miranda Lambert, Emmylou Harris), Sarah Williams and more.*",Portland,Among Authors (NPR Tiny Desk alumni) &amp; Larsen Gardens looking to book a show in Portland on March 6th!

I don't want to call homeless people out but I really can't imagine who else needs to consistently shit out in front of my house.

3098,3098,octopuslasers,1581377794,f1z7hg,Nan,"TL;DR at the bottom, and I hope I don’t upset a bunch of people. 

This is a picture of [Parkrose Transit Center](https://trimet.org/transitcenters/parkrose.htm).  Gateway TC, Gresham TC, and soon Beaverton TC, are set up the same. 

Buses drop off at unmarked spots and **only** pick up at their numbered spots. If a driver is in their bus at the unmarked spot, they’re on their break. “Ignore them,” I hear y’all saying, except they don’t stop knocking and will approach open windows. 

The other day I was driving a 73 out of Parkrose. Every time I had a break, someone interrupted it and demanded my time:

(I like helping people. I like finding the answers to questions and making people happy. But, my time is *my* time, and I’m entitled to it)

—a man who was angry with me when I couldn’t give him information on a 65. I suggested he call customer service. He argued he couldn’t (poor English, no phone, apparently). He blocked my bus and made me late pulling out which not only affects my passengers, but I can get a talk with a manager for it. *The 65 is C-Tran y’all. Not Trimet.*

—a woman who wanted to know which bus left first. *It doesn’t matter. We all pick up only at our numbered stops at these TCs.* Whichever one leaves first will come to you. 

—a guy who decided he couldn’t walk down to the train platform to buy his ticket, he absolutely had to get it from me.  He then walked to the platform to catch the MAX. 

Sometimes we get good breaks. Sometimes we have less than 10 minutes to just breathe and chill. I get that I work for Trimet and people who have questions naturally see the uniform as a source of answers. 

However, the customer service line is 24/7 for texts. There’s the website for information and trip planning. The schedules for time points (which TCs are) are in most shelters. Look for the platform with your bus number, stand there and the bus will show up. 

But please have some consideration for the drivers. That one hurrying to the break room may only have 7 minutes to use the bathroom, get some refreshment and start up again. Any time we run late it comes out of our break. If a driver is chilling in their bus please let them have their time, just as you want your time on a break or at lunch. 

TL;DR: A driver who is not actively driving is not ‘working’ and is on break. Please give them the consideration you’d like when you take a break at work.

3117,3117,boatsboatsboatsPDX,1581388991,f21r3w,Nan,"I know many will want to shun the following, as OHS is a beloved institution. For me it still is as well, as it is one of the best Humane Societies around. However, anyone that recently adopted a kitten or cat in the last 7-10 days - needs to be aware that our new kitten, brought home Feline Distemper / Parvo / Panleukopenia with her from the shelter — infected our other cat (despite her being vaccinated), and almost died.


https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/feline-panleukopenia

We only were able to save both cats after numerous vet trips for both cats, and bills totaling near $1500 for: Fluids - IV, fecal tests, blood test, emergency on all response, monitoring. 

Symptoms: 24 hours after we brought the kitten home it became very low energy, and refused to eat. It projectile vomited profusely- and had massive Diarrhea. 

The kitten soon was severely dehydrated - in only a day - and since we couldn’t get her to drink we rushed her to the emergency on all vet hospital at night.

They gave her fluids - anti nausea - and took samples, and sent her home - and she rested and ate a few bites.

The next day, our other cat - who was already vaccinated and living in separate area of the house - vomited and began showing the same symptoms. Refusal of food and water, listless, rapid dehydration.

The kitten, then reversed recovery - stopped eating once more.  Result was we took BOTH to the local vet (daytime) for fluids, observation , more samples. 

Bacterial checks came back negative. More samples sent out for lab.

They gave a huge amount of IV / fluids to both...  and we again took them home. We were given special food and instructions to begin force feeding - as we near day 3 of not eating for the kitten.  

Our older cat we had to attempt force feeding for food / water on the next day.

Slowly the kitten recovered somewhat over the next 48 hours (total 4-5 days sick). Following exactly 2 days behind our older cat started to recover.

Today the vet notified us of the results from the kitten. They are notifying the humane society that they have sent home an infected cat, and to bleach all cages.

We now suspect that many cats must have been infected, as many kittens and cats went home at the same time last week.

I suspect some probably didn’t make it if they fell ill. Not everyone is willing to spend over $1000 on an adopted pet to cure it .

I know these things happen, this is the nature of humane society and adopted cats.

This is not chastising the OHS - but only serving to tell anyone who may have adopted a cat in this period to seek IMMEDIATE vet assistance if you see any of the following:

-loss of appetite
- shaking
- vomiting 
- diarrhea
- glassy eyes and non responsive
- hiding and purring while not eating for a day
- refusing water

Our both showed all these symptoms.

Best of luck to all you, pet ownership is a wonderful thing - but also sometimes scary.",Portland,Caution to OHS adoptees: Feline Panleukopenia present in new kitten

It's been trending at a 0 score so you might not have seen it yet. If you have narrow and specific guidelines that must be completely fulfilled and then become jaded by the lack of success,  you will struggle to find a partner. 

I showed up to Portland in late 2012 with nothing more than a road bike and what could fit into a 2004 Rav4 in the hopes of redeeming myself after a failed relationship and pitiful start to a post college career. Nobody asked me to move 3000 miles and my first job didn't even work out after a few months. However, I was always welcomed by strangers for arriving to the city. Never was I turned away from any group that I wanted to join for activities or socializing. I came from Charleston, SC which many have considered to be one of the most polite cities in the US. It didn't compare at all to what I experienced in Portland. People actually seemed genuine and interested when they asked you how you are doing. It was also nice to see cars stop for you at crosswalks instead of the murderous  road rage in the south. I routinely was asked if I needed help when fixing my bike on the side of a road.

Dating wasn't anymore difficult than anywhere else in my experience. I found people overall did not care for pretentious and weren't impressed by material wealth. No one should be surprised that there are active people in the area who like to do outdoor activities. Isn't that a major draw to the area? A few fizzled starts and I met my now deceased wife on a Astoria trip from Meetup. We both liked being outdoors and active so we were in a perfect city for this. 

Not convinced that Portland has quality people? Last year my wife finally succumbed to a debilitating condition known as mixed connective tissue disease.  I took her off life support because she didn't possess any capability past basic brain stem functions and shared a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/bj40k7/the_view_from_ohsu_after_the_last_night_ill_ever/)(it was the 9th most up-voted on the sub last year) on the last day of her life. Not only did many people who I've never met reach out and offer support but I actually had people track me down and visit us in the ICU at OHSU. I was given hugs from strangers and free food from restaurants in town when people heard what happened. 

I moved back to the Northwest not long after my wife died from a work training program California. I'm up in Tacoma for income reasons until I make a career transition that I'm hoping will allow me to move back to Portland and thrive. I visit the city once or twice a week and although it's changed over the years I still don't have a problem finding good people and there are as many reasons to stay as I've ever had.

So if you think there aren't high quality people in Portland you may need to do some introspection and realize that it could you that lacks in qualitative features.  Don't like it in Portland? Good, move the fuck out and make room for those of us who want to return.",Portland,High quality people are not hard to find in Portland

I have had occasion to be down in Sellwood a few times in the last week and I like it. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops, even a movie theater and a library. I like that I see people of all ages out and about. It's not like it's ALL hipsters or ALL young families, etc. So far there's not an overabundance of new construction blight. It looks like houses are out of my reach but rental costs aren't too terrible.

In my previous apartment I use an average of 150 kWh/month and was paying about $30 for electricity. I just got my first energy bill in my new apartment and PGE is claiming I used *1600 kWh* in the 3 weeks I’ve had control of my apartment and is asking for $220. For comparison the average *house* in my area uses about 900 kWh/month according to PGE.


I don’t see how this is possible. Yes this apartment is bigger and I expected my energy bills to increase proportionately, but it isn’t 10 times bigger. My personal habits haven’t changed. I’m not leaving lights on 24/7, the thermostat isn’t at 85 degrees, and I don’t run more than two loads of laundry per week. Both my previous apartment and this one used electric heat.


My first guess is that there’s a fault in the meter, but I wouldn’t be completely surprised if one of the outlets was busted or the heat wasn’t drawing electricity properly. But frankly, until those things can be investigated, I don’t want to pay a bill that seems erroneous based on my history of energy use. Does anyone have any advice about the best way to go about contacting PGE to get things straightened out? Any other ideas of what could be wrong?",Portland,Anyone with experience contesting an energy bill from PGE?

3230,3230,TropicanaFanta,1581533793,f2w2f8,Nan,"Weird, somewhat sad story time. 

My male friend was stalked by one of his female coworkers for 5 years. This not only included having someone constantly following him around at his job, watching everything he does, but also following him on his walks home from work, throwing pebbles at his window, knocking on his door in the middle of the night while sticking her hands through his mail slot calling his name, and some other insane shit. He reported it to his work, had a no-contact order through his school, and also reported it to the police (but was told that because she wasn't directly threatening his life there wasn't much they could do). Eventually she moved towns and quit bothering my friend.

Fast forward a few years, another friend goes to a New Years Eve party thrown by a certain ""party production"" company. That stalker girl is one of their performers. Now mildly uncomfortable but not trying to ruin a good night he just avoids her. Later, he messages the staff on facebook, asking if they're aware of her history. They respond saying they have no idea who the girl is and hadn't heard of her before, they hired a third party. So I guess we're to believe they don't have any idea who they're bringing into an event. That's one issue.

But when that friend shared this with his friends, a few left some facebook posts and google reviews telling them (and their customers who have no idea the person they're watching on stage may follow them home) this is concerning. They delete the posts and have the reviews taken down. This is the other issue. They keep hiring that person back for their events, now completely aware of her past, and anyone that raises any question about it on their social media gets it deleted. So...

TL;DR - If you're going to Shamrock Kingdom, or Burning Cat, and you see a girl on stage giving you the eye, there's a good chance it's the beginning of your very own personal horror movie. Cheers.",Portland,Anyone going to Shamrock Kingdom? Or Burning Cat this May? You might want to read this.

* Landlords have to give 72 hours notice of a unit's availability before they start accepting applications for it. This should make it easier to find and apply for a unit, and lessen the stampede for available units
* Limits on screening fees, and on who has to pay for screening at all (some applicants don't!)
* Expansion of what types of ID landlords are required to accept. Expired license? No problem!
* Rent-to-income ratio requirements can't exceed 2x in most cases, 2.5x in some
* If you're denied, you have the right to submit supplemental evidence to make your case and overturn the denial
* Limits on how much can be charged for a security deposit
* Limits on what can be charged for damage, and requirements (for new renters) that the costs of any items you're charged for damaging have to be listed *in your initial rental agreement*, and have to follow a depreciation schedule set forth by the city. 

**Tenants, know your rights!**    
Landlords, don't be dicks or screw up because there are big fines (2x the security deposit + legal fees!)

The insert contained a few paragraphs about NW Natural's request to the Oregon PUC (Public Utility Commission) for a general rate increase. 

By my calculations, NW Natural is requesting a 10.5% increase for natural gas, despite the fact that wholesale natural gas prices are expected to fall 9% in 2020, and there is an oversupply of natural gas available.

You may send a public comment to the Oregon PUC by using the following email address: 
puc.publiccomments@state.or.us

Please share this information with anyone you may feel would also like to oppose the proposed rate increase.

If you would like to see an example of the comments I submitted, with references provided, you may read them below. But remember that every voice counts, and just a simple comment that states your opposition to this proposed rate increase can stop it from happening.

Keep warm folks.



Dear Oregon Public Utility Commission,

I am submitting this letter to staunchly and adamantly oppose NW Natural's proposed general rate increase request.

The Comfort Zone newsletter for Oregon residents included with NW Natural's January 2020 residential bills (source: https://www.nwnatural.com/CustomerService/BillingOptions/ViewYourBill/ViewBillInserts) stated that the general rate increase proposal submitted to the Oregon PUC would subject, ""a residential customer using 53 therms per month [to an] average monthly bill increase of about $6.43."" By my calculations, this proposed increase would raise a residential customer's price per therm by $0.12. Last year I paid $40 per month as part of NW Natural's Equal Pay Plan. I averaged about 35.5 therms per month. If the proposed general rate increase is approved, my NW Natural bill will rise roughly $4.20 per month, which equates to a 10.5% increase.

According to a U.S. EIA (Energy Information Administration) report published on January 15, 2020, entitled, ""EIA expects lower natural gas prices in 2020 as production outpaces demand,"" it is stated that, ""average U.S. natural gas prices will be 9% lower in 2020 than in 2019."" (source: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42496)

The EIA also released an article on January 23, 2020, entitled, ""EIA expects U.S. net natural gas exports to almost double by 2021."" The article states that, ""U.S. natural gas exports will exceed natural gas imports by an average of 7.3 billion cubic feet per day."" In other words, America has an oversupply of natural gas. (source: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42575)

In the Wholesale Natural Gas Market Assessment: Wholesale Natural Gas Futures Prices as of January 26, 2020, written by Roger Fujihara of the Office of Technical and Regulatory Analysis, it is stated that according to EIA data, ""Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged about $0.26 per therm in 2019 and the price is expected to average $0.23 per therm in 2020 and about $.0.25 per therm in 2021."" (source: NGAssessmenandinfo_current.pdf)

If natural gas prices are expected to fall approximately 9% this year, and NW Natural receives their proposed rate increase, the combined total increase in revenue they might receive will approach 20%. I am not prone to hyperbole, but I feel compelled to state that NW Natural's proposed rate increase is both unwarranted and completely without merit.

Based on these professional, researched, and unbiased assessments, NW Natural has absolutely no justification for requesting this 10+% general rate increase. 

Therefore, I strongly advise the Oregon PUC to deny NW Natural's general rate increase request.

Sincerely,",Portland,Please send public comment on proposed NW Natural general rate increase request

At the same time, it's dramatically cheaper than West Linn or Lake Oswego, and safer/cleaner than Milwaukie or Clackamas.

If you live near the old part of OC, the commute to Portland is fast. There are only three stoplights to get to the freeway.

On the flipside, if you live up in the hills, the commute is *horrendous*, because the traffic gets backed up for miles.

With that in mind, I'm curious to see how this new development fares:

Thank you all for contributing. 

I decided to not include national chains, local chains, or places outside of Portland proper. I also just got flooded with suggestions and had to pare the list down a bit.

I will be visiting these joints over the next several weeks and will (probably not) post (hopefully) life altering and humorous updates.

Here's the list in no particular order:

Mod Pizza
Slice
Stark Street
Guiseppe's
Atlas
Pizza Baron
Oly's
Picasso
Tik Tok
Pizza Jerk
Virtue 
Bandini's
Dirty Pie
Silver Dollar

No hate on any of these places. I've never been to any of them that I can remember. Let the best (wo)man lose.

I challenge others to tackle the list as well. One comment mentioned that it might be a good date night. I agree. It's always a fantastic idea to let your Tinder hookup know right away just how bad your judgement is.

(The Joint Office of Homeless Services, an agency jointly funded by the City of Portland and Multnomah County, is contracting with Do Good and has ultimate oversight of the project.)
&gt; 
&gt; We have posted a link to the lease on our information page about the program. You can find that page here: http://ahomeforeveryone.net/stjohnsvillage.
&gt; 
&gt; That page also has basic factual information (FAQs) about the program, and a link to materials shared during the facilitated May 2019 SJNA meeting at James John, where members of the public were also able to ask questions of the program partners.

The dialogue about the impeachment starts near the beginning. Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.

3400,3400,Yaquinaking,1581717816,f3zm6x,Nan,"Ok, r/Portland, we have a coworker who recently returned to the Portland region after working in DC, California, and overseas for several years. Here’s the thing: she’s pretty rad, but she’s in her mid-30s and she’s finding it challenging to get plugged back into the region socially and meet new friends. Of course, she’s not unique in that struggle, which has been [well-chronicled in research and popular media.](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html)

Another coworker and I want to try to help her get connected with some of the great folks in Portland, and we figured that r/Portland would provide a trove of great folks. Here’s a description of our coworker, and a description of the kind of people we think she’d jive well with.
 
Our coworker: 36f, vegetarian for ethical reasons but also enjoys friendships with omnivores (absolutely no exclusive carnivores though -that’s just weird), married with no kids (though she says she’s kid-friendly), studied philosophy for undergrad at a hoity-toity liberal arts school, and got an MPA through a less hoity-toity online program. She likes deep philosophical and political discussions (she’s quintessentially liberal), but also needs friends who can just hang out and sing karaoke, go to shows, play board games, hike, ski or snowshoe, drink a bit, and just generally have a heartbeat and don’t take themselves too seriously. She laughs easily, and at dorky things like SNL skits (ie: Andy Samberg hip hop parodies).
 
You: 25-45f (though that’s flexible), politically liberal but able to laugh (or moderate/conservative, but openminded and enjoy lively engagement), smart and enjoy talking about smart things, well-read, generally positive and upbeat -although there’s nothing wrong with a good rant from time to time, not flakey, seriously interested in meeting a high-quality new friend, enjoy a range of activities, kind/empathetic (our coworker is a legit good person), and most importantly, fun!

#ABOUT KEITH WILSON
**Keith Wilson For Portland City Council**

Hello Portland, my name is Keith Wilson. I’m running for City Council because I want to get things done. I want to tackle sky-high housing costs, our growing homelessness, our inability to keep our city clean and maintained and deteriorating public safety. In addition, I would like to see a complete shift away from combustion engines for cleaner air. These are huge issues and not the time for half measures. I have a plan. I know how to implement and execute and, most importantly, I have the experience and record of success to meet and exceed these challenges. It is time to reTHINK PORTLAND for the decade ahead.

3439,3439,Uitwaaien,1581792654,f4dqxt,Nan,"TL;DR: water bureau told me I’ve been using 5x the normal amount of water, I did a manual and professional inspection and came up completely clean of leaks and a healthy looking meter. 

On Wednesday (2/12) I got a door handle notice about increased water usage on my property. Over the quarter, my usage had gone from always around or under 15 to 85. 

I did my own diagnostic tests to look for a leaks—gauged the water meter over the span of 2 hours while no in-home use, food coloring in the toilet tanks —and came up with nothing. 

I called a plumber out yesterday and had him do a diagnostic around the house. He said that the toilets, sinks, water meter and crawl area were all looking good and no issues to be reported. In fact, he said that everything looked so good that he wasn’t even going to charge me for the service fee it took to get him out there. 

So I contact the water bureau and gave them my clean bill. They told me that they had done the initial meter read on 2/7, and after seeing the skyrocket usage, sent someone out on 2/11 to manually check. They gauged that I had used 6 units over those 5 days, which is apparently an absurd amount of water. They recommended that I get a leak detector service check out the house instead of a plumber. 

So here I am. I have an appointment with a leak detector on Tuesday, but I’m hoping to see if anyone else has gone through this, has any ideas what it could be, or any ideas or what my next steps should be. I’m in the St. John’s area, if that helps.",Portland,Portland Water Bureau notified me of 5x increase of water usage on my property but plumbers gave me a clean bill

3446,3446,tehdimness,1581798438,f4f5il,Nan,"Very recently, the state added milk based products to containers subject to Oregon Bottle Bill, but within months, the OLCC backtracked and reversed it after the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative whined about it. Initially, they became redeemable effective 1/1/20, and manufactures were to label them OR 10c by 1/1/21. 

In the backtracking announcement, the State of Oregon announced retailers and BottleDrop may start rejecting them immediately until further notice. Well, I bought ice coffee containing milk the other day. The bottle says OR 10c, and I got charged 10 cents. There were other products on the shelf whose first ingredient was MILK, but nonetheless had OR 10c.

When you pay the deposit, money lands in OBRC's pocket. If you were charged deposit on milk containing beverage, it maybe wise to keep your receipt until you redeem these containers, so you have a possible class action lawsuit against the retailer or the OBRC Corporation should you be refused redemption payout on containers on which you paid deposit.

&gt; OLCC’s partners in the beverage container recycling industry have informed OLCC of technical challenges they face implementing the December 2019 rule changes. To better align with the barriers to accepting empty containers of milk and plant-based milk beverages that do not fall under the statutory exemption, the OLCC has initiated rulemaking to again look at the definition of “milk.” Until such rulemaking is complete manufacturers, retailers, and redemption centers may continue to apply the prior (pre-December 2019) definition of milk to beverage containers; this includes cultured milk such as kefir and buttermilk.",Portland,Bottle deposit on milk based products (it's complicated).

Recently, I've been having a problem with canners going through my **trash can**, ripping open the bags, and leaving the spilled contents strewn outside the bin. Inside the bin the trash is now unbagged, which causes further spillage when Waste Management empties the bins into the truck. My trash company requires that all the items in the trash can are bagged, so I am also at risk for getting a fee for the mess that the canners make.  It's not a bother to me when canners go through my recycling, but it has become very frustrating when they rip open trash bags and make a big mess.

If you get it, you get it. I have a lot of well-meaning people in my life that just want to help me (ranging from friends and family that do actually care and love me to complete strangers who should probably mind their own business) but I don’t actually have anyone in my life who gets it. 

My theory is that it is simply too painful and anxiety-inducing for anyone to consider that there are conditions that can’t be cured no matter how much money and radiation and sage you throw at them so it bubbles up into endless advice. I think they don’t realize how it comes off - as a fundamental mistrust that I could possibly have tried the “right” thing, because there HAS to be a cure. I must just not know about it. 

It’s exhausting and isolating and I’d love to make some friends that actually get it. As much as I love my friends and know they mean well, they cannot understand what it’s like to be bedridden for three days because your head won’t stop pounding or to have to give up so many things you love because your body just won’t cooperate anymore.

It had plastic screw-on clips on the pedals which were coming apart, they would sort of poorly fit my boots in them.

Unfortunately I didn't take a lot of pics of the bike during the years I had it, though I have a few from my garage which I annotated.

Please let me know if you see it around. I didn't think I'd be this sad-feeling about it. I know it was bound to happen eventually, but it was poor timing as I was already having a really bad day after my furnace broke.

**TL;DR gray spayed cat with white socks, white bib, and yellow eyes missing since early 2/20 one block off MLK.**

At about 4:30 AM - just after I took sleep meds to kill my insomnia - Katara took it upon herself to jump off the second-story balcony and resume her former life as a street cat. She is savvy, but she hasn't been outside since we moved here in July and she doesn't know the neighborhood at all.

We are very close to the church on NE Stanton Street and NE Rodney Ave. I wandered the block and surrounding blocks shaking her treat bag and probably confusing the crap out of any neighbors who are ATLA fans, but no dice. I'm barely conscious right now and definitely need to sleep at least a couple hours before resuming the search.

Fortunately her son did not follow suit. He is now curled up and looking at me piteously just in case I didn't feel like a bad cat parent already (seriously, Bumi, I get it). 

As mentioned, she has yellow eyes, very soft gray fur with a white tux/bib thing, white socks, and a cream collar with a heart-shaped ID tag (it is a tearaway however and may not be present). She's safe to approach but she'll likely stay clear unless you bribe her with food. One time she snatched an entire sandwich out of my hand. Cat treats are probably a better option though.

She's an idiot and I really love her. If you see her, please send me a PM or chat, or text the number on her collar

Thank you for reading. Here's hoping your day starts out better than mine has.

We still had fareless square, the 24 Hour Church of Elvis, Lorenzo's yummy Italian on a just blossoming Mississippi street and the Pearl was just firing up.

I live in Portland Oregon. My father left me a 76' GMC Palm Beach motorhome in 2012.  It has been sitting on a farm out in the open since then but ran when they took it out there.

I love this motorhome and my Dad always wanted to fix it up.  I've got zero understanding of what it might take, how to go about it or any type of understanding of a motor.

As soon as I got home I reported the car as sold on the DMV website and I mailed in my registration with a copy of the bill of sale to Salem. 

When I got home I realized my mistake in not having him sign the title so I called him up and he was super nice and assured me he would send me a pic of the signed title in a day or two when he goes to the DMV. I texted him about it again and he said he would send me a pic when he went to the dmv. 

I searched for the car on craigslist and sure enough he has it posted for a couple grand more than he bought it for. So now he is selling the car with my name on the title.

Running is an activity in which many people can participate due to the low barrier of entry, with really the only gear necessary being shoes. The hope is that we can motivate people who are new to recovery to start healthy habits and also bring them together with people who have been in recovery for some time outside of the normal environment of 12 step meetings. 

Our first meetup is this Saturday and I've received a few requests for shoes already via our website. I am looking for men's 9 and 9.5 and women's 6.5. I will take other donations outside of these sizes but these are the immediate needs. 

If you have shoes that you would like to donate, please DM me here or email me at [info@recoveryrunclub.org](mailto:info@recoveryrunclub.org). You can also visit [recoveryrunclub.org](https://recoveryrunclub.org) for more information or if you want details on when and where the runs will be taking place.

Finding people who do and will live alone and, who don't already have pets, is turning out to be really dang hard. I am thinking that there must be a senior citizen perhaps, or someone who just rarely has visitors to their home, who misses having a pet around....but maybe they are worried that they aren't active enough for a dog, or maybe they feel they could adopt a pet if only they had the life long support of a wonderful, very helpful organization (including a personal dog trainer if they would like), or maybe they simply need some financial support caring for the dog, or work during the day, etc. This little dog could be the perfect pet for them.

He doesn't need a lot of exercise, is small, loves his one person (they know from experience that he can and does quickly transfer his love from one human, to the next, when he his transferred into a new home!) and he comes with a really nice team of people ready to provide support as needed. This may be a really great situation for the right person. He seems to have had some trauma in his life, so he also needs someone who would appreciate learning techniques for managing the little things that he is afraid of. He can get very frightened apparently.

If you have any ideas for getting in touch with Portlanders who live alone (and will for a nice long while) please let me know. Everyone is really brainstorming on how to connect to solo people but we have been looking for awhile and are racing against the clock - he needs to leave his current foster's home yesterday and they really, really don't want to have to keep him in a shelter environment for any period of time. Pip seriously needs a street team of networkers... and I know Portland really loves dogs, so your thoughts and ideas are appreciated.  Cheers to Pip!

I got a leak detection service to come to my house and take a look around. He wrote up a formal inspection for me to send to the water bureau. His findings were as such: 

""After ruling out all other potential sources of leakage, I determined that all of the mentioned potential sources had not caused the excessive use. I also determined that the upstairs hall toilet was the source of excessive use, more particularly the fill valve and chain connected to the flush tower both allowed the water in the back of the tank to continuously flow down the drain. Occasionally when the chain is flipped next to the flush tower, it will draw water over the edge and cause the fill valve to continuously run, reference picture nine. While testing the fill valve, I found that the float on the fill valve will occasionally stick and allow water to constantly run, reference picture ten. It is recommended that all three fill valves on the toilets are replaced in order to prevent future high water usage.""

I cannot recommend [Steven Moon of Agent Leak Detection](https://agentleakdetection.com/) enough. He is a former plumber, journeyman, master plumber, and something like an ""investigative"" plumber?  He was so kind and taught me how to winterize my pipes because I didn't know how. I never would've found this myself, and even a plumber didn't catch it. The leak was silent, random, and constant so it makes sense the bill was so huge.   
Next week I am having a plumber from [Three Mountains Plumbing](https://www.3mountainsplumbing.com/) come out and fix these. The water bureau assured me that if I can prove these were fixed, the  bill will be adjusted to what my averages have been over the last year.  
Thank you for all of your ideas and sympathy. I hope this helps someone out in the future. I highly recommend both of these businesses for their promptness and helpfulness and sympathy.",Portland,!!!UPDATE: Portland Water Bureau notified me of 5x increase of water usage on my property but plumbers gave me a clean bill

Unlike the Talesin and Micah, who used antifa tactics of doxxing, violence and intimidation, Shawn understands the nature of physical confrontation and the value of handling things with peace, love and understanding.  Let us all be inspired by this great man, who is also a great example of why the angry people in this subreddit should reconsider their frequent demonizing of the homeless.

https://www.tprojects.org/newsletter-archive/july-2016/

""Meet Shawn Forde. While a student at the prestigious LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts in New York City, Shawn was devastated by his mother’s death from cancer in 1994. He joined the Marine Corps to channel his pain and anger. After 19 years of service including four combat tours, he was involuntarily separated from the Corps. Feeling lost by this separation from military life, he became homeless in 2014. Shawn eventually found his way to Doreen’s Place, one of our short-term residential programs, and began rebuilding his life. Assisted by one of our case managers, Shawn moved into permanent housing in 2015. In 2016, Shawn completed the Transition Projects Mentor Program, an intensive professional development course that equips formerly homeless with the skills they need to help others trying to escape homelessness. Today, Shawn is married, has three daughters, and is enrolled at Portland Community College, where he’s majoring in social work. His goals include earning bachelor and master degrees in Social Work/Behavioral Sciences and becoming a licensed counselor/therapist. This is what success looks like.""",Portland,Shawn Forde is the unspoken hero from the max stabbing

4100,4100,BagelsRTheHoleTruth,1582582767,f8zchq,Nan,"Some of you may have seen my posts from a week or so ago, seeking recommendations for the worst pizza in Portland. There were A LOT of them, and in the end they had to be whittled down, using(admittedly) somewhat arbitrary rules. This is the list I settled on, in no particular order:

* Slice
* Stark Street
* Guiseppe's
* Atlas
* Pizza Baron
* Oly's
* Picasso
* Tik Tok
* Pizza Jerk
* Bandini's
* Dirty Pie
* Silver Dollar
* Atomic
* 21st Century
* Blackbird

We decided that it was best to hit up two of these joints a night, so as not to stretch this thing out too long. Also, we decided that it was only fair to get one slice of cheese from each place, as a good baseline measure, as well as another slice of whatever they had on hand. 

So, without further ado...


**ROUND 1: Atomic vs. Atlas**


*Atomic*

* The crust was not quite cooked all the way through, and was a bit doughy in the center. It also failed what I will call the ""bend test"", where you pick up a slice by the crust, and see if it bends in the middle, and the tip of the pizza takes a nosedive for the table.

* There was a dash of oregano on the slice of cheese, which added a bit of flavor and nuance, but it seemed like the sauce had kind of slid toward the center of the pie, which made the sauce seem rather thin toward the edges.

* The pepperoni was pretty bland, which is saying a lot for a salty-ass meat like pepperoni.

* The slices were pretty darn big, with a lot (some might say too much) cheese. But for the price, I'd consider it a value.

*Service was friendly, and for how busy they were at about 5:30pm, it didn't take too long.



*Atlas*

* The slices were suuuuper thin. It seemed as if they'd been run over by a steamroller. I'm talking paper thin.

* Obviously they failed the Bend Test

*There was no oregano or spices - just some fairly flavorless cheese, and what, to me, was a criminally small amount of sauce. The cheese slice was basically bone dry (I peeled the cheese up and got a look underneath the skirt - nothing). Even though the slice was incredibly thin, it was super charred on the bottom, which isn't terrible, but makes you think that they'd at least pass ther Bend Test...

* The crust had little to no rise in it. No bubbles, air pockets, nothing. Just flat and sad. 

**Verdict**

Atomic was easily the better pie. While it wasn't the most fantastic pizza I've ever had, it certainly wasn't bad, and I'd likely go again. Atlas on the other hand is something I'd avoid. The price point was similar, but Atlas portions were substantially smaller, and the lack of marinara on their cheese slice was no bueno. If you can't even get some sauce on a slice, I don't know what to tell you. So, Atomic is safe, as Atlas has ""won"" this round in the race for the bottom.

We're going to try doing one round a week, and I'll post updates as I can. As we gather more reviews, I'll compare them against the past ""winners"", and eliminate places as we go.

Cheers y'all!",Portland,[UPDATE] The Quest for the Shittiest Pizza in Portland Begins

4182,4182,Th3Ru55ianMafia,1582677976,f9klhu,Nan,"My car broke down yesterday and I’ve been meaning to try to bike to school, so this was a great opportunity. 


I took out my bike for this first time in months and had a very difficult but rewarding ride across the river. Locked it by the bike racks (which had like 20 other bikes) by the main doors of the PSU Engineering Building. 4 hours later, ready to bike up the many hills leading to my house, I come outside and it’s gone. 

I got this bike like 2 years ago, and didn’t know anything about registration or anything. I don’t even remember the brand or model (I do have warranty information at home so that should help). 


I don’t expect to find this bike ever again. It was around $200 but it looked really nice and it was the first road bike I’ve ever got. 


It pains me that there are people out there that are so desperate that they’d steal a bike right in front of a bunch of students, I guess drugs are a hell of a thing. 
The surprising thing is, is that nobody stopped them. I’d imagine that locking my bike in front of the main doors of a pretty popular building where people stand outside and chat all the time would be a deterrent. 


But oh well. There’s no point in getting mad. The worst part is that now everytime I see a bike that looks similar to mine, I can’t help but think that it could be mine.

Just today I went to the bathroom in Cramer during class and based on loud grunt/moans and the trash bags visible under the stall, there definitely was a homeless man jerking off in the stall. 

About a week ago during the day there was a guy in the park blocks between campus buildings who lifted up his coat, his pants around his knees and his dick was fully out and visible. He was just walking around like this.

The library bathrooms have been especially bad recently, either entirely covered by piss or with homeless camping out sometimes in twos in the stall. Usually arguing incoherently.

At this point I'm not shocked by any of this but I just don't understand where my tuition money goes if it can't keep random grown men from jerking off in school bathrooms on a Thursday, or from walking around with their dicks out in our quad. Enforce the laws, keep this stuff off our campus please!

Don't even get me started on Parking Structure 3...

We already have keycard access points on all the buildings tied to our ID's, why not make them active all the time. There is no reason for homeless people to be in Cramer, Lincoln, Shattuck, the EB, or any university classroom building. This kind of stuff is not flying at other universities.",Portland,Something needs to be done about how the homeless act on the PSU campus.

Looking for a little advice for a friend. 

At an intersection with green light, but having to yield to oncoming traffic to turn left.

The back of their vehicle was in the crosswalk but the front was beyond it into the intersection. At the end of the light cycle the car in front of her (fully in the intersection) turned left, and they followed behind it. In the middle of their turn the light turned red.

It might be cut and dry violation on that. 

But what's the reg if you're partially in the intersection? Or say even fully? If you have a line of traffic behind you, you can't safely back up. And to sit will greatly impede traffic.

School me either way on it, for once the ticket isn't mine! 😆

You just load up designated kitchen trash can sized bags full of empties, drop them off and get paid about a week later. Hours are either 8AM to 8PM; or 7AM-10PM depending on spots.

People have had bad experience and getting screwed over in the past, but they've been better recently and they resolve it more agreeably these days.

I'm making this PSA, because I still see bottle return related posts here that discuss returning containers by hand one by one. So, this suggests there are still quite a few people unaware of the bag and drop option. Not wanting to waste tens of minutes returning bottles is the reason for many people who toss their empties into the curbside bins. More awareness of this easy way means less refundable containers getting thrown to the curb.

I went to the landlord training, one of many renter and landlord training offered by Portland Housing Bureau 
https://beta.portland.gov/phb/rental-services/fair-access-renting-fair-rules

They have really tried hard to push out a lot of training opportunities since we only had a few weeks notice to comply. The training was delivered by Christian Bryant from a property management company/ real estate investment company and while Christian had volunteered and been a part of the regulatory process, he is not a lawyer and just a person offering an explanation as he could.

Caveats: I'm just sharing my notes from the class. I'm not an expert. I own a single house that I rent, I'm not a big landlord nor am I an expert. The class was not taught by a lawyer or anyone from PHB, but was very helpful. It was 3 hours and I still felt like I had tons of questions. There were a lot of times people had questions in the class that were answered with ""I don't know"" and ""I'm not sure yet"" and ""That isn't well defined. I guess that will play out in courts"".  
I hope my notes help others:

**72 hour application process**

*The key word here is ""publicly advertised"". So you can advertise your rental and post when the 72 hour opening is for applications. You can speak to potential tenant and even show them the unit, but if they complete an application before the 72 hour window they experience an 8 hr penalty. 

*The time you ""count"" an application is when it is materially complete, meaning all required parts of the application are complete, they have provided all the proof of income and documentation and the screening fee has been received.

*Many questions about how you're supposed to decide which is ""first"" and how to calculate things like the 8 hr penalty (which gets more complicated if your rental is considered an ""accessible"" unit, meaning it is handicap accessible or could be with accommodations). The short answer is the easiest way is to do everything electronically. Ironically the instructor suggested this 72 hr period was supposed to help the lowest income applicants who do not have a computer ""have a chance"" to turn in an application. However, the difficulty in determining which is ""first"" and the record keeping involved if you accept both paper and electronic applications is really worrisome and it appears most people are going to do everything online now just because the record keeping for this will be automatic.

*You have to post on your listing when that 72 hour application window is, but it is up to the applicants to abide by it. If someone completes an application in full before the 72 hr window then are given an 8hr penalty during that window. So if I have someone submit 2 hours before my 72 hr window and then 2 applications 5 hours into my 72 hour window, the applicant that was ""early"" goes to the back of the line. (again this all becomes more complicated if you have an accessible unit) 

*The moment you start publicly advertising that 72 hr begins... but there is no definition of what publicly advertising is.

**Advertising:**
*When you post your ad you have a ton of stuff you now have to include on that listing. You must specify if the unit is accessible (meaning could a person with a wheelchair use most living areas). This does not exclude a house with stairs as a tenant can request (but pay for themselves) a reasonable accommodation such as a ramp or lift. 
 
*You must note when the open application period begins (a minimum of 72 hours later) 

*You must disclose the screening fee amount

*You must disclose your screening criteria. Since this is typically VERY lengthy, the recommendation was to link from your ad to a website or a dropbox file with your full screening criteria.

**Applications:**

*You must provide an opportunity for the application to ""affirm a disability status"" even if your property is not accessible. So now every application has to ask if you have a disability.

*For units that are accessible, there are some calculations to ""favor"" an applicant with a disability. There are conflicting definitions within the Administrative Rule text itself, one part refers to ""disabilities"" and another refers to ""Mobility disability"" so it is totally unclear if this applies to any and all disabilities or just mobility disabilities

*You must provide on the application a list of notices (recommend that you use links, but there are printable notices available) which include:
- notice for applicants right to request a reasonable modification or accommodation
- Portland notice referring where to obtain the PHB Statement of Applicant rights

*On the application you must include a description of the screening criteria and evaluation process

*On the application you must provide the applicant the opportunity to provide supplemental evidence. In other words, they have to have a chance to upload or provide documents for you to consider if they know something bad will come up during your check. These could be really anything.

**Screening fee limits:**
There are not limits on what you can charge on the screening fees. Most landlords will fall under the ""exact cost charged by the company"" or if they use a company and do some of their own screening it will be the cost the company does + 25%

**Proof of identification and screening:**
(This is where it gets zany to me)

*A landlord (LL) may not reject an application because they do not receive a SS#

*So the question is asked, if a certain credit score is required as part of your screening criteria, how do you check that without a SSN? There were no answers. 

*You have to accept anything that a ""reasonable person"" would say identifies a person, including expired ID. It seems crazy to me, as someone else pointed out, that you can't buy beer with expired ID but I'm supposed to let someone live in my property with one. 

The side talk about LL about this was interesting. I think the effect will be that LL will deny people and give them other reasons if they do encounter an application without a SSN

**Income Screening:**
I encourage interested people to read this part themselves, but there are limits now about adults who are listed as financially responsible and ones that are not and the max amount you can verify for income. It also widens the scope of what LL should consider as income. 
Accepting 2x rent and considering all forms of income, not just job income is something I already do so I honestly did not pay as close of attention to this part. 

I did note that in the screening criteria now that when you consider a co-signer, you can only verify their income levels compared to the rent you are charging NOT their debt-to-income ratio. I heard a lot of landlords saying this may cause them to change their policies regarding cosigning in general, and I can't really blame them. 

**Screening criteria and denials:**

*There are two options for screening. There is the city's ""low barrier"" criteria which allows you to deny someone with just a notice of denial with the statement of the low barrier criteria not met. Denial must be within 2 weeks of evaluation. This allows you to move quickly to the next person.

*If you do NOT use the city's low barrier criteria and you have your own custom one (most people do) you must consider the additional supporting evidence, and if you are still denying you must provide a written explanation of why that additional evidence does not negate the results of your screening. and the denial must be issued within 2 weeks of eval.

*The LL is required to offer a change appeal a denial for up to 30 days but you don't have to hold your unit, it just means they can appeal and if approved then any other rentals you have they don't have to go through screening again for the next 3 months.

**all the above fall under screening criteria regulations and violations are liable up to $250 per violation.**

**-------SECURITY DEPOSITS------**
Now this next part is about security deposits. Violations of these rules are INCREDIBLE steep. I'm frankly shocked the city won't give any chance for landlords to make this right or have some scale for the penalties. Violations to what I'm writing below are liable to the tenant for 2x the amount of the security deposit + reasonable attorney fees and costs. That is incredible to me that they won't even let the landlord make something right for an honest mistake.

**Lease:**
*The lease must reflect the name and address of the bank where you are holding security deposit (and last month's rent if applicable)

*You have to keep the accounts completely separate
(I encourage interested people to read more on this, other than making sure I tell my tenant where the address and bank account is I already follow these regulations)

*You must give a tenant a notice of the security deposit rights
There are limits on what you can charge for a security deposit if you also request last month's rent up front. Recommend looking at the brochure but basically the breakdown is if you request last month's rent up front then you can only as a max of 1/2 a month's rent as a security deposit. 

*It mentions nothing about pet deposits. The instructor believed nothing in these rules applied there, but that is untested and unclarified by PHB.

I'm still confused by the ""conditionally approved"" language which says if the LL is accepting a application upon conditional approval an additional security deposit up to half of one month's rent may be required. the tenant can ask that this amount be paid in installments of up to 3 months. I'm not sure what conditionally approved means it just points to Portland City Code 30.01.086 https://www.portlandoregon.gov/phb/article/737249 but it sounds like I just say ""you're approved on the condition you give me another 1/2 months of security deposit"" and then require that over the next three months? I'm unclear and anyone with more insight I'd love to hear your thoughts

**Condition Reports:**
*Tenant has 7 days after move in to complete and submit a condition report

*if not completed the LL has 17 days after move in to complete and submit

*it is emphasized LOTS OF PICTURES should be used in documentation

*if there is a dispute on the condition report, then they can get 3rd part validation...There is no business model or profession for doing this 3rd party validation so not really sure who you're supposed to get to do that. Probably not your uncle, but beyond that its unclear

*Any repair or replacement of anything in the house the LL must provide the tenant with an updated condition report

*The lease must include an itemized report describing the condition, age of fixtures, appliances, equipment and personal property

*Within 1 week after move out the LL has to conduct a walk through to document damage beyond wear and tear

*The tenant must be notified about the walk through date and time with at least 24 hour notice, and they have the right to be there during the walk through (which is honestly a safety concern for some people)

*The landlord (LL) can only charge for damage beyond normal wear and tear, defined by ""damaged caused by the tenant's actions or inaction""

*To charge for that damage, the LL must use the depreciation schedule published by [PHB here](https://beta.portland.gov/sites/default/files/2020-01/notice-30.01.087.c.1-depreciation-schedule.pdf)

Everyone noticed that the deprecation schedule and what you can charge is based off what you paid for the item, not the cost to replace it. That can be a big difference on larger ticket items. A lot of people, myself included, were concerned about the increase in documentation and overall financial risks that this particular change brings.

**Rental payment history**
*If you receive a request from a tenant or you send a termination notice, you must provide rent payment history covering up to the last 2 years. 

(it seems zany to me that if you are a day late with this you can be charge 2X security deposit + attorney fees + costs!)



So that is my notes! There were TONS of questions asked in the class. A lot of chatter between landlords and some angry people trying to figure out how to comply within such short notice. 

Some other good advice I heard:
Since you cannot give preference in applications if one person applies 1st and says ""I can move in a month from now"" but the third person says ""I can move in three days from now"" it is best to develop a policy and say in your add ""move in must occur within 2 weeks of approval"" under your screening criteria.

I've seen too many posts on the PSU subreddit, and now here, of people upset that homeless folk are in school buildings. More often than not in the posts they're doing nothing disruptive or criminal, just getting off the street and using the bathroom. I understand feeling uncomfortable seeing people living on the streets; we're taught that they're dirty and dangerous and that's hard to get out of your head. But you still need to make an effort. It is so easy to end up without a place to live. It is so easy to become addicted to something that takes away the pain. Take the time to think about how they got where they are, and what their lives are like.

This city has a huge homeless population, for several reasons. We have a mild climate where it's generally safe to live outside without freezing to death. We have public transit that could make it easy to get off the streets and also commute to work, shelters, food &amp; health resources - even though they're at risk of being harassed by police every time. We have an opioid epidemic and recovery isn't easy to get help with. We have a huge surplus of vacant luxury apartments and a shortage of low-income housing. This is an area where being homeless is not as deadly, but still extremely hard to escape from.

These are human beings with histories and families and feelings. Take out your airpods and listen to the people around you. They're not all waiting to stab you and take your wallet for crack. I got a train ticket for a guy at pioneer square last week. He asked where I was headed, asked about my classes. We talked about his own history in university, his friend who was an English professor at Concordia, his favorite authors. The people waiting on their train platform don't want to even look in the direction of someone with bad teeth and a dirty jacket. Take a minute to think about how dehumanizing it is to be treated like you're invisible.

It's okay to be nervous about your safety. You should carry pepperspray or other self-defense options when you're out in the city. Any city. But you have no right to criminalize people just because you're uncomfortable. Let people use a fucking bathroom.",Portland,To the PSU students posting about homeless on campus:

My friends and I are going meet in Portland for a weekend reunion. 
We graduated college last year and haven’t seen each other since. I was the president of our club and am charge of the itinerary, that being said I want to plan a really fun trip so we can keep these yearly reunions alive. If you could please drop some fun things to see, eat, experience..etc..  while we’re visiting your beautiful city, I would really appreciate it. 

I have already googled: best things to do in Portland .. but I feel like these travel sites are missing the mark lol. 
Again, any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Love you",Portland,Keeping it weird Portland trip

I’m trying a different tactic as regards moving and am looking for physical message boards where I can look for or post an ad for a room. Is anyone familiar w/ NW locations w/ heavier foot traffic where people post ads? Trying a different approach than CL and apps.

4624,4624,shittyFriday,1583158034,fccjnx,Homeless,"You are a Sophomore in a public university in the middle of a major city. Campus is built around a city park. This is not your house. Being a Freshmen is not a crime. Being a Freshmen does not make you a bad person. 

I've seen too many posts on the PSU subreddit, and now here, of people upset Freshmen are in school buildings. More often than not in the posts they're doing nothing disruptive or criminal, just getting off the street and using the bathroom. I understand feeling uncomfortable seeing people living on student loans; we're taught that they're dirty and dangerous and that's hard to get out of your head. But you still need to make an effort. It is so easy to end up without a major declared two years in. It is so easy to become addicted to something that takes away the pain. Take the time to think about how they got where they are, and what their lives are like.  

This city has a huge Freshmen student population, for several reasons. We have a mild climate where it's generally safe to live outside without freezing to death. We have public transit that could make it easy to get off the streets and also commute to work, shelters, food &amp; health resources - even though they're at risk of being harassed by smart asses every time. We have an opioid epidemic and recovery isn't easy to get help with. We have a huge surplus of vacant luxury apartments and a shortage of low-income housing. This is an area where being a Freshmen is not as deadly, but still extremely hard to escape from.  

These are human beings with histories and families and feelings. Listen to the people around you. They're not all waiting to stab you and take your homework. I got a train ticket for a guy at pioneer square last week. He asked where I was headed, asked about my classes. We talked about his own history in university, his friend who was an English professor at Concordia, his favorite authors. The people waiting on their train platform don't want to even look in the direction of someone with bad grades and a low GPA. Take a minute to think about how dehumanizing it is to be treated like you're invisible.  

It's okay to be nervous about your safety. You should carry pepperspray or other self-defense options when you're out in the city. Any city. But you have no right to criminalize people just because you're a Sophomore. Let people use a fucking bathroom.",Portland,To the PSU student posting about PSU students posting about homeless on campus:

The Catholic Church committed perhaps the largest crime against humanity with its systemic sexual abuse of children that lasted for many decades and perhaps continues even now. This was done on an organizational level to children.

Now compare this to the homeless, who a bunch of NIMBYheads are trying to demonize and say they are too dangerous to officially live near schools (as opposed to unofficially, which they probably already do.) The NIMBY Commander (Mike Vial) can't provide any examples of the homeless victimizing children in St Johns, much less in or near the school where the Village will be built. He certainly can't make an argument that the homeless are any more dangerous than an organization that everyone knows was involved in systematically raping 1000s of children. All of the members of the church know this happened and still go to the church, making them just as easy to demonize as your average homeless person.

In conclusion, Mike Vial, please show us how the homeless are more dangerous than Catholics or STFU and go use your lawyer power to target people who aren't in the most vulnerable group that you can find, like a little coward.",Portland,Catholic Church being built near school in St Johns!!!

This family of twelve people or so from Vancouver were on a plane to Portland from Las Vegas and started antagonizing this poor lady who was MOVING to Portland and on her final leg of the flight here and her adorable dog about the coronavirus. 

The lady and the family got in an argument about the virus. Flight attendants got involved.

The family  proceeded to cheer and make racial slurs after the poor women was kicked off and then e nasty family took off their shoes stink up the whole plane and let their unkempt children run up and down the aisles and just be general idiots.

If you are bullied on a plane, the flight attendants do not care what its about they will boot you off if you raise your voice. It’s their legal right.  

Also, for the PNW - as we sit in our coffee shops, ride our bikes around, skip our plastic spoons and generally think we are good people, it’s obvious we all are not and there’s a lot of work to be done.  While this horrible outbreak is going  on, to those who get their kale and bunker down remember that there is more than a medical risks regarding the coronavirus.",Portland,Asian lady kicked off a plane last night PDX to LAS over coronavirus argument

Please move out of the passing lane on the highways. Left lane cruising and hogging is dangerous as it causes faster moving vehicles to pass on the right. Once you have open road to your right, please move out of the passing lane. Please do not cruise at the same speed as people to your right while you are in the fast lane. This is causing a lot of congestion on our freeways and highways by impeding the natural flow of traffic. It is causing all of our insurance rates to go up as it causes more and more accidents and the insurance companies adjust rates to not loose money. It is causing more stress for commuters and weekend drivers trying to use the roads.

Having trouble getting toilet paper? Here's a way to make your own:

Supplies: bits of wood and screen for the frame (you can get creative with what dimensions you want your toilet paper to be in!), A blender, a large plastic tub, paper scraps and hot water. 

* Nail together a frame (rectangle suggested but your choice as long as it can fit in the plastic tub of water.) Do more than one if you want more than a few squares at a time. 

* Add the paper scraps to the blender along with a cup or two of water. You'll want to make a slurry.

* Fill the plastic tub with warm water so you've got at least 5-7 inches of water. Add the slurry.

* Put the framed screen into the water and agitate it a bit so paper fibers land on the screen when you lift it. If you lift straight up, there should be an even layer of fiber on the screen. Try to get a thickness between see-through and paper towel. If it's not right, just put the screen back in and try until it looks right. 

* Use a towel to apply pressure and remove as much of the water as possible. Set in the sun to dry.

I was doing just that with a customer's particularly obnoxious BMW SUV (big ole dub chrome wheels) when I received an important call on my work line. So I pulled over into, honestly, a loading zone, one surrounded by homeless camps and one I know to never be in use.

So I'm on my call and about 60 seconds later, you ride up on your white single speed, close to my open window, and say something. I'm entirely startled and say ""holyfuckingshit"". I expected you to be a homeless person asking for money or just harassing me (it's my neighborhood and that happens all the time)  You apologize but then ask me if I'm just on the phone, I say ...Yeah? And you say will you shut your cars engine off. Your speech impediment did cause me to harshly ask again for you to clarify, which I really do regret because that shouldn't have affected my response, but I was heavy multi tasking already and still not sure what was going on. Then I was probably audibly irritated when I agreed so you'd go away and I could keep doing my thing.

I'm a cyclist myself, and I happen to daily drive a fully electric car. I like clean air and the environment. But still, my mindset had me muttering ""mind your own fucking business"" as you rode off. I was annoyed that in the midst of the intense blight and trash of that street corner, you felt the need to do that.

Overall I'm disappointed the whole situation occurred. I feel like in hindsight, I wasn't being an angel but also not enough of an asshole to deserve it. I think you're smug and presumptious. You think I'm an ignorant redneck. If you read this, I'd like to hear where you're coming from and maybe we could discuss it.

Dear Campus Community,

 I want to update you on student enrollment and the impact this has on our current and future year budgets. I also wish to ask you to contribute ideas to help us improve long-term fiscal sustainability at Portland State.

As many of you know, we are predicting that our total student enrollment this academic year will decline by more than 4.5 percent from the 2018-19 academic year, resulting in lower-than-projected tuition revenue. In response, we asked for campus units to underspend their current general fund budgets. 

A further decline in overall student enrollment is projected to continue next fall based on currently received student applications. We are implementing key strategies to steady enrollment and grow revenue, but it will take time for these initiatives to yield results. 

To help alleviate service reductions, we anticipate spending up to $12 million of our limited reserves [context: PSU's total endowment was $73 million in 2017] in the coming fiscal year. Even after that investment, the university general fund budget will be flat from FY20 to FY21, which means all cost increases, including inflation, salary and benefits, will need to be covered without additional resources.

**Strategic Hiring Freeze**

Today I am announcing that a strategic hiring freeze will go into effect immediately for vacant education and general fund positions that are not in the final stages of the hiring process — in other words, where employment offers have been extended or accepted. Certain positions will be exempt under narrow criteria determined by university leadership. 

We continue to explore all mechanisms for reducing expenditures and costs. However, with over 80 percent of the institution’s budget in personnel, our most effective immediate action is to freeze vacant positions and fill them only after careful consideration of how they meet the strategic priorities of the university and are affordable within a reduced budget...",Portland,"PSU planning to spend almost 20% of endowment next year, and implement hiring freeze, to deal with falling enrollment."

I've been thinking about this a lot lately but especially after we got down to two candidates in the Democratic primary yesterday. 

Oregon gets taken for granted a lot because we are almost certain to go blue in the general election and because our primary is so late in the cycle. We started the Democratic cycle with \~30 candidates and by the time we get to vote only 2 will still be running.  It was basically the same story in 2008 and 2016. As of now, I'm not sure a single candidate has stopped in our state yet and only Bloomberg, Trump, and Styer have spent any money here. In 2016 Bernie and Trump both visited once and Hillary never came here. 

I know in 2008 McCain already had enough delegates before we even voted and Obama was the clear front runner before we got a chance to vote. 

I'm wondering what people would think about an effort to try and move Oregon's primary up to earlier in the cycle (Feb or March instead of May). This would hopefully make candidates have to stop here and actually speak to issues that matter to our state. It also gives Oregon the chance to have our voices heard when there are more than just two options left on the ballot. 

I don't know what the process would be (petition, legislative, etc) but it's something I figured I'd at least get some other opinions on.",Portland,What are your thoughts on moving Oregon's primary forward?

While I haven't been able to find specific test numbers for Washington, University of Washington has reported they have a current capacity of 1000 tests per day.

Additionally, UW reports a consistent 5-7% of tested cases come back positive.  This appears to be consistent with Oregon's numbers as well.  3 positive cases out of 67 completed tests is 4.47%



Admittedly this next part is speculation.  Washington's current confirmed number of COVID cases stands at 87.  If UWs percentages stand up, then it would follow that Washington has tested between 1,242 and 1,740 people.


Put another, more visceral way, Washington has more confirmed cases of the disease than Oregon has completed testing for.

That's troubling.  Oregon could be experiencing an outbreak of the same magnitude as Washington, and we wouldn't know.  And while Washington is taking proactive steps in effected areas based on their data, we're flying blind, with very limited data, and so unable to take any actions that might limit spread to vulnerable populations.

What I’m looking for:
To get those dead ends snipped so it’s healthy again! Also looking to keep some of the length, but I’d like short layers and swoopy bangs to give it volume. 

If they do a great job, I’ll of course return for more cuts and possibly platinum blonde highlights.

A man in his late 40's (or older) drives up next to me and screams out in rage ""What are you wearing that FUCKING mask for!?""

Yesterday was my last day in the 90-day treatment program portion of my diversion. I went the whole period was about 100 days, went to classes/meetings weekly and took/passed all of my random piss tests.. I'm at the point now where i just  to stay out of trouble for 6.5 months and i'll have the duii lifted from my record. 

First of all, I KNOW I am an asshole for getting a duii. I have sworn off alcohol for good i really think it only leads to trouble. the duii cost me a ton of money and ive been paying the price. But my question for anyone who has done the program or is in the know: Am I going to be required to take UAs (piss tests) between now and the end of the program? I am not supposed to drink at all for the whole period (which i wont), or use any drugs. But to be honest I wouldnt mind having a bit of weed here and there, in the past it has really helped me with insomnia and anxiety. Hey I know i'm not supposed to so please spare me the lectures :/. So my question is: Anymore UAs?

Forth, how about instead of posting online to a bunch of strangers, you confront the offender on the spot? I bet you often feel way more comfortable and safe telling *us* what not to do rather than the person actually affecting you.
Why don't you do something about it, and instead post a story here about how you were such a hero today for preventing the planet's demise by stopping someone from throwing a poop bag in someone else's trash can?

If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic and misinformation by arming you with sourced knowledge, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from outbreak zones such as Seattle, Australia, and the LA area. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now ready yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted in China through [Herculean efforts](https://twitter.com/NAChristakis/status/1237020518781460480).

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [100,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep. That means there is likely silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186). 

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and possibly breathing as well** (*see bullet point below*). But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[NOT PEER REVIEWED]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing as well. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: ""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now."" [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer. Also please note that this study has not been peer-reviewed, but due to the implications is included here out of an abundance of caution.)

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.**

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)--especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world and has [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients. [Toronto Star soberly warns hospitals can’t cope if coronavirus outbreak worsens in Canada: March 6th.](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/03/06/hospitals-warn-they-cant-cope-if-coronavirus-outbreak-worsens-in-canada.html)

* A surgeon working in the heart of Italy's outbreak gives a harrowing testimony and urges everyone to heed the warning that it can easily overwhelm hospitals ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffa2tf/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/fjx5tc8/) / [Original](https://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_07/coronavirus-bergamo-medico-humanitas-facebook-situazione-drammatica-altro-che-normale-influenza-4fdf6866-6088-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml)).

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

* People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html))

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. Follow the streps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper).  The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum.

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* Practice social distancing.

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO.

* Carry disinfectant with you.

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. 

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* If you have extra face masks, consider donating some to senior care facilities and hospitals, as there is a global shortage and they will desperately need them in the coming months. Masks in the right hands is to your benefit, as they slow the spread. Hoarded masks are actually detrimental to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitaizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Always remember the top three: Disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.

Though [here](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html) is a recent Slate piece that mentions a CFR between 0.2 to 0.4. South Korea, after doing 140,000 tests, reports a CFR of 0.6% ([source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-tested-140-000-031000719.html))

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, as SARS-like virus can have long-term consequences: ""Long-term bone and lung consequences associated with hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome: says a [15-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5)"". And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)).

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal--that and I've been following Covid-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in [Sydney](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), Australia, which will always be kept up to date (as will any of my PSA's that I posted myself, as long as they're still on the main page of that sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

People are walking around coughing on everything without even covering their mouths, or if they do cover their mouths they aren't doing it properly. No consideration to the fact they might be spreading a virus to people who can die from it. Nobody cares. Schools are still open, churches are open, concerts are open, no testing is being done. In two months our entire hospital system is going to be overrun if people keep on like this. Put a freaking mask on people or stay home. You can spread this whether you feel sick or not. Its already here. You might have it. The time for business as usual has passed. Take 20 minutes away from your instagrams and do a deep dive into this virus and then stop acting like its just the flu and there's no reason not to go out this weekend. Our government isn't going to act until its too late obviously so its up to us to change our behaviors. Come on Portland, you are smarter than this.

&gt; Governor Brown's statement
&gt;
&gt; With the Governor’s announcement last night banning gatherings over 250 people in order to help slow the spread of coronavirus, we are taking further steps here at the Hollywood to protect our audience, staff, and volunteers.
&gt;
&gt; For the next four weeks, we are limiting ticketing in our main auditorium from its capacity of 384 down to 250. (This will have an effect on some already-scheduled events that have sold out. If you have a ticket to one of those events, you will be contacted about next steps soon).
&gt;
&gt; This will be in addition to the steps we’ve already taken, which we outlined in a previous email. We will continue to monitor the situation and comply with any and all guidelines from Oregon Health Authority and the Centers for Disease Control.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your understanding.

Regarding the events where they have already sold over 250 tickets, I have a few ideas regarding what might be next. _None of this is official._ It's just me speculating.

- Offer refunds, and possibly even future discounts, to anybody who doesn't want to go out. This allows for natural attrition.
- Do some sort of randomized lottery where the losers are forced to surrender their tickets (with a refund).
- Whenever possible, schedule second shows and automatically bump some people to said shows.

Regarding whether or not any of this is a good idea, that's not my call. Everybody can make their own decisions. I'm just passing info along.

5535,5535,dufftheduff,1584053471,fhpbqu,Nan,"All staffers were sent an email some number of hours ago in regards to what will happen for their campuses due to the coronavirus. Stories are a little jumbled up until the actual alert comes through — this staff email said they would release a statement tonight — but essentially, here are the main things that were said. Apologies if any of them prove to be untrue in the coming hours, their plans might be changed before the official release is sent out. Anyway, here are the points I’ve heard from various staff members:

- Professors are to administer finals online. 
- All activities and gatherings for groups of over 20 (twenty) people are to be cancelled. Music events, clubs, classes, etc. 
- For next weeks finals schedule, there might not be any on-campus classes at all. 
- Spring break (officially starting March 23rd) will supposedly be extended by at least a week. Whether this speaks of the cancelled finals week, or the week of March 30th, or both, I’m not sure. In any case, spring break will be longer than a week. 
- The first couple weeks or so of spring term will take place entirely online. 

And that’s everything that’s been floating among staffers as of this morning. As for what is in the official statement, we should be seeing a mass email sent out by the end of the night. I think the thing that surprises me the most is the 20 person event ban; that’s every single one of my classes! Half of my classes are music classes and simply can’t be done online, so I’m intrigued as to how PCC will act on this.",Portland,Portland Community College said to release response/plan of action in regards to COVID-19 tonight (Mar. 12th)

I have tons of friends who work at Moda, tutor or work reception at the college campuses, and other jobs that have already essentially been closed down, who have no idea what they’re going to do as a result of the gathering ban. I am in this boat myself. 



What the hell are we all supposed to do right now? 
Even if by the first of April these bans are lifted, the lost income from now until then means I will not be able to pay my - already high - rent or electric bill next month. 
The rental/utility assistance services in this city are already abysmal and this will dry them up entirely if they aren’t already. 
Are we all just planning on packing up our homes and throwing in the towel, or what? 



I am in the high risk group, my doctor has instructed me to stay home no matter what, but I don’t have the luxury of sitting around and isolating until this is “over” - I doubt many of us can. 
I *need* income and I *need* it *now.* 


Unemployment doesn’t apply to me and wouldn’t be enough even if it was, and that’s the only option I’m seeing people toss around.

My fear is that someone who is self-quarantining themselves may see people approaching their house with a clipboard and open the door, thinking it is someone official.

Restaurants have very small profit margins, if they have to shut down, it is very unlikely they will reopen.

And anyone who wants to argue that we could be asymptomatic, so could the cashier selling your toilet paper, or the person delivering your food, of the pharmacist selling you your meds, or any random person in that public space with you.

Yelling to have things shut down to protect immunities is greatly affecting our economy.  That will be the biggest loss when we come out of this.

For those who feel overwhelmed with the challenge, ESPECIALLY with kids, I'd like to request tips from those of us that do work from home regurlarly.

For me, here's what helps:

1) Mornings are the best for me. While I'm not stuck to having to be online from 8a-5p like my spouse, it helps to follow that structure.

2) Avoid caffeine in the afternoon/evenings

3) Set timers for yourself to ensure you're getting all tasks done

4) Don't know where to start? Search for ABC123 or Quadrant methods of time management (use google) - there are more out there but they're effective with planning

5) Hosting a meeting? Make sure it's quick and to the point. Some people STILL love talking for 90 minutes if you let them so set parameters of talking times at the start of the meeting. Also, yes, people will be multi-tasking during the meeting

6) Try to log off at lunch and the end of the day. Going for a walk will help your sanity

7) Try to be in a different room of the house when working than when relaxing to allow your brain to switch

8) Set timers for your kiddos so you can have 20-60 minutes of time uninterrupted (depending on age). A friend of mine has his son read, do puzzles, screen time, etc. on a timer system and then they take a 5-10 minute break together. Gotta train your kid to leave you TF alone when working from home.

9) For some people, getting up, showering, getting dressed, and looking presentable is really important with videoconferencing or just motivation. I'm sure some of your coworkers will be dressed up on top but be wearing pajama pants (or worse). :) For others, they can wear jamjam's all day and be productive.

10) ENJOY THE LACK OF COMMUTE AND SLEEPING IN LONGER!!!",Portland,Working from home for newbies

4:37 PM (37 minutes ago)to current\_students 📷

Dear Students,

Portland Community College knows that the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus) throughout Oregon is of concern to our students, staff and community. PCC is committed to providing a safe and healthy educational environment, and recognizes the way we provide service may need to shift for a time in response to recommendations from the Governor, Oregon Health Authority, public health officials, Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help slow the rate of exposure and potential illness.

**The state does not recommend that Oregon’s colleges close at this time, and PCC will stay open and operational.** From a business and services continuity standpoint, the college has made operational decisions in response to the COVID-19 uptick. These decisions were made in the best interest of our students, faculty and staff, both to reduce the risk and spread of the illness and to maintain continuity of instruction and services.

Effective immediately,

* PCC will move toward a higher level of response that continues necessary operations of the college but that seeks to reduce the frequency of in person interactions among students, faculty, staff and visitors throughout our campuses, centers and facilities.
* Our goal is to maintain college operations and exercise social distancing, defined by the[ Centers for Disease Control and Protection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) (CDC) as avoiding crowds and mass public gatherings. In so doing, we are continuing to follow guidelines set by the CDC, the[ Oregon Health Authority](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx), and our local county public health agencies.
* PCC campuses and centers will remain open to serve students. In the spirit of social distancing, we encourage you to contact us by phone or email, however, we’ll be here in person, as well. Please note that some services may be impacted or modified due to staff absences or to improve access for students during this time.

**Now, how do these decisions impact you? And what can you do to stay informed?**

*First and importantly -* ***regularly check your PCC.edu email for updates and critical information***. This is the way that the college will be connecting with you. MyPCC Announcements also will be used to communicate critical information.

Below is initial information that addresses the operations changes and available support that you can expect in the upcoming weeks. Follow-up communications, with more details and guidance, will be coming your way next week. *Again, check your PCC.edu email and MyPCC frequently!* 

**Finals Week (the Week of March 16):**

* *Reach out directly to your instructors* to ask questions related to your final exam(s).
* Faculty, if they haven’t already done so, have been encouraged to find alternative ways to offer final exams other than in-person.
* Faculty have been asked to relax proctoring procedures and practices as often as possible, enabling students to finish the Winter Term. 
* Should in-person finals need to take place, they will take place as scheduled.
* All college service areas - including food pantries and other [support resources](https://www.pcc.edu/student-leadership/services/free-resources/) \- will be open. 

**Spring Break Week (the Week of March 23):**

* All college service areas - including food pantries and other [support resources](https://www.pcc.edu/student-leadership/services/free-resources/) \- will be open for business. Note that many communications with service areas can happen remotely - via phone, email, or even “chat” in some departments. Check PCC.edu for information on specific department hours and services.   

**Spring Term:**

* For the first three weeks of Spring Term -- through Friday, April 17 -- *instruction for traditional, face-to-face classes will be offered remotely, using college-supported technology to assist remote teaching (Google Hangouts, etc.).* During this time period students will not be required to come to a campus or center for instruction.  
* There will be some, limited, courses that must meet in person. For these, we will do everything we can to adhere to social distancing best practices in the learning environment on campus.
* *Regularly check your PCC.edu email* for explicit directions and guidance from your instructors about your Spring Term classes. This will be sent as early as the week of March 16.
* The start date for spring term, as well as published add, drop, and payment due dates will not change. See the [Academic Calendar ](https://www.pcc.edu/enroll/registration/academic-calendar.html)for more information on key dates.
* We are working on requiring that all classes have a syllabus and introductory statement on how instruction will take place for your class during the first three weeks posted in Brightspace (D2L). This does NOT mean all classes are “online.” The consistent use of Brightspace to post a syllabus and communicate the instructional delivery plan will ease this adjustment during this time. **Please become familiar with PCC’s** [**Student Online Learning Resource**](https://www.pcc.edu/online/students/) **if you are unfamiliar with Brightspace.**  
* Computers will remain available in the libraries and labs for use by students for the online, remote delivery of classes. Hours for these resources will be adjusted to accommodate need for access by students. Please check the[ library website](https://www.pcc.edu/library/) for updated hours.
* The college will make a decision on Wednesday, April 15 about returning to regularly scheduled, in-person classes for the rest of Spring Term. Again, more information to come -- *check your PCC.edu email and MyPCC Announcements*.

We will continue to update[ the college's coronavirus website](https://www.pcc.edu/coronavirus/) on PCC.edu, so please remember to regularly check it for new information. And similar to our operations for inclement weather, updates will be posted on PCC.edu and via[ PCC Alerts](https://www.pcc.edu/public-safety/safety-alerts-and-timely-warnings/), among other communication channels should a closure become necessary.

And here is a reminder of the  best preventative measures for COVID-19 that we encourage you to follow:

* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds with warm, soapy water or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol, especially after using the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
* Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
* Stay home when you are sick. If you’re sick with flu-like symptoms, plan to stay home until you are symptom-free (as in, no fever) for 24 hours. 

Following are links we’ve shared in previous communications for helpful background. You also can call the state’s general information number, 211.

The issue is supposedly about not overloading the state data center. Rather that creating a plan to work within their parameters, they've decided to make all employees still come into the office, despite the fact that there is already known tertiary exposure, therefore the virus may already be alive and well among state employees.

No restaurant can follow health code perfectly, employees have no choice but to handle food with unclean hands. We are constant picking up dirty dishes, napkins, etc. I wash my hands as frequently as possible (until they hurt), but it’s impossible to wash your hands between every interaction. 

Furthermore, the service industry is dominated by the myth of the “good worker,” who never takes time off, works through sickness, and never lets their coworkers down by showing up and working no matter what. I’ve worked with multiple coworkers over the last week who are sick and still came into work.

The biggest health concern is all of y’all who continue is to dine out en mass. Large groups aren’t supposed to meet without sanitation standards in place, yet in even medium sized restaurants you could be in a group of 100-150 people. I see guests coughing, sneezing, not washing their hands after using the bathroom etc. Think of it like driving—the risk factor is the other drivers on the road.

The Tribes are independent but the government may still be able to negotiate or apply pressure.

My husband I are having a slight disagreement about this.  We  agree that my 17 y.o. stepson shouldn't be going to the mall, movie theaters, etc.

I'm wondering how much we should limit interaction with friends. Should he be allowed to go to friends homes?  Should his friends be allowed at our home? 

I think we should limit his interactions with other kids. My husband thinks they should be able to hang out at our home, or he at theirs. (But, what if the other kids are out at the mall with no worries, then they come to our house?)

We don't know how seriously his friends' parents are taking this and the parents of the boys do not communicate well.) On top of that, teenage boys can be lax about hygiene. 

My husband is 64. I'm 59. I have a good friend who is immunocompromised due to MS meds. I want to take this seriously, but I don't want to go overboard.

My girlfriend saw a post on Facebook or something last night about a healthcare worker mom who has an immunocompromised kid and weren't sure if they would be able to get tested in time because oregon has a 40/day limit (or something, I'm not super up to date on the news cause I'm young and healthy). I just wanted to make this post to inform those of you in similar situations where it might be worth the drive to Colorado to get that testing done. It is limited to the first 100 or so people, and you DO need a doctors note, but I'm just trying to spread awareness to help those of us whose bodies can't fight it off on their own.

This is probably a long shot, but here we go...

Earlier today I accidentally left a rose quartz necklace in the security bin. When I noticed about an hour later, I went back over to security. They were very helpful and actually searched around and eventually reviewed security footage, which showed a person after me hold up the necklace and take it (not an employee).

This necklace means a lot to me because I gave it to my mother as a birthday gift years ago and it was created by a good friend of mine.

My mother was murdered last year and I was so happy when I found the necklace at her house because I felt like a part of her was in it. I even touched it to her lips while she was in her casket at her funeral.

I'm actually traveling right now to go to the trial for the person who killed her.

Losing the necklace feels like I lost her again. It's killing me.

I just want the necklace back, so if you have it and you see this, please PM me.

I appreciate any upvotes for visibility.

Not to dump on people but in hopes of normalizing, bringing awareness and allowing others to feel the freedom to own their struggles too. The chaos and hysteria in not just my local community but around the world has been triggering to say the least. As I finish reading my local community’s reddit feed and drink my coffee and go through my daily meditation and affirmations to keep my sanity and panic at bay- I am trying to remind myself in the midst of this all what I do have today, what I am thankful for.  Trying to use this time to slow down, enjoy being home, enjoy being still and being thankful to have a job to go to at all. I guess what I’m trying to say is we are all triggered and in that we are inadvertently triggering others. Try to slow down, try to breathe and remember we are all stressed, we are all tired and we are all just trying to make it through the day.  I’m not one to encourage forced smiles and fake kindness and fully know sometimes it takes everything in you to just go through the motions.  If you can just go through the motions today with compassion and awareness that others are struggling too I think we might all feel a little more connected and a little less afraid and hysterical of each other.

6014,6014,Olivander_Douglas,1584245251,fivlpo,Nan,"“Hello everyone,

We are in this together.  And “this” is getting pretty intense, pretty quickly. I don’t think any of us imagined the year kicking off this way. We had intended to start our year gathering together at our company meetings, reflecting on the importance of our service to and impact in our communities. Those meetings have been postponed, and yet our impact in and service to our community is more important than ever.

These are extra-ordinary times requiring extra-ordinary measures. As COVID-19 continues to spread, we are seeing unprecedented closures and cancellations, from NBA basketball games to schools. We all need to do our part to help reduce the spread of this virus in our communities and to also know we have the space to care for our family and ourselves. Your health is a priority – for everyone involved.

So, here is what we are doing during this extra-ordinary time:

We are providing information on the preventative measures you can take (wash your hands and stay home if you are sick!) and following up with any staff who show symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath) to make sure they are seeking appropriate medical care.  Please see the attached PDFs on benefit resources available to all staff and the steps you should take if you are quarantined for or diagnosed with COVID-19.
We increased our sanitation routines to keep your work environment safe.
We temporarily amended our attendance policy so that you will not be issued points as a result of family care or illness absences related to actual or possible COVID-19 infection. This includes regular childcare if your child’s day care or school closes as a precautionary measure.
We are providing additional Paid Time Off (PTO) for you to recover from or care for a COVID-19 related illness. We understand that a COVID-19 diagnosis, whether your own or a family member's, is stressful. To provide some financial security, we are offering the following PTO, effective March 11th and through at least May 1st:
In conjunction with any applicable state benefits, you will be paid for your first two weeks of missed shifts related to:
COVID-19 symptoms (fever and/or shortness of breath &amp; you may have a cough)
A positive or presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19
A health authority mandated quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure
Care for a family member in quarantine or ill with COVID-19
If you need to be away from work beyond those 14 days, we will first apply any PTO you have available, along with any short-term leaves or other options. 
If you are unable to return to work at that time, we will then provide additional pay, for up to a total of 30 days, if you require additional time to:
Recover from a positive or presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19
Remain under a health authority mandated quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure
Care for a family member in quarantine or ill with COVID-19
We have limited our support offices to business critical staff only.  All other support office staff are directed to work in stores to support the increase of business and shortage of store staff.
We are asking everyone to be as flexible as possible with the work you do in store, and when you do it. Could you work shorter shifts, shifts at different stores or in other departments? Everything is an option.  Please work with your manager to determine the schedule that can work for you &amp; your family.  If you are healthy and available to work, come to work.  If you are sick, stay home.  If you can be flexible, be flexible.  Prioritize your health and that of your families first and foremost, but we need your help to continue to meet the needs of our customers and community too.
If you exhaust your PTO and need additional paid time to stay at home to care for your children, we will pay for any scheduled shifts at least through current regional school closure dates: March 31st for Portland and Northern California region, April 24th for our Mercer Island store.  As this situation evolves, we will evaluate any extension to this timing.
Taking care of our families (and that includes our work family too!) is incredibly challenging in these unusual times. We know you’ve been under a lot of pressure, and appreciate the care you continue to show for each other and our customers. We hope these changes provide you with the peace of mind to prioritize your health and families, and appreciate your commitment to serving our customers.

Please check the Pantry for regular updates as more information is available, and thank you again for all you do!

If you \*do\* go over the 1TB nonsense at all, and have never done so in the past it \*will not\* count against their courtesy month policy. So if you blow 3TB or whatever this month and the next, you will still have the two ""courtesy"" months. AKA - usage plan is fully paused.

Sent on behalf of the President’s Cabinet

Dear Colleagues,

The spread of COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) within Oregon is of concern to all of us at PCC -- students, staff, faculty, and administration. Because of how COVID-19 is evolving, the way we provide service and conduct college business is shifting as soon as possible. 

To accomplish this, college facilities will remain open and operations will continue, with the expectation that staff, faculty and management will work -- in new ways, and in the safest possible manner. If instruction, student services, and support operations can be delivered remotely by personnel without compromising service quality or operational security, we will pursue this option as soon as we are able.

Our response is based on recommendations from the Governor, Oregon Health Authority (OHA), public health officials, Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  We are also in regular contact with the Oregon Community College Association (OCCA), the Oregon President’s Council (made up of the presidents of Oregon’s 17 community colleges), some of the Oregon university presidents, presidents of higher education institutions across the country, our regional accreditor, national associations, and our federal delegation to assess best practices in response to this situation. 

Our goal has been to mirror our efforts, and Oregon’s public higher education institutions are responding accordingly, adhering to OHA and HECC guidelines (see page 3) and remaining open. We’re opting to offer as much remote or virtual instruction and student services support as possible, which allows for social distancing and maintains continuity of instruction and services.

We know that some of you are feeling anxious, in part due to the barrage of daily news reports about the illness and its impact around the world. We’ve heard from several of you that the Governor’s decision to close K-12 school districts through the end of this month is a concern, followed by the question of why PCC isn’t closing, too. We’re also hearing concerns about employment and health benefits as our operations change, or if the college needs to close. 

Again, we’re in communication with the OHA and making operational decisions that are in the best interest of those we serve. Supporting continued instruction and services as we move to greater remote or online instruction is our priority.  This is especially true for our most marginalized student populations whose access to the college’s physical facilities, services and resources is critical.

We recognize that some forms of instruction, student services and other operational services are unable to be delivered remotely because of equipment, security, or compromised service quality. For these situations, some staff will be asked to work on site, to ensure continuity of instruction and operations. Protocol is being developed quickly for such on-site work that enables social distancing.

Guided by our commitment to students, management is analyzing the unique situation in their individual areas of oversight, and has discretion to develop and approve necessary operational changes and telecommuting agreements. We are striving to be flexible with our approach. 

Managers will be given authority to assess what work must continue, which functions and services may or may not be provided remotely, changes to these functions in light of our new work environment, access to technology for remote services, and more. Another communication will be sent to managers on Monday with details.

Coordination to operationalize these changes will be done with managers’ supervisors (Division Dean, Dean of Instruction, Dean of Students, etc.) and their respective executive officer (President, Executive Vice President, Vice President or Campus President), and shared across campuses and centers to ensure consistency within particular reporting structures. We recognize that different work agreements may be created for different service lines and individuals. As a community and a college, we’re navigating uncharted territory, and we ask for your support, grace and tolerance as we journey together.

Be assured that Cabinet is in regular conversation as the college adapts to quickly changing internal and external environments. Each member is in direct and continual contact with management as decisions are made, so that we can compare and amend as need be. Administrators will continue to work on site and be present and available to support faculty, staff and students throughout. They’re also leading the mitigation teams and efforts that have been underway at the college for the past week or longer. These include:

An Emergency Operations COVID-19 Planning Team that is reviewing the daily information from the health agencies, evaluating the risks, and analyzing the impact to PCC.

A Communications Team responsible for creating and updating the COVID-19 Website with content for students, staff and faculty -- https://www.pcc.edu/coronavirus/ -- and MyPCC, and for responding to questions from students, staff and community related to COVID-19.  Centralizing communication is critical.  Please send ALL inquiries about COVID-19 to covidquestions@pcc.edu.

A Business Continuity Planning Team that is planning for operational continuity in preparation for short-term and long-term potential disruptions.

And working closely with each of these teams is another dedicated “ring” of responders:

Instruction Continuity Planning

Student Services Continuity Planning, and

Management groups charged with developing operational plans as described earlier (e.g. Division Deans, Student Affairs Leaders and Auxiliary managers)


We continue to field questions related to efforts to clean, disinfect and sanitize facilities at the college. As shared in previous communications, the college is following guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to its regular environmental cleaning of all rooms and buildings, our Custodial team has increased its attention and frequency to high traffic/high use/high touch areas and objects (door knobs, handrails, counter tops, elevator buttons, etc.). Facilities Management Services (FMS) is monitoring and replenishing sanitizer stands throughout the college, with more being added. Disinfectant wipes have been ordered for high traffic locations, like student computer labs, but due to the COVID-19 situation across the state, an arrival date for the order is pending.

Here's where we need your assistance during this 'all hands on deck' time -- please help us be proactive in sharing the responsibility for your areas, departments or divisions. Managers can help by purchasing hand sanitizer or disinfectant wipes for their areas and distributing for use by their teams.

Again, we thank you for your support and partnership as we work together to ensure that PCC is taking preventative and responsive measures for our staff, faculty and students. This is truly an unprecedented and evolving situation, and we appreciate your efforts on behalf of our students and college community. More communication will be regularly shared by email, as well as posted to our COVID-19 website. In the event of any unanswered questions, please email covidquestions@pcc.edu.",Portland,The latest in the Portland Community College saga

We recognize that you are facing many disruptions and unknowns due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) public health situation. Because of how COVID-19 is evolving, the way PCC provides instruction and services is also shifting. Like other public universities and community colleges in Oregon, PCC remains open and operational, while moving quickly towards offering as much remote or virtual instruction and student services support as possible. Up-to-date information can be found on the college’s Coronavirus (COVID-19) Resources page. 


This is the first in a series of communications from my office during the upcoming days and weeks. The intent is to provide you with timely information and guidance to support your continued enrollment, learning, and achievement of educational goals at Portland Community College. Today’s focus is on Finals Week (March 16-20). Below are responses to questions that you may have related to completing your final exams for winter quarter. 


How do I check the status of my final exams? Will my final exam still be offered? 

If you have not heard from your instructor about any changes to your final exam, please communicate directly with them to confirm the status of the final exam for your class. Instructors have been encouraged to offer alternative ways to conduct final exams and activities remotely, where possible. Guidance and training for instructors to support these alternatives have been taking place for the past few days.

If you need any help, contact the Student Help Desk at 971-722-8222 or email shd@pcc.edu. 




Where can I take my exam online if I don’t have a computer or internet access? 

Computer Labs and Libraries across the college will be open during Finals Week. For up-to-date hours and information, check the Library webpage and the Computer Labs webpages. 


Why is my exam still happening in person and on-campus when the college is moving to remote instruction and services?

Currently, the college is open and operational.  Some courses and subjects require specific facilities, equipment, or labs to conduct a final exam. The college is limiting these experiences and all courses that are having final exams in-person this week will be practicing social distancing to keep everyone safer.  


What should I do if I am sick, quarantined, or taking care of others that are?

We have encouraged instructors to be flexible with absences during this unique time. Communicate with your instructor about your concerns to see if there are other options for completing your course before the end of the term. 


What will happen if I cannot take the final exam due to the above? 

Let your instructor know if you cannot take or complete your final exam for any reason.  Your instructor may allow alternate ways for you to demonstrate knowledge of the course material, assign an incomplete that you would have up to a year to complete, or provide other ways to make-up the final exam within the existing finals week window. Options will vary and your instructor, as well as academic advisor, can assist you to determine the best choice for your unique situation.


What if I don’t believe I was graded fairly in a course?

After the end of the term, if you believe you were unfairly graded, you can use PCC’s Final Grade Appeal process to challenge your final grade for the course. Information can be found on the Appeals, Complaints, and Feedback page. 


How can I report my dissatisfaction with any aspect of my final exam experience?  

Please communicate directly with your instructor to share your concerns and attempt to identify solutions. If you are still dissatisfied, you may submit a Complaint which will be reviewed by the appropriate academic Dean in a timely manner. The link to the online Complaint form can be found on the Appeals, Complaints, and Feedback page. 


We appreciate your continued patience as we work to maintain your educational experience.

**So I am a local Registered Nurse ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/b3otty/bsn_nursing_student_in_icu_and_soontobe_rn_here)** from a year ago) in a nursing unit that is and will be providing lots of direct, front-line care to COVID-19 pts at one of the hospitals here. I don't want to call it out directly in this post for fear of risking my job during this time I'm critically needed, but I can prove all of this. 

**I am asking for help from the community to get donations of medical supplies you think you might be able to spare: N95 or simple/surgical masks, goggles, face shields, medical isolation gowns, gloves, bleach products of any kind, antimicrobial hand soap, hand sanitizer, hair nets, shoe covers, portable medical sanitizing equipment (e.g. UV-C lights), etc for myself and my coworkers that we can use if we run short in the hospital, which I suspect is a VERY, VERY high possibility in the coming weeks. My coworkers and I would love to have any of these things and we welcome other medical supply donation ideas!!!**

Nurses and other healthcare workers around the state are beginning to see COVID-positive and COVID-rule out pts, myself included. We're waking up to headlines like [this](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8112063/America-braces-coronvirus-collapse-100-00-ICU-beds-10-MILLION-hospitalized.html). We're reading about and watching videos from China and Italy showing the personal protective equipment (PPE) they're wearing [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0EL9vKqRA8) and comparing it to our own. Check out r/nursing for more on what we're seeing and experiencing in real-time.

We are hearing from our work organizations at this time that we're already short because about 80% of the world’s PPE supplies are produced in China – a country that has clearly been hard hit by the COVID-19 situation. COVID-19 caused major disruptions in the manufacturing process. Plants were shut down for extended periods, which halted production. China also stopped exports of these supplies, in part to ensure it had the needed supplies to care for its own population.

My coworkers and I expect to be wearing very inadequate PPE soon when sh*t hits the fan, and expected to continue to work until if/when we get symptoms or test positive. Not just at my institution but across the state, we're already being told at multiple institutions not to wear N95 masks as those are in short supply, though if you look at China and Italy it's CLEAR they're using N95+ equivalents and so much more. Not to mention just how clearly contagious this virus is, clearly our average droplet PPE measures are not enough.

**IF you have to spare any: N95 or simple/surgical masks, goggles, face shields, medical isolation gowns, gloves, bleach products of any kind, antimicrobial hand soap, hand sanitizer, hair nets, shoe covers, portable medical sanitizing equipment (e.g. UV-C lights), probably dang near any other medical supplies you can think of... My coworkers and I would love to have them!!!** 

If you decide to donate, I can then show you proof of where I work, and I SWEAR to it every last piece of medical supplies donated will be used by front line medical staff in desperate need, and I will share it with my coworkers LIBERALLY. Again see [my proof post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/b3otty/bsn_nursing_student_in_icu_and_soontobe_rn_here) above...I am one to share liberally to others when in need. I live on the west side not too far from 217 &amp; 26 intersection. I work again in a few days from now, so for a few days I can drive around especially if on the west side for supply donations pretty easily. I then work a ton of shifts in a row on nights....and possibly then much more than that as needed at work, so I also heartily welcome drop-offs of donations too!!!

Thanks for reading :) Stay safe out there everyone.

**Finally: IF you think I should post this somewhere else as well for max traction, please tell me where! If you think I'm posting too much that's personally-identifiable here, I welcome feedback. Thank you!**

Please feel to comment below, or direct message me ANYTIME with donations or questions going forward!!! I expect to be accepting and welcome supply donations for my work team not just now but for the foreseeable future! Thanks guys.

We are all worried about what will come, we are all stressed about the unknown personal financial impacts, and we learn more about the virus everyday somethings about it remain unknown... that is a lot of unknowns in our futures to cause a lot of anxiety. My heart genuinely aches for so many folks feeling fearful in these times.

We have the ability to call upon the better angels of human nature. To find the middle ground where we are still cautious- practicing social distancing, washing hands frequently and keeping informed.... but also keeping calm, making sure to view data and claims critically and sharing information only with citing sources so others can do the same. There is a lot of misinformation out there that is aimed at targeting people in such a panic they don’t think twice. There are phishing campaigns looking to email you scary emails you will click on to infect you with malware...Let’s be calm enough to identify rumors and misinformation as such through research and citation and not make it worse through spreading it.

These families are desperate and in need of these donations. They rely on us every week so that they can feed their families and children. 

Due to the panic buying as of late, we have no donations to collect. This coming weekend we sadly may be closed due to lack of donations and will not be able to help these families. I understand the need to stock up on a few extra essential items in these difficult times because of the COVID-19 and social distancing. I understand this is out of our control and I can’t blame anyone. It’s just simply an unfortunate situation and I thought people should know what goes on behind the scenes. 

I don’t blame anyone and this isn’t something that can be controlled. Just a PSA. Thanks for taking your time to read this. I just want the community to be informed.

tl;dr My question is, is it worth the economic hardship on our working and middle class to do something that really doesn't help the people truly under threat?

Things I am not: not a Trump supporter whatsoever and not saying his admin's response has been anything but awful, not advocating for people to ignore basic precautions, not saying anyone's life 'doesn't matter'

We know Covid19 affects about 80% of the population much like the flu...symptoms will be minor or non-existant for some, mild-moderate for others. In the high-risk groups, which we have identified and know how to protect, symptoms for Covid19 are again much like the flu. High risk groups can be a severe infection and without proper care die.

We need to start thinking about the cause/effect of our decisions more clearly, imho

Yes, closing restaurants will inarguably have \*some\* effect of slowing down infection...slowing down, but by how much? Is it going to protect high-risk groups more?

***There's no causal link between closing restaurants and lowering fatalities and severe cases among the high risk groups.*** 

Everywhere seniors and other high-risk people live is under lockdown with precautions in place. If someone is dumb enough to not take precautions now before they contact a high-risk person, closing restaurants won't make them less-dumb. There's no cause-effect...just the vague impression of it because of hysteria.

Some of you may have seen the recent [Oregonian story](https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2020/03/powells-expands-coronavirus-layoff-warns-it-will-be-several-months-before-normal-operations.html) about the layoffs the company will be conducting. Here’s what’s been happening, and what we as workers are currently facing:

**TLDR:** Almost all of us will be let go. We will receive no severance. Our health insurance runs out in less than two weeks. If we get sick, we cannot claim unemployment. *Please help if you’re able to, via links at the bottom.*

Over the last couple weeks, since the COVID pandemic really starting ramping up, the company started implementing more rigorous cleaning regimens throughout the stores, followed by social distancing to limit how close employees could be to one another. On Sunday, 3/15, with almost no warning to employees (some workers were still on their way in to work when they found out), they closed all their stores, sending a text alert conveying as much to all staff. The stores were to remain closed until 3/31, with further information coming, though they somehow planned to keep the website up for online orders (the workers who were sent home fill and ship those orders, normally). We didn’t hear anything more for 24 hours. 

Yesterday, 3/16, the company sent an email saying they would be laying off most employees permanently. We’ve been told that over the next few days, we’ll be getting calls letting us know if we are part of that layoff, though we’re expecting the final number to be big. Really big. 

Powell’s workers (aside from management) are unionized through [ILWU Local 5](https://ilwulocal5.com/), and there are over 400 of us. We are a diverse group of people, from all walks of life in varying ages and personalities, but we’re all united by our love of books, and there has always been an indelible sense of pride in the expertise we’ve honed to help get the right book into your hands. We ship books all across the world everyday. People visit us from nearly every continent. We are a local community fixture, a host for artists and writers, and a city landmark, having operated in Portland for 49 years. 

I have always been proud to tell people I worked at Powell’s over the years that I’ve been there. But today I feel ashamed of that affiliation. We are facing an unprecedented upheaval of all systems of our daily life at the moment, and there’s no denying that this pandemic will leave a lot of lives destroyed in its wake. But we’re being tossed to the curb with no pay, no severance, health insurance that expires in less than two weeks, and the hard slap that comes from the company so bluntly writing us off after so many of us have poured our passion and hard work into making the business the one of a kind place that it is. 

Many of us are older workers. Many of us have children who rely on the support of our jobs at Powell’s. Many, many of us have health problems that range from moderate to severe. Many of us live paycheck to paycheck in a city that already has astronomical rents. And so many of us wanted to keep devoting ourselves to making Powell’s what it is, or at least, what it was. We won’t get that chance now.

I know we aren’t alone in being laid off. This is happening everywhere. And for workers to be let go without pay or severance or any kind of safety net in a situation as deadly as the one we’re all in is *wrong*. Any company that does this now could very well be the cause of death for some their workers. 

Like most people, we’re scared. The odds are that most of us won’t have a job after the next couple days, and there’s a lot of frustration over how the company is handling this. 

We all know how thin the profit margins are in the book business, and the volatility of retail work in the face of something like this pandemic, and how high rents are for businesses. But the Powell’s family owns the land the Burnside City of Books store sits on. They collect rent from the company and surrounding businesses, as well as receive salaries from Powell's. There is more that could be done if they wanted to save their workers. 

Many of us will lose our homes and our healthcare. We will receive no severance aside from any leave we had already saved up. [If we get sick, we won’t receive unemployment benefits](https://www.oregon.gov/employ/Pages/COVID-19.aspx) because we can’t “actively look for work”. And if Powell’s does open their doors again, I hope you will remember how they treated us. 

I’m sorry this is so long. There are a lot of emotions right now and I just wanted to share with the Portland and greater literary community some of what’s been playing out behind the scenes. Thank you for supporting us. 

If you still want to order books, [use this link](https://www.powells.com/?partnerID=35751). 7.5% of all sales made through this link go to the Union’s worker relief fund.

I've found some, and take them for what they're worth:

- Symbiosis PDX is running a kickstarter to help with financial issues, I don't want to provide a direct link, but you can google it. Symbiosis PDX is a child of the [Social Justice Action Center](https://sjacpdx.org/symbiosis-pdx/) which is a legitimate nonprofit organization recognized by the Oregon Secretary of State. I have no context to say if that money will be used appropriately, there is a long list of people who have applied to receive the funds. Some applicants to use these funds seem to be under the impression that funding will be used for minorities (in particular qtpoc) only - there's no statements from the group about the process in which funds will be accepted, or statements vetted. 

- There's this [facebook page called ""PDX Covid19 Mutual Aid""](https://www.facebook.com/pdxcovid19mutualaid), but on their [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAMZHbn6md19Tb28SM53ayFAQK02xJv1NXVjL-J26tDZOQ-g/viewform) in which they ask people to sign up there's a political diatribe at the very bottom worth reading before you get too excited about this ""charitable"" endeavor. 

Does anyone else have lists or links to organizations offering mutual aid, or should one be created? I feel like reddit could just as easily be a platform that's better than facebook. It's probably worth having a conversation about if this type of content should be in /r/portland or some type of new subreddit.

As an example, Red Cross put out a call for blood donations, not that Covid requires blood donations, but donations are simply down and they need a constant supply. Is there other nonprofits and groups in Portland that need simple things that we can promote and respond to?",Portland,Mutual Aid list?

6428,6428,chrispdx,1584484567,fkelcn,Nan,"Yesterday we learned that, for the foreseeable future, bars and restaurants in Oregon are shut down for dine-in/drink-in customers. Today, we learned that the area's casinos Illani, Spirit Mountain, Chinook Winds, are also shutting down. The area's few poker rooms are also shutting down or in the process.

Except for the lottery options at your local convenience store (Keno, Megabucks, Powerball, etc.), the options for gamblers in this state have disappeared.

For those who have gambling issues or it is a large part of their social or recreational lives, this is going to be a shock. Perhaps it will give some people who have been in a perpetual spiral time to heal. Perhaps some will not be able to cope with the lack of playing options and do rash things. As someone who, in the past, has battled with my own gambling demons, I understand the power lure of the endorphins that are generated while gambling. Some compare it to the highs of drugs or alcohol.

Perhaps this period of ""drying out"" for the problem gamblers will be a good thing. In fact, I know it will. If you know someone like this, be kind to them.

Given this, Portland Community College has decided to move to remote operations, closing all campuses and centers as of 4 p.m. on Friday, March 20. No access will be granted to any of our facilities including but not limited to labs, shops, studios, bookstores and/or libraries.

Our plan at this time is to re-open on Monday, May 4. Essential personnel will be allowed on college property only as necessary between March 20 and May 4.

**Immediate impact related to Instruction:**

* The Spring Term will commence as scheduled, on Monday, March 30.
* All classes currently scheduled to be taught online and/or remotely will proceed.
* Classes that can run online or remotely for the Spring Term must be able to deliver instruction in this manner for the entirety of the Spring Term. Assuming the college reopens on May 4, as anticipated, these classes will return to being offered as on-campus, face-to-face instruction. However, all sections for Spring Term must be prepared to complete the term online or remotely should this be necessary.
* Academic Deans are partnering with Student Affairs leadership, working with Faculty Department Chairs to determine the best course of action for programs and classes that cannot be taught remotely or online for the entire term.
* All sections being taught Spring Term are required to have a syllabus and an introductory communication posted in Brightspace (D2L) by the first day of the term. This provides a common space for students to access course information and a list of required resources.

**Immediate impact related to Student Affairs:**

* Student Affairs leadership has been preparing for and beginning to move services and support to be offered remotely in most areas.
* Based on this new decision, they will accelerate the process this week, and prepare their teams for delivering services and establishing telecommuting agreements.

**Immediate impact related to Human Resources:**

* While college facilities are closed, all management, confidential and academic professional employees, and faculty assigned to teach Spring Term are expected to continue to work from home. Some Classified employees may also be expected to work from home during this time.
* Classified employees who are unable to work from home will be eligible for closure pay.  Under the Classified Agreement, closure pay is limited to 40 hours; however, President Mitsui has approved an exception to allow Classified employees to receive extended closure pay.
* During the facilities closure, employees will still be expected to use their accrued leave if they become sick, are taking vacation or personal leave, or are unable to work a full schedule due to childcare or other personal reasons.
* Part-time librarians, counselors and tutors are hourly and are not eligible for college closure pay, but may be assigned work from home, with their supervisor’s authorization.
* Casual and student employees and non-bargaining unit instructors are also hourly and are not eligible for college closure pay.

More information and details from Instruction, Student Affairs, and Human Resources will be shared throughout the remainder of the week as it relates to PCC’s move to remote operations. News from Information Technology and Finance &amp; Administration related to the college’s ongoing operations during the Spring Term will be disseminated over the next few days, as well. Please watch for these updates by email, which also will be posted on the [COVID-19 Website](https://www.pcc.edu/coronavirus/).

And please be on the lookout tomorrow for President Mitsui’s video announcement about the college’s decision to move to remote operations.

More importantly, stay the hell away from people that don't have the ability to stay away from you.

My place of work has been deemed a critical piece of infrastructure in aiding emergency services, and as such, we cannot and will not close, regardless of retail restrictions that might be imposed in the near future. I'm absolutely fucking blessed to have that kind of job security in a time like this, but we encountered someone at work today that flagrantly disregarded our posted signage and emails stating to not come into our branch if you had any symptoms of COVID-19, influenza, or any other form of respiratory illness.

On a daily basis, my team works one-on-one with anywhere from four to ten first responders, which include firefighters, police, medical and security personnel. Those first responders interact with anywhere from five to thirty co-workers a day, and those five to thirty people collectively work with literally hundreds of us on a daily basis.

What streets should I avoid other than 82nd and Johnson Creek path?

Is Google maps a reliable source for safe bike routes?

I’ve witnessed some cyclists ride on sidewalks to take short cuts. Is this discouraged like it is in Seattle? (I’ve been ticketed for similar behavior, so I’m cautious)

I’ve know several people that have eaten shit on the trolley tracks and on Portland streets in the rain. Should I avoid it altogether? 

Any other tips and recommendations are highly appreciated. Thanks!",Portland,Portland Bike Noob

Here is an article explaining the numbers behind why, from someone who has decades of experience in healthcare systems and advanced training in computer science and healthcare data science.

[https://tim.blog/2020/03/17/predicting-hospital-capacity-why-to-act-early-how-to-think-about-lag-time-and-a-model-you-can-use/](https://tim.blog/2020/03/17/predicting-hospital-capacity-why-to-act-early-how-to-think-about-lag-time-and-a-model-you-can-use/) 

I have extracted the most important sections of it, and added plenty of line breaks, for your quick consumption:

————

**How early should governments start introducing mandatory quarantines? The answer is much, much earlier than you might think.**

**A city that institutes a city-wide quarantine when its hospitals are anywhere from 4% to 20% full can still easily exceed its total hospital capacity.**

Say you have a city (let’s call it Springfield) where new COVID infections per day are growing.

The numbers are doubling every 5 days.

10–20% of infected people will need to be hospitalized.

From the day a person gets infected, it takes an average of 10 days for them to seek hospital care.

So if we had 1000 new cases of coronavirus on Day 1, using the high end of the estimate, we can expect 200 cases to arrive at the hospital on Day 11.

Let’s also say that the average hospital stay is 12 days. So coronavirus cases start to accumulate in the hospital.

Now, let’s say there are 5000 total hospital beds in all of Springfield.

The mayor is watching dutifully, but his team, overwhelmed with other duties, aren’t carefully considering exponential growth in combination with lag time.

He sees that about 80% (4000) of his beds are occupied on Day 20, and realizes the city needs to do a full quarantine.

He orders it promptly on Day 20, so that he can avoid his hospitals overflowing.

**New infections reliably start to fall on Day 21** and continue to fall forevermore.

What happens to new daily hospital cases? Remember there’s a **10-day lag**. So on Day 21 you’ll get 20% of the new infections that started on Day 11.

**Hospital cases continue to increase after Day 20 even though we instituted a quarantine!**

On Day 20 we were only getting Day 10’s victims into the hospital. 

The people *infected* on Day 20 *won’t show up at the hospital until Day 30.*

Will we overflow our hospitals?

How many total beds will we need?

Remember: the patients will accumulate since it takes 12 days to be discharged.

**Total hospital beds needed doesn’t peak until Day 35, even though we quarantined on Day 20.**

It peaks at around 22,000—more than 4 times as many beds as there are in Springfield.

Given the numerical assumptions above, **if you quarantine when your hospitals are 80% full, you can expect to exceed your total number of hospital beds by more than 300%.** You can see this playing out in Italy right now. They’ve quarantined, but the hospital cases will still rise for many days after the quarantine is instituted.

If you quarantine at **50%** full on Day 17, you’ll still have a peak hospital need of **16,812** beds. (Remember: there are only 5000 total hospital beds in all of Springfield)

If you quarantine at **25%** full on Day 14, you’ll still have a peak hospital need of **11,092** beds.

If you quarantine at **4%** full on Day 10, you’ll still have a peak hospital need of **6,370** beds.

In this example, if you want to avoid hospital overflow, you have to start quarantining when your hospitals are 3% full. Of course, this extreme example starts at 1,000 cases on Day 1 with only 5000 total beds. The effects of exponential growth are less extreme if you start with a smaller number of initial cases.

Nevertheless, it’s valuable to have this example drive the point home that **in order to prevent hospital overflow, you have to quarantine surprisingly early.**

If you’d like a rough estimate of when would be the appropriate time to quarantine for your particular geographic region, you can modify all the numerical assumptions and run different scenarios by copying the template here:

China had to do a mandatory quarantine to get on top of it. So did Italy. USA is next, and we all know Oregon is woefully underprepared even moreso than the other states that are already being ravaged by this.

“Generally, self-employment is not subject to unemployment insurance tax, it will vary depending on the type of self-employment. However, if you have performed other work in the last 18 months, you may be eligible to receive benefits. We are unable to provide an answer to your specific case because a determination of eligibility requires a broad range of information. The only way to know if you meet the monetary eligibility requirement is to file an initial claim.
 
You can file an initial claim by accessing www.oregon.gov/employ, and clicking on “Use the Online Claim System”; or by calling our Contact Center at (877) 345-3484, Monday – Friday 8:00am- 5:00pm.
 
We are not aware of any other resources available at the moment for individuals that do not qualify for unemployment insurance benefits. However, you may want to file a claim in case the situation changes in the future.

Our servers, dishwashers, hosts and half our cooks are already filing for unemployment. I'm one of the few cooks still getting hours, and I probably will be too by the end of the week. This is the short term problem. The majority of us should be able to survive off unemployment during this time. The problem is will our employers still be around to go to work for when this is all over.

The billion dollar corporations will be just fine after this. The independently owned places and smaller chains will not. I know it's easier to just pull up to a window instead of waiting for delivery, or getting out of your car to pick up your call in or online order. But trust me, we are probably doing a much better job of sanitizing every thing and making sure your food is packed safely for you than the corporate fast food chains. You're probably safer picking it up from us face to face than through a window.

Again, a lot of smaller restaurants are going to go out of bussiness if you don't support us during this time. Unemployment is going to skyrocket when that happens. Please consider going to the smaller coffee shops and restaurants during this time instead of the billion dollar global corporations.

Apparently even partners are barred from the delivery room with nurses as stand-in’s in the Bay Area and in Portland things are going in that direction. 

It made me realize I haven’t read any news articles about this particular stress on people. Why isn’t this being reported and how do we get this out there in the media?

- 4 postpartum ward nurses at Kaiser were tested positive this week after working with babies &amp; families over the weekend.

- OHSU’s childcare center for staff finally shut down this week but only after forcing their staff (some pregnant) to continue working or losing their job all together. One of the pregnant staff was incredibly ill this week and couldn’t breathe so they had to call 911. No testing was available to her. 

- Obstetricians all around are just flat out not coming in to work, leaving families with few options for care in the hospital setting. C-sections will certainly be on the rise to rush the birthing process and free up space for more beds. 

- There are resources to families who aren’t in a high risk pregnancy and can birth at home instead. Portland has wonderful home birth midwives with new protocols in place just for this pandemic.

The official reason given is that they view the ability for medical marijuana patients to get their cannabis to be on par with the necessity of visiting a pharmacy.

As a former MMJ cardholder myself, you know who dies without weed?  Fucking nobody.  And besides, the overwhelming majority of our customers are non-card-carrying med-“ish” and recreational users.

But of course the fear of a stricter future quarantine combined with the lack of much else to do at the moment has drawn people to my shop and we are doing 4/20-level sales daily.  Old mix with young, med patients with rec people.  I serve people who can afford top-tier medical treatment and people who are living outside.

To XXX,

I write with urgency to discuss the housing crisis in Oregon with the onslaught of COVID-19 upon us. As it currently stands, I cannot find one single record of a property management company, mortgage lender, or bank guaranteeing financial relief to the many residents who will be affected by this pandemic. A blanket statement assuring us they care and asking us to call in isn’t going to cut it. Thousands are losing their jobs, have no paid sick leave and were already living paycheck-to-paycheck. We will not have the money; not now, not later, not retroactively. 

Jobless claims in our state surged by 3,200% in one day. Oregon’s unemployment is expected to rise to higher levels than that of the Great Depression. Yet many of these companies will still demand our bills be paid and worse yet, they will charge absurd interest and late fees on top of it. Their financial interests should not be above the common good of the people and they sure as hell shouldn’t be able to profit from this suffering.

As a public servant it is your duty to serve your constituents. That is why I, a member of your community, plead with you to freeze all rent and mortgage payments until the COVID-19 crisis passes.An eviction moratorium isn’t an adequate long-term solution. This is a National Emergency and now is the time to act. Oregonians do not have the luxury to hear you preach about the difficult legalities associated between city and state laws. COME TOGETHER, FIGURE IT OUT, AND DO WHAT YOU WERE ELECTED TO DO.

This is about keeping people sheltered. This is about preventing people from feeling forced to go out and make money. This is about eradicating the virus. We are tired of coming in second to corporate profits that treat our hardships as an opportunity to more thickly line their padded pockets. Make no mistake; they will look to profit from this unless those in government, YOU, put a stop to it. Please wield this power thoughtfully and wisely. Property management companies, banks, and mortgage lenders will persevere just fine. Without your help we, however, will not.

A rough estimate of those affected by coronavirus. I just started by identifying any food related occupations.

|Occupation|Count|
|:-|:-|
|Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations |109,900|
|Combined Food Preparation and Serving Workers, Including Fast Food	|22,820|
|Food Preparation Workers	|9,000|
|Dishwashers|4,510|
|Cooks, Restaurant|14,240|
|Bartenders|6,020|
|Dining Room and Cafeteria Attendants and Bartender Helpers|3,140|
|Cooks, Fast Food|3,130|
|Hosts and Hostesses, Restaurant, Lounge, and Coffee Shop|2,990|
|Chefs and Head Cooks|1,270|

Looking through all these professions I see about a mean yearly salary of $30k per person.

Let's assume all these   
Given the living wage in Portland Oregon is about $15 ([https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/41051](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/41051)) lets assume all these people live paycheck to paycheck.

Let's assume coronavirus affects these folks maximally for 3 months.

173,000 people \* 3 months \* (30,000/12) = $1,297,500,000 dollars 

So roughly 1.3 billion dollars in affected wages worst case.

This data doesn't take into account undocumented workers which make up 12.5% of oregons labor force. I didn't increase numbers because I couldn't find what percentage it is in the food industries.

Let's get to the good part, there are 1,190,180 occupations in total. Let's assume that half those people are unaffected by coronavirus professionally at all. So 500k people.

500k with a mean salary of $56k a year. 

If we just straight up paid people who were affected during 3 months money out of our own pockets. It would come roughly to

$1,297,500,000 / 500,000= $2600

That sounds like a lot you say! Consider that most people already pay state taxes alone of $**4700 for 56k income (** [https://www.oregon.gov/dor/programs/individuals/Pages/calculator.aspx](https://www.oregon.gov/dor/programs/individuals/Pages/calculator.aspx) )

Unfortunate though, I'm writing this with a request in mind. I attend a methadone clinic on the outskirts of Portland. Unfortunately, said clinic is not taking the outbreak seriously at all, and is still compelling people to come in daily/weekly/etc. to dose (according to SAMHSA guidelines, during states of emergency, clinics can increase takehome doses to 14 or 28 day supplies without the normal requirements being met). As far as I am aware, tele-counseling has not been considered. They're still performing call backs where patients come in to have their medications counted and to take a UA. It doesn't really effect me in that way as I have takehome privileges already, but it exposes us, and those we come in contact with (as well as the staff), to needless risk. If you work in a clinic, please try and convince those with the power to make decisions on a meaningful level to consider implementing measures to protect patients and staff from the virus as well as limit exposure whenever reasonably possible. 

The clinic I attend has gone as far as *removing* (you're reading this correctly) the hand sanitizing stations throughout the facility. Even the staff seemed to be disregarding the seriousness of the issue. I know I'm not in the highest risk group, but literally every single member of my family, as well as the people I work with/for, are. When I tried to bring my concerns up I was dismissed as though I was trying to incite panic or get one over on the clinic somehow. I've tried to raise my concerns to the health authority, but have been unable to reach anyone in the alcohol and drug abuse (I think that's the name of division, but I'm not certain) wing of the HA. So that leaves me with reddit, I guess. I'm not sure where else to turn. I can't just not go as the withdrawal is excruciatingly intense and long term (there are plenty of personal accounts on r/methadone by people who went ""cold turkey"" who experienced very severe symptoms for months. I personally know one person who died in the prime of their life due to withdrawal induced dehydration), not to mention it would just be a terrible thing for my recovery in general. 

I don't mean to sound alarmist, I was just kind of shocked by how flippant the behavior I saw this morning was. I'm not really sure where else to turn. If it is allowed I'll post a link to a petition to increase takehome privileges in the state of Oregon, but I don't think it would do much.

The problem is hospital capacity to treat severe cases. Most people will get Covid19 over the next few months/year. That's not why we shut down everything.

The goal is to make sure we don't spread the disease to vulnerable populations because we are at risk of overwhelming our hospital resources.

We need to stop the hysteria and anxiety because it will only cause \*more\* people to unnecessarily go to the hospital, the exact thing we are trying to avoid.

Take it down a few (or several) notches with the reactions, proclamations, and sanctimonious flak. Stop making this worse than it is.

It is understandable that Kaiser is doing these things, but when people and businesses are paying significant amounts of money every month (we pay roughly $500/employee each month) to be able to access medical care (including for things that aren't deemed ""medically necessary""), it seems that these cutbacks should come with reduced/refunded premiums for those who are paying for coverage. Gyms that have closed have had to refund their members and it should be no different in this instance.

I’ve had asthma since I was 9 years old, and am considered a high-risk group, and I had the dry cough, fever, and breathing issues that supposedly accompany the disease. Every Oregon-specific resource i found warned me against going to the ER or urgent care. Out of fear of spreading the illness, we spent over an hour calling multiple numbers to try and isolate what we should do instead. No one had any idea what we should do. The 24/7 nurse hotlines had us on hold endlessly. When we found no answers, we went to the ER, where the doctor agreed I should be tested (and I was). 

Five days later, I have no idea where my test results are, or how I should get them. The paperwork they gave me at the ER told me that the CDC would call me with my results. Thus far I haven’t been called. So I started trying to get county health on the line, since I was advised to call them. There I was invited to leave messages, and I did — over and over again. And no, no one called me back. I’ve also tried calling the ER where I was seen. They said they have no relationship with those lab results, and I have to call county. I *finally* got county on the phone today. Guess what they told me? The doctor should have my lab results, and they have no idea where they are. Who should I call if the response of the ER was to call them? They have no idea. 

This is fucking ridiculous. I’ve lost hours of my life trying to isolate basic test results. There is no online option for checking, no means of tracking, no specific phone number to call, no customer service or point of contact of any kind. Meanwhile, I’ve willingly isolated myself for what feels like forever, but my partner still has to go to work. Why? Because they will not let him leave work unless he or I tests positive for COVID-19. I’m so enraged.

I am not an important person, I claim expertise in nothing, and my sole motivation for writing all this crap that few people will actually read is a simple desire to express myself. I have never worked at Powell's or personally known anyone who does. I have never joined a union, I have never owned a business. The number of years I've lived here makes my imaginary-but-real ""PDX creds level"" something other than ""tourist,"" but certainly not ""native."" Demographic traits like gender, race, and social class shouldn't be factors in determining the value of any idea, and I make no apologies for that belief.

*****


Emily Powell's letter and the public reaction to it has rubbed me the wrong way, and I haven't been able to shake off the feeling.

In particular, I'm troubled by this excerpt, explaining the rationale for mass lay-offs:

&gt; We are simply not that kind of business – we run on duct tape and twine on a daily basis, every day trading funds from one pocket to patch the hole in another. We have worked hard over the years to pay the best possible wages, health care and benefits, to make contributions to our community, to support other non-profits. Unfortunately, none of those choices leave extra money on hand when the doors close. And when the doors close, every possible cost must stop as well.

Taken at face value, this is easy to agree with. ""I am a small business owner,"" some say. ""I get it. I would hate to have to make that decision."" Others are nostalgic and worried about what this means for the future, especially for the Burnside location. This threat to another facet of Portland's cultural identity comes not long after the food trucks were displaced. 

*Poor Emily, Poor Powell's, Poor Portland.*

This is a reasonable response.

On the other hand of the spectrum, people are furious that, in the midst of a health crisis, hundreds of Portlanders have found themselves unemployed and with the timer on their health benefits ticking down to zero. This, too, is an understandable response. 

And though it was addressed to the employees, it can be argued that the letter was truly a PR move crafted to elicit the former reaction and get ahead of the latter. Some might call that cynical, and some might call it obvious. Whatever it is, I couldn't let it go and I had to drill down into that paragraph.

###""...we run on duct tape and twine...""

Powell's Books is a private, family-run company. We can't go picking through their spreadsheets, but there's ample evidence their annual revenues are somewhere in the tens of millions. There's no way to meaningfully estimate their operating costs, but we can assume their margins are thin. That said, how does a company run well for fifty years and not accumulate a cash reserve and significant body of investments? How does a company not do so before, or concurrently with, expanding to new locations?

Cash flow was presumably healthier in the early days, and that would handily account for any stores with pre-Internet grand openings. Even in a rough marketplace, the idea that they're squeaking by without a nickle left over at the end of the month is curious.

If Powell's cash flow is so poor that the company ""runs on duct tape,"" what sense does it make to react to the advent of tablets and dwindling book sales by shuffling physical locations when big chains like Borders and B&amp;N were downsizing? Why, in late 2006 when Amazon was already a powerhouse and quickly picking up steam, did Powell's [relocate one of their retail stores](https://pamplinmedia.com/bvt/15-news/105312-powells-celebrates-new-beaverton-store) instead of observing that the market was disrupted and they would have to adapt? It's not 20/20 hindsight or an isolated incident, either. They made similar brick-and-mortar moves [in 2010](https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2010/03/powells_moving_tech_books_near.html) and [in 2016](https://www.oregonlive.com/window-shop/2016/01/powells_hawthorne_expansion.html).

If we accept that Powell's margins have been razor-thin since these decisions were made, then it must be that these operations were carried out with leverage. What have they accomplished by doubling down on the satellite shops, besides damaging their brand as a quirky, independent book store?

###""...to pay the best possible wages, health care and benefits...""

There's no two ways about it. This is straight bullshit.

How many mom and pop stores have driven their ""family"" to [unionize](https://web.archive.org/web/20110116051423/http://www.ilwulocal5.com/about/we-are-the-ilwu/we-are-ilwu-local-5/ilwu-local-5-powells-books/history)?

Powell's labor relations are not merely an embarrassing footnote in the company's history. The current CEO has continued the legacy of involuntarily layoffs and other assorted big box retailer behavior. Despite the letter describing them as ""colleagues who feel like family,"" there is only evidence that Powell's considers staff as expendable as any other commodity. Recent events are merely an extreme instance of what they've been doing quite comfortably since the '80s.


###""...to make contributions to our community, to support other non-profits...""

I don't know Emily Powell. At all. 

I don't just mean privately. I'd never heard of her until I'd read a news article containing her letter, and the few hours I've spent researching the company has not yielded a cohesive public persona.

A [piece from her alma mater](https://www.haverford.edu/college-communications/news/independent-spirit-emily-powell-00) tells cutesy stories about when she was a little girl helping out in the store and describes her as looking more like a co-ed on her way to class than a CEO. Oh, but Belle's not just a bookish little thing that's nice to look at. She's smart enough to keep the modest family business running just the way it always has been.

But sometimes her bio projects the image of an [accomplished entrepreneur and community pillar](https://www.acg.org/portland/events/acg-portland-september-2018-evening-emily-powell) whose legendary and iconic business thrives because of her vigorous online presense despite ruthless competition. When she's not drinking the blood of her enemies, she's chairing various non-profit initiatives and spends her weekends admiring her impressive real estate portfolio.

Well, which is it? Small business owner just scraping by like everyone else with a little of the ol' ""bless this mess"" attitude? Or business ninja who does battle with superior forces and is merely biding time until Amazon reveals its fatal flaw? 

This isn't as simple as taking off some paint-covered overalls and undoing a ponytail before slipping into a cocktail dress and some Jimmy Choos. One can be Jesus on the cross wailing in the wind about having been forsaken, or one can be post-cross Jesus with the wrathfulness and the vengeance and the blood rain and the *hey, hey, hey, it hurts!* But not back and forth at will, and certainly not both at the same time.

Ironically, when it came time to address a substantial change in the way Oregon corporations are taxed, the ""mogul"" Emily Powell was nowhere to be found.

A nonpartisan review of [Measure 97](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Oregon_Ballot_Measure_97) opined that it was not drafted very well and could potentially cost working-class Oregonians more than intended. Of course, most of that burden would be the result of the natural corporate reflex of distributing the pain over the masses rather than eat a relatively small loss. It's the rational choice for an entity whose reason to exist is profit. Yet the Toys-R-Us kid in all of us is incapable of retaining that essential truth and wants to believe corporations have a conscience and a soul. *How can McDonald's be so bad? Ronald seems so nice.*

So, ""folksy and relatable"" Emily Powell appealed to that kid. It doesn't matter if you shopped at Powell's once on a family road trip, or if you grew up here and the City of Books was one of your haunts, or even if you've never been and you're sick and tired of watching behemoths devour local businesses. In any case, you can't help but be touched when the owner of Powell's says their quirky li'l speciality store might become a thing of the past. The litany of reasons she had for being opposed to it included valid concerns like the wording of how the proceeds would be spent, but her priority was the effect it would have on the little people just trying to make a buck with their small businesses, implicitly including herself. It must have been hard to maintain that ""aw, shucks, we're just a local business"" image when the only other family-named store fighting a ""big business"" tax proposal in Oregon was Walmart.

In an [interview](https://pamplinmedia.com/but/239-news/315919-194206-measure-97-could-mean-the-end-for-powells-books), Emily Powell justified her opposition thusly:

&gt;""We’re relatively low above the $25 million mark. If you’re over 25 you are all the same.""

The language of the Legislative Revenue Office's [official report](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/lro/Documents/RR%203-16%20Measure%2097.pdf) on Measure 97 is surprisingly clear, and its description doesn't use quite the same palette as Powell's (emphasis is mine):

&gt;Measure 97 retains the current minimum tax structure for S-Corporations, partnerships and C-Corporations with sales less than $25 million. For C-Corporations with sales greater than $25 million, a new tax rate of 2.5% is imposed on sales above the $25 million threshold.  For example, a C-Corporation with Oregon sales of $50 million would pay a corporate minimum tax of **$30,001 for the first $25 million in sales (the current tax)** plus 2.5% on the second $25 million ($625,000) for a total minimum tax of $655,001.

There are only two obvious explanations for this discrepancy:     
(1) a book store owner with an Ivy League MBA *skimmed* a corporate tax proposal before a media interview     
(2) the answer was a deliberate attempt to misinform voters     

Keep in mind the report was released several months before the interview. Compare the highlighted amount that a company ""relatively low above the $25 million mark"" would have to pay annually against what Powell claims immediately before that (emphasis mine):

&gt;We’re challenged every year already to figure out how we’re going to be viable for the next year, and **this is about a fifty times increase on our current tax bill.**

Using the mistaken (revenue * 0.025) formula, the tax bill becomes $1.5M when gross revenue is at least $60 million. Therefore, if we accept that she simply misunderstood how the new rate would work, we are then left to gauge whether she was as sloppy with a calculator as she was with reading a document of critical importance, or if she deliberately undersold Powell's revenue by more than a factor of two. 

Meanwhile, Michael Powell personally contributed a $25,000 cash donation to the campaign opposing Measure 97 despite having no active role in the company. There's little use in speculating why he made the donation in the first place and why he chose such an awkward amount. It may have been a symbolic gesture, seeing as it was positively dwarved by [contributions from Target, Costco, Kroger, et al.](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/gotoPublicTransactionSearchResults.do?cneSearchButtonName=srtOrder&amp;cneSearchButtonName=search&amp;cneSearchFilerCommitteeId=18058&amp;?srtOrder=asc&amp;by=AMOUNT) (i.e. massive corporations who stood to shoulder nearly 80% of the burden, as designed). Either way, donating a five-figure sum to a campaign of any kind is not the act of a man who is worried sleepless about money as Belle-Emily characterized her father. The optimistic view is that the Powells are genuinely driven by the desire to provide value to the community through the book store and do not trust the government to use the extra funds to improve public early childhood and kindergarten through grade 12 education, health care, and senior services as intended.

Other than a 2006-2007 offer to donate 10 books to school-age children for every cash donation made by customers, search results for charitable contributions and community involvement made by the Powell's Books entity are slim pickings. Emily and her husband have evidently made a variety of personal contributions to various charities. Emily is listed as a director of what is sometimes called the ""Powell Foundation Inc."" but is properly identified as the ""G R Powell Foundation"" (EIN: 930986542). In 2017, it claimed capital gains from divesting some shares, which is a literal answer to my rhetorical question about the likelihood Powell's Books has something in its threadbare, patched pockets besides operating income. It would make no sense for the non-profit Powell Foundation to have a portfolio while the for-profit Powell's Books is on a hand-to-mouth basis.

It's not possible to get a full and accurate picture of their contributions. The point is, no one can verify whether Emily Powell is financially and personally committed to values she publicly espouses. Does she give so much back to the community that she could conscionably undermine an influx of tax dollars projected to be in the hundreds of millions?

###""...when the doors close, every possible cost must stop as well...""

That seems universally true for virtually every brick-and-mortar business. It's a funny thing to hear from a Powell, at least about the City of Books, because the ""gotta pay the rent"" excuse doesn't work so well when you own the goddamn building.

This revelation makes all the missteps involving buildings owned by other companies exponentially more confusing. Powell's pissed away untold millions following an obviously dying paradigm and unironically fancies itself ""innovative."" They could have consolidated their position by judiciously closing some of the satellites (or just leaving them damn well alone) and making expansions more in accord with the changing times, like refining their web presense.

Powell's got their start online before Amazon, a fact by which they are apparently not embarrassed. Their current tech looks like an actual small business owner tapped his CS undergrad grandson to make it. Before all this research (*especially* before knowing they've had a website since 1995), I chastised myself for being excessively critical of their in-store inventory database and its website, but it seems [I'm not alone](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/11/given-powells-books.html).

###""... I can only hope we might find a way to come back together on the other side of these terrible times...""

None of my arguments or observations are meant to suggest that Powell was readily capable of keeping her staff paid and covered, nor do I believe she was in any way obligated to find a way to make that happen. Conversely, it's not Portland's responsibility to serve as stewards of the Powell's dynasty.

Should the unthinkable happen and the stores remain shuttered after the pandemic has passed, we need not shed any tears for poor Emily. The little bit of publicly available financial information is plenty. To put it mildly, the Powell family isn't doing too badly. You will not spot any of them buying generic breakfast cereal at Albertson's. All signs point to Emily struggling to keep her bookstores open not because she needs to, and not for the sake of those who work under her, but *just because*. 

The only remaining conceivable reason to support Powell's is its status as a Portland fixture. (Interestingly enough, the Powell's franchise didn't even start in Oregon. The first bookstore was a location in Chicago.) Powell's wants you to show support by treating them like Amazon, except the website isn't as well-developed, prices are significantly higher, and shipping is slower. Under no other circumstances does this sound like an attractive offer, but you're expected to read that letter and conclude that any small business owner would arrive at the same dismal state if they had all of Powell's advantages, not the least of which is freedom of concern for rent at their flagship location. They squandered the only asset distinguishing them from competitors when they kicked nearly every member of their ""family"" to the curb. Have fun trying to resolve the paradox of Powell's letting everyone go to stay afloat because they want to continue caring about job creation for the little people.

It's not my place to tell anyone what to value. If you don't care about any of the above, and you simply want Powell's to exist for whatever reason, that's your business and your money.

If the intent behind giving up some of your cash is supporting local small businesses, I can only hope you find yourself carefully evaluating what that really means and why it's important.",Portland,A Closer Look at Powell's Books and Emily Powell's Letter

6863,6863,molsjpg,1584716013,flwatu,Nan,"I live in Portland now but I’m originally from a very small farming town outside of Salem near Silverfalls. A few days ago I went on a hike near my parent’s house that is mostly just known to locals, so when I got there and saw 10 cars along the road, I was surprised. This hike involves walking down a gravel road, lined with cow pasture on either side. The cows roam throughout that area and cross the road, that being said you can easily go on the pasture and walk up to a cow. 

Butttt there are signs EVERYWHERE saying do not trespass, private property, danger, etc. You are only allowed on the road. So tell me why as I was starting my hike, I see a dad allowing three of his very young daughters, walk on the pasture and an uphill to a cow and her baby, from three different angles???? Were they trying to catch the cow?? All I heard the dad say is: “don’t step in cow pies!”. I could tell he was not local based on his clothing choice for this hike. 

I passed him and his son, biting my tongue, until I heard one of the daughters start yelling at the cow “MMMMOOOOOOOOOO” and the dad isn’t doing anything. He just keeps walking. Do they realize cows can charge when they are disturbed? Especially with their baby next to them??? I turn around and ask the dad “Are those your kids?” and confidently he said “Yup! What about it?”. Here’s how our conversation went: 

Me: You know locals don’t really appreciate people trespassing their property, there’s signs everywhere. 

Him: They’re just going to pet the cow. 

Me: They’re gonna piss it off. The farmers around here will literally *makes finger guns* grab their shit and scare you off. 

Him: Oh yeah? So? Why can’t they just go up to the cow for two seconds? 

Me: Cause cows can kill people. Especially children that small, I would call them if I were you. 

Him: *rolls eyes, starts calling for his daughters* Well sorryyyyyy (in an annoying voice), this is the first time we’ve left the Portland area to go hiking. 

Me: Okay, there’s still signs everywhere so I recommend reading those *gives thumbs up and goes about my way* 

Now, I know this interaction wasn’t that bad. My point for this posting being: do not trespass onto farming land no matter what. You will not believe the amount of people I have met over the years who need to be reminded of this. And when someone tells you this, don’t give them attitude. My dad is a farmer, he feeds many people with his hard work that he does alone. The person that owes these cows is also a farmer, mostly likely working on their own too. People steal tools and animals from farmers all the time, one small movement from the field will cause one to get in their truck, grab their rifle, and go check it out. You do not want to be on the other end of that rifle. 

So, if you are traveling outside the area and into new places, please keep in mind to stay respectful and educate yourself on the hike/its area. I know some kids have never seen farm animals, but there’s places you can take them to see and feel them in a safe and appropriate environment. This dad did not realize the danger in was putting his children in and did not care not realize that 1) the cow could hurt them, 2) the owner thinks you’re trying something funny, and 3) you’re making yourself the prime example of what it means to be a “city-slicker”.

&amp;#x200B;

To whom it may concern,

It has come to my attention from someone close to me who works for Club Demonstration Services, the company that employs the Costco sample people, that they are being made to do work outside of their job scope and putting them at higher risk of Coronavirus exposure. The samplers are not employees of Costco and do not get the same benefits or pay scale as Costco employees. They are also mostly part time workers who tend to be older. This person is both over 50 and has underlying health conditions, but depends on their wage to survive. I have previously worked at the same Costco as this worker so I know the ins and outs of that location.

Due to the pandemic they have stopped serving samples in the store. The sample workers are being made to instead clean the store and do “go backs,” which is returning items that people decided not to purchase back to where they are stocked. Both of these jobs are things that Costco employees do, it was common for me to do this when I worked there. I find it very upsetting that these vulnerable workers are being made to do this extra work without extra compensation or safety measures. This person has told me that it is constantly packed in Costco. They have to weave in and out of the crowds of panicked and rude costumers to return items and constantly wipe off the doors of the freezers. I am worried for the safety of the workers, especially with the large amount of untested asymptomatic people that are in our community right now. There are thousands of people going through Costco at the moment and the company is definitely bringing in a ton of money. 

I understand that there are many urgent stories on your plate right now. I think this is important and a matter of public safety for this person and their coworkers. I know that there might not be a full news story on this, but even contacting Costco and Club Demonstration Services as members of the media would hopefully help hold them accountable.

I do not know whether this person would like to be identified so neither would I for now. Please ask me any further questions if you have any. I think there are many many low wage frontline workers in similar situations in the city.",Portland,The mostly elderly and low wage sample workers at Costco are being ENDANGERED by their management.

Hi all. I woke up and saw the above article. 

I want to shelter in place. 

This pandamic is serious and I dont want too see our community suffer and die because of this. I CANNOT stop going to work, where hundreds of people are every day without this order. I don't want to go and expose myself and then come home to expose my family and all my neighbors in our apartment complex. 

It seems that Ted wheeler is on board for this, but Kate Brown isnt. Is he able to enact a shelter in place order without her approval?

I wholeheartedly agree that this is what our community needs. If you agree I would love for us to get a petition going so the governor can see how important this is to us. I've never started a petition and would need some assistance in the department.

6916,6916,twopandinner,1584732445,fm1234,Nan,"Veterans are a tricky bunch - we all probably know one or some. They don't always raise their hand an ask for help. These days with COVID-19, though, there are two groups that might need some help - and it might be difficult to think of ways to offer them anything. 

* Veterans who were already isolated or homebound, and partially or more reliant on assistance from others. These can be tough times for them - and many others in similar situations - as friends, family, and other kinds of caregivers are themselves pulling back and / or being isolated, too. From food to medicine to simple human interaction, they may have needs that are now being under-met or not met.
* Veterans who are now, through the need to socially isolate or to be quarantined, finding themselves in similar situations.

This is true for Veterans in Rose City as much as it is anywhere else. I may not have specific ideas or recommendations for how to assist you with your Aunt Mildred in Sioux City (DM me - I can try), but I do have some ideas for here in PDX.

The VA here in Portland \[[link](https://www.portland.va.gov/)\], if you have not seen or heard, is pretty well swamped. Their approach is that they are today in the business of caring for the sick, and that's about it - understandable, as I see it. *No visitors.* Their website lists details for locations in the Portland area, from Salem to Bend to PDX, but there are also big and small VA locations up and down the state.

There are a number of groups operating in the area that may be able to help. You can check in with the nearest Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/VFW+near+97215/@45.5054485,-122.6241018,13z/data=!3m1!4b1)) or American Legion ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/American+Legion+near+97005/@45.4886226,-122.8401424,13z/data=!3m1!4b1)) chapter - two national organizations that have local chapters sprinkled all over the greater PDX area and also all over both Oregon and the country. Don't get caught up on the titles in their names, like Veterans of Foreign Wars, for example - if they're near, call 'em and see if they can help. Veterans helping Veterans goes together like kale and a trashcan - ask any Veteran and they'll tell you it's true.

There are also other great organizations with whom you can check - like the big teddy bears at the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Assoc ([CVMA](https://www.combatvet.us/)). They have local chapters around the state - to include in Portland ([link](https://www.cvmaoregon.org/29-1)). And there are also truly local organizations to check in with - Portland has it's own amazing Fort Kennedy ([link](https://www.fortkennedy.org/)); while they are local to Portland, there's places like Fort Kennedy in cities and towns across this great country.

It starts, though, with checking in. Call that grumpy ol' curmudgeon and see how they are doing. Don't cut 'em any slack - grill 'em for details. And if they need help... do something about it.

I just started as a painter’s apprentice/assistant. My boss and I are the only ones working and are currently painting someone’s house. I’ve told him several times that I like my personal space (esp as a female in a trade job) and that it’s important to me to social distance in this weird reality. Several times a day he comes up on my ladder and also talks extremely close. When I quickly back up, he scoots closer. When he tries showing me a technique, I keep a safe space and he tells me to move closer so that I can see what he’s doing. Even without the virus spreading, this makes me uncomfortable. He is also running several errands to Home Depot/Sherman Williams and lunch spots, obviously not caring about what’s going on. We share tools, so I politely remind him to sanitize his hands, but he does once (while obviously annoyed with me), then doesn’t follow through again for the rest of the day. 

At this point I really want to self quarantine at home (I’m also just thinking about quitting) but unemployment will not cover my bills. Advice?",Portland,My boss is not respecting my space or practicing social distancing.

**With the support of the State of Oregon, we will be open this Saturday, March 21 and until further notice**.  We care about your safety first, and will implement significant  measures to help protect the health of our customers, our vendors, and  our community. These measures include:

&amp;#x200B;

* Increasing the space between vendor booths to encourage social distancing
* Removing all tables and chairs to discourage gathering
* Restricting prepared food vendors to take-out only
* Eliminating all sampling of food
* Setting up hand-washing stations at all entrances and throughout the market
* Cleaning surfaces with bleach frequently
* Requiring pre-bagged produce to eliminate scales and weighing
* Requiring separation of food handling and payments
* Guidance for vendors on extra pre-market precautions (harvest, packing, etc)
* Cancelling all entertainment

Our precautions will be updated as necessary. Like all of you, we are  processing the news as it happens, and will continue to do everything  we can to make our market the safest source of fresh, local food  possible. **We also need your help to make that happen.** In addition to the policy changes listed above, we ask the following of our customers:

&amp;#x200B;

* If you have any symptoms or believe you may have been exposed, or if  you are in a high-risk category (over 60 years old, previous medical  conditions), please stay home.
* If possible, send only one member of your household to shop at the market.
* No refillable personal containers
* Talk to your neighbors and consider sending one shopper for more than one household.
* Come prepared with a list of necessary items to decrease the amount of time spent at the market.
* Use the hand washing stations and sanitation options we provide.
* Only handle produce that you plan to buy.
* After completing your shopping, do not linger in the market space.

To support SNAP (food stamp) participants in our community, the PSU Farmers Market will also offer **Double Up Food Bucks**  to SNAP participants. Double Up provides up to $10 of matching money to  spend on fruits and vegetables. This additional buying power is  critical for low income community members. We are grateful to the State  of Oregon and many local funders for their support of this program.

We want everyone who has sent us their concerns, comments, and  support over the past few days to know that we hear you. We share your  concerns about both public health and continued access to fresh,  nutritious food. With your help, we can preserve both of these vital  priorities and keep our community safe and healthy.

Thoughts/questions with the current information given from the government and my understanding of the process. With the quarantine happening currently is it really smart to mail checks right now? How are some people going to deposit or cash them? Luckily I have Chase so you can do mobile deposits but I am thinking some smaller credit unions may not have this option. If people are unable to use their bank lobbies to deposit will this just be another thing to overload places like Fred Meyer who cash checks and make money orders?

Also, if it gets real real bad, will the USPS be able to still deliver these checks?

I just hope someone in the government thinks about these things before cutting everyone a check. If they are going off of 2018 tax returns it would help if they tried to use the bank direct deposit information on the tax return first before issuing anything.

When they announced that they were putting these out before the pre-order I was talking with my friend about how I wanted to buy one just because I wanted the controllers but I couldn't justify buying a new Switch, he put the idea in my head that if I bought one he'd buy my old one from me. 

Well... pre-orders came out and I forgot. And when I remembered, they were closed. And when they came out I told my friend ""I'll find one around someplace like Freds"" and I haven't. Ultimately not a big deal.

However, with all the COVID-19 stuff going around I kinda wanna just ""give"" my friend my Switch since he was part of the massive layoffs in the last few days. Also because most will be going into shelter-in-place and my work will be deemed ""essential,"" but I also still want to play Animal Crossing myself. So I'm hoping before everything shuts down I can find one so I can give my friend something to do while being on lockdown.

Anyone see one in town? Preferably something in biking distance, willing to bike out to Troutdale or Gresham areas too. 

TLDR: Told my friend I'd sell him my Switch when I get the Animal Crossing one, forgot to pre-order, didn't find one when they came out, want to give it to him now that he's been laid off but also want to play Animal Crossing myself.",Portland,Animal Crossing Switch Longshot

7119,7119,Capefoulweather,1584824062,fmmbf7,Nan,"As one of those restaurant workers who is still fully employed by virtue of already working at a predominately takeout place, I’ve seen some things in the past couple days from some of our customers that are not... best practices for minimizing spread of Covid-19. I know that most people have good intentions and just aren’t adapted yet to the role they have in helping themselves, each other, and the people making their food stay healthy. So here are some random tips I have for what you can do during these weird times:


Please remember that you can be contagious even if you currently have no symptoms of Covid-19. Please wash your hands BEFORE heading out to the restaurant to pick up your order whenever possible (and wash your hands after, of course, too!) 


If you are with a friend, your partner, others, are picking up for the family- when at all possible, please only have one person in your group come into the restaurant itself to pick up your order.


Please call your order in ahead whenever possible. When you are given a wait time, please respect it: we want to minimize the time you have to wait on site or outside for your food, and we want to minimize the number of people coming in at once. Please understand that takeout places are currently being slammed, and we can’t have crowds of people inside at the same time, which is logically challenging, to say the least! If your wait time is long, please understand it’s because we are operating at peak capacity, and that we want to keep all of our customers and ourselves healthy. 


For people with young children, please try to hold them close to you so that we can make sure that they aren’t touching surfaces that may not have been wiped down yet. 


Please stand at least 3 feet from other people. It’s hard to repeatedly tell people to stand further apart, when there is clearly room for it. If we say we will bring your order out to you outside, please stay outside. If you are worried by a perceived delay, please call inside to check in if possible, or wait the full time we told you before coming back to check in. 


Please don’t lean against/across our counters. Please stand back as much as is reasonable from the counter when ordering, paying, and picking up. We need to try to maintain at least 3 feet from you, and counters are often barely close to that. We also need to keep people as far as possible from our food prep areas. 


Please don’t put your personal belongings on our counters. This is where we put people’s food orders. We are wiping constantly but we can’t wipe it down every second! 


Please support restaurants you see taking extra measures to protect staff and customers and let them know you appreciate it. These are tense times for all restaurants as we look ahead to a possible recession and decreased business in the long term. We get a boost from knowing that the extra safety measures aren’t scaring customers away. 


Please remember that we are glad to serve you and bring a moment of pleasure to you in scary times, but we are also taking on an increased risk of exposure ourselves by doing so. Please be patient with us, please be understanding of menu availability issues and long pick up times, please cooperate when we ask you to maintain space and wait outside our store, and please do everything you can to minimize exposing us and other customers. We want to be there for you. Please be there for us and each other!",Portland,Tips for picking up takeout from a frontline food worker

7145,7145,smoothie_monster,1584830194,fmoijj,Nan,"I keep seeing a lack of social distancing in local grocery stores and thought I would put together a list of my personal suggestions.

## For Shoppers
1. SOCIAL DISTANCE! Stay 6 feet away from other people. That means taking a detour for narrow spaces or waiting for someone to be done choosing an item before going in for yours.        
2. Go alone if you can. If you have a significant other or roommate then make a list and send ONE person only. Shoppers in groups makes it difficult to social distance even if you go with people who you are already in close contact with.        
3. Couples with kids, see 1. No need to bring you, your spouse and your 2.3 kids to make it difficult for others to go around. Kids are also unpredictable and may be harder to avoid. Make a list, send only one, and take turns watching kids if possible.       
4. Don't grab an item and put it back. Try to make sure you really want an item before touching it.      
5. Don't put your cart on one side of the aisle and stand on the other looking for things, how can we go by and give you 6 feet?      
6. Try to get as much as you can to limit store trips.      
7. Carry a sanitizer wipe or paper towel with sanitizer on it and use it to wipe cart handles and open freezer doors. This may be a bit overboard for some people, but I believe in it and do it.

## For Stores      
1. Thank you for putting up with us during these trying times!!
2. Many grocery stores are doing AMAZING things, sanitizing cart handles on every return as well as the credit/debit card machine. If your store doesn't do this, please do!
3. Remove all of the stands in aisles with promotional items and other unnecessary bottlenecks. These make it difficult to social distance in aisles. Also, these items are usually on a shelf already somewhere else.

I am not perfect, I have been guilty of a few of these and try to check myself, but let's all please try. Remember that this effects EVERYONE. The better we do now, the sooner we can go back to some kind of normal. The sooner we go back to normal, the better the odds that jobs will come back.",Portland,Social Distancing in Grocery Store Suggestions

WARRENTON GIVES TOURISTS 24 HOURS TO GET OUT OF TOWN

By Cindy Yingst
The Columbia Press
Tourists have 24 hours to get out of town or face arrest.
Warrenton city commissioners took the stance after thousands of people from elsewhere arrived in town Friday and Saturday, clogging highways 30, 26 and 101.
Warrenton called an emergency meeting at 5 p.m. Saturday, first issuing a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 outbreak and then taking further action to prevent those from other areas coming here on vacations and spring break or for simple recreation and endangering residents.
“This is a serious event and it’s also a major event,” Mayor Henry Balensifer said earlier in the day during a livestream broadcast. “Our top priority is doing what we need to do for the best interest of our citizens.”
Resolution 2565, “To ensure the public health and safety of the citizens of Warrenton and to avoid unnecessary risks to hospital surge in Clatsop County,” makes the following orders:
All camping is closed at Warrenton and Hammond marinas.
All camping is closed at KOA, Fort Stevens State Park, Kampers West and Hammond Marina RV Park. An exception is made for permanent residents, camp hosts, employees and anyone living as a long-term resident of the facilities who were residents with contracts before March 11 – when the virus was declared a pandemic.
All stays in short-term rentals, home-stay lodging and B&amp;Bs are prohibited.
All hotels within city limits are closed except for current users registered for longer than 30 days and as authorized by the county, state or federal health authorities. So long-term contractors already staying in the city’s hotels may remain.
All camping on private property, except by order of the police chief or state, is prohibited.
The resolution takes effect immediately and those affected have 24 hours to vacate.
The vote was unanimous with Balensifer, Tom Dyer, Rick Newton and Mark Baldwin at City Hall – separated by 6 feet – and Pam Ackley via telephone.
The resolution will be enforced by Warrenton Police and four officers were at City Hall for the Saturday meeting, including Chief Matt Workman. 
“We’re prepared for that,” Workman told commissioners. “I’ve spoken with Sheriff Phillips and he will provide us with any additional resources as needed.”
The offense – remaining in town after the 24 hours – is a class C misdemeanor “and that is an arrestable offense,” he said.
“I would hope that the majority of the folks that are affected by this order … will cooperatively work with the city so as not to tax the limited resources we have,” City Manager Linda Engbretson said.
Officers will contact managers of the campgrounds and hotels and they’re expected to take action to clear out their facilities.
Balensifer said he’d spoken with county officials, County Commissioner Mark Kujala and state Senator Betsy Johnson and all are aware of the city’s action and support it.
“We’re not making this decision in a vacuum.”",Portland,Warrenton gives tourist 24 hours to vacate.

Now this is an airport where only a few Alaska Air flights are in and out and perhaps a Delta and Frontier thrown in as well so the place is a ghost town and in the food court there were a handful of people. This idiot, speaking in a booming voice was bitching to a friend then spouse then provider and medical center in destination city of Anchorage.  Was bitching about not being able to get screened for covid 19 due to lack of testing kits. Want to know if he can embrace spose or wear a mask for 14 days. Repeatedly told his call recipients that while he has a runny nose and slight sore throat, he does not believe he has the viral disease.  Explained in his call that he is frustrated be cause he's been in Germany and Dubai and India for 3 weeks and now portland. This went on for 15+ minutes. I was easily 50 feet away and was amazed at this display. Plus, my opinion only based on his appearance made me think that he is not a skilled artisan or white collar world traveller but maybe someone who lives to never miss a nascar race.

I packed up and approached TSA screener, explained what I overheard and also explained, like the overhead announcements state, that I just wanted to tell someone.  TSA screener looked like a deer caught in headlights and referred me to the white paging phone.  Explained to the info person on the phone who transferred me to communications. I explained that all I wanted to do was relay my observations.  Was told there was nothing they could do.  I understood but when went to Alaska dezk and again explained my observations and the lady was great. Chuckled when I told her airport communications couldn't help.  She told me there isn't any screening tjat is done and unless a traveller was displaying symptoms they couldn't really do anything but she took the flight info and description of the dude and was going to relay it to the gate people. All this was about 5 hours before his flight.

The American Red Cross says the warning is issued when ""chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants may be released accidentally or intentionally into the environment"" and residents should ""select a small, interior room, with no or few windows, taking refuge there.""

Something that has been a problem for my community is a paranoid denial of scientific evidence. For years now scientists have been informing the public of a disaster that will be much more damaging than the one we are currently experiencing. Please try to understand that scientists may be flawed but they are hard to convince. Almost every gathering of scientist results in a debate over how to interpret the results and what experiments need to be done that can be more convincing. This is the nature of science. When it comes to man made climate change the community agrees that there needs to be a change. Hopefully this global disaster will catalyze the public to demand a more scientific approach to government policies. Especially ones that involve global disasters. However, watching how serious people are taking this pandemic gives me little hope.",Portland,Climate change will be worse
7233,7233,Training-Product,1584884320,fn03tg,Nan,"Social distancing is all well and good, but we still need food. If you're isolating yourselves at home, and then you have to go out shopping, there's a bit of an issue with the isolation; plus, all the workers who are put at risk because of all the people in the grocery stores.

Here's my thought with regards to this problem. There are ~250k households in the Portland area. Assuming that each household gets groceries once per week, that is 35k deliveries of groceries to be made. Now, let's assume (because atm I don't have the numbers) that there are 500 grocery stores in the Portland Area. That would mean there would need to be 70 pickups per grocery store, per day.

* 250k homes
* 500 grocery stores
* 35k grocery deliveries per day / 7 days week
* 70 pick ups per grocery store.

So my idea is this: If every grocery store got on board, their employees would only need to shop for items and package them in boxes. Volunteer drivers would then pick up these orders and drop them at the people's front doors. With the right coordination, this could be coordinated in such a way that each grocery store in the area gets N number of pickups per day, and can essentially shut themselves off from the public. This also handles the issue with people hoarding.

As well, it would be nice to go along with this something to allow people who are more fortunate to donate to those who are less fortunate, so that nobody is going without food.

This is just a rough idea. There'd need to be a lot of coordination here, but I was curious to see if anyone had any thoughts.",Portland,An idea regarding grocery shopping.

* Listen to your IT department, and if your current setup is allowing you to work from home, make no changes to it at all.

* **EXACTLY** follow your IT Department's recommendations.  Beat them up or buy them a beer later.

* To work from home, you usually need both a computer and a high-speed Internet connection.  Dumb as it sounds, it has to be said.

* All new computers running at least Windows Home, including laptops, will work fine for working from home.  Speed is usually governed by your shitty home Internet upload bandwidth.

* Public WiFi is generally OK.  Cell phone hot spots are...spotty.  A dedicated Internet connection in your home is preferred.

* Physical wires trump wireless.  You can't control when your neighbor turns on his microwave.  Ignore if your wireless connection works well.

* I can't believe I'm saying this, but if you're using your personal computer to connect to work, disable Windows updates, and disable antivirus updates.  Temporarily.  Ask one of my users why this is good advice.

* Windows can ""roll back"" to a previous configuration if something goes wrong.  This is generally called ""system recovery"" or ""windows restore"".  Enable this if you can on your home computer.

* Make **NO** changes or upgrades to your home network.  Trust me.

* Make **NO** changes to your computer's configuration, especially network configs.

* Your home computer should be on Windows 8 or 10 if possible.  Earlier versions don't get updates.  Upgrade only after consulting your IT department.

* Some ISPs block VPNs, or their equipment does.  If you cannot get your VPN to work, you may need to switch ISPs.  Again, I have practical experience.

* Follow exactly your company's work-from-home policies.  This is new to a lot of managers and employees.  Make it easy for everybody.

Under a shelter in policy it is more difficult for a victim to leave an abusive situation. The reason why it's even more difficult is now the victim can't get away with leaving the home to get a restraining order since it would draw attention to the abuser who is aware theres a shelter in. 
Let's say a mom who has kids in school, she would have normaly been able to use school hours to file an order. She cannot do so now. If she tries to leave the home now it would look suspicious. The first hours and days of leaving an abuser is the most risky time and abusers are good at following every move their victim makes. 
For children experiencing abuse and neglect. There are less mandatory reporters around to report suspected neglect, abuse or sexual abuse and under the duration of a shelter in place and the longer schools are closed the more children are left in abusive environments.

Even low interest loans may not help for a business that wasn't clearing much anyway. Is it worth it to take out loans that will take years to repay if you're only earning $30k a year? I owned a small business in Portland for over a decade and sold it last spring because I wanted to move. I don't think we would have survived more than a couple months during a quarantine. I wish all the small business owners well. Hopefully most will get through this.",Portland,According to their FB feed Tanker Bar on Hawthorne has closed permanently.

7291,7291,BridgeCityBus,1584908044,fn6c0l,Nan,"The bus didn’t break down.  It was me, the operator. 

I’ve already noticed that my anxiety is high and although I am so thankful to still have a job and still get a paycheck, I have just a bit of fear every morning going to work and every day I return home, stripping off my work clothes and boots in the corner by our front door and washing my hands up to my elbows. 

I’ve noticed tensions are rising in the city. I’ve seen more aggressive driving and more angry people, even though there are fewer cars and fewer folks out. I’m worried about my family, like you all are. My folks are having a hard time staying put and not worrying about their business being broken into when they aren’t there. I have two sisters who have newborns at home. One of those sisters is an ICU nurse. I have another sister currently out of the country, and a brother who is homeless in Portland.

In most instances of acute work stress, I have been able to keep a pretty level head, and I’m proud of that, considering I’m already a pretty sensitive, stressed out and emotional person.  Today was not that day. 

Barely into my first run, I had an incident happen. I don’t want or need to go into specifics, but it wasn’t an unusual incident. It’s not uncommon for this type of situation to happen, and many operators have dealt with it before. It was not fun, I was worried about the safety of a passenger and with that comes with the worry that maybe I did something wrong.

I called dispatch to report what happened and the dispatcher could hear that my voice was shaky. She asked me if I was okay to continue on and reminded me that I could take some time to gather myself. I think her acknowledging my stress made the tears start, along with the deep, shaky breaths.  I tried to get myself together, wiped my face and continued down the road. 

The shitty thing with me and the way that I have always been, is that I usually deal with stress by using humor, sometimes self deprecating humor. And it works. But when the tears start coming, they won’t stop. I was driving down the road with tears on my cheeks, embarrassed and worried that someone will notice and feel unsafe on my bus. I would not want to be on a bus with a crying operator.

So I stopped again, and called dispatch to request to be relieved of duty. I couldn’t pull it together and I knew that the time they would allow me wouldn’t be enough time. I cried on the way home and I’m still crying now.

This is a super stressful and scary time for all of us.  It’s lowering our tolerances to so many things that could otherwise be taken in stride. In this time I’m thankful to those who can keep it together. God knows what a shit show TriMet would be if all operators were falling apart like me.  I can’t even fathom how healthcare workers are dealing with this on a psychological level.

So a big thank you to all of you!  Thank you for staying at home. Thank you for keeping groceries on the shelves. Thank you for responding to medical, fire and police calls. Thank you for homeschooling your kids when it’s been 20 years since you’ve used sine, cosine and tangent. Thank you for caring for the sick and dying. Thank you for issuing SNAP and unemployment. Thank you for making deliveries. Thank you for filling our gas tanks. Thank you for washing your hands.  Thank you for loving your friends and family at a distance. And for those of you are are staying strong and keeping your shit together—thank you!  People like me need people like you to sometimes hold us together. And that is a hard job to do.",Portland,I had a breakdown today.

All shifts for non-salary staff were cancelled, but no one was laid off. Instead, they are continuing to pay us at minimum wage based on our average hours worked in previous months. I'm getting paid for 35 hours a week at minimum wage despite literally not going to work at all. Our management has reiterated that if money becomes a problem for any of us to let them know immediately and they will explore what they can do to help us.

They informed staff that if they find they would financially benefit more from being laid off and receiving full unemployment insurance, the company would facilitate that and they would still have a job when we're able to reopen.

If anyone is laid off or if the company moves forward with laying everyone off, anyone receiving benefits would keep them throughout the layoff and is guaranteed to have their jobs back.

Thanks to their efforts, I will be able to pay my bills while being able to stay home and keep myself and my partner safe. I don't need to go work in a grocery store and take that job from someone who needs it more than I do.

I’ve not tried it out or anything, but it’s a good idea!  You can get streaming services and ebooks in these wild times, even if you can’t get physical items. 
Go to [their website](www.multcolib.org), put in “create a library card” and the link for that should come up.  Fill out the information and you’ll be emailed back with your card number.  
Everything checks out for three weeks and some streaming services have increased their limits (for example Kanopy was 6 and now its 10).  
Thanks to the fellow redditors who thumbs-upped library services.  It’s a rad place, even if I didn’t work there.",Portland,MultCo Library suspends the in-person visit when registering for a new account online.
7364,7364,EmotionalOcelot,1584926835,fnbf80,Nan,"Okay, look, here's the deal. You're right, no one has told you specifically to stay home. My Facebook feed is full of people posting pictures from the beach, or the park, or somewhere in public surrounded by people. We had kind of hoped the generalized ""Stay home, stay healthy"" message would get you to reconsider your activities. We've just been telling everyone for like three weeks to cancel all non-essential activities, like, say, going to the beach for the weekend. We've cancelled activities through like June to give you even less reason to go anywhere. We've cancelled meetings, conventions, events, anything we could think of to give you a reason to leave your house right now. We've recommended avoided gatherings of more than 100, then 50, then 25, then 10...

So what did you do? You went to the beach. You went to hang out at the park with your friends. You went, ""Well, no one looks sick..."" and treated this like an extended spring break...ODOT closed the parking lot at Multnomah Falls, school districts said, ""No, seriously, property's closed, you're trespassing"", park districts have posted signs...and at least one of you looked around to see if there was anyone enforcing the rules, then entered the park...

When the governor announces Monday a lockdown in the vein of California, New York, and Illinois, it's going to be because asking nicely for folks to use common sense failed to change behavior. For the last two weeks, I've gone to work, I've gone home, I've gone to the grocery store...my social calendar is empty through like July...I've told lots of people I'd love to get together...in like September...I don't want to see anyone I don't absolutely have to...FaceTime and I are best buddies now...

The only reason I'm working is that I do tax consulting, and up until Friday, taxes were due April 15th, and corporate headquarters said, ""We'll shut down when the government shuts us down...or someone gets positively confirmed as infected in your office...""

I know at least two immunocompromised people who I've had to run errands for because they can't go out in public, and even having me run errands is risky because I've spent the last three weeks dealing with people trying to file their taxes, and since we can't tell if you have the disease until you demonstrate symptoms 5-11 days after being exposed, who knows if I'm secretly a carrier...

I did enough shopping today that I should be good for two weeks. I'm really genuinely hoping the lockdown order tomorrow is broad enough that my office is included, because taxes are now due July 15th, so there can't be anything essential about a retail tax preparation business...tomorrow morning, I'm rescheduling clients, I'm moving their returns to electronic processing, I'm doing anything I can to give people a reason to not come and see me...at least until the governor shuts us down...",Portland,I hope the governor shuts us down tomorrow...

#### Synopsis

**After a global pandemic makes public gatherings illegal and concerts impossible, except for those willing to break the law for the love of music--and for one chance at human connection.**

In the Before, when the government didn't prohibit large public gatherings, Luce Cannon was on top of the world. One of her songs had just taken off and she was on her way to becoming a star. Now, in the After, terror attacks and deadly viruses have led the government to ban concerts, and Luce's connection to the world--her music, her purpose--is closed off forever. She does what she has to do: she performs in illegal concerts to a small but passionate community, always evading the law.

Rosemary Laws barely remembers the Before times. She spends her days in Hoodspace, helping customers order all of their goods online for drone delivery--no physical contact with humans needed. By lucky chance, she finds a new job and a new calling: discover amazing musicians and bring their concerts to everyone via virtual reality. The only catch is that she'll have to do something she's never done before and go out in public. Find the illegal concerts and bring musicians into the limelight they deserve. But when she sees how the world could actually be, that won't be enough.",Portland,A prescient novel about our current situation. Buy from Powells online!!

Hey y’all! I’m a baker and aspiring pastry chef with a schedule that’s kept me from socializing as much as I would like to, and I’d like to change that. Social distancing has made me realize I don’t have enough people in my life to distance myself from- lol. I’m seeking platonic friendship connections with interesting and hopefully like-minded people. 

Maybe we keep each other company virtually during our mutual isolation. Maybe we hit it off and get together for coffee or drinks or duck-feeding once the plague has cleared, provided we both survive it. 

I’m mama to two small humans, three cats, and more houseplants than I realize. Baking is my passion. When I’m not baking, I might be knitting, Netflix-bingeing with my wife, lazing about in a hammock, or lost in a book. I’m spending 2020 reading books by female authors featuring strong women, so send me recommendations or tell me all about your favorite books! I have chronic pain that sometimes keeps me inside, but I also love gentle hikes and sunshine shenanigans. 420 friendly. 

I generally relate best to the 30-to-40-something crowd, but feel free to drop me a line regardless... as long as you aren’t a republican. Happy hunting!",Portland,Queer female looking for local friends

He went to say that the owner is of the opinion this virus is a hoax and doesn't get why they can't make money. Carts there are pulling in at most 200 dollars a day, and I know that this is happening all over the city. 

I hope either the city helps these carts out or people in the community who make enough to maybe help the carts stay afloat come forward because it'd be awful if something so weaved into the fabric of Portland comes crashing down.

Here's a chart.  We're at 161 cases as of today, Sunday March 22.  If the current growth rate of about 1.5x increase every 3 days continues we will have over 58,000 cases by May 1.  If we get that growth rate down under 1 the total number of cases will stay under 1000.

Of course we all know the number of cases in Oregon is under-reported due to lack of testing, so this is likely to go up before it goes down.  But hopefully by tracking the growth rate rather than just watching the number of cases increase it will give us something more concrete to focus on.

The red line on the left is the average growth rate, currently about 1.5 (right side axis).  The blue bars are the predicted number of cases if the growth rate stays around 1.5.

Let me know if anyone finds this useful, I'm happy to tweak it.  Our business is pretty much shut down so I have time to do some analysis.

My household needs toilet paper, and obviously it's been gone from the shelves for 3+ weeks now. I went to the Fred's on W. Burnside at 6:45am this morning since they open at 7. No one else was there, so I took a leisurely stroll for 10 minutes and returned to a dozen or so people waiting. They were giving each other a good social distance (*in a scatter, not a line*). I'd guess about half were 60-75 years old, only 2 women, and 3 had masks on. At 7:00 the employee opened the door for the 20 people there by that point, and all social distancing was lost as everyone started walking in at once .... not running or pushing, but suddenly everyone was walking a little faster than normal and no one wanted to lose the chance to buy toilet paper to their slowness. And of course they were all heading to the toilet paper. Ever been to the Louvre and seen everyone hustling past a zillion great pieces of art to get to the Mona Lisa? Yeah, it was like that. 

Fred's had about 50 packs of TP (*so maybe 1/3 of the shelving for TP was full*), and since there's a limit of 1, everyone easily got a pack, and they were all pretty much 24 or 30 packs. They actually had less paper towels than TP which seemed weird since the downtown Target has tons of paper towels but no TP. Some people grabbed Lysol wipes and other cleaning stuff like that. They still don't have any thermometers. I got the giant pack of TP and a 6-pack of paper towels and headed to the register. They had the 4 self check-outs open, and that was it, and one was being monopolized by a guy buying a pack of M&amp;M's with his phone, which he didn't seem to ever figure out or give up on. I was out of there ~7:10, and about half the TP packs were still on the shelf as a few more people were trickling in.

It was an incredibly difficult decision— we’ve managed to stay the course after location changes, a fire, floods from broken pipes, and about every other disaster that could shutter a place. We’ve been doing this for over a decade, but we have never dealt with something like this.

After making the transition to delivery/pick up only in the beginning of the week, we expected to see a marked drop on sales. Instead, we were one of the restaurants that got even busier. While it seems ridiculous to complain about that as businesses are closing their doors for seemingly ever, *there was no denying as long as we were open we were part of the problem*. Few examples:

-Despite the fact we encouraged people to pay over the phone &amp; served through a window to minimize contact with my staff, folks still touched their hands grabbing food, accidentally coughed through the window, etc. Many people still tried the doors and were angry they couldn’t come inside.

-I watched dozens of customers sit shoulder to shoulder waiting for food, letting their dogs play together, closely talking with the caviar and Postmates drivers waiting for their deliveries. While others just posted up with their food anyway, treating it like a cute sidewalk picnic. 

I understand if not every restaurant owner can make this decision, there is a good deal of uncertainty for us at this point. But one thing is increasingly clear— for the sake of our employees, customers, and community at large, we need to flatten the curve where we can. 

Stay safe, Portland. Hope to be feeding y’all again soon!",Portland,We closed our restaurant

7450,7450,Acidsplash4fun,1584977697,fnlx7m,Nan,"Good morning my not-so-distant neighbors. May the sun breathe its pure and antiviral breath upon yous today.

Life sure is weird right now. And for a lot of us life has gotten tough. I made the horrible decision to quit my side job a month ago, and two weeks later my primary job got cancelled on account of all this. 

Who knows what's going to happen?

I'll tell you honestly, I have a lot of personal problems. And they haven't seemed to go away amidst all this. In fact, I'd say they've only been amplified. But what can I do?

I've been reading a lot, trying to be productive, but when you're stuck at home, stewing in all your woes, it can often seem hopeless. We often forget that work deprives us of the opportunity to really deeply think about all the shit in our lives. And that can be good, it can be bad. Depends on you, I guess.

But one thing this has made absolutely clear to me: in being quarantined, in having to fear for those around me *and* myself, in having to think of myself as part of a community whereas before I might have only thought of myself as subjugate to something higher, more sinister, than myself... in being in this situation it seems so clear now that loneliness and helplessness and hopelessness are everywhere. They aren't things we endure individually, they're things we endure together. Because everyone has problems. Everyone is desperate in some implacable way. We all have dark corners our minds like to go to. 

I don't really know if this is helpful. But to you reading this: I don't know you, I probably never will. But you're a person just like me. And we all want the best for ourselves and those around us. And we all have hopes and dreams that feel impossible, I know. Things we're always reaching for and never able to touch. Life sometimes seems like an awful joke. And there's always a dark corner waiting for us; it's inevitable.

I'd just like you to know that there is someone out there as pathetic and lonely as you are. There are millions - billions - of people like that. I'm one, and almost everyone you know is one, too, in their own special way. 

I want you to know that while I may not know who you are, I really do wish you the best. And I believe in you. I believe that you can get through whatever troubles you're facing. Because you are *real* and *vital* and *alive*. And things may not turn out how we want them to, but I promise you, things will turn out - because they always do. And if we can all weather our troubles, we'll be stronger for it.

To anyone reading this... it's likely you only live a few miles from me. You may feel alone, but you're not. You're surrounded by people in the same place, even if they don't show it. I'm there too. And I believe in you, as surely as I believe in myself. There's really nothing else to do.",Portland,Good morning!!

Do people not understand that no cash flow for your employers = no cash for salaries? It's not just retail and hospitality employees that are going to get hit by this. 

I had a friend who just changed jobs tell me about a (very expensive) home that he wants to make an offer on this week, another just purchased an $8k bike, and another said ""I hope my trip to NYC in April can still happen.""

I just get the sense that a lot of generally smart people have no idea how bad this situation is.

7462,7462,Dpurcell92,1584982365,fnna05,Nan,"Not to downplay any emergency profession, but for decades we as a society stood by our police and fire as they put their lives at risk to help and save our communities. For decades the emergency medical profession has wanted  to be recognized for their need in the community and has been faced with criticism with remarks as ""it's not really that dangerous for them"" or ""the work is different"".  Now police and fire are staying away from the scene unless there is an immediate life threat, as they should. There is no need to expose them for no reason, your ALS paramedics are coming in to take care of you. You may be thinking, ""so what, it's their job"".  Just take this into consideration. 

This virus is deadly to the elderly and those already in poor health. The EMT/paramedic is legally obligated to come and take you to the hospital. They are not allowed to decline you services. They are now exposed. They may not get sick, but they go home and expose their husbands and wives who may have poor immune systems. They may still live with or take care of their parents who now may become sick and die. This is not just isolated to the corona virus, but to the flu, hepatitis, TB, Ebola, etc., etc., etc. Of course, they take precautions, but things happen. Sometimes people lie about their conditions, sometimes equipment fails, sometimes mistakes are made. 

If things go wrong on the job with police they may be shot and killed, things go wrong in a fire they may be trapped and burned to death, things go wrong with EMS they may potentially   
kill their entire family. It won't be quick either. They will watch their family slowly waste away in pain and agony until their last breath, knowing they were the reason for their families demise. 

Paramedics in the US average 35,000 -55,000 a year. EMT's average 30,000-45,000 a year. No pension, health benefits often only cover the employee, not the family, and sometimes they still have to contribute. Almost all EMT'S and Paramedics have been assaulted on the job. They are exposed to disease, blood, and other colorful bodily fluids. 

If we learn anything about the current situation in this country, learn that all emergency services are important, all emergency services work together and help each other, and all emergency services should be treated as equals. There is a huge shortage of EMTs and Paramedics in this country as it is not financially feasible to make a career out of it. In New Jersey your town is not even legally obligated to provide ambulance services. They must have police and fire coverage of some sort, but not ambulance. Image your loved one dying, you calling 911, and a police car and fire truck show up, but no ambulance. 

It would be great if after this corona pandemic blows over that a movement is made to get the local, state, and federal governments together to finally recognize and treat the emergency medical services the way they should be treated.

From the web page: 

Starting March 23, we are making changes to our primary care and dental services to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

* We will provide most medical appointments by telemedicine. This is when a care provider offers medical advice and treatment by phone.
* Services will be consolidated at fewer clinic sites. All other medical and dental clinics are closed.

Offering more telemedicine appointments will ensure that clients can still access care, while making it easier for everyone to stay home and stay safe.

## How Telemedicine Works

* Your provider will call you to confirm whether your next appointment will be by phone or in-person.
* For a phone appointment, your provider will call you at your scheduled time.
* Your provider will determine if you need an in-person visit after taking to you over the phone.
* If you do require an in-person visit and you have an active cough or fever, you will be asked to wear a mask as soon as you arrive.

## Primary Care

Food is so incredibly important, so this has been my main focus. I have a simple, very rough idea at the moment, and I would love input on it.

Social distancing is all well and good, but we still need food. If you're isolating yourselves at home, and then you have to go out shopping, there's a bit of an issue with the isolation; plus, all the workers who are put at risk because of all the people in the grocery stores.

Here's my thought with regards to this problem. There are ~250k households in the Portland area. Assuming that each household gets groceries once per week, that is 35k deliveries of groceries to be made. Now, let's assume (because atm I don't have the numbers) that there are 500 grocery stores in the Portland Area. That would mean there would need to be 70 pickups per grocery store, per day.

    250k homes
    500 grocery stores
    35k grocery deliveries per day / 7 days week
    70 pick ups per grocery store.

So my idea is this: If every grocery store got on board, their employees would only need to shop for items and package them in boxes. Volunteer drivers would then pick up these orders and drop them at the people's front doors. With the right coordination, this could be coordinated in such a way that each grocery store in the area gets N number of pickups per day, and can essentially shut themselves off from the public. This also handles the issue with people hoarding.

As well, it would be nice to go along with this something to allow people who are more fortunate to donate to those who are less fortunate, so that nobody is going without food.

This is just a rough idea. If we could work with the stores, a small army of volunteer software engineers should have no issue creating the app (I would volunteer there) that people can use to coordinate all this (volunteering, shopping, etc). There would need to be a lot of coordination here, but I was curious to see if anyone had any thoughts.",Portland,"An idea with regards to grocery shopping, input appreciated."

Ok Lets have a conversation about gloves. With this whole Pandemic going on I see more and more people wearing gloves but using them in all the wrong ways. 

TL:DR Gloves are not Magical. 

First off: Cotton Breathable Gloves for winter are doing nothing for you. The germs attach and go right through those gloves. You are just taking and storing all the germs and bacteria you touch while you are about and about, taking them back to your car or home or where ever you leave them. Then when you go to use them again you are just putting your hands into tainted gloves. 

Second: Disposable Gloves weather latex or rubber. These are ONE TIME USE gloves. Gloves are not a magical force field that are protecting you. If you are wearing a pair of these gloves and you reach into your pocket to get your phone or  your keys then you have just moved the germs that are on the gloves into your pocket. If you touch your phone with them you have just transferred those germs from the outside of your gloves to your phone. When you are home later and you reach into your pocket to get your phone then both the inside of your pocket and  your phone are now tainted. 

If you are going out and you are going to be using disposable gloves you should bring a whole box or bag with you. If you have them on and you need to take out your phone or keys, take the pair of gloves you have on, off and dispose of them. Then take the item out of your pocket. Once you have put the item back, put a new pair of gloves on. I know this sounds wasteful but it is necessary to help prevent germ and bacteria transfer. 

Disposable gloves should not go from building to building. If you are leaving the grocery store or whatever building you are in you should dispose of those gloves on your way out and put on a new pair before you get in your car, on your bike or on public transportation. 

Be Safe out there friends and remember Gloves are not Magical.",Portland,Gloves are not Magical Force Fields!!!

-**25 person limit inside the center**, wait outside if it is full. Maintain social distancing, please.  
-**6 feet of distance to be maintained between RVMs** (Reverse Vending Machines- the things you put your containers into). Most centers have the machines spaced closer together than this, so now every other machine will be out of service in order to maintain recommended social distancing. This means many stores will have only half of their machines working.  
-**Only one person per machine at a time.** Don't bring your spouse or friends to hang out with you when you return containers. We will nicely ask them to leave the area. If you want to argue about it you can leave with them.  
-**All lines require guests to maintain 6 feet of social distancing** (for RVMs, customer service counter, handwashing area, pay station, etc.).  
-**35 dollar/350 container limit per person per day no exceptions.** I know there were some stores that were cool with you doing more if they weren't busy or if you went through the line again, but we can't do that anymore with more limited capacity. If you want to argue about this we can adjust your daily limit to be 0 containers/0 dollars per day.  
-**Redemption Center drop door hours for green bags stay the same** 6am-10pm  
  
So Centers will be open, but have more limited capacity. Grocery Stores are not accepting any containers for now. They have enough going on right now, so not taking cans will hopefully make their already hectic days a little bit easier.  
This means Redemption Centers are the only places you can bring in cans and put them in a machine and get cash in hand. I'm guessing we will be busier, and your visit may take longer if you go to one. But then again we may be slower with more people staying home. I don't really know, if i could accurately predict this I would be way higher up in the company.  
**My recommendation to everyone would be to set up a Bottle Drop account and use the green bag drop off program.** You can set up an account at an in store kiosk, or even better from the comfort of home via our website https://www.bottledropcenters.com/open-account/  
You can stop by a center to get the bags and your card, an employee can explain how the program works and give you some tips if you want, and then you just cruise by and drop off you bags at the drop door and never have to step foot in the store again until you need more bags. If you drop your bags off at a redemption center we usually get them done the same day, sometimes it can take a day or 2 if something breaks in the back.  
  
We are also working hard at constantly wiping down any surface that people frequently come in contact with in the center. But people can be gross and their cans are usually gross. Socially distance yourself and sign up for green bags and avoid the gross. (ps- don't you be gross with your green bags please)  
  
This is all I can remember right now, a lot of stuff is being thrown at us and things are changing all the time. It could change again tomorrow! But this is where it stands now.",Portland,Bottle Drop Centers will still be open- with some changes due to the current station (mostly inside the center)

 To all concerned citizens,

Unprecedented times call for unprecedented creativity.  It is evident that we have what is in essence a two front war:  a global health pandemic, and an economic meltdown of unprecedented proportion.

The best recommended method to fight the pandemic is social distancing.  Therefore, we must implement immediately a stay-in-place policy across the nation and the world.  If the way to stop the virus is to stop the spread through interpersonal contact, this will be the quickest and most effective way to flatten the curve, and stop the virus in its tracks.  Let it play itself out in infected populations, and wait for the coast to clear.

Secondly, the cash flow crisis that is upon businesses and individuals must have a uniform policy across the board that keeps everyone “whole” as a result of the stay-in-place policy.  The economic consequences of the pandemic so far have dwarfed the medical impacts.  **The best way to combat the economic meltdown and cash flow crisis is to pause or freeze all debt, mortgage, lease, and rent payments in their tracks across the board for everyone.**  I have advocated for immediately passing a national law to do just this.  Once the crisis is over, allow business to recover and then un-pause.

We have frozen millions of businesses ability to make money, pay wages, and economic activity has screeched to a halt.  The only way to effectively keep our nation and the world from a meltdown is to simultaneously halt the need to make payments.  All banks and financial institutions must get on board with a uniform policy enacted across all platforms to make this work.  If banks cannot receive payments on the loans, we are facing another financial crisis.  By halting the requirement to make payments, banks can then work within the framework of the Federal Reserve System, and interbank lending to create and maintain liquidity for essential services.  We can reduce or stop business failure in its tracks, and thus, the need to bail out industries and financial institutions.  Federal and State aid can then be most effectively used for the basic survival needs of food and utilities.

We must have the mindset to create a national protocol for these situations; protocols for health systems and economic systems that protect everyone on both levels.  The current paradigm of tax credits, loans, and bailouts cannot possibly keep everyone “whole”.  The government cannot and should not create untenable amounts of debt or print money in the volume needed.

Many banks and individuals are working out these very solutions on their own.  What is needed is a coordinated, coherent and effective policy across the board for all people.  We must stand united and demand a national economic freeze for both our health needs and economic needs.

Please share this letter, its ideas, or both across every platform you have and to every political and business leader you can.  We must create a movement that begins with the premise that all people will equally be kept whole throughout this crisis.  That means with healthcare and economic needs.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: In order to combat the economic fallout this pandemic is creating, we must push for a ""debt freeze"" to pause all debt, mortgage, lease, and rent payments. Without action, we will be hit hard by the economic mess COVID-19 is wreaking.",Portland,Protocols for Health and Economic Survival--Please Help!

We have a number of projects at apartment buildings as well as dozens of housing developments. I’m most worried about the apartment buildings because it’s much more highly trafficked than the house jobs we do. 

I have someone living with me who is more at risk than others due to a respiratory condition, which is the cause of my anxiety with all of this. Our company just expects us to go about work as normal, but I’ve made up my mind that I will not work at the large building job sites during this shelter order. I’m fine with the house jobs because there are fewer people and it is easier to maintain distance. 

How should I broach the subject with my boss? We have plenty of work at both types of jobs, I just don’t want to risk being sent home if I don’t have to. If push comes to shove I’ll go home over being at an apartment building though.

'If you can keep your head when all about you

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
   But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
   Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,
   And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
   If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with triumph and disaster
   And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
   Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,
   And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
   And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
   And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
   To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
   Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
   Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
   If all men count with you, but none too much;

I prepare taxes - which is as glorious as it sounds.  This time of year is usually 60-70 hours weeks as we happily crank through the piles of paperwork our clients have dropped off.

This year, as you can imagine, has turned out a bit different than most years.  Most firms have closed their offices and turned staff out to work from home, which can be done, but also just hampers your efficiency.  Our clients have also gone into seclusion, their accounting staff are gone, the investment advisers and bankers we work with have been slammed - it's a bit rough.

So, the reason for this post - the IRS has pushed back the usual filing date to 7/15 (hurray!).  Bad news:  Our Governor, and the Department of Revenue, are waffling - they want to keep the 4/15 deadline in order to ""help with the state budget.""

They kept giving me more work notes and ignoring my requests for testing, so I finally said fuck it and went into urgent care. 

I walk in the door, and there’s a greeter there. She asks me why I am coming in. I tell her all my symptoms and how long I have them and that I was trying to see if I can be tested for COVID-19. After listening, she tells me to park near some orange cones and that someone will come out and test me! I was so excited that someone was listening. Sure enough, a nurse comes out. The test itself is VERY uncomfortable lol. A swab all the way up your nose is both nostrils. Got it done though and drive back home. 

Here’s the kicker. I get a call from Kaiser when I get home. They tell me that since a doctor didn’t order the test, they are not going to run it, and they are going to dispose of the test kit with the swab they took. I explained to them that the greeter at the door directed me to take the test. The provider that called said that the greeter needs to be educated and that the only people they are testing are healthcare workers and people with severe symptoms in the ER. He explained that they have a limited amount of tests. So I asked him if they have a limited amount of tests, does it really make sense to throw mine out because I’m not a healthcare worker?

People could provide dates/rough locations of their movements in the last few days and when enough data pours in, it can help build and trace clusters? People could also provide ""confidence votes"" on submissions to legitimize them. 

Of course the big gaping holes in this are: there's no way to know for sure if you have it since there is no testing, and no easy way to get confirmation of submitted information from medical professionals.

While I'm not out of the hole yet I am making progress toward financial independence and I figured I could share what I've learned. Hopefully these tips can help someone.

1. **Discontinue all essential services.** This means Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, gym membership, special clubs, and so on. If they're not going to help bring in income or keep your lights on, get rid of it.

2. **Set a routine.** What time do you wake up? What time will you go to bed? If your answer is ""I don't know,"" set a time. This structure can give you a sense of control over your day.

3. **Think in abundance.** This is a hard one, because it may feel like all evidence points to the fact that you're out of money &amp; resources. But remember--facts don't care about your feelings. Tell yourself you already have more than enough. Suddenly unemployed? You have more than enough.

4. **Get Exercise**. This can fit in to #1 - set a routine. I try to get 20 - 40 minutes of cardio every morning. Why in the morning? Because it's hard to squeeze in in the afternoon. Plus, I hate exercising, so I found I was always dreading ""workout"" on my calendar. Whatever you do, make it intense to work off that stress. Maybe encourage others in your house to participate. Too afraid to go outside? Just search for [""indoor cardio""](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=indoor+cardio) on YouTube.

5. **Don't be afraid to ask for help...**. Remember, we're all in this together. We're here to support you. You know that warm fuzzy feeling you get when you help someone out? You can give that warm fuzzy feeling to someone else.

6. **...But don't be a consumer.** Remember #3 - abundance mentality? Here you can use it. Give to others what you have.

7. **Most important, financially: find creative ways to make money**. This trying time will be more diving than any other time this generation. Who is creative enough to find ways of making money, and who is going to give in to despair? As long as you have breath in your lungs you have the ability to earn income! How?

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_citizen\_science\_projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_citizen_science_projects) 

And now, some of my favorite individual projects:

* [Fold.it](https://fold.it/)\- Probably the most famous crowdsourced science project, this protein-folding game made headlines when people power outperformed AI. You learn basic rules about how to ""fold"" complex shapes, and then try to solve puzzles based on real molecules. Bonus: they have puzzles directly based on Covid-19 molecules!
* [Eye Wire](https://eyewire.org/explore)\- Another 3D puzzle game, this one helps scientists map neural connections in the brain. Players have charted new circuits and even discovered (and named!) new types of neurons. Someday soon these maps will add incredible sophistication to scientists trying to treat brain diseases.
* [Stall Catchers](https://stallcatchers.com/main)\- Stalls are areas of reduced blood flow in the brain, and they're associated with Alzheimer's disease. Removing stalls might help treat Alzheimer's, they they're hard to find. Stall Catchers is an online game that crowdsources the goal of identifying stalls and moving us closer to a treatment for Alzheimer's.
* [GLOBE Observer: Clouds](https://observer.globe.gov/do-globe-observer/clouds)\- NASA collects tons of data about clouds via satellite, but they also want to know what these clouds look like from the ground. By taking pictures with the GLOBE: Clouds app, you can help atmospheric research. If you're interested, you can compare your data to that collected from space. Bonus: Not interested in clouds? Check out GLOBE Observer's other apps for measuring [mosquito habitats](https://observer.globe.gov/do-globe-observer/mosquitoes), [land cover](https://observer.globe.gov/do-globe-observer/land-cover), and [trees](https://observer.globe.gov/do-globe-observer/trees).
* [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2011/08/bhl-on-flickr.html)\- BHL has a truly gorgeous array of classic plant and animal art, but their collection is massive and they need help tagging the pictures. You don't need to be a biology genius- most labels are already in the image, you just need to add the tag. Then researchers and browsers alike can search the collection in a whole new way.
* [Anti-Slavery Manuscripts](https://www.antislaverymanuscripts.org/)\- Boston Library owns a giant collection of handwritten correspondence between anti-slavery activists. It's an incredibly important piece of history, but they're currently not databased or searchable. They need people like you to read and transcribe the letters so that students and historians can more easily learn from what these activists had to say.

And finally, a special mention to /r/scholar. Researchers need access to past research, but sometimes it's hard to find. If you have access to a scholarly database through your school, work, or library, consider helping these people dig up the articles they need.

So, you could use them to eat at a locally owned restaurant, the restaurant could use the currency to buy produce from a local farmer, the farmer could use it to buy equipment from a local supplier, etc. Obviously, places like Starbucks or Kaiser Permanente would not be included in this exchange. I just see it as a way for local businesses to stay afloat after this crisis and to encourage people to shop at local businesses only.  I know that other cities have used this before. What do you think? I mean, with people all acting in unison now, and out of the need for money and while waiting for the US Government to come through for actual people, if they ever will, this seems like it could only help.

7724,7724,SAPHEI,1585103731,foild7,Nan,"Some of you may remember me from my ""STAY THE FUCK HOME"" post last week. That post got a lot of mixed reviews, with a lot of the negative reviews telling me that people simply couldn't get tested. I didn't want to provide any identifying information regarding my father-in-law (whom I had mentioned in the comments), but at the time, he had gotten tested (for the first time) for COVID-19. As of today, I am legitimately concerned that the state is withholding test kits and/or withholding the *real* numbers from the public.



As the title states, my father-in-law is a state employee. Any information that I'm providing here is second-hand information from him and my mother-in-law, and I do not want to provide any further information that could risk identifying him. I apologize if you feel that this discredits the information, but it's all I have at this point.

Two weeks ago, he stayed home with a 102-103 degree fever, a cough, and a sore throat. He went to a hospital and was first tested for the flu, but the test came back negative, so the hospital decided to administer a COVID-19 test.

The test was sent off to the CDC for verification, and three days later, my FIL was informed that there was something wrong with his test, so he was asked to come back to the hospital to get re-tested. This was at the beginning of last week.

Today, he called down to the hospital to see if they had received the results, and now they are refusing to tell him where his test is, what stage of testing it's in, and they're also refusing to provide him with a work release.

I don't want to fuel conspiracy theories, but if this doesn't present itself as a red flag to you, I don't know what to say. The first concern was the hospital improperly administering a test, causing the loss of a test when they are supposedly scarce. The second is that it seems (emphasis on ""seems"" because I can't possibly provide proof at this time) as though the State of Oregon is doing everything in their power to hide the numbers of confirmed cases.

We don't know what to do at this point... Thankfully, my FIL has almost fully recovered, but I feel like I have a responsibility to make this information publicly known.",Portland,"My FIL works for the state, was tested for COVID-19 nearly two weeks ago, and the hospital is refusing to inform him of his test results after they botched a first test."

I think they are necessary only because people aren't listening otherwise. If everyone would correctly do the things we're supposed to do such as hand washing, social distancing, not panic buying, etc. we'd get through this without orders.

That being said, I stopped at two grocery stores last night on my way home from work (Essential and responsible/safe employer) to get a few groceries for my family and my mother called asking if I could pick a few things up for her at a different store. (I was thrilled she called which means she has listened to our suggestion of letting us get stuff for her so she can stay put in her house away from people.)  In both stores it seems that for the strong most part folks are keeping distance, being polite, etc. I made it a point to smile at folks a little more as I got out of their way just to try to keep folks more happy and less panic. (I'm pretty health and mobile so don't mind stepping out of the way of ""older"" folks who are just trying to shop.)

However, there were several people who wanted to have their normal loud speaker phone conversations while strolling slowly through the store not paying attention to anything else. Now lets just say aside from the current pandemic, I already hate you. But now I'm watching you basically bump into people while laughing and yelling your spit into the air for those people. 

I watched one person facetime with someone else to show them the shelves in a food aisle, which were fully stocked, and while holding the phone with one hand would bump in front of other people just to grab stuff off the shelf while yelling spit into the air.

My opinion, and just an opinion as a suggestion for discussion and not arguing, is that stores should consider some kind of ban or deterrent against speaker phone use at least while we get through this. If a store wanted to take a Terry Tate approach to it all I'd be happy to spend my money there.",Portland,After what I saw in two grocery stores last night I think they should temp ban speaker phone and facetime calls in stores...

7767,7767,daddydicklooker,1585154392,fotgaw,Nan,"I'm currently employed at everyone's favorite local convenience chain and we've been deemed essential because we count as a ""grocery store"" 


Over the last few days of having to go into work and deal with the general public I have been astonished the lack of regard they seem to exhibit for my health, their own and everyone else's and I can't seem to figure out a reason that convenience stores are allowed to be opened I must say there's a gas station attached to them. 


There are people I will see three to four times a day everyday and it hasn't changed since the stay-at-home order has come into effect.


Trying to convince people to buy more than a single pack of cigarettes so that they don't have to stop by every day (or even multiple times a day because they're smoking more and they're bored) and then having them make light of the situation and telling me how lucky I am I get to be at work still and they're just cooped up at home is beyond infuriating. 


**Your desire to get out of the house should not supersede my safety though**. I feel like I'm putting my health at risk every day so that people can come in and buy a king size Reese's or make multiple trips to buy tall boys of beer rather than picking them up one at a time.


Realistically we sell alcohol, snacks, cigarettes and lotto. I get that these things can be comforting in a time of crisis. But all of these things are also sold at other stores that are actually essential and can be picked up when you're doing your **weekly** grocery shopping.  


If you're a regular customer that I still see everyday it tells me you care more about your snack/beer/smokes than you do about my health.


To make matters worse my work hasn't even announced any kind of sick time should we get this virus from having to continue to work or extra compensation for the risk that we're taking.  


I know that everyone is stressed and further inconveniences in this time only make it worse but please be considerate of the people that still must work with the public every day during this trying time.  If you could please adjust your buying habits to minimize contact with workers by making thoughtful purchases we really would appreciate it.",Portland,"Your buying habits of stopping in to the convenience store every day to pick up your energy drink, pack of smokes, tall boy and munchies needs to change."

7771,7771,kitesinskieslikepies,1585157102,fou9gu,Nan,"I’m a 30yo with an autoimmune disease. I’ve been debating going to the store for a few days, and since grocery delivery is now hard to come by, I braved it to Fred Meyer at Gateway this morning for the special shopping hour. I’ve pretty much run dry on everything I stocked up on weeks ago so this was a trip to stock up again so I can limit contact. 

It was... interesting. I want to warn any others in the same position of what to expect. 

When I walked up to the front at 7:01am, the lady loudly exclaimed *This is SENIOR SHOPPING ONLY... 60+... I mean... unless you have another issue*. It was kind of embarrassing and I felt immediately ostracized by the way she said it. I was so condescending. I told her I have an autoimmune disease and am at high risk according to my doctor. She smiled and then thanked me? So I grabbed the cart and moved inside... where people had apparently been there shopping for a while based on the amount of items in buggies. 

Most of the elderly folks in there weren’t taking it seriously at all and treated it like a personal shopping hour. One guy kept picking up all of the meat packages with his bare hands, reading everything on the back, and then setting them back in the displays. He didn’t even get any meat and had no buggy. I saw him walking around everywhere and he didn’t pick up anything to purchase, just touching and putting everything back. So many people where doing that.

A lot of people were just doing their normal, personal shopping of a few items and weren’t practicing a safe distance whatsoever. Store employees had buggies everywhere and were standing around in groups gossiping. No gloves or anything. The only person with gloves was the lady at the register. Not saying you have to wear gloves, but they weren’t taking *any* precautions. Seriously, I watched so many employees just stand around and chit chat with one another. Maybe at least don’t stand directly next to each other? 

They weren’t limiting how many people were inside. They only had 3 registers open with multiple people waiting closely to checkout. Self-checkout was open but it’s only useful if you only have a couple items. 

Less than half of the people in there seemed to be concerned about spreading the virus. It was scary to be honest. 

I started panicking while I was there so I just got as much as I could and left. I won’t be going back for a very long time because the virus is obviously spreading at the grocery stores with how lackadaisical a lot of people seemed. 

Since I’m not a senior, people game me dirty looks the entire time (even though I’m in a mask and gloves and very clearly trying not to get sick). It was really not cool to feel like that while just trying to get food and supplies and keep myself safe. 

Some of us have invisible illnesses and treat the special shopping hour seriously. It’s really sucky that some (a lot) of the elderly folks were just treating it like their own shopping time that they deserve absent the virus. 

This whole thing is scary but for the love of god STAY HOME unless necessary! It’s not the time to go get some 2 liters Diet Coke and that’s it. It’s not the time to get your home decor items. It’s not the time to get a few days worth of food and then keep going back to the store (unless you don’t have the funds which I understand). 

There was a **line** at the lottery machine ffs. This isn’t the time, folks! At the very least stay away from each other.

To be fair, I did see some elderly couples taking it seriously and I thank them so much. They seemed to have a list of things to get and grab in order to stock up. They had gloves and weren’t touching anything unless necessary. Please be like those people when you go out. 

Anyway, that was my experience today. It made me feel worse about how bad this is going to get in our community. Stay safe and **stay home unless necessary**.",Portland,My experience as an at-risk person during the early shopping hour at Fred Meyer.

So this company have been deemed essential, have signs posted for social distancing, but nothing is enforced and they are not protecting us employees working with the public. There’s not enough employees working to even cover for you to leave and wash yo ur hands, there’s certainly no gloves and running out of paper towels to wipe registers with. 


I am at risk and not seeing the benefits of continuing on with an employer that won’t qualify me for benefits anyway. If I’m not going to get benefits like a full time employee (even though I’ve been working full time hours) then I feel I should take a risk elsewhere for work.

If you have any needs, shoot me a PM and we can talk about what you'd like done and pricing(if you provide me with an estimate from a shop, I will do it for half if not less.)

We at Eternal Arts are going to be doing regular live streams of our classes for our students, and are inviting the larger community to join in. We figure this is a way we can give back to our community during these times and just want to help keep moving and meditating.

We will be live casting Mondays and Wendesdays with Kung Fu at 6PM and Tai Chi/Chi Gung at 7PM on our Facebook page:

You can find out more about our instructors, lineage and school on the Facebook page as well.

I hope everyone has a good day and stays healthy during these times!

Overall it was fun, although I wouldn't want to do it again. Right in front of the main entrance to the big showroom was what looked like a marble statue in between a pair of pillars with a couple speakers set up next to it. There was some operatic-type music playing and the statue began to oscillate whilst spouting water from her fingertips. She moved very convincingly and may have been a real person in some sort of elaborate costume. We watched her for some time until the music stopped and there was scattered applause. In our haze we were unable to determine if she was a robot or a person and also what the hell she was advertising if anything. Were you there? Do you remember this?

Multiple people in my building work as nurses and doctors...in addition, my mother is in the middle of a prep for a lung transplant, and my girlfriend has asthma;  By ""terse"" i mean that when they refused to break it up, I yelled down at them for 15 minutes until someone called the cops on us.

After the neighbors in the alley mocked disabled people and people with mental health issues, and one of them complained about not going to college  (I'm not joking), they threatened that they ""knew me from around the neighborhood"" and described my girlfriend (she visits on weekends). Super classy good times!

I went down to speak to the first officer and asked if they were enforcing shelter at home or breaking up groups in any way yet. I explained the group had been sharing open containers and cigarettes the last hour or so (and on previous days). The officer was unsure and said she was ""just waiting for her partner"". She went over to speak to the group.

When her partner arrived a couple minutes later, the officer joked with the group that they should hold off on the ""orgies"" and ""stay safe"", then they both left. 

The group started blasting music in celebration and TWO MORE of them came out of the dark (yes they were apparently lurking in the shadows like a goddamn warner bros cartoon, you can't make this up), so I caught up with the cops down the block.

Highlights: 

&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Institute analysis of 597,000 small businesses from February to October 2015 found that half of the companies held a cash buffer large enough to support 27 days of business. Half do not.   
&gt;  
&gt;Cash buffer days are the number of days that a business can continue paying its typical outflows — such as payroll, purchasing supplier, or loan repayment — without bringing in any money, in the form of things like revenue, tax rebates, or transfers from investors' or owners' private savings.   
&gt;  
&gt; The median number of cash buffer days across all small businesses was 27 days. And, a quarter of small businesses hold fewer than 13 cash buffer days in reserve.    
&gt;  
&gt; Some industries have less of a buffer than others. On median, restaurants only have 16 buffer days, in part because of how labor-intensive they are to operate. The lack of buffer is becoming a massive problem currently, as restaurants and bars are forced to stop serving customers due to the coronavirus outbreak, sparking fear that [many will close for good.](https://www.eater.com/2020/3/19/21185918/how-can-goverment-assistance-help-restaurants-actually-need-in-the-form-of-relief) 

I'm not defending these businesses in particular(or owners who are perceived as callous in some cases) but as a former small business owner myself I empathize with folks on both sides of this. During my 12 years as a business owner many people assumed I was rolling in cash and didn't pay more or offer more benefits because I was greedy or because the market didn't demand it. The truth is almost all of my friends who had regular day jobs were earning more than me. My overhead was relatively low so I probably could have survived 2 months or so without cash flow but that's it. 

A couple things to note: this is normal for small businesses. If you think a business should 100% have the ability to pay all its bills without cash flow or not be in business you may be right but most of the small business you enjoy wouldn't exist and we would live in a world of chains and conglomerates. Maybe that's the trade off. I also believe that's why most small businesses have a shelf life. Ever wonder why a place that is awesome and seems slammed might close? Fixed costs always go up and when the owner is over is suffering from burnout and can't afford a manager something has to give. And finally no one could have predicted this.",Portland,"For those wondering why some small businesses are struggling to pay their bills here's an informative article.

We know how deeply this delay is impacting you and your family during this extremely trying time and we are doing everything we can to get this nailed down next week and to get payroll into your accounts as quickly as we possibly can. If you receive a check in the mail, we ask that you please wait until at least Wednesday to cash it.

The weight is on our shoulders and we are doing everything we can to get you paid as quickly as possible and to keep the company afloat so that McMenamins is here for you when this pandemic is over.
 
If you know of anyone that did not receive this email, it is because we do not have their personal email contact. We will be calling employees for whom we do not have email addresses for.
 
Due to how quickly things are changing, we will continue to use email to reach out to everyone. Please also keep an eye on our main social media channels on Facebook and Instagram for when we will be reopening. We are currently closed throughout Oregon and Washington until at least April 16.

I've probably spent about 2 hours outside over the course of two weeks. Started feeling icky a couple days ago- cough, chest burning and tightness, all that good stuff they tell you on the CDC website. My employers health plan was not ACA compliant so I shopped for private insurance at the low low price of $300 a month at the beginning of the month before all this happened and plan will not be in effect until April 1st.....awesome. My options were limited. 211 referred me to virginia Garcia who referred me to providence's ER. Virginia cannot take any new patients for the virus and cant give tests to people who arent patients apparently. Providence said come in and they can take make the determination whether or not I qualify. 


Got to providence, nurses and doctors all dressed up as expected for pandemic. One person allowed in at a time in the lobby. Go up to the front and explain my symptoms, they give me a mask and run a thermometer all over my head. No fever. Super cool! Was given a pink slip and sent to a second lobby down a corridor. Staff cleaning the entire lobby, I get seen by a nurse who takes more information from me about symptoms behind a desk, dressed appropriately. She takes my ID and my insurance card and says she will try to get them to backbill my visit (awesome!). While she was talking to me, she mentioned that while they are expecting that the tests and visits will be free for people who are uninsured, they have no way of knowing right now. She wants to help people, but they can only do so much. I'm directed to sit and will be seen soon. There was only me and one other person there so that went fast. The lobby was empty and extremely quiet, which is very unusual I think for immediate care. Get called back 10 minutes later, chart updated, take vitals, etc. My blood pressure was very high which was unusual. The med tech mentions the doctor will be in soon. 


20 minutes later she comes. Go over symptoms a 3rd time. Takes additional vitals, lungs, etc. She explained that I didnt qualify for testing because I am not immunocompromised or elderly but I very likely have it. She let slip how they are only allowed to do so many tests a day so they have to pick and choose very carefully. I'm not surprised. Everything's fucked. I get a prescription for benzononate and albuterol to ease my coughing and breathing issues. Said to call the virtual desk if it gets worse before coming in. I tell her I've been getting worse over the last few days but I understand.  Had a little laugh about that. Discharged with some coupons so I only have to pay $40 for the meds. The office visit itself is another story....


So I'm waiting to get them from rite aid. The security guards arent letting people in who have the virus or show symptoms. My prescriptions are probably done so I'm going to attempt to get them.


Idk if anyone else has had to go thru if, I figured a write up from an uninsured person will help others try to find some guidance. The reason I held off was because of money, lack of insurance and no idea where to begin. There are options out there if you're scared or worried. They will do what they can to help. Hopefully this will help someone who feels as helpless as I felt. ❤

My name is Josiah. I'm a Bartender here in Portland. I've been working the last few years on my concept to open up a small owner-operated cocktail bar. I have everything together for it except for the funding part.

I got laid off from my full-time bar tending gig when the state closed down dine in restaurants and bars. As much as it sounds nice to sit around and watch Netflix during this time, my mind is obsessive &amp; I am passionate about this project, so I'm putting in a lot of work right now. 

I'm building a compact mobile cocktail cart that I can roll into different establishments (i.e. retail spaces, coffee shops, restaurants w/o alcohol) and run a small bar program for a couple of days using the OLCC's Temporary service license. It would give me proof of concept, exposure to my company, &amp; something to show potential investors. I think it might be a cool way to fill in unused space and time for a business as well and make a little extra money.

I was sent home after being exposed (in close proximity)to a woman who matched the description of a recent victim of covid19 in Clackamas county.

She was having trouble breathing. Trying to be pleasant, kept saying she felt dizzy and that her head and stomach hurt. Coughing sporadically. She was looking to get to Providence. I suggested she grab some fresh air at my time point since we had two minutes to kill before we could leave, and so I could distance myself from her since she refused to sit farther back. She could only stand 30 seconds of the wind before running inside saying it was too cold.

Sweating and swaying I kept asking if she was okay. Eventually I couldn’t take it anymore and asked if I could call medical for her, she complied. I parked my bus at 50th and Caruthers right in front of the Maverick apartment building. 

The emt shows up wearing an N95 mask while I sat there completely unprotected and unprepared for this pandemic. He asked her symptoms and she coughed the whole time, red eyes, said she wanted Providence. Initially I thought she said she was 59 but when he asked she said 69. Reading this morning’s announcement of a woman who passed away at Providence hospital being 69 gave me chills.

When they sent me home I was instructed not to enter the garage under any circumstance, “Just leave your pouch in the seat and exit the bus at the spotter shack” I was also told to make sure I was clear for work (from my pcp) for the next day.

I walked back to my car because I was so scared to infect anyone. I knew I had just been in very close proximity with a woman on her way out of this carnation for 20+ minutes. 

The advice nurse instructed me to take a shower and immediately strip my clothes off when entering into my home, as well as sanitize anything I touch between my car and the shower.

I continually think of every single action I made that day with tears running down my face absolutely terrified of infecting my kids.

So when my doctor asked me if I had any symptoms outside of this fucking cough I can’t shake, and cleared me for work, I immediately doubted the safety measures put into place to protect our society.

When my boss had no problems with me returning to work, and in fact asking me to work extra on my day off(because my doctor said I was good to go) I really sat back and watched the whole thing play out.

The longer we stay in service, the longer we refuse to look at this pandemic sweeping through our nation and the entire planet, the more people that will die.

Yesterday a friend of mine passed away. Dan Wilson served the city of Portland for 30+ years. Solid man. Good human. They said he had a heart attack and it wasn’t covid19 related.

I’d be interested to see what the results would be if they tested him in an autopsy. To tell the full truth of why we have been robbed of his beautiful life energy. To tell the full truth of the risks that every single one of the “essential employee” fleet will be taking to continually provide services.

Shut down your restaurants for takeout and delivery please?

We don’t need convenient stores if it’s life or death, I wanna know the employees are safe, Dutch Bro’s, Starbucks, Taco Bell and Wendy’s.

Shut it down!

I may very well be the last non-emergency personal that woman ever saw before she died and she walked onto my bus and said to me, “Honey I’m home!” She was trying to make light of her dark circumstance, and I didn’t hesitate to support her and make her feel valued. I didn’t shout at her to back up, I suggested she sit, I could tell she was ill and I asked her to create space so she could breath easier, I tried my best but I’m not heartless and if I can tell someone next to me is dying I’m not able to clearly measure 3-6 feet. Now my cough is getting worse, I woke up with a headache, my chest hurts, and I’m cold but hot. I was gonna wait until Saturday but I can’t, calling my doctor today.

I’m so sad that we are all here as a society, that we can’t prioritize the safety of the people who are forced to work over the financial implications of shutting down.

I am suggesting that we exercise a little extra caution before we decide to pet our neighbor’s outdoor cat or let our dog run free at the dog park or the grocery store. 

I love animals. I love dogs and cats. I own pets myself. Usually I don’t give a fuck when I see someone with their dog at the coffee shop or running around off leash but these are different times. 

The CDC warns against direct contact with pets when infected. Keep in mind not everyone who has been infected with the virus shows symptoms yet they are still contagious.

&gt;...people with COVID-19 and in-home isolation should be advised to limit interaction with household animals. Specifically, while a person infected with COVID-19 is symptomatic, they should maintain separation from household animals as they would with other household members, and avoid direct contact with pets, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, sleeping in the same location, and sharing food.

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/interim-guidance-managing-people-in-home-care-and-isolation-who-have-pets.html

While it’s a secondary means of transmission, the virus can live up to 72 hours on surfaces. Porous surfaces like animal fur make it more difficult to spread but a dog’s collar and tags would support the virus for longer. 

&gt;According to a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can live in the air and on surfaces between several hours and several days. The study found that the virus is viable for up to 72 hours on plastics, 48 hours on stainless steel, 24 hours on cardboard, and 4 hours on copper. It is also detectable in the air for three hours.

https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/03/20/sars-cov-2-survive-on-surfaces/

Here’s text from the AVMA cautioning about the spread of the virus. There are a lot of unknowns and lack of information and testing at this point because the pathogen is so new. 

&gt;Smooth (non-porous) surfaces (e.g., countertops, door knobs) transmit viruses better than porous materials (e.g., paper money, pet fur) because porous, especially fibrous, materials absorb and trap the pathogen (virus), making it harder to contract through simple touch.

&gt;Out of an abundance of caution, it is recommended that those ill with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus.

https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/covid-19

My father is 78. He’s in great health overall, but this virus could kill him at his age. Needless to say, he’s been spending a lot of time at home. Luckily I can call him every day and he has a great network of friends he can talk to. 

However, many older and elderly people do not have this. Many older people rely on church or other organizations to get their social interactions during the week. As we all know, those organizations cannot meet right now. That means many older people are being hit twice: **stuck indoors to avoid a virus that might kill them, while having to be isolated from any kind of community.** 

If you can - please call the older and elderly people in your life. It will do you and them a lot of good.

I always hear people drone on and on in Portland about community. But being a part of a community isn’t always self-actualization and feeling your feelings - it means you pitch in and help. This is one way you can do that. 

Thank you. Also, please wash your hands and stay home.",Portland,Please call the older and elderly people you know!

I filed my claim online on the 15th, when the system was really backed up and pages kept having those lovely ""timed out"" messages. But I was still able to file my claim and received the confirmation screen.

This past Sunday I filed my weekly status report and tried to follow all those rules to the T. I checked the box saying I was temp laid off. 

Got the letter in the mail today that I my claim is nonvalid due to a question regarding my availability as well as a question regarding School attendance. I have no clue what that means. Any insight?

I also received a letter titled ""wage and potential benefit report"". For some reason it is missing two quarters from my base year as well as one employer that I had during this time. Any idea what the issue is here?

I guess I am looking for some insight from people that have gone through this process before.

8178,8178,brenda_leigh_smith,1585404836,fqkx37,Nan,"I did my homework now that we have the retrospective-scope some. Long text, but hopefully an instructive read.

I put together a timeline for sentinel cases to community transmission for coronavirus in southern EU, Washington state, California and NYC.  Sources are: info I have collected from NYT, Guardian, Al Jazera and Wiki (lots, esp specific dates).  Interesting and instructive story. 

Take home messages: (A) all sentinel cases from Wuhan starting mid-late January, except NYC with sentinel case from Iran late February; (B) sentinel case in Rome was January 31 and &lt;3 weeks later, there was a soccer match in Bergamo vs Valencia (NE Coastal Spain) that involved &gt;40,000 fans and ~2,500 traveled from Spain (many thru Southern France) to the game - this is a perfect storm, later described as “The Bomb”. This event set the trajectory for northern Italy, Spain and southern France - perfect timing with virus incubation and infectious transmission (1-3 weeks) - thus absolutely overwhelming number of infections in northern Italy and, eventually, Spain and southern France (3) the sentinel case in Seattle was 10 days BEFORE the Wuhan tourists in Rome, but the exposure was sooooo much more limited, but it got into a senior home in Kirkland and they got hammered (by our standards) (4) Washington state infection was way more a hot spot than epidemic and epidemiological exposure tracing and quarantine could be done; (5) NYC sentinel case was Feb 25 (from Iran) and we are now about 4 weeks out from that......  It spread rapidly like in Northern Italy, but more due to permanent population density (25,000+ per square mile) than huge soccer gathering...... that’s the urban US model going forward 

Conclusions: (A) the situation and timing in Rome-Bergamo fit perfectly with this virus’ biology - ~2 week incubation time and asymptotic transmission - it really was “The Bomb”.  It set the stage for a humanitarian disaster - Italy and Spain are still setting record deaths/day, even now 7 weeks into the infectious process (almost 1000 deaths past 24 hr in Italy, Spain &gt;700) - those poor people got blind-sided very badly; (B) even though Seattle’s exposure was 10 days EARLIER than Italy’s, it was much more contained, but pretty quickly got into a senior home and took a toll - case follow-up etc has largely allowed for containment - we are in waiting at the med school; (c) NYC is less than 4 weeks out from their sentinel case and their population density of ~25,000 per square mile and the reality of asymptotic transmission is highly problematic in the absence of major societal constraints (lock down);(D) now, densely populated cities in US will follow NYC  - look out: New Orleans, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Detroit etc, esp if there is not lockdown; (E) social distancing works to reduce transmission (esp with the luxury of close epidemiological follow-up) and thus rural areas will be largely spared initially because they are distanced to start with, but their time will come with  sporting events, church groups, Boy Scout Troops and big families - the Mormons got religion on that right quick; (F) in the absence of a perfect testing environment (very tough in a global pandemic with a very novel virus - that’s a very big diagnostic pull, but it has been done in this, albeit delayed, and that’s very impressive) social distancing, self isolation and ridiculous degrees of hand washing are very effective.

Feb 19: Champions League soccer match in Bergamo - Atalanta vs Valencia (NE coastal Spain) - with 40,000 Italian fans and 2,500 Valencia fans attending [later characterized as “The Bomb”] - enormous, immediate infectious spread &lt;3 weeks after sentinel cases 

Feb 20: a man in Lombardy tests positive after previously leaving hospital without testing - likely he had early exposure to the Wuhan sentinel cases - volumes will be written on him. 

France lies between Valencia and Bergamo - lots of thru travel - thus, the high # cases in France

Early March: In Spain, Valencia players, fans and sports journalists fall ill  - the beginning in Spain 

Early March: Unusually nice early spring in Spain in late Feb and early March with lots of social activity at cafes etc - the virus spreads strongly in Spain 

March 8: thousands gather for Int'l Women's Day in Madrid - many, many infectious people march together and most are not symptomatic. 

March 11: 3,000 Madrid fans flew to Liverpool for another Champions League soccer game - the virus moves to the UK - here comes Boris. ....

My question is: How is the job market for teachers in Portland? I’ve read some older posts about how they were making big cuts in the district, so becoming a new hire there was not easy. Because my husband and I are looking to both go into teaching, we are a little concerned about this. Also, we have a good amount in savings, but are also wondering if it is even realistic to try to live in Portland on a dual-teacher combined income.

Our other plan of action is moving to Salem, where we grew up. I imagine it might be less competitive there, but we are really attracted to the idea of living in/near the city. 

Any firsthand experience being a teacher (elementary, sped) in Portland? Any insight at all is appreciated. Thanks for your time.",Portland,Teaching in Portland?

Could it be done?  If there were a restaurant, say, that could effectively enforce the 6 foot rule among each group of customers, where each group is limited to people in the same household, and take the precautions necessary to limit each group's 'sphere of influence' inside the restaurant as much as possible and then to disinfect everything a group had contact with before the next group was brought in, would that restaurant be a significant contributor to the spread of covid and thus socially unwelcome, or could we socially engineer this problem and come up with a workable solution?

I think places where people come together and connect *in the flesh* are as important now as they ever were for a healthy community, as paradoxical as that may sound in the midst of a viral epidemic.

I would like to please ask anyone who sees this to be patient if your orders get delayed or cancelled on short notice. I am a store supervisor at one of the stores that provides delivery/drive up service. There have been call outs in the delivery/drive up departments and I’ve had to call people who proceed to scream at me that they placed their order a week ago and I’m a piece of shit for not calling them earlier. I just get handed a list of orders and am told to call, I am a messenger who is trying to juggle the actual, physical store/people shopping in it and deal with the online store that I have no formal training with. I had a lady tell me I deserve to die because her order for wine and chips had to be cancelled because the people who usually pick the afternoon orders called out with 20 minutes notice. The folks who do show up end up working 15 hour days to fulfill as many orders as possible. We are training people as fast as we can and doing the best we can.

Please remember that the people picking out your groceries ARE PEOPLE and they get sick/burned out, too. We’ve been slammed in the grocery business since before the official announcement of this situation and while there are some people who are appreciative, there are still the same jerks that will treat us like less than dirt. I don’t need people saying thank you to me, I need people to stop coming in to the store for small purchases (when possible) and ESPECIALLY older folks who come in for one thing multiple times a day.

On a side note, we are not sending paper products through delivery service or drive up and go because it’s first come, first serve at this point. I can only confirm this for Lloyd Safeway, not others.

To make things quickly, the design should follow the KISS philosophy - no complications, simple to repair on the field, uses off-the-shelf generic components so we are not tied to any specific vendor. Where applicable, we will use an AVL for critical components such as the pumps/valves.

Here is a KISS product specification:

* Can be built using a cheap hand truck as the mechanical chassis (such as the $35 one’s available at Harbor Freight), and use a 12V battery the dead weight.
* Uses one pressure pump, and one input filter which is washable.
* Can service 2 (or more?) patients at a time with individual pressure valves to each output (this may contradict the KISS philosophy). The motor pressure is set to the higher of the two outputs, and the second valve ""leaks"" to adjust to the 2nd patient's lower requirement.
* Works on 12V input (so can be powered from an AC adaptor) or a car lighter, or just a 12V car or UPS battery. (Diode-OR all power input options).
* The control circuit and motor &amp; valve power electronics can be built on a single PCB. Simple control uses potentiometers.
* Each pressure valve is controlled by an analog PID circuit. Simple approach, not a PhD. project. Maybe this doesn't give us a gamut of options, ok, no big deal.
* From my very recent discussions, a couple of PCB fabrication vendors have been classified as essential services (one in WA and one in CA).

Personal experience: designed several products in the past 25+ years, worked with overseas and local vendors, currently manage a small team of engineers for a living.

I was hoping anyone with any *knowledge (read:* ***not*** ***assumptions)*** on the matter could share with us here so there can be a reliable spot for Portlanders/Oregonians to go for this sort of thing. I imagine that someone will end up speaking with someone at the unemployment office before they release any concrete information on this stuff, and it would be great if anyone that does manage to get through to them could update up here as to what they hear. I hope for everyone struggling financially right now that this process is as smooth as possible and provides some sort of way out of the interminable worry.

So far as I know, our systems in Oregon won't accept self-employed workers yet. I know the bill remarks that states need to sign up with the federal government to take part in the (Section 2102/2107) Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Assistance. How long this will take, I have no idea. If I find anything about a potential timeline in the coming days, I'll update here.

There are also a few emergency declarations of Kate Brown's regarding unemployment benefits and qualifications posted there. 

Lastly, contacts that you may want to reach out to if you have the time. The fact that no information is being put out by Oregon regarding self-employed/gig workers is unacceptable. Maybe a few inquiries it would prompt them to consider it.

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

8367,8367,pdxCaregiverInCrisis,1585538953,frjfdg,Nan,"For the past 10 months, I've been a  fulltime caregiver for an elderly gentleman who would be considered in the highest risk group for COVID-19.  He has been hospitalized in the past for both pneumonia and the flu,  and uses a nebulizer for severe asthma.  As this pandemic developed, I became more and more petrified that I would become the ""weak link"" in the team and inadvertently carry the virus to him, which would most certainly be fatal, statistically.   Living in a busy house with several roommates and up until 10 days ago,  coming and going Airbnb travelers, I didn't know how I was going to maintain social distance while sharing a bathroom and kitchen with up to 6 people.  So after thinking about it for all of a couple days, I plunked down the last of my savings to live in a private space, with my own bathroom, kitchen, and laundry, and even offered to bring my client's laundry there at no charge so that we wouldn't be risking his laundry being contaminated in the communal laundry room in his subsidized housing building.

   So all day Sunday and Monday I moved everything I own, (AGAIN) and then I showed up to work on Tuesday,  texting the person that I'm relieving, so that she can let me in and I can avoid touching the outside lockbox with an entry fob and then putting it back etc, basically trying to save a pair of gloves....

Well, she lets me in by touching the press bar with her bare hands, and when we get back into the client's building, and I remind her to wash her hands, because I had just seen her do that, she flat out REFUSED, saying, ""I'm not doing that. I'm not afraid of a door.""  I replied that the virus can live on surfaces for days.  She answers that she will wash her hands before touching the client, or before touching food, but that she's ""not changing her life over this."" When I tell you guys that I was shaking with rage and adrenaline for hours, I'm not exaggerating.  Imagine turning your whole life upside down to try to protect someone, and then have another person tell you that 20 seconds effort is too much to try to keep him alive, WHILE THEY ARE GETTING PAID!!!

So then I emailed my supervisor, and her supervisor, and so on, demanding that she be removed from his environment immediately.  In a day and age when people are being arrested and charged with domestic terrorism for licking a stick of deodorant in Walmart, someone who is deliberately risking the life of the person they are supposed to be caring for is even more criminally negligent.  In addition, I had reported her two weeks ago for not taking the pandemic seriously: Saying  ""The flu is more deadly and then arguing with cdc facts...  And I reported her 8 months ago for poor hygiene and sanitary practices.  In all cases, nothing happened.  

   So my employer responded that they are not prepared to terminate someone's employment without due diligence and fact- finding, and my response to them is that when there's an officer-involved shooting or a doctor accused of serious malpractice, that individual is removed from duty, pending investigation, in theory, to protect vulnerable populations like my client.  They stood their ground.  

I responded that I did not feel safe reporting for duty, nor did I feel my client's safety was being taken into account and as such, could not report to work with a clear conscience...

Am I insane?  On Monday I was handing over every penny to my name for a safer space, given my responsibilities, and on Friday I was refusing to go to work and possibly also endangering my healthcare. (I'm no spring chicken myself and have my own health concerns, which makes it even more infuriating)

But honestly, I can't walk away.  My mom was a nurse who walked off a good paying job more than once rather than sign off on paperwork that lied about how many nurses were really on to save the company money and skimp on care... 

So I'm ready to call  both OSHA for workplace safety and DHS for elder abuse and also considering a protest (socially distant of course) with signs like: ""Don't be a slob, Just do your job!"" and "" Wash your hands and save a man!""

I'm hoping that they come to their senses in the morning, but if not, I'm ready to go nuclear and pull the trigger and make their week full of news reporters calling on them to defend the indefensible during these drastic times. They are also not savvy enough to hide their employee list on bulk emails, so I could possibly use that as a source of support.  

 So I'm wondering, how much support would Portlanders give, hearing about this?  Would you write a letter, make a call, attend a (spread out) protest, anything?  Again, I know a lot of people are feeling insane right now, but I absolutely feel like I'm in Bizarro World. What caregiver refuses to wash their hands during a plague, and what kind of employer defends that?

An inside person has ""told me"" that Legacy hospitals finally have their own in house Covid-19 lab test and can do them without the OHA saying it is ok now.  So no longer do they have to call the OHA, confirm the patient is about to die and be admitted, and then order the test.  If you have Covid-19 symptoms and present to a Legacy hospital, you can finally be tested.  Now, results still take 2-3 days, which is frustrating, but at least we can finally get an accurate numbers on our local infections.  Obviously, you cant just show up and say, hey I feel find but I want a test, but if you have symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, nasal congestions, or overall fatigue, you are likely able to be tested now.  Bonus points if someone you have been around has been sick with similar symptoms, you have traveled to other Covid-19 hot spots, or have been around someone with a confirmed Covid-19 infection.  

This is especially helpful for those that are older or otherwise immunocompromised.

Up until 2-3 days ago, patients that weren't sick enough to be admitted weren't able to be tested, so our numbers of positive Covid-19 cases has been falsely low, but now we can finally see how wide spread this disease is, and try and treat those that need it.",Portland,Legacy Hospitals Are Now Testing for Covid 19

Threads keep getting deleted when people realize they’re wrong, and it makes me mad when I put a bunch of effort into defending teachers. 

So here you go, just a lil slice of what I, a PPS elementary teacher, did today. It’s certainly not everything, but I’m trying here.

7:00 AM to RIGHT NOW

Woke up and immediately began reading r/teachers looking for ideas.

Visited and read a ton of articles and sites about remote teaching tools and experiences.

Had a remote staff meeting with 35+ teachers and admin about how to access all the trainings the district wants us to do.

Talked in the meetings about how to start contacting all our families and directing them to resources if they need them (we’re social workers too, ya know).

Talked about how teachers are already using remote tech to teach new concepts and review older ones with students.

Identified support teams for teachers who need help navigating remote learning.

Had another meeting with 5 of my grade level colleagues to teach them how to use google hangouts, classroom, etc etc. 

Discussed how we are going to work together to provide our students with a cohesive learning plan for our respective grade levels.

Posted three assignments on google classroom for kids to tell me about their break, draw together, chat with each other for social time. Basically testing their competence with google classroom.

Responded via comments to the 5 or so kids that sent me notes about their breaks.

Emailed all my families with information about what we’re planning moving forward and how to access our classroom online.

Responded to a ton of parent emails requesting I give them their student’s log in information.

Downloaded all the log ins for the MANY sites we use and created a folder to hold the info parents are constantly asking from me.

Linked the resources we regularly use on our google classroom for (presumably) easy access.

Started around 3 accounts with science, social studies, and reading sites that are giving free access to teachers right now.

Played with those sites for over an hour trying to figure out how to get them to integrate with my google classroom or create assignments within the site.

Talked to a coworker who needed help creating a google meet for a meeting with a family with special needs.

Talked to the sped teacher about how to move forward with remote IEP meetings.

Began planning what kinds of videos I can make and upload for my kids (read alouds for one).

Began scheduling google meet slots/sign ups for students to come and chat with me next week when they have access.

Began to schedule the digital programs we use to follow the schedule of learning standards the district asks us to follow.  Scheduled what standards we will look at each week and brainstormed what kinds of activities I could modify to work remotely.

Thought long and hard about how much time most of my students could realistically access content.

Created a google form asking families to tell me directly what specific help they need and to give parental input into what they’d like to see moving forward (probably my biggest mistake today). Sent that out.

I dont know if that's going to be a viable source this year.

Indeed, I've been to 3 garden supply stores and a few stores like home depot and fred meyer. Everyone is short on seeds. I spoke with one nursery owner who can't find help to get veggie seeds planted (he sells starts).

I'm laid off of work, and will go insane if I'm not productive...so, I'm considering helping people install vegetable gardens as a side hustle.. 

OR... (even better) what if I could crowd source an unused greenhouse  to get some thousands of veggies started to either sell at cost, or to distribute for free once the starts are viable... note, I want to equip people to grow their own, so I envision growing until plants are just a few inches tall.

I dont really have any money to throw at it, nor the land to do it... what I'm considering doing is to crowdsource labor and finances. I'm just posting this to gauge interest.

Heres me: I have a few shovels, a small truck and trailer, a kick ass work ethic, and a love for playing in the dirt. I'm a very amateur gardener, and if this turned into a community thing, I'd almost certainly want advice and help on doing it right... maybe from a seasoned gardener or landscaping company. About 50% of my gardening attempts are failures.... so... I'd want to take a back seat on deciding how to plant/irrigate, etc. 

An obvious concern is adhering to social distancing, health code, etc. That may make this more challenging to pull off.

My wife and I need some help, or at least some answers/solidarity that we aren't alone.
My wife was laid off from her work last week, final day was Friday March 23. Both she and her friend, who also worked at the same non-profit applied for unemployment that day. Her friend heard back from the unemployment office that same day saying she was approved and how much she would get, however my partner still hasn't heard anything back and every time we check her application it just says ""No valid claim found"", which I understand as just meaning that it's still being processed. (Is that correct?). She received the confirmation number so we're sure the application went through.

My question is, why did her friend get approved same day but my wife is now on day four with no word? And what can/is there anything we can do? As most people know by now, calling unemployment isn't helpful as the lines are almost always busy. Is this something we just need to wait out?

8566,8566,Questionsquestionsth,1585680270,fsilw5,Nan,"Hi guys!

I want to preface this by saying I clearly do not work for the unemployment office, I am not a specialist, and these answers may vary/change. Please keep that in mind, and process them accordingly.


However, I keep seeing the same few questions asked about unemployment, and figured after spending so much time just trying to get through/on hold, I'd post the answers I received after speaking to a specialist today, in hopes of saving you some anxiety/endless calling/another text post.
Again, I am not a specialist, I do not have all the answers, and this is just what one representative told me - however, if it saves you time endlessly redialing the office just to be told the same basic answer, that's something! 



**I keep calling, and it just gives me the busy tone! This has happened 100+ times! What do I do?**


Well, you have two options. 

You can keep dialing and trying to get on hold - I spent a collective total of around 17 hours spread over about a week, 8,000+ individual dials, and eventually 2 hours on actual hold to get through - or you can give it some time and wait.


It depends on why you're calling.


If you are simply calling about the fact that you aren't showing as a valid claim in the system, but you received a claim number and have been submitting your weeklys, I would wait - until it has been a month+ with no communication from UI, I wouldn't waste your time trying to get through.
 When you're seeing this message in your status checks, it simply means you haven't been processed yet, and they won't be able to do anything about that for you just because you call in.


However, if you need to update information, something you submitted was incorrect/missing, you can't apply online, or any other problem *not* relating to ""not a valid claim"" worries, I would call in and see what they can do.


**So, if I keep seeing that I ""don't have a valid claim"" I'm okay? Really?**

In theory, yes.

 I am not a claims specialist, so don't take my word as gold, but from what they told me, this simply means you're still processing/haven't been processed. 
You still need to file your weekly claims - go in and check the status of those a bit after you've done so to make sure they go through, it'll still tell you if that has been submitted or not, and you want to make sure you do this or you will not receive benefits for those weeks.
If you received a claim number, you have a valid claim.


Processing time right now is up in the air. I was told to expect a few weeks, but there is no ""perfect estimate"" right now. She said to call if it's been a month or more, but to expect to be told that they're just behind even then. They're adding more workers all the time, and trying their best.


You *will* eventually receive communication. Whether that's a letter about your approval/benefits amount, something requesting clarification/more information, or regarding a denial, you *will* receive something *eventually.* Make sure your address is accurate, keep an eye on your mail, and *keep filing weekly.*


They are trying for a 1-3 week turn around on processing, but they just aren't really consistent right now.


**Are there any delays in payments?**

I was told no. Once you're approved, those payments won't be delayed, and you'll also receive the ""back pay"" for weeks you claimed where you weren't yet processed.


She said that the waiting week still applies right now, but that may change, and that she wasn't 100% sure how the additional $600 would be handled yet, but that they would update the website as information came in with the most accurate details.


**So, what should self employed, gig workers, or the new categories who can apply do?** 


The specialist basically said that there's a lot of trial and error going on with that right now.


Absolutely apply, and fill out the form to the best of your ability taking into account the fact that it has not been updated for these new categories. 
Try your best to do this online, if you can, only calling in if the system does not allow you to complete the application, or you're struggling to come up with the proper information - but be prepared for crazy hold times!
They are keeping that fact in mind when processing the forms, and will reach out for more information if things need to be clarified. I wish I could give more information on this, but she didn't really have a ton herself. 


She said that they're expecting people to just fill the applications out to the best of their ability right now, knowing full well things may not be properly detailed due to the limitations of the app.


For example, she said, ""If you've been doing Lyft for the last year, put Lyft down as your employer, fill out the self-employed bits as they are relevant to you, and we will connect the dots when processing or reach out for you to clarify."" 
She said she has seen plenty of applications already where people are either filling it out as though they are self employed, or where they're putting gig work as an employer, and neither is necessarily the ""wrong"" way of doing it, as long as the information is accurate and truthful, and you clarify as much as you can in the fields provided.


The unfortunate fact is that right now there is no communicated, 100% perfect way of doing it, and it does leave a lot of room for error and confusion. They are aware of this, they know we're doing our best, and they are doing theirs to try and get those things processed considering all the variables.


Anyway - I know that's not a lot of information, but these are the few questions I keep seeing posted time and time again, and hopefully this saves someone a bit of hassle. I'm happy to answer any questions anyone may have to the best of my ability based off the knowledge I *do* have - I spent a great deal of time speaking with the specialist - but again, I am *not* a specialist, and should not be treated as one.
Hopefully they will release a bit more information and have some more transparent communication soon, but until we hear from an *actual* employee or see *actual* posted instructions on a lot of these things, we just need to wing it the best we can, *be patient,* and keep claiming each week.

I have a small business, we unfortunately are shut down for some time, we have had a few staff members be temporarily laid off until we return back to normal so that they can claim UE. I have 2 staff members who are still working but part time. From 36-38 hours down to 16-20. I would have loved to be able to continue to pay my staff, they are like family, but this was our only course of action to prevent permanent closure (yes I know about the EIDL and 7a PPP loan and will be using those but with no cash flow in this moment I can’t ask staff to work without money to pay them right now. I have not been paid for over a month and will continue to not take pay until everyone on my full staff is back to work, I am not trying to cut hours for staff so I can keep getting paid). 

So my question is can I have my two staff members who are now working reduced hours apply for partial unemployment so subsidize their reduced incomes? I am trying to find the best way to do right by them, and this seems like maybe an option to allow them to keep working part time, they are essential, but also get a little supplemental help from UE. Are there reasons they would or would not qualify to get partial UE? Any insight on this would be incredibly helpful! Thanks.",Portland,Partial unemployment question

• Lockdown (Stay home).

• Asymptomatic (the virus is strong and you can be sick before a fever so stay home as much as possible to stop the spread).

\------------------

In case you haven't seen these posts yet, I host these events called Skip the Small Talks where I put strangers in a room and get them talking to each other about more meaningful and interesting stuff than social norms generally allow. My background is in social and clinical psychology research, so my approach is informed by the literature on self-disclosure, question-asking, game theory, and some other stuff that I can nerd out about in person if you end up coming to the event and are interested in hearing me ramble for a while. But basically, we use cards with questions written on them and a lot of structure to allow people to open up to strangers more comfortably and quickly than you might usually.

People have reported finding Skip the Small Talks useful for meeting new people, for becoming more comfortable in social situations outside of Skip the Small Talk, and for interacting with humans in a low-effort context. Some Redditors said some nice stuff about us [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/b0146n/experience_with_skip_the_small_talk/) if you want to check out other people's take on it.

You can check out all our events [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/skip-the-small-talk-10841599652) and you if you want to keep up with our events, you can sign up for our e-mail list [here](https://www.skipthesmalltalk.org/) (I don't spam, I don't share your e-mail address with anyone, and I really genuinely do hope you'll let me know if the e-mails ever start getting annoying).

We are grateful that you have trusted us to provide for your housing needs and we want to do what we can to help you make it through this financial disruption.

The owners have given their blessing so we may reasonably help you remain in your home as a KBC Management resident.

Based upon the information you have provided to us we will provide you with temporary flexibility by modifying your payment obligations.  Note that this is a deferral, not forgiveness, of some of the rent and other payments as they come due.

Specifically, we agree to the following temporary payment arrangement:

One-half by April 15th; Balance by April 30th; Waiver of any late fees

Failure to comply with this temporary payment arrangement is a material breach of your Lease Agreement and will be treated as such per the default terms of your Lease.

The project I was working on was wrapping up in a month anyways so I was likely going to be laid off then, but now they're asking that I continue to work while furloughed and collect unemployment and in exchange basically they'll pay my health insurance and other benefits. To me that sounds like I'm getting fucked and working for free and now healthcare is being dangled over me.      
I made a decent amount of money before, I'm an engineer, and I've saved enough to last me a few months most likely. From looking at estimates my income will be cut into a third of what it was before effectively as I was barely working during school, I graduated in June and started working in July.    
Is it even legal to work while furloughed? That seems like unemployment exploitation/fraud, but I figured I'd ask in case anyone knows before I talk to the unemployment office tomorrow (if I even can).   
If I get laid off and lose my health insurance, how does applying for health insurance work? I assume OHP would base it off of my previous few months of income but I'm not sure if that applies if you're unemployed.

Now I’m just all sorts of confused. I have too much of one, and not enough of another. I’m imbalanced. But, I also know it’s short term. I keep hearing Mr Miyagi in my head. “Up, down, Uuup, Dowwn.” Those  are my emotions. And I know I’m not alone. 

So, here’s to painting the fence (metaphorically speaking). We will all be masters at fence painting in the not too distant future. I strongly believe this. We will all continue to learn how to rebalance ourselves. This has not been the first time, nor the last.

Thank you, yet again, for your wise words, Mr. Miyagi. Somehow hearing in my head, “Up, down, Uuup, Dowwn” is very soothing at the moment, and makes me smile.",Portland,"“Daniel Son, paint the fence. Up, down...Uuup, Dowwn.” We will all become masters."

My mom used to drive down NE Fremont to Emanuel hospital as nurse. Most people wouldn’t even drive that street back then. She had no fear, and made lots of friends along the way. Shit, if you showed up as a white person to play basketball at Irving Park, you had best know a player. N Vancouver, N Williams, Mississippi Ave...please believe, most of you would never recognize your street in 1994.

I just posted something in hopes to encourage everyone during these trying times. I immediately received backlash, and it made me incredibly sad. Apparently I said everything incorrectly while attempting to instill some form of hope. Goodness, when has an attempt at being kind become so wrong?

This is not the Portland I know. This is not the Portland who reaches out to the community as I used to know it (regardless of our past faults). All cities, communities, families, individuals have their demons.  However, I am utterly confused, and more importantly, saddened by the display of utter selfishness this city has become.

It is not a time to prove what you have, or don’t have. This is NOT the time to say your situation is worse than the other. THIS is the time to lay all indifferences aside and be a pillar of strength as a city, community, and individual to rise against all that inhibits us from being the best we can be. Simply put, we need to be here for each other in any capacity we can. That’s it. Super fucking simple, really.

If you are unwilling to do that, and only focus on yourself, so be it. But, that is not the city I was raised in. Let’s go back to our roots.

Sure, keep Portland weird. But for fucks sake, keep Portland real as well. The moment we lose that is the moment we lose our city. I fear it is already lost in our neighborhoods, and that makes this gal really sad. But, I also have high aspersions. I believe we can be kind, and weird, all at the same time.

I need to guide/lead/manage at least 3 people in doing something positive for the community. Fortunately, now is a both a challenging (but also fantastic time to do it) because there are so many people in need, but we are still being asked to stay home and keep social distancing in mind. 

I wanted to start by asking the community what they need most. I could do all sorts of projects like a canned food drive, a clothing drive, helping seniors grocery shop, supporting doctors and nurses with meals while working, donating supplies to elementary school kids who are stuck at home, tutoring people remotely, etc etc... but I feel as though some of these efforts will be much more meaningful and impactful if I actually know what the community needs most - coming directly from our community members and not just my thought of “what I think people need”

I have a pretty strong idea of who needs what right now, but I know that there’s a good chance I may miss important details that could result in a huge opportunity to help certain groups of people who are potentially overlooked or most in need. 

So, I was wondering if anyone wanted to suggest things they’ve noticed people need most right now. Is it diapers? Canned goods? Help with daily tasks and grocery shopping? Straight up money from donations to help pay for everything/bills/rent? Fresh fruits and veggies? Tutoring help? Toys for kids to play with while quarantined at home? Mental health support? Someone to talk to? Other areas I am missing? 

Also if anyone would like to be one of the three people that I lead in my community betterment leadership project, please let me know and I would be happy to talk about that too. Potentially this could end up working out remotely too - as to minimize risks for everyone.

So we traded it in and got a new vehicle but now we have to fight for the repair costs plus the depreciated trade in value I got (another 4K lost). We are working on a certified letter for the “good faith” attempt to collect but the rest of the process is giving me a lot of anxiety 😭

8731,8731,the_jowo,1585779696,fta175,Nan,"Dear Mr....
Thank you so much for contacting me about the difficulty you are having getting through to the State of Oregon Employment office. I have been hearing from many people who are in the same situation as you, and I know it's extremely frustrating.

As part of the CARES Act that Congress passed last week, we included over $1 billion dollars to help every state handle the overwhelming demand they are now experiencing due to coronavirus layoffs and furloughs. This includes money for increased unemployment benefits and more money for running the state unemployment programs.

The Employment Department is run by the State of Oregon, not the federal government. Oregon has entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor for additional resources, but unfortunately my ability to get them to change protocols or procedures is extremely limited. Having said that, my office has had several conversations with the senior leadership at the Oregon Employment Department to try and help get things moving. They informed me that one of the problems is that they are still using mainframe computers that are decades old, making it more difficult to reprogram for the changes in the CARES Act.

Also, as of today, the Trump Administration has not given guidance about how state departments should administer the CARES Act. Oregon and every other state must wait until that happens to start processing the extra $600 per week that will be added to unemployment benefits and provide unemployment insurance to the additional people who now qualify, like independent contractors and gig economy workers. I am continuing to press the US Department of Labor to issue that guidance immediately because people need that money NOW.

I know that time is of the essence. I will continue to do everything I can to try to make this happen right away. In the meantime, I am also developing information and resources for people about benefits that are available and how to access them. You can get more information here: https://blumenauer.house.gov/covid-19-economic-stabilization-resources.
Sincerely,
Congressman Earl Blumenauer

I get that you just are walking around the block, and your front porch is your new office, so it all makes sense to you. I feel where you're at. 

I know you realize I'm trying to stay 6' or more away from you. I'm like almost 3 weeks in on this ""Together alone, alone together"" shit and I really want it to work out for all of us. 

Can you please just put your dog on a leash? The neighborhood may feel different, but it's not actually your personal backyard. I've seen a lot of ""cool Dads"" with dogs 20' in front or behind them wandering the hood recently, and it's frankly just really self absorbed at best.

Just a few, of many, reasons why you should consider using a leash:  


1. Your dog may be super well behaved, doesn't mean everyone else's is. What happens when someone else's angry doggo on leash meets your wandering dog? All you are bringing to the table is a hopeful whistle. You're willing to bet your dogs life on that? If these dogs get in a fight and someone person gets bitten, the vet may want to test your dogs brain for rabies. Just to be clear, yeah they kill your dog to get to its brains for that test. 
2. Cats.
3. Squirrels.
4. Toddlers.
5. You may be the cool dog owner who knows everything is chill, but that person walking across the street might have been attacked by a dog years ago and is scared shitless when your pooch comes running around the corner 20' in front of you. 
6. Your dog just took a shit on your neighbor's tree lawn. You didn't notice cause you were half a block ahead and talking to your S/O. Strangely you didn't seem to be carrying any poop bags, so I guess that's lucky!
7. Cars are so big and fast. Dogs typically lose in those battles. That sure is going to be a downer for everyone. 
8. Not everyone loves dogs, and it's not actually important that you teach them to. 
9. **If your dog is really so well behaved, why are they not able to walk on a leash???**

That it would be too boring and mundane, just driving in circles all day and handing out tickets. Deke’s blog changed my mind about all of that.

The way he writes about the drive itself—the sounds and smells and people. The beautiful parts of the city that he rolls through and the corners of town that he wouldn’t otherwise visit. The interactions with Portland characters and his telling of an inner monologue while navigating a beast of a vehicle through the narrow streets. This is what made me finally want to experience these things.  He helped me realize that this job is so much more than just driving a bus. He also was a motivation for me to write about *my* job.

I’m trying to learn to do some basic NFC programming for a personal project using NFC stickers. In order to program the stickers, I need to use an android device which I unfortunately do not own.

The device can be as close to obsolete as possible, I just need the nfc capabilities to work, the screen to work, and for the device to turn on from what I understand :)

If you have one laying around that you’d like to sell, let me know! I’m also happy to borrow and return the device after a few days if anyone may have one that they’d be willing to loan out for a week or so. I can facilitate no-contact pickups, of course. I’m located in SE around 60th and Holgate.

1. Show up on time. I know this may be hard to fathom for some it seems, but just because the airport is very slow and basically dead all the time, does not mean flights are changing their times to fit your needs, even if you are only one of 6 people flying to Fresno on a Monday morning. The jetway doors close 15 minutes before departure, so showing up to the airport at least 45 minutes to an hour early is highly recommended. 

2. We only have one security check point open. All passengers are being screened through the D/E check point on the north side of the terminal. ALL PASSENGERS MUST GO THROUGH THIS SECURITY. The B/C gates are accessible through the connecting hallway from D/E to B/C. Please allow extra time to get to your gate if you are traveling out of B/C gates (Alaska, Southwest, and American respectively). 

3. Shops/restaurants are closed here too. Yup, coffee shops, mini marts, and restaurants are closed at PDX too due to the recent announcements by Gov Brown. There are still a few select mini marts open both pre and post security, but options are very limited for food and drink. I’d suggest if you need a lunch before your flight, bring one from home. Solid foods (such as sandwiches) CAN go through security. Pack accordingly, and you’ll be set.

4. Alaska Airlines no longer is offering in-flight services, such as drinks and food (on flights less than 3 hours). Just a heads up for you Alaska Airlines flyers, that we no longer are offering these services. Feel free to pick up something to eat BEFORE your flight so you’re not blind-sided by the lack of availability on board. 

5. Last but most importantly, please have a good attitude. Airline workers, TSA, and everyone else here at PDX is just as stressed as you. We all are worried about our jobs, our income, and our way of life. Screaming at us about missing a flight or having to walk the extra 1000 feet to go through the other security just makes life even shittier for us. So please have some patience with us as we deal with less staffing, more irate customers, and other obscurities that continue to pop up day to day.

Thank you for your cooperation in making PDX a safe, easy travel experience for all. 

PS, for those of you who need to hear this, NO WE DID NOT CANCEL YOUR FLIGHT JUST TO SPITE YOU. Yes we get accused of doing this on a daily. Jesus Christ some people...",Portland,PSA about flying in/out of PDX during these uncertain times.

First and foremost, we just want to say thank you to everyone who is contributing to the frontline efforts during the COVID-19 outbreak. We also want to acknowledge everyone who’s practicing social distancing, and doing their part to help the community at large. We’re here because we, too, would like to help.

In response to the current COVID-19 outbreak, our team has worked tirelessly to bring forth our next iteration of virtual healthcare: VideoCare™—an easy, affordable way to connect with a ZOOM+Care provider in-person, from the comfort of your home.

Virtual healthcare plays a critical role during the COVID-19 outbreak: connecting you with a doctor, while keeping you both at a safe distance. VideoCare™ elevates virtual care to a more personal and comprehensive level, allowing our doctors to identify, diagnose, and examine the visible signs of injury and illness. Plus, a friendly face never hurts.

Once you schedule, you’ll receive a confirmation text and a notification when your video visit is ready to start. A ZOOM+Care provider will discuss your concerns and offer a diagnosis, treatment, and even prescribe medications–or refer you to an in-clinic visit if further evaluation is needed.

Really, above all else, we want to make life less strenuous for anyone seeking care during these unprecedented times. Please reach out to us on social media if you have any questions or simply want to say hello. Stay safe, healthy, and at a distance.  


Sincerely,

ZOOM+Care

From Chloe Eudaly's Facebook post yesterday:

""Earlier today, Portland City Council signed this letter urging our state and federal elected officials to forgive all rent and mortgage payments for renters and businesses whose income or expenses have been substantially impacted by COVID-19. I am grateful to Governor Kate Brown for announcing a commercial eviction moratorium this afternoon—this action will provide some relief and help ensure that the small businesses we know and love can have a fighting chance to stay where they are throughout the COVID-19 crisis. But we need to do more. We need forgiveness of all rent and mortgage payments for renters and businesses for the duration of the crisis. 

We are all in this together—Portland tenants, landlords, workers, and business owners—and this commercial eviction moratorium will help to stem the tide of evictions. But we also need to stem the tide of foreclosures and bankruptcies. I strongly encourage our state and federal elected officials to prioritize rent and mortgage payment forgiveness for all Oregonians as soon as possible.""",Portland,Portland City Council signs letter urging Rent/Mortgage Freeze

8850,8850,MsContin,1585862809,ftuxv1,Nan,"tl;dr: looking for an enclosed area to play fetch with my puppy to exercise her without her running away. 

Hi all, as the title says my puppy is getting antsy and I'm only able to exercise her so much given my current work schedule (I'm in healthcare). I still take her on walks in the morning and evening for a few miles but she still has seemingly limitless energy and I'd like to stimulate her more. She was just given all her vaccines to go to dog parks right before all of the quarantine restrictions went into place but now that is no longer an option. She loves fetch but my backyard is tiny and insufficient for this. I'm just wondering if anyone knows of anywhere in Portland (I live in SE but am willing to drive) that's fenced in where I could play fetch and let her run around without risk of her chasing a squirrel into traffic? I apologize for not posting this into /askportland, I tried several times but it kept giving me a server error message. 
 Thanks for washing your hands and staying optimistic, Portland!",Portland,"My puppy is getting antsy, any fenced in areas to play with her?"

We are starting with the James Beard relief fund... but looking for local Portland, since that is our home and what made us.

Anyone know of any that have been setup?

We are challenging other food makers experiencing higher sales in this period to do the same:

——-
Hello - many of us small makers are seeing a rise in sales during this time. People are buying shelf stable food and sales are up.

As it feels wrong to profit take in this period, we are choosing to donate all profits during this period to the James Beard foundation to help provide relief to the people and businesses that are important to our industry, who are struggling.

We invite other makers seeing increased sales during this period to do the same.

I'm now a month in to it.  Some things are working well, and some are not.  Thought I'd share my experience and I'd love to hear how others are doing.

**Things which are working well**:

1. Multnomah County Library, ebook lending service. I’ve been reading about 3-4 books a week. I handed my son my old kindle and I think he’s up to 3-4 books a day. The waiting lists seem to move quickly and the delivery process to my kindle app is smooth.

2. No knead bread. That shit is easy. Finding flour is a bit of a challenge but the outcome is consistently good.

3. Not drinking. Since I’m not moving around as much as I generally like to I’ve cut back very significantly. One small scotch a week as a treat, and every couple of weeks sharing a bottle of wine with my spouse (over a couple of days even!). I do feel better and I believe my immune system is stronger which is a good thing these days. This is tolerable because…

4. Adabinol. A teaspoon of this just melts me in to the couch. A couple times a week I’m good for a mental vacation and this does the trick. I sleep like a baby too.

5. Comcast / Xfinity. In the past I have been extremely critical when I was suffering from stability and performance issues. Those have largely gone away in the past three years, and even with what I imagine is a massive surge in usage my Internet connection is very solid.

**Things which are falling short**:

1. Not being able to do an antibody test. We can’t seem to get our act together to measure things like true rate of infection and prevalence of the Coronavirus in the community. It’s possible that the cold I had earlier this year was mild COVID. As a family, we treated it as such and started socially distancing right then. It would be nice to know whether we had it or not, or if we were part of the population that is asymptomatic.  

2. Lack of fresh air. I miss being able to go outside and wander around. I will go for a walk or a run every once in a while, but I am mindful of the fact I live in a neighborhood with lots of people, and I want to stay the fuck away from them. 6 feet is not really enough, so I find myself choosing to stay inside too much.

3. Dishpan hands.

4. Conference call and video conference overload. I am immensely grateful that I still have a job and an interesting one at that. I am super fortunate. That said, instead of being able to meet ad hoc and work something out in the hallway everything needs to be a scheduled conference.

I worry about myself too, but that’s eclipsed by what I am concerned will happen to the rest. We’re all being careful, but the math says we are all going to get it some time.

I have a weird game I play in my head when I'm bored. I pick a North American metropolitan area and think ""What if (metro area) got a \_\_\_\_ team?"" I think about the team name, its logo, its fans, its stadium/arena, etc. And during this quarantine I've been playing this game A LOT!

So today I was thinking about your city Portland. What if the NFL awarded an expansion team to Portland? What do you think the team name would be? Looking back at past or current football teams in other leagues, I see the Portland Thunder for an arena team name. Looks like they changed their name to the Steel later though. Portland Breakers was a team in the USFL in the 80s. Would you reuse one of those names? Or make up a new one?

Not a football team, but lacrosse team the LumberJax is a pretty cool name. I might spell it correctly though. :-)

But she keeps saying the 6 month window to pay back all rent starts from the start of the delclaration of emergency, not the end. Wtf? I'm not crazy right? Why would the countdown be from the start of crisis and not the declared end? I asked her if she was mistaken saying all rent would be owed within 6 months of the start of this. I'm overwhelmed with trying to sift through articles/gov websites to see what's up. 

Someone please tell me I'm not crazy and there's some source out there I could link her.

I'm not absolutely out of $$ but: a. this might be a while, b.  service industry is gonna take a while to kick back up ($$), and c. why would the doomsday clock to pay back rent start from when I'm out of work.

9020,9020,octopuslasers,1585969549,fum9aa,Nan,"Trimet is making a lot of changes and people are frustrated. And I get it. But I just drive. I don’t set policy. I don’t have control over what’s allowed and what’s not. I was literally followed today on my break by someone bitching me out about all the ‘stupid’ changes because Trimet is falling for the virus hoax. I want to be helpful but I can only do what I’m allowed to do. 

Windows and hatches should be open and need to remain open, even if it’s cold. We’re being told this is to improve air movement. When you’re breathing the same air as other people in a confined space you can see how this would be important. 

Buses can only have 10 people (or 15 if couples). This, as I realized today, could conceivably mean you’ll be passed up multiple times if the bus is already at capacity.  This kinda screws people over depending on the bus to get to work on time. 

We don’t take cash but the ride is not free. If you walk past saying ‘I only got cash’, it’s fare evasion. It’s been a week now. Y’all know you need HOP cards. Customer service (503-238-RIDE) is giving them out. Albertsons and Fred Meyer has them. AFAIK the $3 fee is waived. You could be ticketed for not having valid fare. And yes, I’ve heard the argument it should be fareless *but I don’t get a say in that*.

I get HOP is a great conspiracy and you don’t want to be tracked (they say as they board a fully camera’d bus clutching their smartphones) but bite the bullet and buy one. It can be a disposable one that’s not connected to you except to show proof of fare. 

We’re reducing service (which should work awesome with the 10 person limit). Check Trimet.org for updates and schedules. 

I know this all sucks. But I also know we’re not the only ones not taking cash (and y’all don’t walk into those stores, grab stuff and say I just got cash and leave). I know we’re not the only ones enforcing social distancing. It’s more impactful when we do it, I think, for some people but this is the world we live in. 

I’m out there every day. It’s not an easy job under normal circumstances. Please be kind.",Portland,I just work here...

9029,9029,throwawaymysocks,1585981310,fuoovw,Nan,"Hey Reddit,

After one week of teaching distance learning I am certain that this closure will go on until summer. With the mixed messages from the government we started this week after spring break prepping ungraded supplemental materials and distributing laptops. The supplemental assignments were supposed to be temporary and last until April 27th. On Wednesday night we starting getting emails saying prep for graded assignments starting April 13th and be prepared to give online classes for the foreseeable future. Since Wednesday the expectations have completely changed and everyone from the superintendent down is taking distance learning for all very seriously. If the plan was for school to resume in May the expectations would be prep 2-3 weeks of material and try your best to make it work. However, now everyone is expected to convert their entire end of the year curriculum online and become experts on distance learning techniques. There's also a big push to get everyone as tech fluent as possible which I don't think would be happening if this was temporary.

 Anyways I'm proud of how dedicated all my colleagues are being about this. The school district distributed hundreds of Chromebooks this week and are working with providers to get WiFi to as many as possible. The superintendent has been really flexible about teachers working while also home schooling their own children. The amount of change happening so quickly is unprecedented especially for a school district.",Portland,A teacher's perspective on why school is closed for the rest of the school year.

We only have about 10 employees in a large warehouse and our duties make it quite easy to maintain distance. Every morning I come in and wash everything I need to use down with bleach and go about my day.

However, a core group of about 6 people were still taking breaks together in our small lunch room, sharing food, gathering up in tight knots and gossiping, laughing, 69-ing, whatever. Two days ago my boss was doing something and one of these ""what's contagion"" people was right over his shoulder for no reason, cuz she was bored. Then two more people come in and they're all jammed up in a little spot like this is 2019 and we're all just blowing into each others mouths for fun. I sat there, shocked. 

So yesterday I told my boss that this shit isn't funny and that certain people either didn't understand this shit or weren't taking it seriously. The signs about keeping a 6' distance were clearly just decorative. I was calm and said that yeah, at times, due to what we do, we'll have to break that for a few minutes one-on-one, but that this ""this is fine, everything is fine"" shit had to stop.

And he listened. He called us all together in the warehouse (distanced, of course) and said that this shit needed to stop and that if we don't observe these distancing guidelines we'll get shut down, AND that this behavior was endangering not only us, but our families. Lunches would now be staggered and if anyone was caught casually breaking the guidelines, they'd be sent home.

Five minutes later they all were wearing face masks (where they came from, I have no idea) and had started distancing. Whether or not it sticks, time will tell, but it was nice to see that even he, who had been guilty of gathering and sharing food with the crew, started acting appropriately. 

I'm not in full-on panic mode yet with this bullshit, but I'm taking all necessary precautions and keeping my fingers crossed. That's all we can do.

My wife works for a major hospital in town and due to foreseen circumstances is out of masks despite the recent COVID-19 crisis, despite dealing with corona-positive patients every day.  

Recently she has asked me to avenge her inevitable death and I’m wondering what that means.  The wife and I have a lot of communication problems in the past and despite all the extra time we have been fortunate enough to spend with each other lately, I’m not comfortable asking her for  actual targets.  

I mean, obviously the most logical person would be President Trump.  But do you think that’s even possible?  I certainly am not going to risk air travel at this point, dead wife or not.  And I can’t leave my kids alone for the two weeks (or however long it takes) to drive across the country (and back!) to assassinate the president of our United States!  

I guess my question is thus:  If your loved one asked you to “avenge their death” because of gross incompetence on the part of the government, what would be your preferred target?   

I love my wife but I don’t think cross-country travel is the best idea right now and I can’t imagine any members of the current US executive branch visiting the Pacific Northwest any time soon.   

Should she end up dying, is there a more local scapegoat?   

I should mention that I am extremely anti-gun so any killing has to be done through, I don’t know.  Let’s say dropping coconuts.",Portland,Avenging the death of a loved one?

I loaded up all the healthy meals I had prepared at home and was on my way. I helped someone who is paralyzed get out of bed, shower and get ready for their day. I left to care for a 91 year old who asked me to stop at the TJ's near Holgate - there was a line all the way around the building and I didn't have time. As I left, my heart sank when I saw people leaving with more bags than could fit in their grocery cart, but at least half of the people were wearing something on their face. I dropped the meals, tidied the house, did the laundry and most importantly - talked for an hour or more. Missing human interaction is hard for everyone, but especially for a widower who can't go to church. I dropped a box of supplies to a young couple who are expecting. I was a little bit relieved that they were resting because I'm just always afraid that I'm one of those ""silent carriers"" I keep reading about. I'm in my 50's, so I know it's unlikely, but still... Lastly, I stopped at the Albertson's on Murray south of Scholls Ferry. I had dug my facemask out of my old Burning Man supplies. A little dusty, but better than nothing. I put on my gloves, grabbed my list and marched inside. The store was packed. Groups of 4 or 5 people shopping together. I only saw two other people with masks. More than once I waited my turn to head down an aisle and as I was making my selection had an impatient person push up to me and come within inches. I went to the self check-out and noticed that the one clerk in the store with a mask was wearing it around his neck. As I was leaving with the groceries I need to make meals for all these people, I passed two young men. One of them began to cough and I visibly recoiled. The both started laughing. That was the last straw - I sat in my car and cried for awhile. In a few days I will do it all again.

9176,9176,dj50tonhamster,1586123502,fvm6m1,Nan,"Hi. Long story short, my wife &amp; I finally made the jump from Comcast to CenturyLink last month. (Pro tip: If Comcast is trying to prevent you from leaving, or otherwise jerking your chain, threaten to go on social media. They change their tune reeeeeeeeeeal fast.) I figured I'd post here about the experience.

tl;dr - Install service is a crapshoot, fiber is sweeeeeeeeet.

Long story short, the first guy couldn't do the install when he came out. It was our fault. He gave us his boss's email address and told us to get in touch once everything was squared away. He seemed pretty competent overall. Alas, as with many things CL, actual followthrough sucked. His boss never emailed us, and he didn't respond to a text we sent. My wife ended up spending hours on the phone with CL before we finally got a second install set up. (Some of it was undoubtedly related to COVID-19 but some of it was the usual crappy CL customer service.)

The second tech seemed kinda clueless. He was nice, just a bit aloof. Once everything was installed and confirmed to work, he took off before epoxying the hole he had drilled or putting a plate over the cable in the house. Whoops! Thankfully, he came back to get a tool he left behind. We caught him and asked him to epoxy the hole and install the plate. He did, and he was nice about it. So, everything did get squared away in the end. Just be sure to look over everything before your tech leaves.

Regarding the service itself, believe the hype, although you may have to apply a little elbow grease in order to get the full benefit. For one thing, I immediately ditched the crappy Zyxel router that the guy gave me. I plugged in my router and followed [these directions](https://dougrathbone.com/blog/2018/03/31/configuring-a-thirdparty-asus-rtac3200-router-to-directly-connect-to-a-centurylink-gigabit-gpon-service) to get it to talk to the ONT (i.e., use PPPoE creds + VLAN ID). The tech did give the creds to me, and everything worked on the first shot. (Side note: The username, despite what the link says, will be *lastnamefirstname@centurylink.net*. If you want to be sure before punching them in, first log into the Zyxel router and get your username from there.) For the record, I use a recent Asus router and [Merlin](https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/download) firmware. Everything worked like a charm out of the box.

Performance? Frankly, based on my use cases, I see no reason to stick with Comcast if you have a choice. Download speeds are roughly the same, although it seems like CL is a bit faster when I've been transferring large files. Upload speed is a totally different story. It's just as good as CL's download speeds, whereas Comcast's UL speeds, while still the best of non-fiber options (40 Mb/s), is comparably laughable. I don't know if Comcast will ever be able to compete in this regard without rolling out their own fiber first. (I know they offered 2 Gb fiber in extremely limited areas. I don't know if they still do. $300/mth is a lot to ask.) If you work from home and have to deal with large files, this is a no brainer. In real world scenarios, I've seen both DL and UL max out at ~850 Mbps.

Needless to say, you have to use a wired connection in order to get the full benefit. I do, although my wireless devices have gotten great speeds too.

As many people know, there's no data cap (although Comcast has supposedly turned it off 'til at least June 1 or thereabouts). If that matters to you, once again, this is a no brainer.

Finally, on a quasi-related note, I have a co-worker who has [Wave](https://residential.wavebroadband.com/) fiber service. He says it works great but doesn't know much beyond that and the price ($80/mth). From what I've gathered, it looks like they bought out Frontier's fiber service but haven't done much expansion beyond that and some large apartment buildings. If you can get Wave, definitely look into using them. If not, cross your fingers and hope that they can build it out some more sooner or later.

I hope this helps somebody! Customer service isn't all that hot, but if you can get through the install, you should be pretty happy.",Portland,CenturyLink gigabit fiber: Recent install + service review

""My daughter usually gets up earliest and goes out to feed them. This  morning, that was about 7:00 am. She discovered that both gates leading  to the street were wide open, and one of the goats was missing - but  the other two were still around.  This, by itself is highly unusual.  Both gates were definitely closed at 11pm when we took the dog out  before bedtime. Zygoat, the girl goat, has never run off - none of them  ever have. If they ever get out of the fenced area, they just wander to  the neighbor's shrubbery and start chowing down - they NEVER run far.

We immediately scoured the surrounding blocks - but I had a hunch this  was not an accident.  We have had drunken fools do pranks before and  come in the yard at 2am, and we did worry about someone actually  stealing them at first (especially when they were babies), but we've had  them 5 1/2 years without a major incident - but I had a pit in my  stomach about this one.

After an hour of searching, I came back  home and created the URGENT - STOLEN GOAT post.  And as much as I  dislike social media sometimes, this time it was a godsend.  Many of our  friends shared it on their pages. And within 2 hours, word had spread  across town, and someone had just seen a post about a white goat roaming  out near Kelley Point Park - 10 miles from our house.

My  daughter and I raced up there and found her, exactly where she'd been  seen a half hour earlier.  She was lying down on a driveway in front of  an industrial park - way the hell away from where anyone lives.  She was  very scared, and didn't want to move.  I noticed she had some injuries  to her back feet - a bit blood here and there, but didn't seem too  major. I was hoping she might just need some stitches.

At this  point, my phone is blowing up every minute with people alerting me to  the goat sighting, so I quickly updated the status to let friends and  family know she had been found.  She still didn't want to move, and  wouldn't put any weight on the leg that was the bloodiest, so I picked  her up and carried her to the car, and immediately called my vet and  sent him pics of her injuries.

It turns out her  injuries were much more extensive than I knew.  Upon closer examination,  she had a fractured leg, multiple cuts and abrasions on ALL FOUR of her  legs - the vet said it looked like she had been hog tied with rope.

I have absolutely no idea how she got free, or if this person let her  go, or what the hell they were doing at an industrial park - no idea  about anything - except that someone came into my yard between 11pm and  7am, carried away my pet goat and abused her.

9289,9289,luvhardcandi,1586216109,fw9kxi,Nan," Summary:

I'm a 30 year old guy lives in Portland. I  want to share my experience of having a severe panic attack after I had some cannabis edible. I went to the ER on an Ambulance . Now I  received the bill totaled around $4200. It was embarrassing and costly. So maybe it's a good idea not to get high by yourself when you are going through potential anxiety. Also it helps to pay attention to your stress level and mental health.

Story:

I don't smoke but I love cannabis edibles. I had this 1000mg syrup that's awesome. So every Friday night I would drink a little \~under 10mg to get high. My favorite things to do after that would be eat fruit bars, cantaloupes, watch planet earth etc. Somehow in March, for the first time in my whole life I experienced a panic attack while high. The amount of THC may not be evenly distributed in the syrup and I may had consumed more than my regular amount. I probably was under stress and experiencing depression or anxiety. 

It quickly escalated to a delusional  epiphany that my life was under imminent threat either I was going to kill myself or someone or something was going to. I called 911 a couple of times telling them I was going to kill myself. Then I took an Uber to go the hospital, but halfway I told the uber to top and jumped out of it. Then I lied on the sidewalk and someone's law and called 911 again for ambulance. 

Uber driver was shocked, PDX cops came then the ambulance &amp; paramedics. I was put on an ambulance and sent to a mental health ER and observed for 12 hrs. I was crying at the reception / triage area, telling crazy stories that I don't even understand to the doctor and the interns.  Next day when I woke up at the facility, I was super embarrassed,  and I was hanging out with people with mental conditions until noon. But I have to say the healthcare workers and volunteers at the facility are very professional, so are the Uber driver, cops, paramedics.

I know we're all a little short of funds right now but my household is fighting our shared sense of impotence-in-the-face-of-doom by trying to help out. We've been told by a number of sources that houseless people are having a really hard time charging their devices right now because libraries and businesses are closed. So we are buying external-chargers, charging them, sanitizing them, then distributing them to shelters. 

I know most are pretty tight on funds right now, but if you have a little extra to share--or know someone who does, we'd really appreciate you contributing to our project. We'd also appreciate it if you shared our Wishlist with fb groups, faith communities, or any other social network that might be interested. [https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2P1G82LF4V9DL?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2P1G82LF4V9DL?ref_=wl_share)

If you want to help but don't want to use the wishlist, we'd be glad to accept any extra power-banks you might have sitting around. DM me and I'll give you an address to drop it off. We'd also be happy to distribute any pre-packed snacks, mini hand-sanitizers or DIY cloth masks that you might happen to have.

That being said going out to Fred Meyers is completely awful. I'm not talking about the need for social distancing and such but rather just the tension between everyone. It's truly uncomfortable and I hate that we all have to feel this way about each other now. I understand it's temporary and I understand it's necessary but the psychology of what is happening is truly an under stated issue. I hope once this over it won't take even longer for us all to feel safe around each other again and I hope we have an economy to return to.

I am not one who likes to live in fear. I follow safe precautions as everyone else is. I will go outside and I will walk around without fear. This is still America. We all still have freedom.

Background info: my neighbor just adopted two dogs.Two rather annoying puppies that bark into the night. And an inconsiderate owner that allowed them to do that.

Today was a beautiful day so I was in my backyard doing some yard work and preparing my vegetable garden. Their dogs start barking like crazy when I was working. I did not do anything to provoke them. Anyway, my neighbor, let’s call her Karen, just start marching out and start yelling. She demands that I stopped whatever I am doing and go back inside cause I was agitating her dog. I ignored her and continued to work. Her screaming got so bad that my other neighbors came out to see what's going on and he just tells her to mind her own business and it is her responsibility to control her dogs. Karen said she was trying to sleep and me being out there cause her dog to bark which wakes her up. At that point, my neighbor gives up and we all ignored her.

Well 30 minutes later, Portland police showed up. She called in a complaint, alleging that I was harassing her dogs. Well my neighbor was able to back up my account and the police took my statement and went to talk to her and... I hope that’s the end of it.",Portland,My neighbor called the police on us because her dog was barking.

Wanted to get a pulse from this community here. Located in NE Portland. With social distancing and this beautiful weather, I have seen more and more of our neighbors out for walks, runs and bike rides throughout the neighborhood. Everyone is being great about keeping their distance, and I love seeing so many people staying active. Definitely makes the neighborhood feel like more of a community to see more folks out and about. 

My question: How do y’all feel about front yard dogs that bark? We have six dogs alone on our block that are allowed in their front yard unsupervised for hours a day - This means that they bark/growl at every person that walks, runs or bikes by. I personally am real tired of hearing a dog pop off every few minutes. These neighbors are totally comfortable with letting their dog bark for minutes on end without interruption. 

As an owner of two of my own, I totally understand the role my dogs have as defenders of our home. Even so, I cannot imagine just leaving them in the front yard unsupervised, especially if they were to bark at every soul passing by. If they are ever unsupervised (rare), they are in the back where they will not see or bother a soul. Totally understand that everyone has different standards when it comes to raising/training a dog; just seems lazy and inconsiderate of your neighbors. 

As the weather gets nicer and more folks are home, I think we’ve got a lot more of this to look forward to. Let me know if I’m crazy or hyper-sensitive. If I get some solid feedback I may very well make the effort to meet my neighbors and talk to them about the whole deal. If y’all have had any success with this I am all ears. Sending all the good thoughts your way and hoping that you are safe and healthy. Thanks Portland!",Portland,Neighborhood dog etiquette during social distancing

3. Health agencies must be able to monitor confirmed cases, trace contacts of the infected, and have at-risk people go into isolation or quarantine.

4. There must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days, because it can take that long for symptoms to appear.",Portland,Four markers that may signal the end of the pandemic

257,257,frankylovee,1586291487,fws32n,Nan,"I got my unemployment letters in the mail and there are errors. My main source of income for the entire period that they’re looking at wasn’t counted as income. (It accounted for 3/4 of my income.) I believe this is because of an error in the spelling of my name on my W2 for that business. There is also an error in determining my waiting week. 

The notice says I have 10 days from the day it was mailed (3/31) to call or the information becomes FINAL and I cannot correct it. I received the notice Thursday night (4/2) and began calling the next morning. I called off and on all day on Friday—at least a thousand times. That’s not a joke or an exaggeration, I mean I called one thousand times. Saturday and Sunday, couldn’t call. Monday and today I’ve woken up at 7:30am to get ready to start calling at 8. Yesterday I actually got through once. I was on hold for almost an hour when the call dropped. I spent the next 4 hours calling over and over and over and over again. I finally gave up and ate lunch, then I continued calling intermittently until 5pm. Same thing today... called over and over from 8am-noon and then took a break. Guess I’m going to get back at it now, but I’m extremely discouraged and getting really emotional about everything. I only have 3 days left and I don’t see how I’m going to be able to do it. I just need 5 minutes of someone’s time, I don’t get why this is so impossible. Based on them only accounting for 1/4 of my income, my payments will only be $151. This won’t even cover half of my rent. I’m just really freaking out right now—I’ve called THOUSANDS and thousands of times.

Please read this and give me any guidance on what's best. I have called thousands upon thousands of times, just busy lines. I'm nauseous from stress constantly. I know many are in the same situation. 

I will write this out as simple as possible.

Husband and I moved from Maryland in November 2019. Left our full time jobs there. He worked immediately.  I did not start work until early January 2020. He was laid off on March 14th. I just started my furlough yesterday (April 6th).

We applied for Oregon unemployment for him, but got mail today that he did not make enough money in Oregon during his base year. I wasnt aware of the base year stipulation until a few days ago, after we had already filed. But the letter also states we can close his OR case and they can tell the new state that he has claimed weeks of unemployment and the new state will take this into account for when to start his benefits. 

Is this true? Do I need to somehow get someone on the phone to put this in order? Or should I somehow figure out how to close his OR case and go ahead and attempt to file with MD? 

Also I am assuming since I'm filing April, because of my ""base year"", I will have to file through MD. which no issues. I am just hoping I can file online and wont get a rejection letter as well and be required to somehow call. 

Any guidance? Help? My mental health was already bad, this has made it worse and I'm ready to just fuck off into the sun.",Portland,Another plea for help regarding unemployment.

So I was outside looking at the moon tonight, and about 30 minutes prior to posting this, I saw a somewhat bright blinking red light with a trail of exhaust below it in what looked like the direction of Portland/Vancouver. I thought it was a dim flare or something initially, but when it was about halfway up the skyline from the moon, it appeared to start curving northbound, and during that curve, it appeared to have another blinking red light separate off of it and travel in stride what appeared to be below it, but in retrospect was probably traveling eastbound. The first light appeared to then pick up speed and was flying at what seemed to be faster than a normal plane speed across the sky and over my house to the north. It probably took the light about 5 minutes to be gone from my view over the treeline. I took a video, but did not catch the curve in the flight path or the separation, and it is grainy since it is from my phone.
I guess I am just curious if anyone else saw this tonight? I'm pretty sure this isn't a ufo, but it does look like the same path a rocket would take when being launched.

My next-door neighbor likes to yell on the phone for hours, the unit across the hall blasts their TV so loud I can here it in my unit, and my upstairs neighbor stomps and slams drawers at weird hours. I usually will play music when I'm home, at what I thought was a reasonable volume, you can only barely hear it outside my door.

Seeing as how everyone has been hope for the last few weeks there has been a lot more noise and people seem to be on edge. I have been playing music more often (because I'm home all the time). Within the last week my upstairs neighbor started stomping while I would play music.

Today I was playing some jazz music fairly quietly at 11Am and they started stomping and stomping (I assume they didn't like the jazz). About 30 minutes later I got an email from my landlord saying they made a noise complaint and that I have been playing loud music everyday from 8AM - 11PM for months. I go to school and work 5 days a week so that was obviously BS, but now I'm facing a noise violation with my property management and am scared to listen to music.

I know everyone is on edge with the whole stay at home order and pandemic, but as I'm writing this they are stomping around loudly above me. Also, I wasn't playing loud rap music or anything, it was some pretty soft jazz. I don't think I should have to be worried about playing music in my apartment but also don't want to get on bad terms with my landlord. I feel pretty helpless and am at a loss of what to do. It seems now more than ever we should be more considerate of our neighbors and not be worrying about trivial things.

For me, I’d like to see the city invest in some visibility. I (and I’m sure, a lot of you) am tired of the limited visibility around the city.

Trying to navigate tight neighborhoods is a nightmare. So many times, I’ve either almost hit someone (in a car, on a bike or on foot) or been hit because I thought it was safe to go. [Traffic mirrors](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uxqEU26uL._AC_SX425_.jpg) would help so much. Trying to see around parked cars or through windows to see if a car is coming is extremely nerve wracking and annoying. Four way stops so we can see who is and isn’t there without having to worry about traffic that doesn’t stop. I’m sure the stops would be slightly annoying, but it would be so much safer. Now that there are so many kids out of school and playing, it makes me even more nervous to think of what could happen.

Crosswalks ...need I say more? I’m not totally disappointed, but the lack of lighting at some crosswalks, especially in residential areas is just scary. Pedestrians just walk out (as they should) believing they’re safe which couldn’t be farther from the truth. Having to slam on your brakes because you could’ve, or believed you would’ve hit someone just sucks.

Potholes and faded signs. Seeing how Portland has no issue with closing streets, how is it that some of these streets got to be so bad without getting any attention? How is it that regulatory, warning and guide signs get so faded and not get any attention? Is this some conspiracy or scam to collect money from tickets given? (Sarcasm)

I know charts are published showing what the money goes to and is used for but I can’t find anything recent. I have noticed a lot more of those traffic cameras, snapping pictures of people speeding or committing traffic infractions ...those can’t be cheap. Spending money to make more money from the people. Let’s spend some money on making sure the active people in the community are safe from potential hazards that already shouldn’t be present.",Portland,"City of Portland, is there any way that you could spare some change for things that the people want and need?"

I’m a journalist working on a story/documentary about the opioid epidemic and its effects on Portland and its neighboring suburbs.

The research shows that many prescription opioid users eventually turn to heroin. Some of the legislation in Oregon may be a factor in this, including how much legislative pressure we’re putting on Oregon physicians to avoid over-prescribing opioid narcotics.

For my story, I’m going to be demonstrating how heroin is bought and sold in Portland. On ‘justice.gov’ I found the following excerpt:

“Primary open-air markets in [Portland] include the Transit Mall, Old Town, and various areas near the MAX Light Rail Line. Methamphetamine, heroin, powder cocaine, and marijuana are available at each of these locations; however, crack cocaine availability is generally limited to the Old Town area in the city of Portland.”

Does anyone know if this is true? I wasn’t aware Portland had “open-air” drug markets. If this is actually the case, does anyone know around what time of day (and what day of the week) these markets are generally active for heroin sale? Alternatively, does anyone have any pointers for where to go to acquire heroin in Portland? Our plan at this point is to just drive out to an area known for its drug use and ask around, but anything more specific or any other helpful pointers are more than welcome!

Thank you so much guys. I know this is an odd request, and I hope it’s not breaking any rules. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

edit: if you’re uncomfortable with sharing specific info on this post, definitely feel free to PM me. If you happen to be a heroin dealer in Portland, I would love to speak with you for my story (totally anonymous), so please shoot me a message. Thank you.",Portland,Journalist here - where are Portland’s open-air drug markets and/or where is heroin sold?

419,419,irinasumnmn,1586416755,fxnwwx,Nan,"Hello,


I live in a neighborhood where the houses are extremely close together. The road in between our houses is also pretty narrow. 

My neighbors across the street from me have been tough to get used to. They share their driveway with their neighbors to the side, but have an overflow of cars so they always park in front of our house. They would park their work van and unload it (it’s a home remodeling van) leaving a bunch of debris and trash in my yard and always had shady looking people who work for them around basically walking in my front yard while unloading the van. 

Their dog constantly gets out because they keep it locked in their back yard (even when they leave) and uses our front lawn as a toilet (neighbors do not pick up the dog poop, I just end up spraying it with a hose, but getting tired of this as well).  A lot of the times I find it running around my yard and then barking at me. 

The thing that bothers me most though, is that they have a basketball hoop in our street and their 3 teenage  kids will play basketball every night from 7pm-10pm. I work in the morning. My bedroom is RIGHT by where they play and no matter what I do, I cannot block out the noise from the dribbling ball as well as their yelling. The other night they were also shooting the ball into their recycling bin (apparently that’s fun?) which was extremely loud. I tried asking them nicely if they could keep it down last night at 10pm and the teenagers dad just yelled “WE’RE DONE, WE’RE DONE” at me. Not even an “I’m sorry”. It was a wasted effort as it didn’t really work anyway, same thing happened today. 

I feel like I can’t relax in my own home. It baffles me how they don’t think about their neighbors when we are a closely packed into this neighborhood. 

I get that the sound ordinance is from 10pm-7am. There doing nothing wrong and there’s nothing I can do. So why am I so upset? Am I completely in the wrong? They are the ONLY neighbors like this on our entire street. Everyone else is pretty pleasant.

Maybe you can give me insight. Willamette Dental Group is forcing employees to take ""unpaid leave"" instead of temporary lay-off. They are forcing us to use all of our PTO and stating that it is in our handbook that we need to use this time before going to ""unpaid status"". They are asking employees to reach out to HR who are filing for unemployment. I have spoken to the unemployment office and they say for this COVID19 crises, employees do not have to use their PTO in order to receive unemployment benefits. Willamette Dental is stating that employees who had vacations planned can take unpaid time off when their vacation comes.

What are your thoughts. This is a confusing time and Willamette Dental has changed it's ""policies"" on this seemingly overnight.",Portland,"Willamette Dental Group is forcing employees into OFLA/FMLA status and making people go on ""unpaid leave"""

I plan on contacting him about putting in motion activated sprinklers to deter the cats from roaming in his yard. I’m upset, but mostly I don’t want his behavior to escalate.

I’ve lived her 8 years and never had a problem with him before. I take care of a feral cat colony (although Pierce is more of a stray) and cannot keep them inside. Even Pierce. The few times I’ve had to for medical issues, they cry and scrap at the doors and rip the drywall apart trying to escape. They cannot and never will be indoor cats. They are all spayed and neutered. When we bought the house they were here. We take care of them best we can. 

No, I will not give out our neighbors info, please don't ask.

Edit:  Feral cats exist because of the actions of irresponsible people. Not feeding them does nothing but cause diseases, fights, and suffering. We are doing what is recommended as the most humane solution.

My bf and I were 2nd in line waiting in the self check-out line, there was a guy in front of us (who looked so much like Questlove from the Roots that I could’ve swore it was actually him, though my bf says I’m blind). A customer checking out at one of the machines closest to where we were standing was scanning his stuff and every 10 or so seconds he’d look back at the guy in front of us and shake his head in this disapproving way. It was a little hard to tell what was happening because the guy checking out had a mask on (neither myself, my boyfriend nor the guy in front of us had on masks). After about 3 instances of the masked guy doing this weird head shaking thing, he pulls his mask down and says to the Questlove looking guy in front of us “You know, it’s really rude to be in here without a mask on” and then stands there staring at the guy like he wanted a confrontation. Big mistake! The guy in front of us absolutely laid into this guy, telling him to shut the fuck up and mind his business and that if he can’t handle someone without a mask standing 10 ft away then stay at home and also something along the lines of “just call me a (n-word) if you really want it” and “gangstas don’t dance, we boogie, pussy.” The guy in front of us was clearly pissed off and by the end of this exchange was repeatedly asking “you good? cause we can dance if you still got a problem” and at this point there must’ve been 15-20 people watching.

The guy who started all this told the employee overseeing the self scanners to call the cops (""Call the cops, I will not stand for this!"" was literally what he said), but the employee said “Sir it looks like your transaction is complete so lets keep things moving.... peacefully.” lol

But an hour later, Arambula checked her earnings on the Instacart app and the entire tip was gone, with a message saying the ""customer modified the tip post-delivery."" She ended up making just $8.95 from Instacart on the order.
""I was flabbergasted. I couldn't believe it,""

...

""It's very demoralizing,"" said Arambula, who lives in the **Portland, Oregon**, area and has worked full-time for Instacart since June 2017. ""I don't pretend to be a hero, like a nurse in a hospital ... but I literally am exposing myself [to coronavirus] and when I return home, exposing my own family to the possibility of transmitting this disease. When you know that it's somebody who's just doing it to game the system and to get their order when they want it, it's really frustrating.""

So long story short I applied 3/15 and didn’t hear a word until yesterday (4/9) when I got a letter stating my claim had been denied “based on my work history.” The letter states that to qualify, I “must have work with total base year wages of $1000 or more and have total base year wages that are equal to or greater than one and one half times the highest total quarter amount in the base year or, you may qualify if you have some wages and 500 hours of work during the base year.” I definitely make more than $1000 a year (my rent alone is $1100 a month) so it’s clearly a clerical error (unless I’m misinterpreting the letter which is a definitely possibility) but I’m beyond stressed and trying to get ahold of them has obviously been fruitless. 

I asked a few people who said they received the same letter and weren’t able to contact anyone, but were approved by mail a few days later. I’m just wondering if anyone else has had this experience? I’m pretty freaked out because the letter was sent on the 7th and I didn’t receive it until the 9th, and I only have until the 17th to request redetermination.

623,623,strikkeislandhast,1586575252,fyvh6f,Housing,"A hybrid PSA/rant - 

A few days ago, my partner was working in the front yard (of the house we own), and I was inside, looking out the window. I watched a car with a family drive up and stop, then talk to him out the window. They asked if he was the homeowner or a renter, and then said they were checking out the house because they were interested in renting it and they saw it online.

We found our own house listed on numerous sites, with photos from the listing from when we bought it last year. It's listed at least $700/month cheaper than houses of similar size in the area, and with MANY more amenities than most other rentals have at that price. **With how tight Portland's rental market is, I worry that folks have fallen for the scam and lost deposit money,** especially now during the quarantine, when I definitely would not want to be looking for housing or losing money to a scam. ):

We've put a sign out front, and I've seen many cars drive up, stop, read the sign, look upset, and leave. Of course, I can't be sure how many people were just reading the sign, but... it's been listed for almost a week now, so I imagine a lot of people saw the listing and maybe fell for it.  

I've been messaging with the scammer, and they are actually using *my partner's first and last name* as an alias, which really adds to the invasion-of-privacy feeling. I assume they got this info from the same places that the mortgage insurance scam mailers get it. (Where this info is actually available, IDK. Tell me if you know!)

My takeaways -

* If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.

* If you buy a house, go to all of the listing sites and try to get the listing photos removed so they can't be used in a fraudulent ad. 

Anyways - thanks for listening. Stay safe out there.

We have been being told that(like SSI recipients) disabled veterans need not file any extra ""non-filer"" paperwork regarding the stimulus check.

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/04/10/irs-finally-launches-registration-tool-for-stimulus-checks/) this is [not the case](https://i.imgur.com/zR6AyuC.png).

While the [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here) site has not been updated or specifically names vets as exempt, the recent update that listed persons not required to file was changed to remove Disabled Veterans [from the list](https://i.imgur.com/eAPwCHp.png).

I have emailed my congressman (and many other congresspersons), the IRS, the Dept of Vet Affairs and others trying to get some kind of official word or confirmation on exactly what Veterans do or don't need to do with ZERO response.

None of the .gov sites I checked confirm or deny Vet's requirement, but [the site that the IRS sends you to](https://www.freefilefillableforms.com/#/fd/EconomicImpactPayment) to complete the form [does specifically name us.](https://i.imgur.com/TKRtD1A.png)

So, anyway... If you are a service connected disabled veteran receiving compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs and as a result are not required to file yearly taxes, I would suggest either filling out the payment info or making some calls to gov't folks and try to get word on if you have to.

All this being said, I submitted the form but it was rejected because I didn't have the correct 2018 AGI amount from my return. That's right, the return I never filed. They rejected the form they want me to fill out because I don't file for not having information from the form I didn't file.

[Here is the spot on the form where you input it with the instructions \(enter ""0""\)](https://i.imgur.com/o8qCPLg.png)

I'm using my first ever Reddit post (sorry for lurking) to try to bring some attention to the plight of a couple friends. They are Portland nurses who signed onto a 13-week contract to go to NYC to fight COVID-19. They found themselves some last-minute, and therefore expensive, temporary housing on AirBnB (through host Sonder), paid their deposit, and prepared to head into the fray. A few days later, their contract was cancelled due to a mercifully diminished need for their services. **Both Sonder and AirBnB are refusing a refund or even a credit for the \~$3500** portion of their rent that had to be paid to reserve their housing. It seems inexcusable that these companies feel justified, legally and otherwise, in keeping this couple's money...especially given [AirBnB's touting of their assistance in providing housing to COVID-19 frontline responders.](https://www.airbnb.com/openhomes/covid19relief)

I'm super frustrated for my friends, but the part that should piss us all off is the fact that these two are surely not the only health care professionals in this situation- AirBnB and Sonder, among others, have probably realized a lot of ""profits"" with this circular cancellation-policy dance.",Portland,Oregon nurses left with bill after NY COVID crisis work canceled

If any of your cats go outside, look for sneezing and runny eyes, and try to keep them away from any other house cats as it is obviously quite contagious.  At no point did Vader come in direct contact with another cat, so it may have been something another cat did on our property, or something else in the air completely.  The symptoms are sneezing and runny eyes, and for my boys it didn't get worse than that.  They still ate, drank, used the litter pan, and even played if you used the laser pointer (I do this for about 10 seconds to make sure they are alert).

790,790,empress02,1586737602,g084p8,Nan,"I wanted to create a post to share information and availability with other grocery gophers. I started shopping for my family as well as my boyfriend's family, both with a number of elderly, and then other friends' families as well as neighbors of ours in both Skyline and the Pearl residences. Right now I am doing all the grocery shopping and prescription pick-ups for 48 individuals, 26 of which are 55 years or older. 

I wanted to start a post about product availability to cut down on trips to stores for specific items only to turn around and walk right out empty handed, thus cutting down on the amount of foot traffic/proximity in these stores. I know there are a number of other gophers out there who serve as the point of contact for vulnerable people who do not want to make the trip to a grocery store, so I figured having a centralized place to post product availability would be helpful. Obviously this post will fall off page 1 or 2 in a day so bookmark this page and revisit and hopefully enough gophers will stay in touch to share info/availability/location info for however long we need to keep shopping for others.

Most of you have probably noticed over the last week a return of things like paper towels and hand wipes, and even a number of stores now have toilet paper and alcohol based hand sanitizer (the benzalkonium chloride-based sanitizers seem to have never gone out of stock, and while the CDC doesn't endorse their use for COVID19, there are studies that show it is actually more effective at breaking the 'envelope' which houses COVID19). Regardless, most people I shop for are understandably adamant about getting Purell, GermX or another ethyl alcohol based sanitizer gel. We briefly made our own using alcohol and aloe but people weren't a fan of the 'spritzer' style and wanted the gel, so I have been fortunate to get a supply of Purell from a restaurant owner who allowed me to use her Webstaurant and Uline accounts.

As I visit multiple stores and have a good grasp on where to find what, I also do have a bit of excess supplies from a few order mix-ups and inaccurate grocery lists. Right now I have 96 rolls of Charmin ultra soft (bundled in packs of 6 and 12), eight 20oz Purell hand sanitizer bottles (pump applicator), 24 Viva paper towel rolls (they are bundled in packs of 2) and a number of lemon scented Clorox wet wipes, kills 99.9% of bacteria. If any other gophers are needing any of these we are happy to meet and unload as I have just finished my deliveries from yesterday and today and want to get these excess goods to those who need them. I also have 9 1000ml Purell sanitizer gel that come in bags (https://www.webstaurantstore.com/purell-2163-08-nxt-advanced-e3-rated-1000-ml-gel-instant-hand-sanitizer-8-case/381P216308.html) and require a dispenser, however if you are a gopher you may find it easier to dispense this gel into empty 2 or 3oz flip cap bottles (Freddies sells them in the Trial Size section, so does Wal Mart) to dispense to the people you are shopping for. One bag makes roughly 16 two-oz bottles of sanitizer.

I also have about 48 rolls (four separate 12packs) of generic brand paper towels ""Good Value"" I think that I will throw in for free for anyone who wants them.

So yes, if you need help with any of the items, or if you simply want pointers on where to find things you're looking for, please use this thread! 

I mostly want to supply other gophers since it is the best way to spread these items with minimal contact. If this comment section is crickets and no other gophers are in need, I will happily work with individuals who may need some of these items. (I am selling them at a loss, so there is no mark-up and you will get a good deal)

Sorry to mods if this is breaking any rules by offering to sell certain items. I'm mostly just wanting to deplete my stash and help other gophers. the main point of this thread is to share stores/locations that have supplies of certain things.

Also I have flour (white and wheat), but only a couple bags worth. I was given a duplicate shopping list and ended up with double of everything, including the flour.

So please ask about any items you are looking for, I can most likely help you find them. And if you wanted to meet up and pick up some of the items I have on hand, respond here or email me dallas.may96@gmail.com",Portland,Grocery gophers

Students are waiting for a response from administration. I will edit this thread to reflect current communication between administration and students.

This has been a conversation raging across grad campuses and cohorts as tuition was increased for Summer semester 2020. Many students are in considerable debt and facing unemployment while tuition has been raised without consideration of the current financial climate. These are complicated times for everyone in administration, but many graduate students are hoping for understanding from administration. 

It has not yet been decided if classes will commence digitally or not through summer session. If this is the case the off-campus fee is more appropriate for next semester. For perspective, PSU has waved their campus fees for students until further notice.

Lewis &amp; Clark Graduate school espouses a social justice message. Graduate students are hoping the administration will honor this by removing the tuition increase for the time being and adjusting fees to reflect off campus pricing, a difference of around 100$ per credit.

Hello Portland!

Recently I was having a hard time finding accurate information through google about the changes that most grocery stores are making in response to the cornovirus outbreak, so I thought I might make a few calls and compile a list for everyone to use.

In the above table is a list of the changed operating hours for most Portland grocery stores, and the special hours that some stores are offering that are now reserved only for customers that are at high risk of Covid -19 as indentified by the CDC.  

If you think you may fall under the category for high risk you can find more information here 

 [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html) 

This table is the result of an open interactive webmap project, that I am currently working on, that will show grocery store locations as well as walking traveling time to each location.  I know that in this compilation that I missed a few small independent grocery stores in the city, I want the information that I gather to be as wide spread and as accurate as possible, so if you know of a grocery store, and don't see it in the table, send the information my way so I can add it to the list, and eventually to the interactive map. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this can reach a few people and help someone out.

Am I the asshole for questioning whether the same rules apply to Apartment buildings in lieu of amenity fees? 

Hear me out... Often people choose a specific building  to live in based on offered amenities. Amenities, which include gym, grills, community spaces, etc are factored into rent price. Now given that these spaces are closed indefinitely due to COVID, should we expect a rent concession from our apartment leasing company to account for a service that we pay for that is no longer offered by the property? Isn’t this comparable to a gym closing and not offering a membership refund?

Either way someone loses, but to a leasing company, insurance would take the hit versus a consumer struggling to make ends meet during this pandemic.

So I walked down the block and cautiously approached the guy. He tried to make me an adversary immediately, but I didn't let it happen and tried to establish some rapport to help calm him down. 

He lowered his voice, but then shit got DARK. His face went dead and sullen. He then began to tell me all about his deteriorated family relationships and how he is done with life now and wants to end it. 

He must've said it to me 3 or 4 different times   and failed to get a reaction out of me so he went back to freaking out again... so I politely excused myself and walked home in a serious state of unease. 

I called 911 and told them that a suicidal man was down the street from me and needed some care. They didn't send a ""mental health task force"".... just a cop and they merely shooed him away and offered no help beyond that.

913,913,alohagothic,1586876034,g16yd4,Nan,"I'm a Permanent Resident Alien and I filed for unemployment in OR on March 26 and am curious about others' experience. Has anyone else who is a P.R.A. actually gotten their unemployment application successfully processed, and if not, what has been your experience? Do you have any tips?

I understand the system is inundated and poorly designed to handle a massive influx, but I've been following procedure to the T and the last two weeks, my claim status has been ""Your claim for the week ending {DATE}, 2020 has been received but not paid because of a problem."" On April 6, I received a letter saying my application was processed but asking me to mail them a work authorization document, so I made copies of my green card (front and back) and mailed that to them on the same day. I spent some time looking up whether you could upload documents online, but apparently you can't.

I have no idea whether they received this document or not. According to the USCIS(.gov) website, your P.R.A. card counts as a work authorization document (literally) and you don't need to apply for one. I sent a couple emails/used their contact form inquiring about whether they received my document, but have gotten no response. Of course, calling them is IMPOSSIBLE right now. Tried a million times yesterday, and always the busy signal.

All their letters and system responses use very vague wording: ""There was a question about your citizenship"" or ""There was a problem with your claim"" and the directions you eventually get are to call them. Except YOU CAN'T REACH THEM. **So what are you supposed to do?** Should I write and mail another letter to them? Should I resend copies of my P.R.A. card? Should I email them directly and just attach my P.R.A. card to the email? Or should I just be patient and assume my application is processing, they received my documents, and the ""problem with your claim"" message is just procedural? (Has anyone here done any of these things with success?)

And if anyone here actually works in the Unemployment offices, what would you say I should do? I don't mind waiting for acceptance, I just wish I could know what's going on and having the phone lines constantly on busy signal is wholly disheartening. I seen people on here saying they've called thousands of times. I've only called less than a hundred times but I haven't gotten through at all.

To make it worse, all their request letters so far (two of them) have a ""Failure to respond in 5 days may result in a rejection of your claim"" but I only seem to receive the letters 3 days from the date of the letter. Of course, my logical brain tells me it's business days but I got another letter dated April 7 (which I assume was also procedural because they probably hadn't gotten my work auth docs yet) only on Friday, April 10...so I'm not sure if it's from the date of the letter or the date of receipt but if it's the former, I'm always 3 days behind once I get instructions. And of course, instructions are always to **call.**

Thanks for any input. Being a P.R.A. always takes that extra step in processing anything, but in my experience, just presenting my green card has never resulted in issues processing or filing anything. It made me question whether I was even eligible (but I am). I just wish I had some sort of assurance that the copies of my card were ever received; if I had that, I would just sit tight and patiently wait. But, zero response so far.",Portland,Other Resident Aliens filing for Unemployment?

I have a few places to choose based on my job location on the other side of the hills between SW and Tigard. All seem OK and if it wasnt for the virus I'd have done a final tour and selected one.

2. an older place (90s) with a single giant sequioa and some flowering bushes, but with a large yard and garage/shed.
3. also a much older place (70s) several tall sequioas and a small backyard with a few cedars. Think Maywood Park-ish. Also is more expensive.

We are creative, we love dogs, and we don’t care for pretentious a*#hats. We are real, we are strong and it has been my pleasure for 7 years to drive the citizens of Portland around.

Then one day everything changed.

There were no more children up to shenanigans being loud and rowdy, the silent commuters who never spoke other than a brief smile and thank you before exiting stopped riding, the homeless people and mentally ill grew angrier and desperate, they stopped taking cans at a lot of places. I watched buildings hollow and stoops empty. I observed masks,gloves, sanitizer bottles, and fear spread rampant, with packs of toilet paper tucked under arm.

One day I found myself exposed to this virus as I watched medics take my passenger from my bus and transport her to the hospital after displaying the downward slope of this feared virus. I watched the spotters who receive our bus step back as they saw me pull in and point to the gate, my managers requested I not enter the garage and go directly home so as not to expose the rest of my coworkers. I couldn’t even turn my pouch in. 

I remember walking all the way back to my car because I couldn’t take the bus, I was terrified every time I walked past another human because I was afraid I would infect them. 

I remember the fear that hit me as my daughter came running for a hug only to watch her dad grab her and walk away, and climbing into the shower scrubbing myself down hoping like hell I didn’t infect my children.

Then I got sick. I was confined to my house. No test was given when I explained my difficulty breathing and the sharp stabbing pain in my lungs. They told me I wouldn’t be given a test until I was on a ventilator. Even when I explained I was a bus driver who had been exposed. I found out later two people who had connections to the medical field got tests after just describing their symptoms and I realized that I would never be tested, because I was not gonna die and I didn’t know the right people.

So I fought. I slept. I won.

I’m back!

I’m so grateful to share this story, I’m so grateful I didn’t infect anyone, my kids dad is in quarantine now because he displayed symptoms but I’m happy to share he is on the mend as well and our kids have both parents, both bus drivers healthy.

I got an approval from a doctor to return to work yesterday, and I will share it with you briefly. 

I spent a majority of my day commiserating with my passengers who were part of the essential work force, reminisced about my quarantine drunk days making podcasts and watching Netflix in the comfort of my bedroom while imagining all my passengers happy and safe. 

I quickly realized everything and everyone has changed. It’s not all bad. I’m going to continue to show up and move a city who fills my soul. Thank you so much for staying home, and helping us fight this scary a**pandemic.

At a high level, I am more than happy to work with small and medium-sized businesses, and help them figure out their IT approach during the current crisis we are facing, **on a pro bono basis**, as long as it doesn’t end up interring too much with other projects I might be working on.

I don’t want to bore you with my life story, so I will summarize it as much as I can without too much detail or turning it into a resume as it is not the purpose here.

For a little bit of quick background information, I did management consulting for Boeing many years ago, and then moved to Chicago as a software development consultant.  After that, I did independent IT consulting for a major European company’s subsidiary in the midwest for a few years.  They then asked me to join the company as a department head to build their software development team from the ground up in St. Louis, which took a few more years.  The team ended up generating profits in the tens of millions of dollars for the company on an annual basis.  I also ended up managing several teams across multiple remote locations.  As I had wanted to move back to the Pacific Northwest, I was able to then find a position in the Portland area, heading up a group of incredibly smart people and the company’s enterprise applications department.  When that Portland company got bought out, I started my own company that focused on digital marketing as my pet project, which I sold two years ago.  During that time, I also worked remotely as an independent consultant planning corporate IT strategies and roadmaps for people whom I had previously worked with in the past.  I have recently wrapped up all my remote projects and now have a bit of time on my hands.

The nature of what I am looking for is not exactly your typical job postings.  I love to solve things like:

\- These are our goals, but we are not sure how to get there.

\- This is our plan to accomplish these objectives, does it make sense?  Are there alternatives?

\- We have people all working at different geographical locations.  How do we leverage technologies for everyone to get the work done easily and efficiently?

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some examples of things I have done and can do to help companies with so that they can save a lot of time and expenses as well as shorten the learning curve.  As I said, it is not exactly the type of work you see with job postings.  Instead, it’s more project-based and more actual consulting in nature.

I would love to engage companies that are here in the Portland area.  It just feels good to be able to help and contribute to companies and businesses that are here or have offices locally.  Even for larger projects, I am more than happy to work as an independent consultant to carry my own administrative costs and I already have a very efficient home office setup from all the years of remote work I have done.

I would gladly talk to any companies and discuss their needs, and how to achieve their goals.  If a small company wants to bounce off ideas about what they plan to do or how they can go about doing it, I am more than happy to help.  If a larger company is looking to develop a longer-term roadmap for IT strategies, I would gladly provide my professional experience and recommendations as well.  Throughout my career to date, I have been to college campuses to interview summer intern candidates as well as done one-on-one interviews to help select top executives for multibillion-dollar corporations.

One thing that may not come across as obvious is that I am seriously looking to make an impact.  I want the companies that talk to me to be glad they found me, and that the work I do for them matters.  That is a major motivation for me on a more personal level.

Part of the reason I am posting this is because my professional connections are mostly in the midwest and not right here in the Portland area.  As I finished the projects I had been working on, I am now looking for suggestions in terms of how to connect with companies around the Portland area too.

As I said at the beginning, this is not an easy time for anyone.  If a small to medium-sized company wants to figure out their IT strategies and plans during this unusual time, **I would gladly do it for free to help as much as I can.** 

This ends up being longer than I had intended.  I do appreciate anyone who took the time to read it all the way through.  Thank you for any thoughts and suggestions.  Please feel free to send me a message as well.",Portland,Helping Small and Medium-Sized Businesses

Then you are losing over $1200, between the first skipped week of benefits that won't get waived despite the feds footing the bill, and that extra $600 that would have gone along with it\* --all because of a computer system that is at least 30 years old (despite having received funding for an upgrade 10 years ago), and the lack of a promise from officials of retroactive payments when they would have the time to make this happen for us, once the dust has settled somewhat.

Head East is a head shop located on SE Division and 133rd. From my understanding, it's been around since the '70s. I've gone inside a few times. Pretty standard head shop fare - bongs, drug rugs, Bob Marley posters, Egyptian statues. They don't sell pot (at least, from what I can tell).

The statues is what got me curious about the store. My good friend is really into ancient Egyptian stuff, and I bought them a few pieces for their birthday. The total ended up being significantly lower than what I expected. In fact, a lot of their merch seems cheaper than what I would expect. A very nice glass pipe from a PDX artist? $25. Caveat - I don't know a lot about the handcrafted pipe industry.

Then there is the clientele. People are going in and out of there at all times. Car pulls in with two or three folks, but only one goes into the shop. Even during Snowpocalypse 2016, when the roads were an absolute shit storm, they had robust business. But why would they drive all that way for incense and rolling papers?????

So they have to be doing something under the table. My theory is buying and reselling prescription meds. If it was something super hard like meth or heroin I figure they'd be out of business a long time ago. Even if the area doesn't have high property values compared to the rest of PDX, there is no way in hell they could stay open for this long selling faerie statues and Grateful Dead stickers.

My husband works in the restaurant industry. In February, after having worked for the same chef for 8 years, he accepted a new job (different sort of kitchen/lateral move). It paid less, but with tips (which are split among everyone in the company across all locations) it was going to be about the same pay. Even so, this was offset by his desire to broaden his skill set to advance his career, and the promise of upward mobility at this new place.  On top of that, we had a safety net of his old chef maintaining that he could come back at any time no questions asked should things not work well at the new place. So we had only to benefit from this job change.

Then the pandemic hit and he was furloughed 5 days into his new position. No big deal right, that's what unemployment is for? Except that today, after waiting a month for Unemployment to investigate the claim, he was denied. Their reasoning is that he ""had no good reason to leave his old job.""

So we were denied unemployment benefits because he happened to change jobs right before all this hit. Steadily employed for the past decade, paying taxes into unemployment insurance, and getting a big ""fuck you"" when we need to access it. Cool.

I recall seeing someone post a while back that they had just changed jobs and were uncertain about what would happen with UI - well, here's your answer. You get nothing. I would love to hear from other folks who have experienced this - did you have the same outcome? Were you able to successfully appeal?

Edit: I mentioned the part about the lower pay and tips at the new job because the investigator said “they don’t count tips” (despite the fact that they’re included in his paycheck and taxed) and basically told him since he accepted a lower paying job he shouldn’t get unemployment.",Portland,Denied Unemployment

So a bit of context I work for a company (retail) that's been deemed essential, but honestly neither here nor there with that.. I've been off in quarantine the last 3 weeks using my pto to try and protect a grandparent my family takes care of for various reasons. So this was my first full week of work, and these are some of the things I saw that made my jaw drop.

1. Things are changing, and daily at that point especially on the companies and their policies. It takes us workers time to adjust, not just you as consumers. Especially those of us workers that dont work at big box stores that ARE really considered ESSENTIAL. 

That being said please be patient and courteous with us, a lot of us medium sized businesses dont have the man power to handle all of these changes on a daily basis as employees are getting hammered for trying to enforce these changes, getting burnt out, or melting down.. Or straight up quitting.

2. Kind of banking off the first point please have patience with us businesses that are modifying our policies just to stay open..

If you pull into the parking lot and see a greeter or there's some sort of standard of procedure before entering.. please dont get pissy with them, we're doing this for your safety as well as everyone around you. Guess what we're already losing voices especially in very busy/peak times. I had an hour long shift today just to greet, and I tallied everytime I gave out the speech. In one hour I tallied 109 hashes 
And the speech is pretty in depth. So for example pretend you were a band frontman or singer do you think your voice can hang on that long? Not alot of folks can do that.. please just be mindful of that. 

3. This one hits me hard, and I cant stress this one enough.. This is for the parents out there. If your responsible enough to come out and purchase products protecting yourself while wearing a mask, why doesnt your child / infant have a mask as well?! This is crazy! Or why are they even with you at that point? 

This is nuts and honestly very selfish of you parents out there. Children as it is touch everything they can out of curiosity. So not having them protected, as well as monitored is an absolute failure as a parent.

 To add to this we still have to disinfect and quarantine any unsold items. So having to toss good product cause your child's handled it. Or to disinfect after the fact is costing us time and money. Which we have time for niether..



These are just a few of the things I've seen unfold over this last week, and to be completely honest the way workers are being treated at this point its ridiculous. Were open for you to have options to do during these very awkward times, as well as keep us as a company, as well as individuals going and moving, to treat us this way is demeaning and grief filled.. We are people just like you at the end of the day.

So I guess where I'm going with all of this is: 

1. Please be patient
2. Please be courteous 
3. We're all in this together relax please
4. This is new ground for everyone, things will change 

Thanks to anyone who read this rant I really do appreciate it! Stay safe everyone! We stand together.!

I recently found out a friend I was around had been exposed (works at a hospital) and tested negative for it. But knowing how many false negative tests have been reported, when I developed a small cough and had a temperature of 99.1 I didn't want to risk it, as I deliver stuff to people. I immediately quarantined myself and stopped going to work. 

So, I have been trying to find methods for testing. Providence and other health care providers I have researched and contacted to see a doctor tell me I must go to the county, as they are no longer accepting new patients. I need to be an 'already established' patient, I believe is the term used.

When I go to multnomah county health they say I need to contact my doctor if I am showing symptoms. As they have limited tests, understandable.

I have been going thru the run around all day, and I keep getting sent in this circle because I don't have insurance or a primary care physician. 

I also am totally fine. I have a very small and mild cough, a slight tickle in my throat and NO way to recheck my temperature as thermometers are all sold out everywhere, but I did have a temp at 99.1 when I was checked yesterday.  

If it wasn't for this cough I would assume its just my allergies, but considering I deliver to people I want to make sure, but I cant find a way to get a test so I can go back to work.

Hello Portland

If you saw my last post of the list of grocery store locations in and around Portland with information on the altered hours of operation and the special hours for high risk customers, then you may remember my mention about the interactive web map project that I was working on.  Well here it is!

This is the first draft version of an interactive webmap posted through ArcGIS Online that is open and free to use for the public.  The map contains locations of all grocery stores in and around the Portland area, as well as walking time ranges for each area.  The ranges can be selected from the legend on the right of the page, and are broken down by 10, 15, and 30 min ranges.

The grocery stores all contain inforamtion on the altered hours and special hours for high risk customers, simply click on the desired grocery store symbol, and all accomanying information for that store will pop up alongside it.  Grocery stores that have special high risk shopping hours are highlighted in blue.

There is also a feature on ArcGIS Online in the top left of the browser that lets you enter in your current address and add it to the map, this will allow you to view  your location, and see what resources are closest to you, you then find the grocery store in question, turn on the walking ranges for that area, and find how long of a walk you are from that location!  Who knows!  you might find out something new about your neighborhood!

Give the map a shot and let me know what you think, tell me what needs improvement, what would you like to see added?

&amp;#x200B;

This is the framework for another map Im hoping to build later on, same style but with walk-in and drive-in COVID-19 testing areas as the focus instead, hopefully Ill be able to get access to that information soon.  In the mean time, I hope this helps a few people out. Share the link and the map as often as you like, and get the word out.

If you'd like to see more information on the maps or see more of them, head over to a blog page where Ive been posting maps Ive been creating based on the coronavirus pandemic.

Normalcy - Going to the store to grab ingredients for a sudden dinner craving. Heck, even going to the store just to get your daily exercise in or visit with friends at the coffee shop. Normal used to be living life, hanging out with friends and family and loved ones. Going to work, sitting in meetings, waiting in traffic.
Today, our new normal is putting on “throw away clothes”, a face mask, and gloves anytime you want to venture out to get only the essentials you need. When you do venture out, you send one member of the household, quarantine your clothes for 3 days when they come back, washing down all of your groceries and then praying for the next two weeks that no one in the household ends up getting the virus. Our new normal is not being able to get your teeth cleaned, go to the gym, or even hug your mom. I am not writing this to complain about how scared we all are and that it sucks I can’t go to the gym, that’s simply not a compelling story. I am writing this to express my angst and frustration with our healthcare system and “widespread” testing of COVID-19.

As I write, my brother is on day 17 of being sick, likely with the virus but cannot get tested because “he’s not bad enough to warrant getting tested” a nurse at a testing site told him yesterday. He has had multiple virtual doctor visits with the Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU). During yesterday’s visit, he was finally approved to get tested. He mustered up the strength and courage to drive himself while sick to a testing center, a few hours after being told he should be tested. He gets to the testing center and waits for a few hours before they tell him he isn’t bad enough to be tested. 17 days of a constant fever, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, severe anxiety, and worrying about passing it to our at risk parents whom he lives with. Our parents who must constantly live in fear that they may get it, or that if he gets worse they can’t even drive him to the hospital for fear of getting it and not recovering from it. Myself, who is trying to think of a plan “B” to be able to transport him if needed while not risking my household getting infected. For many other families across the world, they have had more dire outcomes than ours hopefully will be. Many families who have lost a mom, a brother, a grandparent, a hero. Lives have been lost, many more than are being reported. An economic impact which is not yet fully known.

I know every state has different rules around testing, but how can we seriously consider opening up our economy if we aren’t even widespread testing those that are sick? Even if my brother does not have the virus, could he have something potentially worse or another condition going on that can’t be treated right now because all the other doctor offices are closed. “Testing is free” you say? Then why must you pay for multiple doctor visits before being approved to get tested and even then still get denied? What about all of the families across America that live with parents and grandparents but the children can’t get tested because they aren’t hospitalized. What about all of the people in America that don’t have health insurance or foreign visitors that are stuck in our country (sorry if you are stuck here) who have free healthcare back home but doesn’t cover you in our for-profit medical system. What about all of the people that are still working and risking their lives every day to drive public transportation, pack-up your groceries, or service your car?

Our economy cannot begin to think about going back to “normal” until we truly have widespread testing. Testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic. Antibody testing for everyone so we know who had it and who may be safer than others to not contract it again for the next 6 months. They say that could be a fantasy we will never reach. We need to reopen so people can be employed again. At what cost are the lives of our loved ones for reopening the economy too soon, simply because someone picked a date on the calendar. I know many others have likely had a worse outcome than what my brother will hopefully have; I write this to be another voice in the fight against the pandemic.

My only preference is to not be in another basement apartment with little natural light like my current place, not the best environment to be cooped up in.

Dear EatPortland:
 
Our office has received questions and concerns regarding the operation of the Oregon Employment Department (OED) under the COVID-19 emergency declaration. As you may know, the Department has been processing tens of thousands of new claims and record levels continue to be filed. This caused a tremendous strain on the phone and computer systems making the claims application process frustrating for everyone. We have been working closely with the Department to help address some of these concerns. 
 
Here’s what the OED is doing to increase capacity:
• OED will be adding more than 300 new staff positions and more shifts to process claims. They will continue to add staff until the backlog is closed. We know that this process has been stressful on individuals, and they’re doing everything they can to ensure they are fully staffed to help Oregonians submit and process claims.
• OED is updating computer coding to eliminate barriers to getting benefits. They will continue to monitor and upgrade their computer systems for better service. OED is working to ensure they properly address computer issues and ensure every Oregonian can submit their claim.
• OED does not want Oregonians to wait for hours to make a claim. They will continue to add phone capacity for staff to take calls.
• OED is allowing claims to be backdated to the time of job loss. OED believes waiting in line should not reduce benefits.
 
Here’s information on how you can help front-line staff at the OED and your fellow Oregonians who are trying to file:
• Whenever possible, file your initial claim online. This helps free up the phone lines for someone else to get through.
• It typically takes about three weeks for unemployment benefits to be distributed. Benefits will catch up to filers.
• If you filed a claim online and received a confirmation number, it will take OED longer than normal to contact you but know - the claim has been received.
• If you make a claim on the second week, and they have not processed the first one yet, you may get a notice that it is not a valid claim. Know that you can still keep filing claims online and you do not need to call in for that.
• New federal benefits are coming. That includes a $600 weekly additional benefit and benefits for self-employed and “gig economy” workers. We are working to implement these new changes as quickly as we can. We expect the benefits to start going to those who are already eligible for regular unemployment insurance benefits as soon as possible.
 
For additional information, please visit the Oregon Employment Department’s re-vamped COVID-19 page that has a section dedicated to frequently asked questions. You may also wish to view Governor Brown’s COVID-19 resource page, which has a wealth of information and resources to help all Oregonians get through these challenging times.
 
The dedicated staff at Oregon’s Employment Department will get through the backlog and get up to date as soon as possible. We know this situation can be frustrating and difficult times for all Oregonian and we ask for your patience as OED tries to ensure all Oregonians get the assistance they need to ensure the safety, health, and wellness.
 
 
Sincerely,

I've been sick for a few days in bed with a fever, dry cough, and couldn't taste very well. Finally I decided I had to do something. So I googled testing and came across Legacy Go Health (their urgent care clinics) setup. First you fill out a questionnaire to evaluate your symptoms and it told me that I probably had it. So I scheduled a telehealth appointment for 1030 this morning. The Dr I spoke with confirmed that my symptoms sounded like the Covid-19 so she recommended testing, and that someone would call me soon. 10 mins later my phone rang from a drive-thru testing facility to set up a time. They had a location in Gresham, Beaverton and Vancouver. I drove there and checked in at a tent outside where they checked my ID and stuck a q-tip up my nose and was told to park and they'd bring my results out. 17 stressful minutes of browsing reddit later they had my results, negative (thank god). The whole process has seemed to be streamlined and become very efficient, especially the rapid tests. 

I will say the efficiency of these rapid tests are unknown, but there is some questions about it.

Police: Criminals not following stay-at-home order

Some crimes have rebounded after falling shortly after governor ordered people to isolate.

Jim Redden Friday, April 17, 2020

Some troublemakers in Portland are not obeying Oregon Gov. Kate Brown's ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"" order.

After initial reductions following the March 23 directive for people to stay home to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, many crimes rebounded, according to the Portland Police Bureau.

The most serious ones include shootings, commercial burglaries, high-speed driving and domestic violence, bureau officials told reporters during a briefing on Friday, April 17.

""There was a dip early, but it's ticking back up to what we normally see this time of year,"" said Portland Police Chief Jami Resch.

One notable exception is shootings, which are higher than at this time last year, with at least 150 being investigated by the Gun Violence Reduction Team so far this year, Sgt. Ken Duilio said.

It could be worse, however. After a spike of about 30 shootings in two weeks after the order was issued, the number has declined in recent days.

Some of the increases represent shifts. For example, commercial burglaries are up about 80% based on a comparison of the time period from March 12 to April 5, while residential burglaries are down around 40%, Resch said. That likely is because many more people are now home all day while a lot of businesses are closed with no employees on duty, she said.

The actual number of commerical burglaries is still relatively small, however, with only about three more a week being reported, Resch said.

Likewise, armed robberies of taverns and bars are down because they have closed, said Detective Brett Hawkinson. But they are increasing at businesses that deal with cash and are still open, including marijuana stores and banks.

The number of bicycles reported stolen off the streets also has fallen because fewer people are going on rides, said Officer Dave Sanders with the bureau's Bike Task Force. But more bike storage facilities are being targeted by thieves.

Motor vehicle crashes are down dramatically, but the number of people cited for speeding has increased, especially in cases where drivers are going 31 or more miles per hour over the speed limit — which Resch called extremely dangerous.

Domestic violence calls also continue to see a slight increase over earlier this year, said Resch, who promised that each call is seriously investigated.

Resch praised most Portlanders for taking the stay-at-home order seriously. She said officers have not had to respond to many calls about people violating the rule and have not yet cited anyone because folks all have voluntarily dispersed when asked by responding officers.

Resch also said no bureau employees have been know to test positive for the novel coronavirus that causes the potentially deadly COVID-19 illness. She said the number of employees taking sick leave is holding steady.

Resch thanked the public and businesses for donating personal protective equipment to the bureau, including masks and sanitizers. She indicated officers have enough PPE to continue responding to every call where their presence is required.",Portland,Portland Police: Criminals not following stay-at-home order
