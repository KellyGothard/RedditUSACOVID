I'm graduating college in May 2020 and I'm trying to decide where I'm going to live after school. Right now I'm between the Minneapolis area or the appleton/green bay area.

One concern I have about living in Wisconsin is this shit show of the Foxconn Deal gone wrong, and then me having to pay more taxes because of it.

The beginning of 2019 I left an apartment, someone moved in after me and never put the electric in their name. I, first of all, didn't realize I had to call and take it out of my name. When I moved into the apartment I had to call and put it in my name to begin with so I assumed it would go back to the landlord's account. I guess it just kinda slipped my mind, calling to have my name taken off of that address. Anyways, someone moved in after me and continued using electric for 6 months on my account. It accumulated $1300 in late bills. 

I'm kinda lost at what to do here. Just pay it and move on? The landlord says WPS doesn't allow anyone to take electric out of someone else's name but I would imagine the landlord would have some say in that, or the person living there, since I had to do exactly that when moving in. I had to call and tell WPS I was living there in the first place in order to have it on my account instead. So I guess I don't understand how someone can just keep it in my name, never call the utility and that's totally fine. 

Has anyone else had this experience? What do I do??",wisconsin,Someone who moved in apt after me kept electric in my name?

Here is another [article](https://journaltimes.com/news/local/foxconn-pays-village-million/article_d6c3dd09-e1cd-50a5-96b5-942eee1fa2ad.html) about Foxconn. What the hell is going on with everything? Last I read Evers had said the plant isn't what was agreed to so Foxconn won't get anything. Foxconn now needs to renegotiate the entire contract to get any incentives. However there seems to be a different article every week saying they will or will not get the billions laid out in the original contract. 

So does anyone know what is actually going on with things now? Is the contract void because Foxconn isn't building the generation plant they agreed to under contract? Is Evers really willing to renegotiate a contract with Foxconn, this seems like political suicide. Considering Wisconsin has nothing to gain from Foxconn bring here why doesn't Evers just tell Foxconn to pack their sh!t and leave the state? Can he even do that if he wants?",wisconsin,So confused about Foxconn.

85,TallTallTruffula,1578176026,ek3ewg,Politics,"Recently there have been several posts concerning cannabis legislation that is circulating within the Wisconsin State Legislature. Each idea proposed by our Senators and Representatives has a long and sometimes difficult path to becoming a law, much longer than is often explained when people talk about “how a bill becomes a law.” I wanted to provide a post that directs to the official documentation of these bills on the Legislature’s website as well as the info about the legislators that are the most directly involved in the process and the committees through which these bills would receive their first public hearings and votes, along with short summaries about the bills and particularities of process that exist for some of them.


**Recreational Legalization:**

**2019 Wisconsin [Assembly Bill 220](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/ab220)/ [Senate Bill 377](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/sb377)** relating to: marijuana possession, regulation of marijuana distribution and cultivation, medical marijuana, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of marijuana, requiring the exercise of rule-making authority, granting rule-making authority, making an appropriation, and providing a penalty; by [Representative Melissa Sargent](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1842) and [Senator LaTonya Johnson](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1904) et al.; referred to the [Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/assembly/1993) and the [Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/senate/1951) respectively.


**Decriminalization:**

**2019 Wisconsin [Senate Bill 577](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb577)** relating to: decriminalizing 28 grams or less of marijuana; by [Senator Fred Risser](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1915) and [Representative Shelia Stubbs](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1931) et al.; referred to the [Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/senate/1951)


**Medical Cannabis Bills:**

**2019 Wisconsin [AB 570](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/ab570)/[SB 507](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/sb507)** relating to: medical cannabis, providing an exemption from emergency rule procedures, granting rule-making authority, making an appropriation, and providing a penalty; by [Representative Chris Taylor](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1870) and [Senator Jon Erpenbach](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1899) et al.; referred to the [Assembly Committee on State Affairs](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/assembly/2041) and the [Senate Committee on Government Operations, Technology, and Consumer Protection](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/senate/1949) respectively. 
This pair is the comprehensive medical cannabis legalization that Senator Erpenbach and Representative Taylor have been working on for a long time, these bills have been referred to committees other than the health committees which is notable. because [Senator Patrick Testin](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1921) is the lead Republican cosponsor of the bills, and also happens to be the chair of the [Senate Committee on Health and Human Services](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/senate/1950). 
Leadership’s referral of a medical cannabis bill to a committee other than a health committee was likely done because three of the Senators on the bill (Erpenbach, Testin, and Carpenter) serve on the health committee, which practically guarantees that it would pass an executive session in that committee, thereby being recommended to the full senate for passage. Leadership knows that none of the Republicans in Gov Ops or State Affairs are willing to vote it out of committee should it somehow come up for a vote, they’ve also likely talked with the chairs of those committees, [Senator Duey Stroebel](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1919) and [Representative Rob Swearingen](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1828), and received assurances that they won’t allow it to come up for a public hearing or a vote in an executive session.

**[LRB 5095/1](https://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/19lrb5095_01.pdf)** relating to: medical marijuana, granting rule-making authority, and providing a penalty; by [Representative Mary Felzkowski](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1829) and [Senator Kathy Bernier](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1943) et al.; and not yet introduced and referred to a committee. 
There are usually two of these LRB numbers which will eventually become an AB and an SB once they are referred to committees in their respective houses. They would both have exactly the same language. For now just the one has been released by Felzkowski and Bernier, but it is enough to see what they are proposing. The deadline that Felzkowski and Bernier set for cosponsorship on this proposal was for 12:00pm Jan. 3. 
After they have all of the names of the cosponsors they will send this bill with those names to the leadership in one of the houses (likely the Assembly, because [Senator Scott Fitzgerald](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1901) is unlikely to allow this bill to come up for a public hearing, while [Representative Robin Vos](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1857) has been more open to the idea. Rep. Felzkowski, as Assistant Majority Leader in the Assembly, will also be part of the leadership discussion that decides the fate of this bill). 
Leadership then decides which committee to refer the bill to, and then it is in the hands of that committee chairperson. There are some procedures that can change this process, allowing a bill to be taken up by another committee, or pulling the bill onto the Assembly or Senate floor for a vote without having received a hearing, but what I have described is the typical process.


**Other:**

**2019 Wisconsin [AB 236](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/ab236)/[SB 237](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/sb237)** relating to: persons who use medical marijuana legally and possession of a firearm and confidentiality of the registry status of a person on a medical marijuana registry; by [Representative Shea Sortwell](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1932) and [Senator Kathy Bernier](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1943) et al.; referred to the [Assembly Committee on State Affairs](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/assembly/2041) and the [Senate Committee on Public Benefits, Licensing and State-Federal Relations](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/senate/1954) respectively.

**2019 Wisconsin [SB 245](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb245)** relating to: applying the indoor smoking ban to vapor products and marijuana; by [Senator Andre Jacque](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1941) and [Representative Debra Kolste](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1838) et al.; referred to the [Senate Committee on Government Operations, Technology and Consumer Protection](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/senate/1949).


Reading the *“Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau”* provided in each bill will give you a decent sense of what these bills do and how they differ from each other, but there are often details that do not fit into their analyses which only reading the entire bill and comparing it to the existing state statutes can uncover.


When I refer to “Leadership” in the above paragraphs, I am mostly talking about the legislators who serve on the [Assembly Committee on Assembly Organization](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/assembly/1981) and the [Senate Committee on Senate Organization](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/senate/1956). The individual within each chamber who is directly responsible for the referral of bills to committees is the Speaker of the Assembly [Robin Vos](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1857) or the Senate President [Roger Roth](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/senate/1916). These two do have the ability to act individually with regard to referring proposals within their houses, but for anything requiring consideration, they are likely conferring with the other members of their org committees, as well as other relevant parties, to make sure that the process runs as planned. The org committees are responsible for the executive level decision-making for their house. They also sometimes come together under the [Joint Committee on Legislative Organization](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/committees/joint/1972) if they feel that a decision must be made to apply to both houses.


You can find this kind of information by visiting the [Wisconsin Legislature Home Page](https://legis.wisconsin.gov/) and then proceeding to [Current Session](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019) under the “Law and Legislation” section. Tables gathered here can be used to find almost everything that I have made available here.

If you are interested in contacting your legislators about any of the bills above, or anything that happens to be on your mind, you should visit the [Wisconsin Legislative Districts Viewer](https://maps.legis.wisconsin.gov/) which can also be found under the “Find Your Legislator” button on the Wisconsin Legislature Homepage.

331,Judoka229,1579714086,esf68u,Nan,"I have been struggling lately because my ex-wife has been increasingly unfair regarding our son. 

&amp;#x200B;

We currently have a good thing going, as we have for most of the post-divorce (2013) years. I get my son for a week, and then he goes back to his mother for a week. Nobody pays child support. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I came home from active duty, back in 2014, this arrangement started. When I began looking for a place to live and work around our hometown (Kohler/Sheboygan area), she up and moved to South Milwaukee. I terminated prospective jobs and ended up getting a job as a Correctional Officer down in Racine, but lived in South Milwaukee. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got back into the military (2016), in a reserve capacity, and ended up retraining into an IT field instead of Law Enforcement. We all agreed that we would move a little bit west to be more central to both of our families, and our jobs. I moved first, as I now had a great job out in Madison (2017). My commute was an hour, which was tolerable. After almost two years, she instead moved down to Racine (2018), after meeting a married guy and getting pregnant, ending his marriage. So now she lives with him and his three kids, with her two kids, in a two bedroom apartment. My wife and I (married in 2019, together since 2014) were forced to move back to South Milwaukee/Oak Creek area to keep my son in the same school. Now my commute is 1.5 hours (roughly) in the morning, and 2 hours (roughly) in the evening. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got promoted and had a new opportunity laid out for me, which would give our son education and health care benefits, but his mother refuses to compromise. She considers her boyfriend's family and her own in her decisions, but not mine or my wife's (who's family lives in another state). 

&amp;#x200B;

It is very difficult to continue down this path. My three hours in the car every day on top of 10 hour shifts leaves me with little time at home, and it makes my son sad when we can't do things all the time because I need to get to bed to wake up at 0345. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do to improve these conditions? My son is 8, and has told me on many occasions (without my prompting) that he wants to stay with me all the time, but my ex wife refuses to hear it. Am I just doomed to struggle driving my life away and spending $400/month on gas while spending too little time with my son?  


Sorry guys, I didn't mean to rant. I'm just at my wit's end. I really try hard to understand why my ex wife acts the way she does, but it is tough to continue making decisions in my life based on the poor choices she continues to make.",wisconsin,Who handles child custody cases?

Last month (while we were on vacation, and just returned this week) a slew of tickets and a tow notice was sent to us for the old car we donated.

When we donated the car we removed the plates, received a donation letter, etc. I thought we'd taken all the necessary steps back in 2017.

I talked with Rawhide, and it seems they sold the car to another company, but the company never updated the registration with the DMV and it is still in our name. Rawhide has been helpful, and has reached out to the agencies that have sent us the tickets/citations/tow notice and most seem willing to update the ticket/citation information to the company Rawhide sold the car to.

The important thing we want to do is have the VIN removed from our name to eliminate the possibility of future tickets/citations being sent to us. I talked with the DMV (called their title department) and they told us it was impossible, and that that the only way to remove our previous car is by having the company that bought it register it. Otherwise the car will forever be in our name in the DMV records. Assuming the company does not complete the registration with the DMV is there really nothing we can do?

The car is currently at the MKE tow lot, so hopefully they will properly dispose of it this time and it will be the last we hear of it..",wisconsin,Sold car but buyer never registered it with DMV

&gt;Sen. Ron Johnson, who played a small role in the Ukraine saga, said in an interview that the impeachment inquiry’s revelations have been counterproductive to the U.S. relationship with Ukraine.



&gt;Johnson, who traveled to Ukraine last year and also personally pressed President Donald Trump to drop his hold on the military aid to Ukraine, said that the back-channel talks between the Trump administration and Ukrainian officials never should have come out. The Wisconsin Republican concluded of the impeachment trial: “The sooner this ends the better for America.

&gt;“It never should have got exposed outside of the agencies. It just shouldn’t have. If these guys are really trying to help Ukraine, it hasn’t helped,” said Johnson, who has steadfastly defended Trump’s conduct in the saga.

&gt;“I was always convinced that once President Trump met [Ukrainian] President Zelensky, those two were going to hit it off great and now all of a sudden Ukraine would be Trump's best friend. I've just always believed that. I think it's true. So this didn't have to be exposed,” he added. — Burgess Everett",wisconsin,Ron Johnson blames impeachment for harming U.S.-Ukraine ties

I posted in this sub a few weeks ago asking about hog hunting in the state, because the existence of hogs in our state is almost entirely anecdotal.  For the most part, wild hogs seem to be specifically escaped farm pigs and do not have a stable breeding population.  There have been sightings for years in many counties, but the primary locations of interest seem to be around Prairie du Chien and Gay Mills with sightings also occurring around Washburn and Douglas Co and Price and Iron Co.  These aren't the only places that have reported them, but they seem to be the best leads so far.

I have been googling but much of the information available is dated or anecdotal.  I am planning to do a few 'expeditions' around the state to attempt to track hog(s).  So far, I will definitely be exploring around Prairie du Chien and Gay Mills but I am looking for information on areas in the northern counties that might be worth investigating.  I do plan to contact the DNR and see what they have to say, but any information you guys can provide would be appreciated.

Wisconsin is really...really clean.

Most recently I was along interstate 5 in California traveling out from LAX to Lancaster and there was just...garbage everywhere.  Every 3~10 feet was a plastic bag or fast food container or shredded tire or whatever.  Even out on the rural roads there was always some evidence humans had decided they didn't feel like waiting until they found a trash bin.

Which sucked.  The view was just absolutely gorgeous of mountains, valleys, the desert and so on...but at the forefront of every view was a little pile of trash here or there. It really impacted my experience.

I landed back in Wisconsin and on the drive back along 43 I didn't even see so much as a plastic bottle.  Driving across my hometown, even with the snow receding there were no hidden nuggets of garbage.  Sure cigarette butts here and there but even those were at a minimum.

I know there are exceptions and given 10 minutes you could probably find an example of some trash laying on the street or something...but you have to go looking for it, it isn't just there.  For the most part our interstates and rural roads are all exceptionally clean. 

So a big, -big- thank you to everyone who does their part to keep our home beautiful.  Whether you just wait to get to your destination to toss out that fast food bag or if you take part in an adopt-a-highway or whatever.

Thank you.",wisconsin,A thank you to those that adopt a highway and everyone that helps keep Wisconsin beautiful

So, basically, they charge you .08 cents ber KwH during 'off peak' times 7pm to 7am - MF and all day Sat &amp; Sun and .19 cents during ON peak time 7am to 7pm Monday thru Friday

It was hard to listen to him talk out of one side of his mouth that our gov't is so partisan and divided - and then on the other side continue blaming the other side. Typical. Not to mention the insane amount of deflection in his answers. Not sure what I expected but never the less, disappointed.

Is La Crosse a good place to be for someone like me? I’ve driven past on I-90 plenty and I’ve been to UW-La Crosse a couple times, but I haven’t spent much time in the city itself.

I went to school at UW-Stevens Point and I really miss being able to walk or bike most places. I also enjoyed how Stevens Point kicks most of the chains out to outlying areas, which La Crosse seems to do as well. The arts scene and just generally relaxed atmosphere were a big positive too. I’m currently living in Georgia and desperately missing the upper Midwest and everything that comes with it.

So can anyone tell me about living in La Crosse for someone in their mid-20s? Pros? Cons? Any tips or advice? 

If I did move there, I’d be looking to rent up to $1,000 a month, but it looks like I should be able to get by much cheaper. Any advice about where to live or where to avoid?

We're both originally from SE Minnesota, but aren't really keen on going back there specifically. My husband went to UW La Crosse and has some friends still living there, so we've got a couple connections (literally just two), but we're looking to make more!

We're both active - very outdoorsy (backcountry camping/hiking, canoeing/kayaking, fishing, boating, climbing, you name it) ...not fans of big city life/shopping - we're pretty simple/minimalist. We are also childfree (don't have kids, don't want kids) .. We are contemplating moving to La Crosse this Spring once we've returned from our travels, and are quite honestly looking for like-minded people around our age (~25-35) we could meet up and hopefully make real genuine connections with.

Aside from being active/outdoorsy, we enjoy:
- traveling
- going to plays/musicals
- eating ice cream any time of year
- movies/sitcoms (only on our millionth time rewatching Big Bang Theory)
- craft beer
- board games/card games (anyone else know how to play cribbage!?)
- yard games
- cooking/grilling out
- trying out ""alternative lifestyles"" (tiny house, vegetarian/vegan, etc..)

We aren't so much into the bar scene when it comes to rowdiness/getting totally shitfaced, so not looking to do that.

834,Jurassic-Borks,1582419556,f821iy,Nan,"SO, I realize you guys might get a lot of questions like this on this sub. But my circumstances are a little unique, so I hope you can provide some guidance just in general or specifically on relocating.

Basically, I'm an army bratt, which means I grew up with parents as soldiers and moving around from place to place. I don't really have any place I'm ""from"" because I've traveled to and lived in many states and countries throughout my life. It was great because I got to see a lot of the world from a young age. But it's also sort of lonely because now as I reach adulthood, I kind of feel lost in the fact I don't feel I ""belong"" anywhere.

I currently live in Southern California. The weather everyday is beautiful, but it's crowded and expensive no matter what the fuck you're attempting to accomplish. People here are kind of fake and self absorbed. I have no real roots here, so I'm just another one of the nameless millions trying to make it big. I think I need a change of pace

I'm looking at Wisconsin because it's where my extended family live, I have some childhood friends who settled down there, and because the upper Midwest is the only place I really have any sort of ""cultural connection"" to even though I wasn't raised there because it's where my parents are from. (Dad from WI Mom from Chicago, IL). I also like the fact in times past when I've visited, I always felt like I was visiting the heart of America. :) Rolling green hills and corn farms, red barns, small towns, parades and summer festivals. Maybe it's cheesy but I enjoyed the vibe.

I'm taking a hard long look at possibly relocating there. Thing is, I have a few concerns.

1.) How bad is seasonal depression?.The weather can have an impact on me. I don't mind snow or cold; it's the grey that can bum me out.

2.) I'm also young and gay. Is it possible to build a romantic life with another gay guy in WI? Are people accepting there? Are there gay guys in Wisconsin?

3.) How affordable is it? Is it gentrifying? One of those places where I'll just become another one of the working poor in a few years? I currently don't have a middle class income, so is rent/gas/food cheap?

4.) What outdoor opportunities are there? I love to hike, ski, swim, camp, and travel. I also pretty decent at ice skating. Will there be opportunities for this in Wisconsin?

5.) Finally: is Wisconsin hostile to transplants? Is there a chance I can become part of the community if I make a good effort? Or will I always be seen as an outsider? How hard will it be to make friends?

Thanks for all those who took the time to read my post! : ) I greatly appreciate whatever input you may have to offer! &lt;3",wisconsin,I'm seriously considering moving to Wisconsin. What do I need to know?

In every other state, after you graduate from law school, you have to pass the bar exam before you can become a lawyer. In Wisconsin, you don't. Wisconsin is the only state in the U.S. where you can be an attorney without having to pass a bar exam to prove you know your stuff. For instance, in California, only 50% of the people taking the bar exam passed it last year. Jack Welch, the CEO of GE (he just died, may God rest his soul) said you should fire the bottom 10 percent each year as part of an orderly continuous improvement process. A bar exam does this by weeding out the worst law students. Wisconsin doesn't have a bar exam for its graduates, so you are more likely to find a bad egg in Wisconsin than somewhere else.

Also, in every other state, after you graduate from law school, you have to pass a national ethics exam (its called the MPRE) before you can become an attorney. In Wisconsin, you don't have to take this test. So now you can have not just a bad egg, but an unethical bad egg. 

Even worse, Wisconsin lawyers are not mandated to have malpractice insurance. This is kind of like giving the keys to your uninsured Lambo to your 16 year old kid. For example, here are two well-known examples where the Wisconsin attorney royally screwed his client:

* Len Kachinsky - the lawyer from making a Murderer who threw his client Brendan Dassey under a bus. Kachinsky did such a bad job that a judge removed him from Dassey’s defense team. see https://gazettereview.com/2016/01/what-happened-to-len-kachinsky-new-update/

* Eagle Nation had a $50 million dollar lawsuit dismissed because their attorney forgot to work on it and was charged with 28 ethics violations. see http://www.barcomplaint.com/article-of-interest-copypaste-ok/wisconsin-former-eagle-nation-attorney-cole-white-faces-28-ethics-violations-involving-failed-50-million-lawsuit/

A bad attorney can literally RUIN your life, and you may not be able to fix it. So don't just trust a slick-talking attorney. Always use google to research your potential attorney and also check websites like http://www.barcomplaint.com/ and https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/offices/olr.htm

Even after you do your research, always ask your attorney if there have been any complaints against him or her and whether they have malpractice insurance. Do it by email so you have a paper trail. If they won't answer you, dump them.

Hopefully this will save you from a lot of grief.",wisconsin,PSA: Research your Wisconsin attorney

In my opinion, the ballot question doesn't make clear what exactly Marsy's Law will do in Wisconsin, so I'd urge you to read up on the changes themselves before making a decision. In particular, the question states that it will leave the **federal** constitutional rights of the accused intact, but that is misleading because it absolutely reduces rights of the accused at the state level.

The proposed amendment literally ***removes*** the following from the state constitution: "" Nothing in this section, or in any statute enacted pursuant to this  section, shall limit any right of the accused which may be provided by  law."" So it does reduce the rights of people accused of crimes in the state, contrary to what some supporters have claimed and contrary to what the question itself implies.

Then there is the fact that alleged victims can refuse discovery requests by the alleged criminal. I'm not a lawyer so I can't pretend to understand the full impact of the other parts of Marcy's Law, but it seems like this could easily lead to unfair trials and false convictions. 

There are surprisingly strong victim's rights in the state constitution already, and I think this amendment would make the entire process less fair. Please, do feel free to disagree with me! Only two organizations in Wisconsin are opposing Marcy's Law, and even following local news closely, I hadn't heard about any reasons why you wouldn't vote yes for this, and even if you still plan to vote yes, at least you will have heard a dissenting view. I intend no disrespect to those who think Marsy's is necessary.",wisconsin,Reminder: there will be a question on the April 7th ballot about adding Marsy's Law to the state constitution

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted in China through [Herculean efforts](https://twitter.com/NAChristakis/status/1237020518781460480).

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [150,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer. Also please note that this study has not been peer-reviewed, but due to the implications is included here out of an abundance of caution.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/fgj062/joe_rogan_experience_1439_michael_osterholm/fk4t45b/) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf))

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article)

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

* A surgeon working in the heart of Italy's outbreak gives a harrowing testimony and urges everyone to heed the warning that it can easily overwhelm hospitals ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffa2tf/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/fjx5tc8/) / [Original](https://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_07/coronavirus-bergamo-medico-humanitas-facebook-situazione-drammatica-altro-che-normale-influenza-4fdf6866-6088-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml)).

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

* People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html))

* **Update:** ""Any country that looks at the experience of other countries with large epidemics and thinks that it won’t happen to us is making a deadly mistake,"" [warned the WHO](https://twitter.com/reuters/status/1238560462524035073?s=21).

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an ""adjustment reaction."" [Here is a very short guide](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm) on how to cope.

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare it to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. **Update:** [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca).

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* Practice [social distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/).

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing social distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

* [Source](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) / [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fg4a74/covid19_median_incubation_period_is_51_days/) with regards to this section.

#**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS:**

(All direct from [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China.)

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes (more [here](https://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/treatment-care/planning-sick-days/coronavirus))

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/fgj062/joe_rogan_experience_1439_michael_osterholm/fk4t45b/) of source)

* People with weakened respiratory system due to smoking/vaping ([source 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)), ([source 2](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/Abstract/publishahead/Analysis_of_factors_associated_with_disease.99363.aspx))

* Lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function or that require home oxygen (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf), last page)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""** 

UPDATE: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds)).

UPDATE: The [New York Times detailed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html) how 40% of Americans have chronic conditions and should immediately start taking extra precautions.

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html), more from [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be. And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)). Update: [This claim is now in dispute.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w)

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in [Sydney](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), Australia, or the one over in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), both of which will be kept up to date (as will any of my PSA's that I posted myself, as long as they're still on the main page of that sub).

**What is it?** EARN IT is a bipartisan piece of legislation introduced in the Senate that would create a committee headed by the US Attorney General that would a list of best practices for combating child abuse online. Companies that fail to follow these best practices would become legally liable for anything that users say or do on their platform. These guidelines, then, will be a mandatory part of doing business. The AG would have the authority to overrule the committee and make the rules whatever he sees fit. The makeup of the committee would be almost exclusively those with a law enforcement background or experience working with law enforcement.

**Why is this bad?** Barr, the current US AG, believes that encryption hinders law enforcement and should be banned. Encryption is what makes browsing, shopping, chatting, banking, and communicating with your doctor's office online secure. It is also essential for people who use a VPN to work from home. Without encryption, none of that information is secure or private. Barr believes that encryption needs to be banned or broken for law enforcement because its existence means that companies cannot always provide law enforcement with the data it wants.

Another stake holder in this discussion--the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children--believes that online services should be made to scan all messages for content the NCMEC considers to be abusive (not necessarily illegal!) using approved software and report that information to the NCMEC and law enforcement. 

**But isn't EARN IT needed to protect children?** No. The existing law that protects websites from being legally liable for what users post does *not* apply to federal crimes. All websites that become aware of something like child abuse material must report it to law enforcement and cooperate fully.

**Isn't EARN IT needed to make companies do more than the bare minimum?** Not as far as I can tell. All major sites have means for users to report illegal or harmful content they find, and all major sites employ content moderators to go through it and report it to law enforcement if needed. Google and Microsoft also scan cloud accounts for known illegal porn and report finds to law enforcement. Facebook uses automated programs to scan for bad stuff that nobody has reported yet, and I'm sure other big companies do too.

**tl; dr** The federal government wants to make online communications insecure, and to make scanning of all communications for undesirable content mandatory, along with whatever else AG Barr wants to ""help protect children"". 

I haven't heard any discussions about this on the local news, and I don't trust our representatives not to vote for it. If you agree that this is a bad idea, please take action:

Be thankful. Enough said.

Be positive. Society has been through worse. It will be ok.

Be helpful. If you can help a neighbor or donate to food bank then do so.Use your turn signal.

Use positive words and actions when interacting with others. Let idiots have the last word if necessary. Let someone go ahead of you.

We are all in this together. It sucks for everyone, remember that whenever you may be upset at the situation. We are the adults.

Listen to what's being asked to be done and try to do it. The government is doing what it can. We don't follow blindly but we should try to remember that it's about protecting others. Both political parties are trying their best. Let people spew hate online at each other over an affiliation. No need to take part.

Bonus rule

Try to remember the lessons of the past. World War II,Post 9/11, all the times we've banded together as Americans to face down what will be our biggest enemies during this time which are fear, ignorance and selfishness. The biggest fear is fear itself.Each one of us should be the leader we want to see.",wisconsin,10 rules for a Pandemic and 1 Bonus Rule

The world is experiencing an event the likes of which we've never seen in modern day.  This will impact everyone in some way - some for weeks, some forever.  It is of upmost importance that everyone has access to accurate information and recommendations to keep everyone safe.

There has been a sudden uptick in suspect user accounts attempting to, and sometime being successful in, posting suggestions contrary to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) and [Dept. of Health Services](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/index.htm) (DHS).

Models shouldve been heeded weeks ago to provide much farther warning of closing for various industries instead of the bs surprised youre closed on the same day catch up nonsense (just like what happened with restaurants). 

Additionally hair salons should not be grouped with day spas, nail salons, tattoo parlors, body art establishments, and tanning facilities and be forced to closed while laundromats remain open and people are allowed to buy nonessential items at grocery stores. Access to adequate grooming facilities is of similar importance to laundering facilities. If both were closed indefinitely which would be easier to do at home to an acceptable degree for an average person, washing your clothes in the kitchen sink or trying to cut your own hair? Obviously washing your clothes is something that could be accomplished without much trouble compared to cutting your hair. The only other reason that came to mind regarding why hair salons would be closed vs stuff like laundromats not being closed would be social distancing but no one can do that in the grocery stores and it isnt explicitly called for anywhere except for banks as far as ive been able to determine based on the news article linked in a different reddit post as well as my local news website.

Furthermore I have been unable to find any information regarding this closure anywhere on my local news website (wluk fox11) which is the primary local news servicer for my entire region of the state.

In spite of little evidence of food-borne COVID-19 transmission, I still worry about getting sick from a pizza made by an asymptomatic carrier. Why not ask people to either order food if they're cool with it, OR buy gift certificates &amp; cards from specific local restaurants. I don't mean go to a grocery store or online and buy a Pizza Hut gift card, but instead call the restaurant directly and ask if the manager or owner can sell a card/certificate over the phone and mail it to the customer. That way the store gets cash flow NOW and the overly anxious customer (like me) still gets value, if at a future date, for the purchase. And if the store isn't a franchise the manager or owner can always print out vanilla certificates, write in the customer's name, the amount, expiration date, and sign, date, and mail it to the customer.

I know the election has probably slipped from many of our minds, but I feel the need to make a quick post about this before people start voting (hopefully early or absentee, for heath and safety!). 

You may have seen, or will see, adds about Marsy’s Law for Wisconsin. It will appear on your ballet as “additional rights for crime victims” with the ability to vote yes or no. 


Though it is not my place to tell anyone how to vote, I am concerned about how this proposition is portrayed in the advertising and on the ballot, and I want to encourage people to do some more research before deciding on their vote. 


First, it is worth noting that Wisconsin already has strong legal protections for victims; full information can be easily found online. The additional coverage included in marcy’s law is viewed by many legal experts and victims advocates to be unnecessary and in fact a constitutional overreach; the amendment was even deemed unconstitutional in some states because of how it undermines the sanctity of the presumption of innocence and other rights of the accused.  More detailed information can be found here:

https://ballotpedia.org/Marsy%27s_Law_crime_victim_rights

I get that some companies are teetering on the edge of financial collapse and they see staying open as a way to benefit their workers... but I think it comes at the expense of the larger society.

1568,rhadamanthus52,1585088069,foef1e,Covid-19,"This week Governor Evers issued a recommendation to prohibit gatherings of 10+, and to keep a distance of at least 6 feet from other people. Currently the state prison system has over 23,000 people incarcerated and there are many, many more in county jails. None of the inmates or workers in these facilities will be able to follow these health recommendations.

The Governor must immediately move to drastically reduce these numbers, or COVID-19 virus will spread like wildfire through our jails and prisons as incarcerated people, corrections officers, and health-care workers in these facilities are all in close contact. Large amounts of hand sanitizer will not do anything in such settings. Once symptoms start showing in these populations after days of incubation it will be too late to act. Our hospitals and health-care systems will quickly be overwhelmed by many simultaneous prisoners, nurses, deputies, COs, sheriffs, mental health workers, and custodial workers who work in these facilities every day. Many Wisconsinites will die because of the simultaneous need for use of hospital facilities driven by our jails and prisons.

Gov Evers must immediately use all the power granted to him under WI 323.12 4B to release as many prisoners as possible from state facilities.

Additionally he should issue formal advisement to county sheriffs around the state to give them political cover for the hard but necessary steps they must take to reduce their jail populations. One such easy advisement is the immediate release of all people in county jails who are being held pre-trial on account of being unable to meet bail. Nobody should die in jail or contract a virus in an overcrowded jail because they are too poor. Additionally the Governor could recommend that sheriffs release any and all persons in jails for misdemeanors or other low-level offenses. 

Taking these actions now is necessary to save thousands of lives in Wisconsin - the lives of incarcerated people yes, but also the lives of everyone in our state who come in contact with our thousands of prison and jail workers every day. In the coming week and months many Wisconsinites will soon need access to limited medical resources but these resources will quickly be overwhelmed if we have a massive spike in critical cases all at once caused by our overcrowded jails and prisons. We can prevent this but we must ask now. I hope we have the courage to make these absolutely necessary decisions.",wisconsin,Governor Evers must recommend immediate suspension of cash bail

1607,TailsYouLose,1585152106,fosro3,Covid-19,"First, I want to thank you for your continued support of staff and even-handedness thus far during the covid-19 pandemic. However, I have some concerns with the response, or lack thereof, from human resources and the city. Governor Evers announced his ""Safer at Home"" policy on Monday with the full text released yesterday morning and set to take effect today. So far, we have yet to receive any guidance with regard to the order from the city. During this time of uncertainty, the silence has been deafening. 

By virtue of not hearing anything from HR, it has been left to employees to surmise that everyone is deemed essential and is required to report to City Hall as normal. I agree that every city employee plays a vital and essential role in strengthening the city and carrying out important functions, however by deeming every employee essential, is anyone actually essential? It is my understanding that non-active duty Fire Department personnel and some Parks &amp; Rec staff are currently working remotely. Why has no citywide policy been put in place for such an option? The response from the city thus far feels like a 'business as usual approach' which directly contradicts directives and guidelines provided by the state, City of Milwaukee, and medical professionals alike. Given the sometimes asymptomatic nature of the virus, it is of great concern that employees have not at least been given an option to work remotely, if possible, in order to help in the effort to flatten the curve. It feels like either the city is not taking this seriously, they don't care about the health and wellness of employees, or both.

The governor's order includes the provision that ""All businesses, including Essential Businesses and Operations, shall, to the greatest extent possible, use technology to avoid meeting in person, including virtual meetings, teleconference, and remote work (i.e., work from home)."" I am asking that effective tomorrow and throughout the duration of the governor's order, I am able to work from home. I would ask that my colleagues are also afforded equal opportunity work from home. Given the proper IT tools (VPN to the network, etc), nearly every one of my job functions can be accomplished offsite. Without having full capacity VPN connectivity, I feel I am still able to accomplish nearly every essential function of my job via email and phone. I'm more than willing to take a box of files to purge or work on any other projects you deem necessary. I am also willing to come to City Hall on an ""as needed"" basis to access the server, pick up additional files to purge, attend meetings, or provide another valuable service for the city outside of my normal job functions. 

If it is decided that ""work from home"" will not work, I am asking to use my vacation time to cover not coming in to City Hall during the duration of the order. Again, I would much rather work and perform my essential job duties but I am also unable and unwilling to compromise the health of myself and my family. 

Perhaps the city is in the process of announcing a comprehensive and thorough response to the covid-19 pandemic but this has not been communicated to employees. On Monday, the state put forward a comprehensive policy covering state employees. If the city is interested in mirroring these policies, I would be happy to share the text of the state's response.

 Summerfest, a staple of early summer entertainment in the Midwest, will now see its festivities occur later in the season. The Milwaukee bash has pushed its schedule to September as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

Originally set to run 11 days between June 24 and July 5, the festival will now take place across nine dates on September 3-5, 10-12 and 17-19.

“The music industry has been profoundly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and most live events scheduled for early summer have been cancelled. In the interest of safety and in cooperation with artists, Summerfest 2020 will move to new dates,” wrote Don Smiley, President and CEO of Milwaukee World Festival, Inc., in an official [**statement**](https://twitter.com/Summerfest/status/1242225904740417536). “The new dates provide the best possible option to deliver the Summerfest experience our fans and sponsors have grown[(read more....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/03/milwaukees-summerfest-pushed-back-to-september/)",wisconsin,Milwaukee’s Summerfest Pushed Back To September

My office and job is considered essential infrastructure, and my company’s owner hasn’t seen the light of the working from home idea yet, so I’m driving to and from the office every weekday. It’s noticeably just way, WAY more busy and congested. Why??

Just got furloughed due to COVID-19 and was told my employment status would be set to Zero, meaning I get no pay, but my employer will cover my health benefits and I will still accrue PTO/Vacation time during this time as if I was still working.  My employer also offered me the opportunity to take a lump sump payment for all my accrued PTO time instead of accruing PTO.  


Anyone know how this will affect any UE claims if I'm still accruing PTO time while furloughed? My HR contact said she had to ""research"" the issue and now a week has gone by and still no answer from her.

I just spent an hour on the WI DWD UE site and I can't find anything on how this will affect my UE claim.

1752,TMKF2,1585444725,fqwzn8,Nan,"As a matter of public policy so far, government agencies presently want to get the message out that masks are *less effective* at preventing the transmission of COVID. That message prevents runs on the stores and supply houses of essential medical goods, and prevents overconfidence that could result in a lack of attention to other controls like physical distance, isolation, and hand washing. 

However, evidence does show that the use of any mask that covers the mouth and nose is more effective than no intervention, and that when those that are infected and those that are not infected are interacting (in whatever “essential” outings we’re engaging in these days), having both parties wear masks substantially decreases the likelihood of transmission. 

This is particularly important for the amazing grocery workers, delivery drivers, utility workers, tradespersons, plumbers, electricians, etc. who are necessarily still interacting with the public in some way. 

If your boss won’t let you wear a mask at work, and you would like to, please DM me.  

Obviously, no mask is a guarantee that a person will not transmit or contract the disease, but any mask reduces the chances when combined with daily body temperature monitoring, social distancing, and good hand hygiene.

While it is not official public policy at this point, I have been advocating strongly for a social media campaign to promote universal masking. Adopting universal masking will help reduce transmission rates. 

Additionally, and most importantly, it will help buy additional time for the healthcare system to increase capacity and improve treatment protocols for those suffering from COVID. When you are dealing with exponential math, a small reduction in transmission can result in the difference between thousands and tens of thousands. 

Starting Monday, if you are conducting any business in public, please, wear a mask. At the very minimum, use a bandana or scarf to cover your mouth and nose. 

There is an inherent social disincentive to wearing masks in public when they’re reserved only for the ill. In order to move that needle and change perception, we need healthy people to be seen proudly wearing their masks as well. Starting Monday, my friends and I will be wearing our masks and promoting them for everyone. 

There are many people already cranking out masks and looking to donate them. Not all healthcare systems are accepting them. There are also lots of patterns for making masks, and if I can make one, so can you. 

Wisconsinites: let’s be the state that does it differently. We all know what happens to places that waited too long to act, and a government proclamation or order to wear masks is not coming soon. 
Let’s not let it happen here.

We could all use a diversion from the current state of affairs. One escape for me is a game called ""Out of the Park Baseball"". It is an extremely powerful baseball simulation engine which you can also use to create your own custom leagues. After reading a post awhile back about someone who has a 50 team league in which all 50 states compete, I thought ""hey, we should do that with Wisconsin counties"". So I did.

Inputting 72 teams took quite a while, and there is a lot more I could do with this (custom ballparks, actual city locations for games) so I may blow it all up and start from scratch at some point. I also want more locally influence names for each county too. In any case, this is what I've got. I hope you enjoy the story. Ask me anything about the league you might care to know!

\_\_\_\_\_

It was the Spring of 2021. The world was just beginning to recover from the ravages of COVID-19. Wisconsin, like many states, endured suffering that was mitigated by intensive social distancing efforts. However, after a year without sports, Governor Evers and the Wisconsin State Legislature, decided that this would be their top priority. After weeks of intensive discussions and public debates, a plan was hatched.

To revitalize communities across the state and promote the love of a game that lost a year, a statewide baseball league, to be known as the Wisconsin Baseball League, was born. Each county across the state would get a team compromised of residents of that state. Exceptions were given to residents of more popular counties who had summer houses in the more sparsely populated northern counties. In the end, 72 teams were established, with 4 Southern divisions and 4 Northern Divisions. Each team also had a farm club of reserves as well.

The first season, an experimental 80 game slate, proved that offense would be a struggle. After all, the teams were compromised of mill workers, accountants, salespeople, and all other manner of regular folk. The pitching, meanwhile, was straight up dominant. The league averages in both the Northern and Southern Counties hovered around .190, while the pitching ERAs were a pristine 3.00. Kenosha took the crown over Wood County. After some suggesting the southern counties had a head start on good weather, the start of the season was pushed back to May, and the season expanded to 100 games.

Over the 31 year history of the league, no team had as many championship appearances as the Vilas County Eclipse, or matched their three championship wins. Brown County had the highest win percentage at .549, while the Adams County Superstars struggled to a .462 win percentage and only three playoff appearances. While some would point to the highest popular and warmer climates of the Southern Counties as a reason for imbalance, the Northern Counties actually won 17 of the 31 total Championships.

As the league enters the 2050s, the continuation of the league, which survives on taxpayer funding, game attendance, and concessions, will head to a statewide referendum. While the future of the league is uncertain, one thing is for sure - baseball is alive and well in Wisconsin!",wisconsin,The Wisconsin Baseball League - An OOTP21 Experiment
1778,thyusername,1585515768,frd9e7,Politics,"Good Morning, 

 

Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes and I understand that some folks have questions and concerns about the April 7th election. We want to assure you that everyone is working hard to get polling places and poll workers the resources they need to make sure voters stay safe. Clerks across the state are working overtime on election preparations to ensure that Wisconsinites have the ability to cast their ballot. Lieutenant Governor Barnes and I would like to provide an update on what we will be doing to ensure that Wisconsinites are able to cast their ballots in a safe manner.

 

On March 27th, I asked the Legislature to come together to take bipartisan action to ensure three things:

Every registered voter receives an absentee ballot to vote in the upcoming election;
Absentee ballots postmarked the day of the election are counted; and
Our election workers have extra time to count the influx of ballots.
We need to be doing everything we can to ensure that voters can participate in the April 7th election while still staying safer at home, so I am hopeful that the Legislature will act swiftly.

In the meantime, you still have time to register to vote and request your absentee ballot. You can check your registration, register to vote online, and request your absentee ballot until Monday, March 30. Here are the steps you can follow to get registered, request your ballot, and stay safer at home while you vote: 

 

1.   Go to www.myvote.wi.gov on your computer or mobile device.

2.   Check to see if you’re registered to vote

a.     If you are not registered to vote, you can do so by clicking the “Register to Vote” tab on the website. 

b.    From there, the website will take you through a series of questions confirming your identity and address. 

c.    Note: you will need to include your driver’s license number, which is the 14 digit code on your ID that begins with a letter.

d.    Already registered at your current address? Please skip ahead to Step 3.

3.   Return to the main page and choose the “Vote Absentee” option.

a.    You will need to enter information to confirm your address, which should be good to go if you’re registered to vote.

b.    You will see some options when you get to the next page, including requesting a ballot for all elections in calendar year 2020, the April 7th election or other elections in 2020, or the ability to request a ballot for this and future elections, if you’re indefinitely confined. Please pick whichever option applies to you. 

c.    If you are an overseas or military voter, you can follow the above steps, too. Your ballot will be accepted until 5 p.m. on Election Day. 

d.    This will take you through a series of prompts, including verifying your identity by providing a photo of your driver's license or ID card. 

e.    To upload a photo, use your cell phone, mobile device, or camera to take a picture of your state ID. This website is safe and secure.

f.    After that, the website will direct you to a confirmation page, which can you choose to print if you would like. 

4.   Once you have requested a ballot, you can follow up with an email to your local clerk confirming you sent in your ballot request. You might not get a response right away, but this is helpful for both you and the clerk’s office to track your submission. You can find a list of clerks here: https://myvote.wi.gov/en-US/MyMunicipalClerk. 

a.    Include in the email to your clerk your first and last name, address, and that you’re requesting an absentee ballot for the April 7th election. 

5.   If you requested an absentee ballot, you will receive the ballot by mail prior to the April 7th election. 

6.   Once you receive your ballot, please note that someone needs to witness the signature of your ballot. Considering the Safer at Home order, we understand this could be challenging for some folks. Here are some guidelines for who can serve as a witness: 

a.    Vote the ballot in the presence of one adult witness. The witness cannot be a candidate for the election.


7.   Please feel free to call our offices or respond to this email with questions or for further assistance. 

 

Our focus has been, and will continue to be, ensuring everyone has the opportunity to cast their ballot in the upcoming election. The bottom line is everyone should be able to participate in our democracy. We know this is a difficult time, and that everyone is doing the best they can to stay safe. We also want to recognize and thank all the clerks and poll workers across the state who are working tirelessly to find a solution to ensure that Wisconsinites can participate in the April 7th election.

 



The Department of Health Services (DHS) is working with local and tribal health officers, health care providers, and other partners to adjust the response to COVID-19 as needed. As always, the public should follow simple steps to avoid getting sick and help stop the spread of the virus, including:

Frequent and thorough handwashing;
Covering coughs and sneezes;
Avoiding touching your face; and
Staying safer at home.
As we continue to receive updates on the status of COVID-19, my administration will continue to share the most accurate and current information that we have. Thank you again for contacting our offices.

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

It starts off with steel drums, then a bass guitar, followed by a synthesizer and an electric guitar. I made out some lyrics from the guy singing such as, ""What's the matter with you, what's the matter with me, what's the matter with the way I ??? you now?"" ""What the hell has gone wrong, why do I sing a song, why can't you just run away, I got TV?"" ""I'm digging for you, I'm digging for you, I'm digging for you and you're digging me too.""

Some more lyrics I made out: ""What you want to believe, I can never achieve, I can never change the way I stay on down."" ""I can never explain, I can never explain. I can say I can't say he once gave me my mind."" ""I'm digging for you, I'm digging for you, I'm digging for you and you're digging me too.""

==INSTRUMENTAL SOLO==

The guy starts singing lyrics that correlate to burying a sin and smoking cigarettes as well as ""digging for you"".

I stumbled across this particular song a little over two years ago out on someone's curb from a recorded cassette tape that was made in the mid 1990s. So I searched everywhere online and I have found nothing whatsoever. I even used Shazam, Spotify, Soundhound, and Musixmatch. I still haven't found anything about it.

Could the song be from a local band? If anybody knows what the name of the band/song is, let me know.

Thanks in advance!

Unemployment public information can be found here:
https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/covid19/public/ui.htm


The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act temporarily expands eligibility for SBA economic injury disaster loans (EIDL) and provides an emergency advance of up to $10,000 to small businesses and private non-profits harmed by COVID-19 within 3 days of applying for an SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). To access the advance, you first apply for an EIDL and then request the advance. The advance does not need to be repaid under any circumstance, and may be used to keep employees on payroll, to pay for sick leave, meet increased production costs due to supply chain disruptions, or pay business obligations, including debts, rent, and mortgage payments.


Eligibility


In addition to the entities that are already eligible for SBA disaster loans (small businesses, private non-profits, and small agriculture cooperatives), eligibility is temporarily expanded to include:


*       Business entities with 500 or fewer employees:


*       Sole proprietorships, with or without employees


*       Independent contractors


*       Cooperatives and employee owned businesses


*       Tribal small businesses


*       Private non-profits of any size.


Additionally, you must have been in business as of January 31, 2020. Expanded eligibility criteria and the emergency grants are only available between January 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020.


How to Apply


*       You can apply for an EIDL online here: https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela/Information/ApplyOnline with the SBA.


*       When you apply, you can request an emergency grant of $10,000.


*       The SBA will provide the grant within 3 days of receiving your application.


*       You will not have to repay the grant, even if your application for a loan is denied.


*       You can visit an SBA resource partner who can help guide you through the loan application process. You can find your nearest Small Business Development Center (SBDC) or Women’s Business Center here:
https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance 



Can you apply for other SBA loan programs?


If you apply for an EIDL and the grant, you can still apply for a Paycheck Protection loan. However the amount forgiven under a Paycheck Protection loan will be decreased by the $10,000 grant.


For more information about SBA loan programs, please visit the  Small Business Administration &lt; Caution-https://www.sba.gov/ &gt;  . More information about small business programs in the CARES Act can be found on the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship  website &lt; Caution-https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/resources &gt;  .

Thank you for taking the time in reading this. I am currently working with other technical people, on a solution/system, that will allow anyone within a local community to sale their food products as efficiently and simple as possible to their customers, while maintaining a ledger of information about the source of their product. This system will be built to be as decentralized as possible, so each state entity manages and control the ecosystem for their given state. In other words, we will be family own services, not big corporation like amazon.

There are a lot of aspect to the system that we are building, but we are looking for our first (or possibly more) partner that will own and operate the business for their state (USA only right now). If you know anyone passionate about building something that will help the community build a self-sustainable food culture, please pass this to them, I would really appreciate it.

&gt; - There will be two poll workers at the poll book table. They will sit six feet apart from each other, behind a Plexiglas shield that is already installed at your polling location. These shields were designed and constructed by City Engineers. They are not to be altered. There is     space underneath the shield to slide the poll book forward for the voter's signature.
&gt; - The poll worker who is handing out ballots will also sit behind a Plexiglas shield that is already installed at your polling location. This shield was also designed and constructed by City Engineers, and is not to be altered. There is space underneath the shield to slide the ballot to the voter.
&gt; - Poll workers who are working in close proximity to others (e.g., curbside teams) should wear the plastic face shields that you will find in the supply tote. Do not stick your head in a voter's vehicle. Respect social distancing.
&gt; - Poll workers who are processing absentees need to stay six feet away from each other. We still want to keep an eye on each other for accountability purposes, but from a distance of six feet.
&gt; - A bottle of hand sanitizer should be placed on the poll book table. Voters should be encourage to use hand sanitizer when they step up to the poll book table. This will allow time for their hands to dry before they touch their ballot.
&gt; - A bottle of hand sanitizer should be placed near the polling place exit for voters     to use as they exit the polling place.
&gt; - Voting booths should be sprayed with disinfectant **after each use**. (This is an update from what we discussed in training.) Poll workers with fragrance sensitivities might need to avoid this task.
&gt; - **Never** use sanitizer or disinfectant spray on the tabulator or ExpressVote touch screen! You have screen cleaning wipes specifically for the touch screens (found in the ballot box).
&gt; - Spray ballot marking pens with disinfectant spray **after each use**.
&gt; - Voters may use their own pens, as long as they are ballpoint pens with blue or black     ink. No sharpies because they can bleed through the ballot. No gel pens (pens that write really smoothly) because the ink does not dry fast enough, gums up in the tabulator, and causes ballot jams. No green or red ink because the tabulator may not see it.
&gt; - Poll workers should not share the pen they are using with others, unless they first spray the pen with disinfectant.
&gt; - Poll workers are encouraged to frequently wash their hands with soap and water, or frequently use hand sanitizer.
&gt; - There are 50 pair of gloves in your supply tote. If you choose to wear gloves, remember that the CDC warns they may provide a false sense of security. Just because you are wearing gloves does not mean it's okay to touch your face. The Wisconsin Elections Commission has provided guidance on how to remove gloves [here](https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-04/how-to-remove-gloves.pdf).
&gt; - If you choose to bring a paper-based or form-fitting mask from home, you will be required to sign a green “voluntary use waiver” form. Cloth masks or other cloth over the face does not require the form. Based on CDC guidance, the City of Madison neither encourages nor discourages the use of cloth masks.
&gt; - Avoid touching your face.
&gt; - Sorry, no potlucks for this election.
&gt; - Each polling location should designate one poll worker to keep reminding everyone in the polling place to follow these safety procedures, and to practice social distancing.",wisconsin,The email sent to poll workers in Madison regarding PPE

Wisconsin clerks and poll workers who run Tuesday' election are older, and many, if not most are in the age groups where a much higher percent of the people who contract covid-19 are at risk for severe illness and death. Even younger heathy people who would not normally be affected by covid-19, but who have a modified ACE2 gene, are becoming severely ill and dying. 

Because there are cases of covid-19 all over our state, and thousands of clerks and poll workers running Tuesday's election, when you put these things together, the chances of a clerk or a poll worker contracting covid-19 at Tuesday's election and dying from it are almost certain. The chances of a clerk or poll worker contracting covid-19 and passing it on to a spouse or loved one is almost certain.

No postponable election is worth someone's life. No person's life should be put on the line for politics on either side of the isle. 

There is no reason the people we elected to our public offices at every level, cannot come together in this time of crisis - that is resulting in people dying, and find a solution to postpone this election. But clearly that is not happening...

It’s time for all of the county clerks, the municipal clerks, the deputy clerks, the chief election inspectors, and the poll workers to come together and demand a postponement of this election. It’s time they tell legislators that they are not putting their lives on the front lines, for an election that can be postponed, where those clerks and poll workers are very likely to be infected with a virus that will result in some their deaths.",wisconsin,Postpone Tuesday’s election

2151,Asklepieion,1586227612,fwcjrq,Nan,"Earlier today the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court intervened to block an executive order to postpone the election tomorrow in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Then, the Republican-controlled U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 as part of a separate case to block another move by Gov. Evers to extend absentee voting as part of a case brought by the state Republican party. These changes mean that absentee ballots should be post-dated by tomorrow or that, if you did not request or receive an absentee ballot, that you will now have to vote in-person tomorrow. Elections that had been scheduled in at least 15 other states have already been postponed because of the spread of the virus.

There are less than 12 polling sites scheduled to be open for in-person voting in Milwaukee, the largest city in the state and the city with the largest African American population — there are normally more than 180 polling sites available according to a report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The Republicans are aware that even minor reductions voter turnout, especially in more densely populated areas and areas that are more racially diverse, can be enough to swing state-wide elections in their favor. There is no evidence of significant voter fraud, the main Republican argument against these measures, in states that use vote-by-mail (e.g., WA or OR).

Throughout the state, hospitals are preparing to have subspecialist physicians (e.g., oncologists, primary care physicians, etc.) that are, in some cases, decades removed from relevant experience cover general medical inpatients. There are no more elective procedures and in-person outpatient clinic appointment availability has been severely restricted. There have been several other major changes at the hospital where I work that have been made proactively to service structures and call systems to prepare for the surge of these patients — it is really that serious. 

There are also other members of the community in essential roles (e.g., grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, community transit employees) that are also stepping up and placing their lives on the line every day for no additional compensation or even appreciation.

The Wisconsin Republican party is taking advantage of a national public health crisis to attempt maintain their white-knuckled death-grip on the state government, potentially allowing thousands to become infected and die as a consequence. These Republicans are using a highly-lethal infectious disease to maintain their minority-majority control of state government through voter suppression and are willing allow you to die, your parents to die, your grandparents to die, your family members with chronic medical conditions to die, and your immunosuppressed family members to die to do it.",wisconsin,Reflections on the separate SC decisions from a WI physician

The lawsuit is over the ticket resale giant’s recent [**shift from providing refunds to cancelled events to providing vouchers worth 120% of the order value**](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/03/stubhub-voucher-cancelled-events-covid-19/). The change, announced last week, has caused some to posit that [**StubHub is in dire financial straits**](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/04/opinion-stubhubs-urgent-peril-and-the-industry-response/) over the sudden impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on live events.

Filed in Wisconsin by Matthew McMillen, the lawsuit claims the company has no right to “retroactively” back out of its “longstanding ‘FanProtect’ guarantee… in response to apparent liabilities it would incur stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic.” While StubHub is providing refunds in states which have laws on the books requiring it to, residents of other states holding tickets to cancelled events are only being offered a voucher good towards future ticket purchases – a move designed to avoid potential liquidity problems stemming from difficulty in recouping payments already[(read more....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/04/wisconsin-lawsit-stubhub-voucher-policy-switch/)",wisconsin,Wisconsin Resident Sues StubHub Over Voucher Policy Switch

 Two of Wisconsin’s most popular gatherings have been pushed back two months. Oshkosh’s Country USA and Cadott’s Country Fest were originally slated to take place June 25-27 but due to the coronavirus pandemic, organizers have moved both country festivals. They will now occur August 13-15.

“This was a difficult decision to make, but safety is ALWAYS our number one priority,” reads a [**statement**](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialCUSA/photos/a.359589432775/10157150036437776/?type=3) from Country USA organizers. “We use this principle to guide everything that we do, and it is now clear that moving the event to August is in the best interest of everyone’s safety.”

Country Fest, on the other hand, was nearly cancelled entirely. With many festivals facing a daunting task of rescheduling and growing safety fears with holding large-scale events too soon, some have pulled the plug on their 2020 editions. Instead of falling victim to cancellation, Country Fest turned its focus to the positive impact it has on the local community.

“It would be easier for us to postpone Country Fest 2020 to summer 2021,” organizers said in a [**statement**](https://twitter.com/countryfestwi/status/1246090235425030144). “But we know how big of an economic impact Country Fest has on local businesses, partners, vendors, artists, and the Chippewa Valley community with all the employees we hire.
