20,20,MattyDoodles,1578020779,ej96ir,Nan,"Greetings from Colorado!  

For those of you planning on an Illinois adventure for marijuana to bring home, simply mail it using ONLY the USPS!  Don’t risk a possible federal trafficking sentence over a plant!  There’s a reason police camp a state line.  You get stopped 20 yards into the state before crossing the first exit, you can’t plead that you didn’t cross a state line with it.  Now, not sure how Indiana cops are, or your laws on marijuana, but Kansas troopers played this game all the time to fill their bankrupt state coffers.   Yes, yes it’s “illegal”, but it’s also a plant that can’t kill you and is only illegal due to racism, so I’m splitting hairs here.

Now, how do you mail it successfully?!  Here’s my advice below.

Pay attention to how you mail it using the ONLY THE USPS.  Only ship using the following USPS methods below:

First-Class Mail® items.
Priority Mail® items.
Priority Mail Express™ items.
Global Express Guaranteed® (GXG®) items that contain only documents.
Priority Mail Express International™ items.
Priority Mail International™ Flat Rate envelope and small Flat Rate box.
First-Class Package International Service items
First-Class Mail International items.
International Priority Airmail™ (IPA®) items, excluding IPA M-bags.
International Surface Air Lift® (ISAL®) items, excluding ISAL M-bags.
Certain Global Direct™ (GD) mail.
International transit mail.

The US Postal Inspectors, numbering around 1,200 are like the police force for USPS. They can open any of the mail services, though if it’s one of the services in the “USPS cannot” list above, they must get a search warrant to open packages that they believe violate federal law.  Yep, 1,200 officers for the WHOLE nation and search warrants to open.

Now, if you seal the contents in a smellproof bag, use a legit return address with a common fake name like Mike Pence (kidding..... Mike Johnson or something), ensure there’s not a shit ton of your fingerprints on the contents and possible stickers receipts linking you to the contents, pay cash at the USPS and don’t act strange and answer “no” to their question they must ask about hazardous items you should be fine.  Why would they question a normal package?  They only ship million of the damn things a day!  Oh, what about the drug sniffing dogs?!  You mean the ones that smell for bombs?  As the postal police are mainly there to secure the mail systemYeah, good luck with that.  

Now, you mail a package or two, take care to smell-proof it, you should never raise eyebrows.  Also, there’s the benefit of the doubt, as in there’s no actual way the post office is going to waste resources busting you over a SINGLE package, again 1,200 postal cops total and then needing a warrant to open that package. 

Even so, say you’re REALLLLLLY unlucky and that package is opened, who’s to say you aren’t mailed a package by a person that hates you?  Now, they could bust you if you’re dumb enough to leave your prints all over the inside and they set up a sting operation to get you to sign for your package, but seriously, you get someone at your door wanting a signature, don’t sign and play dumb.  Also, do you think the USPS, which is super cash strapped, is going to waste their time on a sting operation on small fish for one package.  That’s insane.

All that said, don’t get greedy and start a pattern of mailing tons of packages home raising the suspension of your carrier.  They aren’t stupid, they start seeing a TON of packages rolling in from Illinois right now they may actually set up a sting.

Best of luck Hoosiers, may you all eventually vote in politicians that allow you a frigging plant product sooner rather than later!",Indiana,To those of you buying weed in Illinois from your shady Colorado friend!

To change the map so it shows the **Indiana state senate districts**:

1. Click the basemap button (Next to the ""Menu"" button)

2. Look under the ""Overlay"" heading (mobile users scroll down)

3. Click the house layers to turn them off

4. Click the senate ""fill"" layer and then the senate ""boundary"" layer.

It may take a few seconds for the data to appear.  It depends on how busy the GIS server is and the speed of your internet connection.

I asked a questions on the Indy subreddit about marijuana legalization chances in Indiana in 2020 and the comment section turned into a very amazing list of people who want to only see their state ""mature"" I guess. Because they love their state. Here what I've noticed myself: 

1.  People in public are actually very polite and or they mind their own business

2. The ""bad"" or ""below average"" schools are staffed with people who work their butts off to make due with what they have because they are there for the children and funding in Indiana for schools is embarrassing

3. There is a LOT of work here. Again THERE IS A VERY LARGE VOLUME OF JOBS IN THIS STATE THAT PAY GREAT IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO WORK. And the majority of workers I've been in contact with here are (mostly) amazing.

4. The people of Indiana care about what is happening in it crime wise. They want a safe state for families, a vacation destination, industry and  education. That's not a lot to ask for

There is more but those are the 4 that stick out to me the most. I grew up in Alaska and moved here Tennessee.  What is weird is the south is probably the rudest place I've ever lived. It sucks down there. But here it is the polar opposite. I really love it here. My wife and I are completely shocked with that to be honest.

Specifically, in Richmond we have many great old houses.  I live in one.  The Crain Sanitarium, however, was bought a few years ago by a scammer couple who did a lot of damage to it, stiffed the contractors they'd hired, and left town suddenly.  Who really owns it now, I don't know.  What I do know is that there's a window opening where the glass has fallen out and is letting the rain and snow in.  It's on a West wall, so it gets all the weather.

Indiana Landmarks has an historical preservation covenant on the building.  I, and several other concerned citizens, have notified them of the defect and suggested that they spend $100 to buy a sheet of chipboard and hire somebody to put it over the hole in the wall.  No answer.  No action.

I previously bought a house in Seymour that had an Indiana Landmarks covenant.  Silly me, I though they would refer me to contractors who knew old houses.  Nope.  They don't know anyone, because they don't do any actual work.  I read up the law on the subject and a covenant or easement that is not enforced is void.  I think that also applies to the Crain house.  They can't hold anybody to standards they fail to enforce impartially.

I was impressed at the fast email reply, but dismayed by his position and reasoning on the current state of the impeachment trial.  

In short, he is ignoring any evidence save for ""The Transcript"" and the whistleblower report.  His position is ""if I only look at two of the thousands of pieces of information, and I use procedure and technicalities to willfully ignore the rest, and vote to not even think about looking for more information that might be relevant, then I can say that no serious crime is proven.""  

It is a disingenuous position that ignores significant and relevant testimony and evidence, some of which is publicly available today.  If he had a better argument, I was willing to listen to it.  Instead, he's just a coward like everyone else, as displayed by last night's votes on amendments, and his continued insistence that ""he's open to witnesses.""  I'm afraid this is just more spin and lies, and that he'll continue to betray his constituents, the country, the Constitution, the rule of law, and every moral and ethical code he's pretended to follow.  He will claim he ""considered allowing witnesses"" and decided against it, he will vote to ignore all logic and reason, and he will betray us all while lying to our faces in the hopes that he can get away with it politically.

Mike Braun still has time to not be a coward.  I really want Mike Braun to represent our state as a fair, just, and rational body of people that can make the right decisions at the hardest times.  Admitting you are wrong, voting on the side of justice despite personal cost, and calling balls and strikes, all of these are traits we're proud to hold core to our values here.  Instead, I'm afraid he's going to avoid responsibility, shirk his duties, and hide behind party lines to sneak through this critical time in our country's future.  It will set us back years, perhaps generations, and will definitely come back to haunt us all when we elect future presidents.  We need Mike Braun to reverse the timeline and fix these obvious wrongs.  

Please don't let us down Mike.

**\[BEGIN LETTER\]**  

Thank you for contacting me regarding President Trump. I appreciate hearing from you.

On September 9, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee was notified of a whistleblower complaint. The complaint relied on secondhand reports from unnamed sources to allege President Trump had improperly used the office of President to solicit cooperation from the Ukrainian President to investigate allegations of meddling in the 2016 election by Ukrainian officials and corrupt behavior from previous U.S. officials in Ukraine. The House Committee demanded immediate declassification of sensitive documents to investigate the claims. The President ordered the declassification and public release of both the transcript of the phone call between the President and Zelensky and the anonymous whistleblower report.

Before either the whistleblower’s report or the transcript of the conversation had been released, Speaker Pelosi announced support for beginning a formal impeachment inquiry in the House. As a result of that inquiry, on December 10, 2019, Representative Nadler introduced H. Res. 755, *Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors*, which included two articles of impeachment. On December 18, 2019, those two articles passed the House of Representatives on party lines.

On January 16, 2020, the impeachment trial began in the Senate with the swearing in of Chief Justice John Roberts. As a United States Senator, I am now tasked with evaluating the charges against President Donald Trump. The Constitution of the United States, which I took an oath to uphold, requires removal from office should the President be impeached and convicted of “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”

**Having read both the whistleblower report and the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, I believe that the impeachment proceedings can only be characterized as a politicized attack on the Trump Administration. The documents reveal a conversation in which President Trump talked to President Zelensky about alleged corruption that occurred in Ukraine beginning under the Obama Administration and continuing through the 2016 election, topical and highly relevant to the United States’ recent relationship with Ukraine.**

It seems to me that career politicians, distressed by President Trump’s election in 2016, have sought from the day after the election to undermine his ability to effect change. Instead of working on issues that the American people care about, like healthcare reform and infrastructure ^((ignoring the pile of passed HB legislation that the Senate won't take up)), the Democrats have instead decided to continue harassing the Trump Administration with flimsy and unsubstantiated claims.

As a United States Senator, I take my oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States seriously. This oath guides my decision-making in each vote that I take, and taking votes in President Trump’s impeachment case will be no different.

It is an honor to serve as your U.S. Senator from Indiana.  Please keep in touch with me on issues of concern to you. You can also follow me on Twitter or Facebook for real-time updates on my activities in the U.S. Senate.  If I ever may be of service, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Senator Braun,

As a member of your constituency I respectfully request that you support 
subpoenas for witness testimony and documents in the ongoing impeachment 
trial. The American public wants to hear from senior White House officials 
central to the events investigated by the House of Representatives. Please do 
not allow haste and process arguments to bury facts and evidence you are 
empowered to compel into view of the public. I call on you to show yourself 
to be a Hoosier of honor and integrity and conduct yourself with the 
consideration and diligence demanded by the gravity of our current 
circumstances. Hoosiers will not forgive you if you are complacent in the 
midst of a cover up or an accessory to that cover up. Allow all relevant 
facts to come into public view as part of these impeachment proceedings, and 
weigh these facts carefully and in good faith. Vote with your integrity to 
guide you: not Mr. McConnell.

Respectfully,

          On January 16, 2020, the impeachment trial began in the Senate with the swearing in of Chief Justice John Roberts. As a United States Senator, I am now tasked with evaluating the charges against President Donald Trump. The Constitution of the United States, which I took an oath to uphold, requires removal from office should the President be impeached and convicted of “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”

          Having read both the whistleblower report and the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, I believe that the impeachment proceedings can only be characterized as a politicized attack on the Trump Administration. The documents reveal a conversation in which President Trump talked to President Zelensky about alleged corruption that occurred in Ukraine beginning under the Obama Administration and continuing through the 2016 election, topical and highly relevant to the United States’ recent relationship with Ukraine.

          It seems to me that career politicians, distressed by President Trump’s election in 2016, have sought from the day after the election to undermine his ability to effect change. Instead of working on issues that the American people care about, like healthcare reform and infrastructure, the Democrats have instead decided to continue harassing the Trump Administration with flimsy and unsubstantiated claims.

          As a United States Senator, I take my oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States seriously. This oath guides my decision-making in each vote that I take, and taking votes in President Trump’s impeachment case will be no different.

          It is an honor to serve as your U.S. Senator from Indiana.  Please keep in touch with me on issues of concern to you. You can also follow me on Twitter or Facebook for real-time updates on my activities in the U.S. Senate.  If I ever may be of service, please do not hesitate to contact me.

&gt;Dear \[Senator\],  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I write to urge you and your fellow members of Congress to allow witnesses to be called in the current Impeachment Trial of Donald Trump.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In order to better understand whether or not President Trump has committed impeachable offenses, it is of the upmost importance that we be allowed to hear the testimony of those who have first-hand information regarding the alleged offenses. The White House has refused to comply with Congress to produce relevant evidence and testimony, which is a grave offense to the sacred checks and balances that are laid out in the US Constitution. This is a crucial moment in the history of our country, and as such it is imperative we revisit the first words of our constitution:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution.""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;We cannot honor these fundamental values, intrinsic to who we are as a country, while refusing to investigate potential corruption in the highest office thoroughly and fairly.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As a voting citizen of the state of Indiana, it is important to me that I know my elected officials are on the side of the law and impartial to partisan politics. A just, informed verdict is impossible without investigating all facts and questioning all witnesses. Your decision will not only be remembered by myself and other voters in Indiana, but it will also go down in history as a defining moment in how we value justice and liberty. Our government is built by the people, for the people-- it is your duty as a duly elected public servant to make informed decisions on behalf of your constituents.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,  
&gt;  
&gt;Your name

Thank you for contacting me regarding the Senate impeachment trial.  I appreciate hearing from you on this issue.

Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides the House of Representatives with the “sole Power of Impeachment” and Article I, Section 3 provides the Senate with the “sole Power to try all Impeachments.”  As Senate trial proceedings begin, I will uphold my duty as an impartial impeachment juror and carefully evaluate the facts and legal arguments presented.  I take all my responsibilities very seriously and I hope the proceedings can be completed quickly so we can get back to the work Hoosiers elected me to do, including reining in health care costs, taking care of veterans, keeping Americans safe and secure, and continuing to grow our economy.

Please be assured I will keep your thoughts in mind as I evaluate the evidence and legal arguments during the impeachment trial.  Once the trial concludes, I will provide you with an explanation of my vote.

Again, thank you for contacting me.  It is an honor to represent you in the United States Senate.


Sincerely,
Todd Young

 Lawmakers in Indiana are considering a bill that would make non-transferrable tickets unlawful in the state, but are facing strong opposition from both sports teams and concert promoters in their efforts. The legislation protects consumer rights to do what they wish with a ticket after they buy it – use it, give it away, or resell it – without restriction from promoters or primary ticket sellers.

“You bought the ticket, and that’s your property that you should be allowed to transfer,” bill author and Republican state Rep. Martin Carbaugh told the Indianapolis Business Journal.

The bill passed the House Commerce, Small Business and Economic Development Committee by a 9-4 vote last week.

As currently written, the bill does not apply to sporting events, and operators for the large venues in the area – Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Ruoff Music Center, and the Amphitheater at White River State Park according to the IBJ – are all in opposition.

Around 1998 or so my grandmother passed away and we attended a funeral for her in I believe the Muncie area. I was fairly young at the time so alot of this is vauge recollection but I distinctly remember my family found an ice cream parlor in what seemed like the middle of no where, and we stopped to cheer up. 

I cannot remember the name of the shop, but I remember they had a large wagon seating area inside the shop, with I think an old fashioned truck front end out the front of the shop? I also remember it was right next to a patio furniture shop, that seemed to specialize in custom wooden gliders and furniture.

Am I crazy, or does anyone else remember this place? I've been searching off and on for at least a couple years with no luck. Unfortunately my parents later passed away while I was still young and I was never able to ask them or get directions.

 An Indiana bill to ban non-transferable tickets was killed after it didn’t receive enough support in the House.

The bill[ **was introduced by Rep. Martin Carbaugh**](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/01/indiana-bill-non-transferrable-tickets/) (R-Fort Wayne), and it seemed like the legislation would garner enough support after it was passed by the House Commerce, Small Business and Economic Development Committee last month. However, ticket fraud and technology complicated the issue of transfer-ability and in the expedited short session, Carbaugh was unable to work through the bill and find a compromise, the representative said.

“It’s an interesting issue, but there were a lot more questions than answers, ” Carbaugh told the [***Journal Gazette***](https://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/indiana/statehouse/20200202/ticket-transfer-bill-dead-issue-not). “People feel very strongly about it one way or another.”

📷

Carbaugh went on to note that tickets are consumer’s property and they should be able to transfer them however they choose. He explained that if someone is sick and unable to use a ticket, they should have the right to resell it, however, venues are moving away from the option of PDF tickets in order to escape duplicates and fraud.

I just would hate to get rid of it as this is really why my SO loves this house. The wood stove is not near the cars, in fact is has a bar area separating the stove from the cars. However, I know none of this matters with insurance companies.

We are having our agent contact the seller to see who they have their home insured with, but we have a feeling, the insurance company may not even know it exists. I know in Michigan, my parents have a detached garage with a pellet stove, but I know codes are different by state. So I am posting here in hopes someone may be able to help us.

352,352,oneillschool,1581607716,f3bli8,Nan,"BLOOMINGTON and INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. – Indiana’s social assistance  industry has more than doubled in size since 1995 to reach almost 60,000  paid employees in 2018. However, less than half of those now work for  nonprofit organizations, down from about 70% prior to 2005, according to  a new Indiana University report.

The report, “[Nonprofit Paid Employment in Social Assistance: Update Report, Indiana 1995-2018](https://nonprofit.indiana.edu/doc/publications/employment/socialassistanceupdatereport.pdf),”  uses data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)  prepared by the Indiana Business Research Center (IBRC) and analyzed by  the Indiana Nonprofits Project.

Social assistance employees  provide key services that support Indiana families and help them meet  their life challenges. They provide child day care, employment training,  counseling, disaster response, and other relief services.

The  report’s findings show that nonprofit paid employment in social  assistance has grown during the 24-year period – up by almost 50%,  especially prior to 2003. However, for-profit employment in the social  assistance industry has grown much more rapidly and almost quadrupled  over that period, with most of the growth occurring after 2005.

Nonprofit  paid employment shows distinctly different profiles in four social  assistance sub-industries over the 1995-2018 period. Nonprofits have:

* lost market share relative to for-profits in the rapidly growing individual and family services subindustry,
* maintained their relatively small share in the slowly growing child day care Services,
* lost some of their dominance in the overall stable vocational rehabilitation services, and
* increased their strong dominance in the growing community food, housing and emergency services subindustries.

“While  our data do not allow us to document with certainty why these shifts  have occurred, it is likely that nonprofit social assistance providers  target their services more explicitly to low-income Hoosiers than do  their for-profit counterparts, so the shifts we are seeing raise  concerns about the continued availability of affordable social  assistance services in lower-income communities,” said Kirsten  Grønbjerg, Distinguished Professor of Public Affairs at the O’Neill  School and the Efroymson Chair in Philanthropy at the IU Lilly Family  School of Philanthropy at IUPUI. Grønbjerg directs the Indiana  Nonprofits Project.

At the same time, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of  2017 has reduced tax incentives for middle- and lower-income families  to make charitable contributions, and research has shown that wealthy  donors give disproportionately to causes other than human services. “It  is too early to know how this policy change will affect nonprofit social  assistance providers in Indiana,” Grønbjerg noted, “but they depend on  charitable contributions to help keep their services affordable.”

Our family was trying to get gas for our car, and there is a Fed Ex (Ground) driver blocking up and entire alley where we have to get back all the way to get out of. The driver is inside the gas station blocking up the entire alley. 

So basically the driver (small Indian man w/ mustache) comes out without making eye contact. Gets into the car, goes to the back to do something, then comes back and starts yelling at us and flipping us off and cussing us out verbally, but we cannot hear him because we are in a car.

459,459,oneillschool,1582640349,f9awzh,Nan,"The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation has named an [Indiana University project to improve health by solving pollution in Madagascar](https://research.impact.iu.edu/our-strengths/environment/solve-pollution/index.html) as one of the highest-scoring proposals, designated as the Top 100, in its [*100&amp;Change* competition](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/) for a $100 million grant to help solve one of the world's most critical social challenges. IU is co-leading the project with [Pure Earth](https://www.pureearth.org/) and the [University of Birmingham, UK](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx),  working with a multidisciplinary environmental consortium and project  partners in Madagascar. The project lead is IU O’Neill School of Public  and Environmental Affairs associate professor [Joseph Shaw](https://oneill.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/shaw-joseph.html).  


The proposal aims to implement and advance the work that was started with the creation of [Madagascar’s Health and Pollution Action Plan](https://www.pureearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Madagascar-HPAP-Report-1.pdf).  This plan, the first of its kind to be drafted by any country, was  developed by the government and people of Madagascar with the assistance  of the [Global Alliance on Health and Pollution](https://gahp.net/)  to address the country’s deadly pollution problem. Although Madagascar  is well known for its biodiversity — more than 80 percent of the species  in Madagascar exist nowhere else — its struggles with contaminated air,  soil, and water are less widely recognized. Pollution is the leading  cause of death in Madagascar, leading to one in three deaths. If it  continues unchecked, it will soon eclipse death by all communicable  disease.

The project brings together the strong will of the  Malagasy to solve pollution with the knowledge and experience of leading  environmental, public health, and pollution prevention experts whose  skills are needed to implement the plan. Additionally, the project  applies a process than can be replicated in more than 10 other countries  that have initiated health and pollution action plans.    


 “Madagascar’s willingness to lead the world in tackling the pollution  health crisis has attracted the interest of top environmental scientists  and pollution prevention experts,” said Shaw. “This initiative is  bringing together many of the most accomplished leaders in understanding  and improving the quality of air, soil, and water. Most importantly, we  are committed to ensuring the plan can be implemented in a way that  meets the needs and reflects the priorities of the Malagasy people, and  that these strategies can be sustained and adapted over the long term.”   


The Top 100 proposals represent the top 21 percent of competition submissions for *100&amp;Change*. The proposals were rigorously vetted, undergoing MacArthur’s administrative review, a [peer-to-peer review](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/peer-review-authentic-rarified-glimpse/), an evaluation by an external panel of judges, and a technical review by specialists.

Each  proposal was evaluated using four criteria: impactful, evidence-based,  feasible, and durable. MacArthur’s Board of Directors will select up to  10 finalists from the high-scoring proposals this spring.

Since the inaugural *100&amp;Change* competition, other funders and philanthropists have committed an additional $419 million to date to support bold solutions by *100&amp;Change* applicants. Building on the success of *100&amp;Change*, MacArthur created [Lever for Change](https://www.leverforchange.org/)  to unlock significant philanthropic capital by helping donors find and  fund vetted, high-impact opportunities through customized competitions.  In addition to *100&amp;Change*, Lever for Change manages the Chicago Prize, the Economic Opportunity Challenge, and the Larsen Lam ICONIQ Impact Award.

“MacArthur  seeks to generate increased recognition, exposure, and support for the  high-impact ideas designated as the Top 100,” said Cecilia Conrad, CEO  of Lever for Change and MacArthur managing director for *100&amp;Change*. “Based on our experience in the first round of *100&amp;Change*,  we know the competition will produce multiple compelling and fundable  ideas. We are committed to matching philanthropists with powerful  solutions and problem solvers to accelerate social change.”

#### Bold Solutions Network launches

The  Bold Solutions Network launched on Feb. 19, 2020, featuring Indiana  University’s proposal to improve health by solving pollution in  Madagascar as one of the Top 100 from the *100&amp;Change* competition*.* The  searchable online collection of submissions contains a project  overview, 90-second video, and two-page fact sheet for each proposal.  Visitors can sort by subject, location, sustainable development goal, or  beneficiary population to view proposals based on area of interest.  


 The Bold Solutions Network will showcase the highest-rated proposals  that emerge from the competitions Lever for Change manages. Proposals in  the Bold Solutions Network undergo extensive evaluation and due  diligence to ensure each solution promises real and measurable progress  to accelerate social change.    


The Bold Solutions Network was  designed to provide an innovative approach to identifying the most  effective, enduring solutions aligned with donors’ philanthropic goals  and to help top applicants gain visibility and funding from a wide array  of funders. Organizations that are part of the network will have  continued access to a variety of technical support and learning  opportunities focused on strengthening their proposals and increasing  the impact of their work.

#### What they’re saying

“We are  excited to be part of a partnership that holds such transformative  power. Madagascar, a member of GAHP since 2016, was an early adopter of  the Health and Pollution Action Planning process, bringing together a  broad cross-section of government ministries, civil society and  international organizations, to analyze the scientific data on pollution  and health, and select a set of priorities for action. The sustained  focus and commitment from this broad coalition to improve the health of  all Malagasy children has propelled us to this promising point.”  —Richard Fuller, president, Pure Earth, and board chair, Global Alliance  on Health and Pollution

#### More about 100&amp;Change

[*100&amp;Change*](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/) is  a distinctive competition that is open to organizations and  collaborations working in any field, anywhere in the world. Proposals  must identify a problem and offer a solution that promises significant  and durable change.  


The second round of the competition had a [promising start](https://www.macfound.org/press/perspectives/promising-start-755-solutions/): 3,690 competition registrants submitted 755 proposals. Of those, 475 passed an initial administrative review. *100&amp;Change* was designed to be fair, open, and transparent. The [identity of the judges](https://www.100andchange.org/#wise-head-panel) and the [methodology](https://www.100andchange.org/#scoring)  used to assess initial proposals are public. Applicants received  comments and feedback from the peers, judges, and technical reviewers.  Key issues in the competition are discussed in a [blog](https://www.macfound.org/programs/perspectives-100change/) on MacArthur's website.   


In the [inaugural round of *100&amp;Change*](https://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/sesame-workshop-and-international-rescue-committee-awarded-100-million-early-childhood-education-syrian-refugees/), [Sesame Workshop and International Rescue Committee](https://www.macfound.org/programs/100change/2017/) were  awarded $100 million to educate young children displaced by conflict  and persecution in the Syrian response region and to challenge the  global system of humanitarian aid to focus more on building a foundation  for future success for millions of young children.

510,510,oneillschool,1583164408,fce1ab,Nan,"Toddlers and young children spend much of their day crawling, playing  and climbing. For parents and child care providers, that means constant  mopping and dusting to keep floors and furniture clean and safe. But a  new peer-reviewed study, co-authored by two Indiana University  researchers, suggests high levels of dangerous contaminants -- known as  PFAS -- are finding their way into child care centers through the very  products intended to keep children healthy. 

 The study, co-authored by O'Neill School of Public and Environmental  Affairs researchers Amina Salamova and Guomao Zheng in the journal [Environmental Pollution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31901805),  is one of the first to examine PFAS exposure risks in indoor settings  other than people's homes. It found that PFAS are abundant in child care  environments, which leads to ""significant early-life exposures."" 

""Children are especially vulnerable to environmental exposures  because of how quickly they're developing,"" Salamova said. ""We really  need to better understand the exposures children experience in places  where they spend a significant amount of time such as their home, child  care facilities and even vehicles. These early exposures could have  harmful effects later in life.""

Poly- and perfluoroalkyl  substances, or PFAS, are a class of chemicals that have been widely used  for decades in firefighting foam and a range of stain- and  grease-resistant products such as carpeting, upholstery, clothing,  cleaning products, food packaging and cookware. PFAS chemicals are known  to leach into food from kitchenware and packaging and evaporate from  consumer products and get into indoor air and dust.

PFAS are highly persistent chemicals that have been linked to cancer, hormone disruption and immune system harm.

""We're  just beginning to understand how prevalent PFAS contamination is,"" said  Erika Schreder, science director at Seattle-based Toxic-Free Future and  one of the study's authors. ""The more we look, the more we find. We  know these toxic chemicals have made their way into our water, our air  and even our food. And now we can see they've made their way into the  places our children spend time learning, discovering and exploring.""

While  children typically spend the most amount of time in their own home,  they spend an average of seven to 10 hours a day in a child care  facility, making those places a significant potential source of  exposure.

The researchers analyzed nap mats and dust for 37 types  of PFAS chemicals at seven child care facilities in the greater Seattle  area and one in West Lafayette, Indiana. Researchers recruited a variety  of facilities including a former church, a former home and a facility  with multiple classrooms. Only one facility had carpeting. All the  centers were vacuumed or mopped daily.

Researchers found 28  different PFAS compounds in the dust samples they collected. Salamova  said the researchers were surprised that some PFAS were present in the  dust at child care facilities at levels higher than in homes in the U.S.  and Canada. Even more surprising was that the dust contained  unexpectedly high levels of fluorotelomer sulfonates, a class of PFAS  used in cleaners, waxes and polishes.

Researchers believe that if  the floor products are contaminating child care facilities, there is a  strong possibility they can be contaminating other indoor environments,  like hospitals and senior care facilities.

People trying to reduce their exposure to PFAS should avoid the following types of products:

* Foods packaged or served in grease-repellant packaging such as microwave popcorn bags.
* Stain-resistance treatments for clothes, shoes, furniture, luggage and carpets.
* Teflon and non-stick cookware.
* Personal  care products with ingredients that include the words ""fluoro"" or  ""perfluoro."" These can be found in dental floss and cosmetics such as  nail polish, moisturizers and eye make-up.
* Cleaning products that contain perfluorinated or polyfluorinated ingredients.",Indiana,"Cleaning products could expose children to dangerous contaminants at child care facilities, IU research finds"

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

I supplied at link to an article below about issues people are having with ISDH. We are on the brink of a major outbreak in our state due to the lack of support from our government. Our public services are failing us as citizens and our healthcare professionals. I am not blaming our state department specifically as they get support from the CDC. I am not here to make this a political issue. I am simply reiterating what many scientists and physicians have already said. Many ppl voiced concerns about the lack of testing and availability for screening. This will only increase the spread of the virus throughout the state and within our communities. After reading the article below, I felt I need to make you all aware of alternative resources outside of the ISDH. These resources provide screening and give direction on what steps to take next. 

Community Health Network - 24/7 call center  317-621-5500 

IU Health - 24/7 IU Health Virtual Visits app is providing virtual 

ISDH - there have been many issues with this line, but I want to supply the information anyways. 317-233-7125 now staffed 24/7

Most counties have webpages with additional information on how your community is handling COVID19. 

TL;DL - A woman was in a place where people had exposure to COVID19. The woman and her mother have had symptoms of COVID19. They called and emailed ISDH and left several messages with no response even 72 hours later. Others in the community have experienced this as well.

The amendment gives charter schools access to referendum dollars from local public school districts. School districts have increasingly been forced to turn to referenda, in part, due to the money being siphoned out of their budgets...by charter schools.

""Joel, you're going to have to speed it up. We don't have time for this tonight...""

What is Dysentery?
It makes you have to use the rest room CONSTANTLY which is a valid reason to stock up on it if you are affected. 
What the symptoms of coronavirus actually are:
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is characterized by mild symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. Illness can be more severe for some people and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties.
More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and people with other medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill.
People may experience:
runny nose
sore throat
cough
fever
difficulty breathing (severe cases)

So with this information available for everyone to read.
Can we please end this pointless hoarding of toilet paper rolls it is absolutely pointless as it won't help you unless you think your going to have to use the toilet 60 times a day a week.

658,658,Explorer2004,1584208373,fimdmy,Nan," I've said for years that we should have classes in the schools about critical thinking, or just common sense, but that we'd be hard pressed to find someone to teach it. Up until now, it's been a joke.  
So the panic buying is in full swing. Toilet paper is gone; Lysol, etc. Last night in the local Wal-Mart, people were discussing all sorts of things in line, while lamenting the lack of supplies. I won't bore you with the list, but there's plenty of aluminum foil left to line your hats with. Just don't try and find dry goods now, like rice and beans.  
A man in line behind me with three young children was talking about how there was (of course) no toilet paper. Oddly enough, there is no run on diapers here, or baby supplies. I told him that a baby wipe, if carefully used and folded (one single wipe) can do the job of probably 1/8 of a roll of toilet paper. It was like the light bulb went on over his head. For him, there seemed to be no critical thinking skills. *The ""herd"" needs toilet paper, otherwise, one cannot clean his butt!* No, if nothing else, you can use a Handi-Wipe washed in soap, or a washrag. Then again, you have to have soap. Sad to say, but I have to wonder, for how many people out there is soap a luxury item?  
Look up how soap, no matter the type, with vigorous hand washing, kills the virus cells. Antibacterial agents don't work on viruses, but the washing and the chemical makeup of soap goes a long way, as to tearing the virus up, physically, so it will die. Any old soap will do.  
Oddly, we still have bleach. There are plenty of cloth alternatives to toilet paper, and the water is still on. Granted, those in urban areas can't go out and find an old pump on an abandoned property, but in rural Indiana, there are plenty out there if you know where to look. No, do not bleach your butt! Wash the rag, and use that after it's rinsed and dried.  
As Grandpa recently said, ""Too bad they don't print those big Sears catalogs anymore, and it's not corn  season!"" Yes, the corncobs left out there now are not prime material after wintering! He's pushing 100. He's seen some things in life. He's survived some things in life. I once read somewhere that every time an old person dies, it's like a library burning. Find one and listen to him/her. You might learn something.  
So I'm alone wandering the garden center. I realize that not everyone can grow a garden. They don't have land, or they don't have much space in town. But every little bit helps. For example, if you can grow a houseplant, you can grow a tomato plant, or a pepper plant. No, a garden won't save you. But it's something to do, and it'll likely yield something. If I have to stay at home, at least I'll have that. Worse comes to worst? That Alpo country stew flavor or whatever it is, isn't too bad! I'd swear it's the same thing that comes in a Campbell's Chunky can. Found that out by by morbid curiosity, thanks. (Laugh, that was funny!)  
Not to start any fights, but my personal faith and belief system (especially at middle age) is that I do not care how much longer I live. Faith and religious beliefs are a hot-button issue, and arguing with one another over them does no one any good. And yet it seems to be a favorite pastime. I can see why, though, as those of ""pick a faith"" often like to use it to harm others, physically or verbally. They miss the point. And for just about any argument, there's a scripture for that.  
Personally, I place my faith in Jesus Christ. You don't? Fine. Have a nice day. You prefer Buddha? OK. No beliefs? OK. If you're right, and when you're dead, you're dead, and it's just nothing thereafter. If I'm wrong, oh well - the outcome is the same. What have I lost? Same as 'you'. Let's move on and agree to disagree, and tend to more important matters at hand. As the saying goes: Life – no one gets out alive.  
If I contract COVID-19, oh well. I've had a good run at this life. There is much in the news now about doctors in hardest-hit areas having to make choices. This is called 'triage'. Given the choice of treating a younger adult with children, or me, my choice is to treat the young person. Again, not to stir up a debate, but just hit me with something hard and fast, like putting a dog to sleep. If you're out of drugs, raid the police locker, call Walter White, and you can OD me with that. Or just hit me over the head with a good baseball bat. None of these little T-ball sticks, thank you!  
Humans, however, seem to be little more than panicky herd animals when the pressure is on. Selfishness, for far too many, seems to be the order of the day. I recall that 9/11 seemed to bring out the best in people. And now we have this outbreak, which seems to be bringing out the worst in people. Certainly not all, but a disheartening percentage. Many of the prepper videos I've watched over the years cite that when things get tough, you're going be fighting. Sad but true. I do NOT consider myself a prepper, either. As I said earlier, though, the old folks know a lot. I was raised in the 60's by a large group of them that likely knew God when He was in Kindergarten. Laugh. It helps. So do I know it all? Do the old folks? No. None of us know it all. I'll end with this thought: If this really gets bad, bad to the point of having to literally go hungry, then what good is all that money you made from selling hoarded toilet paper and Lysol wipes going to do you? So you made some money. Now the price of what YOU want has gone up, and perhaps that paper money we use (only because we have faith in it) isn't worth anything now. Gold, even? Why? You can't eat it. Why does everyone want it? At the end of the day, what we're seeing now only hastens the coming of the worst case scenario. “I'm gonna survive this!” OK, have fun with that, and enjoy what you've created.",Indiana,Alternatives &amp; Rational Thought

This is the only part of this post where I'll share my opinion outright. Right now, I am upset that our representatives are not speaking out against clearly wrong choices by the federal government and government officials. Representatives, including Donald Trump,  need *bipartisan*  criticism to be held accountable. Aside from the bully pulpit, Congress is a **coequal** branch of goverment able to limit poor choices by the president. Things I'm mad about: 

* House Republicans slowing down Coronavirus relief bill over abortion concerns (link)[https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/hyde-amendment-spending-package-democrats/index.html]

* Senate vote on Coronavirus relief bill delayed to Monday because McConnell with Brett Kavanaugh to [attend new federal judge Justin Walker's swearing-in ceremony.](https://www.wdrb.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-brett-kavanaugh-attend-federal-judge-s-swearing-in/article_1611593e-657c-11ea-abbf-7b4a682a00e0.html) **No Republican pushback, and none from our representatives.**

* No Republican representatives criticize [Trump’s mishandling of coronavirus](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/814881355/white-house-knew-coronavirus-would-be-a-major-threat-but-response-fell-short). In fact, many are [still not taking it seriously]( https://theintercept.com/2020/03/12/republicans-continue-to-deny-coronavirus-threat-as-public-health-official-warns-of-catastrophe/)

The governor and other state officials will conduct a COVID-19 briefing today at 2:30 p.m. in the south atrium of the Indiana Statehouse with the latest updates on testing and cases.

Here are additional directives from Governor Holcomb.

* Indiana will adhere to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for large events and mass gatherings. The guidance recommends no in-person events of more than 50 people. Here is a link to the guidance: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/mass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html
* Under the current guidance for schools, 273 public school districts are closed, using e-learning days, or on spring break and have announced a future closure. The Department of Education is working with the remaining 16 school corporations to determine their next steps and needs
* Bars, nightclubs and restaurants are required to close to in-person patrons and may provide take-out and delivery services through the end of March
* Hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers should cancel and/or postpone elective and non-urgent surgical procedures immediately. This action will help the healthcare system conserve resources and personnel necessary to meet emerging health needs
Physicians should continue to perform critical procedures necessary to prevent short-term and/or long-term adverse effects to their patients’ overall health
* The state’s Emergency Operations Center has been raised to a Level 1 status and will work in conjunction with the incident command center at the Indiana State Department of Health for planning, coordination, predictive analysis and other functions
State employees will maximize the use of remote work and meet virtually whenever possible while maintaining operations. Non-essential in-person meetings will be limited to 10 persons or less and should meet virtually whenever possible. High-risk individuals should not attend meetings in person
* State employees over the age of 60 with underlying health conditions are advised to work from home, and agencies should identify work that can be accomplished remotely for those individuals
* The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites, which are closed on Mondays, will close to the public beginning Tuesday
* The visitors center at White River State Park will close
Indiana state parks and recreation centers, including state park inns, remain open. Restaurants will convert operations to take-out and delivery
* State agencies already are developing remote work plans for employees and will continue to implement them while maintaining necessary state services. Employees who work outdoors are encouraged to practice social distancing
* The Department of Workforce Development (DWD) has suspended rules requiring certain unemployment insurance claimants to physically appear at a Work One location to engage in reemployment services for the next four weeks. This will ensure that individuals who may be symptomatic do not have to physically appear to continue their unemployment insurance eligibility
* The DWD will also request flexibility under federal and state law to expand eligibility for claimants and ease burdens on employers.
* The Indiana Economic Development Corporation will postpone the inaugural Indiana Global Economic Summit, scheduled for April 26-28
Communities are encouraged to work together to provide child care options for all who need assistance and delivery services of meals and other necessities for senior citizens
* Hoosiers who can donate blood are encouraged to visit local blood centers. Blood supplies are low. Please follow the guidance at www.redcross.org
* More information may be found at the ISDH website at https://on.in.gov/COVID19 and the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.",Indiana,Gov. Holcomb Announces More Steps to Slow the Spread of COVID-19

Indiana to offer Psychological First Aid training in response to COVID-19 epidemic

Intervention approach is designed to reduce the initial distress caused by traumatic events and to foster short and long-term adaptive functioning and coping.

INDIANAPOLIS – The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, in partnership with the American Red Cross Indiana, announced today a series of trainings in Psychological First Aid for Hoosier health care and social services professionals. Psychological First Aid is an approach to helping people who have been exposed to a disaster or traumatic event, in this case the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning next week, the Red Cross will offer two virtual, instructor-led for health care professionals, social services professionals and the like who may be able to help administer Psychological First Aid should they encounter Hoosiers experiencing distress or needing help coping.

“Being a health care professional is a calling, and now is our time to rise to that calling,” said Jennifer Sullivan, M.D., M.P.H., FSSA secretary. “In this time of enhanced anxiety and uncertainty, we want to do all we can to equip health and wellness professionals with effective tools to support the mental well-being of Hoosiers. Psychological First Aid is a tried-and-true approach to reducing the emotional effects caused by traumatic events, so that Hoosiers have the best chance of maintaining normalcy.”

The Red Cross and FSSA are making two opportunities available for professionals to participate in this virtual training. To register for one of the trainings, click the link on the preferred date below to register. Only the first 30 registrants will be accepted for each training session.

Tuesday, March 24, 2020, 1 – 4 p.m. EDT

Tuesday, April 7, 2020, 1 – 4 p.m. EDT
“We know that both medical and mental health providers are likely to encounter individuals who are experiencing various levels of emotional distress about the outbreak and its impact on them, their families and communities,” said Jay Chaudhary, director of the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction. “Providers should know how best to acknowledge the uncertainty people feel about emerging diseases and help Hoosiers understand that there is an emotional component to potential health concerns. This Psychological First Aid training is designed to help in this effort.”

DMHA also recommends that Hoosiers feeling distress or anxiety due to the pandemic call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Disaster Distress Helpline at 800-985-5990. This hotline provides live crisis counseling and is toll-free, multi-lingual and confidential. A text option is also available: Text “TalkWithUs” to 66746 to connect with a trained crisis counselor.

A Union Spokesperson told the Detroit Free Press that Fiat-Chrysler Is doing everything they can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 


https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.freep.com/amp/5030889002

This article was released earlier this week and the one below was posted yesterday. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/united-auto-workers-call-on-gm-ford-fca-to-shut-down-u-s-factories/amp/

While I’m glad the union is trying to do something, I feel the need to speak out. I’m an employee at KTP FCA auto plant and everything we are seeing being said to the media and public, is a lie. While I posted this in a comment in a different thread, I felt the need to make a post to reach more people. 

The first or one of the first cases of COVID-19 in Howard county was a man from my plant as the first link states.

A quote from the first link: 


""Consistent with CDC guidelines and the company’s own protocols, the company has placed into home quarantine his immediate co-workers and others in the facility he may have come into direct contact with,"" said Tinson. ""Additionally, the company has deep cleaned and disinfected his working area and is deploying additional sanitization measures across the entire facility, retiming break times to avoid crowding and deploying social spacing.""

A quote from the second link: 

“FCA said in a statement that it has already implemented extensive protocols to ensure the health and welfare of our workforce. We are continuing to carefully monitor the situation and are making improvements as needed. As a member of the joint UAW-GM-Ford-FCA COVID-19 Coronavirus Task Force, we appreciate the opportunity to share best practices across the industry.”

While I cannot know personally if the mans area was cleaned and sanitized (my union steward assured me it was), I can speak on the rest. 

The company has not deployed any additional sanitation measures despite providing cleaner to clean our work stations. As of now, March 18th, we have not been provided any hand sanitizer nor does anyone, management or otherwise, know when or if we will get more. The only hand sanitizer in my department that I’ve witnessed, has been brought in by the employee from home. 

The company has NOT retimed breaks, we are all going to break at the same time and crowding break areas. The only social distancing measure they have implemented is making employees stay at the same work station for the duration of their shift. This doesn’t help those who work directly next to others, less than 2 feet away. 

Another quote from the first link I provided: 


“As a reminder, Estrada said the UAW encourages all UAW members and others to wash hands frequently, use hand sanitizer frequently, avoid touching the face and avoid contact with others within 2 to 3 feet, if possible. Anyone experiencing symptoms of a high fever, dry cough or illness, should take precaution and stay home.”

I’ve already spoken to the fact that they have no provided any hand sanitizer but I’d like to address the last bit of the above quote. FCA works on a point based attendance policy as many places do. This means that there are some employees who have used their call-ins and have too many points to call in even if they have symptoms. If they were to call in, they could be suspended or worse, terminated. While I agree that those points or call-ins should be saved, sometimes that’s just not plausible for some people. We are not provided sick days here, so when someone is sick, they either use their personal days, vacation days, or come in and are sent home by the plant nurse. If an employee has come down with symptoms and doesn’t have a point to use or wrap all or vacation day, that person has to come into the plant. The only way they’ll be able to go home is to be sent home by the nurse, which means that potentially infected person has come into the building and potentially infected others. In a time like this, the way our attendance works is not working for employees. 

The only thing the company has really implemented is that they are sending people home with any signs of flu-like symptoms. So if they do test positive for the virus, they’ve still come into the building and potentially infected others, especially considering they aren’t implementing social distancing and are not providing hand sanitizer. 

In a time like this, with the virus spreading so rapidly, it’s places like my factory, who employee thousands of people, that will make this spread even faster.  Not to mention the other plants (CTP, ITP 1&amp;2, and Tipton) who also employee a lot of people. FCA employees people from all over the state and even people who do not live within Indiana. With the company ignoring the pandemic the virus will spread not only all over Howard county, but all over the state and possibly other states as well. I hope in the near future the company comes to realize their mistakes and corrects them, if not, I’m afraid Indiana will only get worse from here.",Indiana,"Union Spokesperson says FCA is doing everything possible to prevent spread of COVID-19, I’m here to tell you they’re lying."

Particularly after spring break travel. Indiana is only testing critical cases. They have no idea how many healthy people, kids, are passing this around oftentimes unknowingly. 


Sick people can't even get tested unless they are considered critical. So these ""numbers"" of confirmed cases are just that. Confirmed. If you're not allowing everyone to be tested you have no way of knowing how many cases actually exist. This is frustrating because Monroe County keeps reiterating they have no cases. That is dangerously misleading. They have no cases now because no one is being tested unless its an emergency.

With everything going on you'd expect the biggest hospital chain in the state to join others in helping their communities and employees. Sadly IU Health is not one of those. I have multiple friends who have told me the same story but are afraid to say anything due to retaliation. They are worried about getting sick and feel their bosses simply do not care. I was once an employee with them also. Here are some facts-

\- IU Health Billing is mainly handled at Revenue Cycle Services @ 250 N Shadeland. It's two floors with a basement. This is a billing building, no doctors. In at least one department that was confirmed they still have 50+ people in one big room of a call center. They want to lower it to 25-30 but even that just seems idiotic right now for putting that many people and their families at potential risk.

\- I got an email from IPL last night that they would be helping til mid April. What is IU Health doing? Business as usual! Patients are still going to get their bills and can still get sent to collections for not paying. They have the technology and are fully capable of stopping/pushing bills back before they are being mailed but have made no indication they will. Financial Assistance pretty much doesn't exist right now as well.

\- All of this just makes me utterly sick but I felt that people need to know this. People are genuinely having tough times and IU Health could care less as long as they get your money.

\-I urge you that if you or your loved ones have a bill with them to give them a call at 317-612-2754 and ask to speak to a supervisor. That's the only way this can possibly change.",Indiana,IU Health doesn't care about patients or employees during this outbreak. They still want their $$$ though!

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like this is all part of life 

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now. 

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

His family gross income is 34,000 a year for 3 people (two unmarried adults and a child) he claims his girlfriend and her child as dependents on his taxes making their tax household 3. I have two questions as this income surpasses the amount allowed for straight Medicaid.

His girlfriend has full Medicaid. I cannot figure out how this happens as she doesn’t have any personal income and he claims her on his taxes. Her daughter as well as he fully pays for them both (she is 14). I cannot figure how she qualifies as she is on his taxes and their income is too much. He has no idea either and she applies by herself so he doesn’t know what she does. Could she be doing something sketchy or is there a legal loophole for her to qualify. She is not disabled and doesn’t work at all. Her only child is 14. She will not give him any information about it. (Which disgusts me)

Is there another program for him to apply to that might subsidize health care for him? He works contract work full time in Indiana with no insurance offered through his employer. He isn’t a young guy and I’m feeling very scared for him if he gets sick.

If you fail to pay rent according to the terms of your rental agreement, you can and some will be evicted after the outbreak. 

So if you are late on April 1st, and you have a 3 day grace period to pay, and you pay on April 10th, after the outbreak is over you can be evicted. Some (including myself) Have gotten letters or notices from landlords stating this. There is no law protecting you from what happens DURING the outbreak. So it doesn't matter if you pay up before it's over, they can kick you out and there is nothing stopping them

I verified this by contacting the City Clerk of Fort Wayen and then talking with Small Claims. They stated that it's true and they would have zero way to help. So just because people say you can stay home form work for safety doesn't mean you will actually be okay. 

Things like this need to be addressed. People are being forced to stay home, and they should, people are dying, but people are going to lose their homes unless the wording of the policy is changed.

Now, before you tell me I'm fear mongering, I'm passing on information. This information can easily be accessed with a simple phone call to your City Clerk.

DECATUR COUNTY CONFIRMS 1st CASE OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS

Greensburg, IN - The Decatur County Health Department, in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH), has confirmed the first presumptive positive cases of novel coronavirus in 5 county residents. The patients are isolated at this time. 

The county is working closely with the state health department to identify any close contacts of the patient who might have been exposed to ensure that appropriate precautions are taken in accordance with the latest CDC guidance. At this time, the risk to the public is believed to be low.

“At this time, I advise the public to continue seeking their information from reputable and trusted sources,” said Decatur County Health Officer Dr. Arthur Alunday. “Websites such as The Indiana State Department of Health or The Centers for Disease Control are reliable sources for updates. I urge our community to remember that knowledge can help us remain prepared and level-headed as we continue to navigate this ongoing and ever-changing situation.”

Symptoms of novel coronavirus include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Like influenza, human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others through:
• Respiratory droplets released into the air by coughing and sneezing;
• Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands;
• Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands; and
• Rarely, fecal contamination.

The best way to protect yourself from any respiratory illness, including the flu, is to:

• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
• Stay home when you are sick.
• Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

I am a type 1 diabetic/immune compromised and I have family members at home that have recently contracted the virus. My boyfriend's son is also staying with us for a few more weeks and has had the sniffles and I'm looking for something to protect me as best as I can. It is no longer safe for me to travel home, I have canceled my flight and where I am currently staying there is no way for me to get basic deliveries (it's too far out for most deliveries) and most of all other products are out of stock or not purchasable online anymore. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find anything online to purchase a mask that's going to get here in a timely fashion/isn't fake/is heavily out of my budget range. I've spent the last few hours researching everything I can find to ensure the validity of some of these masks and it's too inconclusive for me to justify purchasing something that isn't absolute. I have no idea how long I will be stuck out here and I'm trying to be as safe as possible before finding a ride to take me to a store to get some supplies.

The problem isn't the damn list. It has to do with companies. Some are greedy, yes. Some are just trying to survive what everyone knows is coming (severe economic downturn). Bitch about the employers (but also be ready to recognize that your company might actually be essential to this country not completely collapsing).

Non-essential companies are, in fact, closing. Several friends of mine are out of a job right now because their shops closed up. Factories in Elkhart County (one of the hardest hit counties in the country during the Great Recession) are shutting down production.

So:

1) Realize the list is no different than any other state so far

2) Realize that it's not the easiest list to come up. Where does one draw the line to make sure maximum health impact with minimum impact to the country as a whole

3) Companies are going to take advantage of the situation because companies suck (but some companies are trying to survive both for themselves and their employees)

4) Your company *might actually be essential*. You just might not know your customers are.

I filed for his unemployment online and received a decision saying he was denied because his employer reported paying him $0.00 in the base period they have listed (10/01/2018 - 09/30/2019). This is easy to counter as he has pay stubs and a W2 showing otherwise.

I’m kind of confused on what this means. For starters, in the document they sent, it states “employers names” but doesn’t list anything and simply shows that “employers” reported paying him $0.00. 

Furthermore they emailed me back within 2-3 days of me filing for his unemployment, could they have contacted his previous employer that fast? I’m confused if his employer denied paying him (I don’t understand why they would do that) or if this is some mistake from the workforce department.

I have tried contacting the workforce department for the past two days but they’re not answering the phone. They also said I can appeal this but have until April 4th, next Friday.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

The team at Johns Hopkins updates the data multiple times during the day.  Each time you open the map or click on a symbol, you will see the **most recent data** that is hosted on the GIS server.

The map has **multiple GIS overlays** that you can turn on/off/restack.  These overlays include:

\* Cases by county (USA only)

\* Deaths by county (USA only)

\* Cases by state (World)

\* Deaths by state (World)

\* Testing locations (USA)

\* Hospital data (USA)

\* A layer with links to each state’s COVID-19 website (USA)

When the map opens, the overlay layer showing COVID-19 cases by county is displayed.  If you zoom in you should also see blue lines that are the county boundaries.  If those lines do not appear then the federal GIS server hosting that data is likely too busy.

Looking for the legend?  Need help?  Please read the **""Map tips""** \- link in upper left corner. 

If you take a moment to read the ""Map tips"" then you can learn (1) **how to make your own custom map links**, (2) how to make any overlay clickable and (3) learn more about the data the map can display including links to more information about the Johns Hopkins data.

Finally, be careful in interpreting the small yellow and magenta circles on the map.  Together they show counties (or states) where there is less than 10 \*reported\* cases.

For example, my friend works at a factory, classified as essential business, that just alerted the employees that there was a confirmed case within facility. They refuse to tell the employees who they were, what area they worked in (it’s a large building), or what areas of the facility said employee frequented recently (there are multiple break rooms, cafeterias, etc utilized by all employees). Their cited reason for keeping that information privileged is HIPPA. I found out speaking to someone that knows the infected individual that they worked in maintenance, which means they work everywhere in the building repairing broken systems. Said individual was working on the same water pumps that my friend was inspecting today. That area was not cleaned or sanitized since the employee tested positive. My friend was not notified, and no one in that area was notified. Does the employer have a legal obligation to provide more information to their employees? Does the employer have an obligation to shutdown for a given amount of time? What legal liability do they create by obfuscating vital safety information from their employees? Is there somewhere that this should be reported to the state authorities, in case the company is trying to hide this?

The Standard Celeration Chart (SCC) is a tool  used by some behavior analysts. It is a semi-log chart that displays rate of change in an effective manner.

Currently the confirmed new cases are accelerating at a rate in which new cases per day will double in a week. 

The tests being completed are unfortunately decelerating which reduces the amount of data that is being collected to analyze. This is the main issue currently with assessing the impact that COVID 19 is having within the state of Indiana. By having extremely limited testing requirements, we are essentially flying blind.

Deaths have jumped in their level but is currently showing a rather flat celebration rate (going neither up or down). I hope this trend continues to decrease or remain stable, but looking at other countries and states, we can expect for an increase in acceleration of deaths relatively soon. This is the number to pay the closest attention to, since it is less reliant on testing and more dependent on defining the cause of death.

If anyone is interested in seeing more of these types of charts there is a facebook group called 'Standard Celeration Charts and COVID-19' that is tracking data from all over the world. If you are interested in IN charts specifically, feel free to DM me.

Cummins to suspend production at southern Indiana plants

Columbus-based engine-maker Cummins Inc. plans to temporarily close its southern Indiana manufacturing sites beginning next week because of coronavirus-related business disruptions, the company said Saturday.

The move affects three facilities in Columbus and one in Seymour, Cummins spokesman Jon Mills told IBJ.

Affected employees will not be paid during the shutdown but they will retain their medical, dental and life insurance benefits for up to 90 days, Mills said.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza,
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

There is money coming to everyone on April 9th. Oh wait, nvm Mid April. April 9th isn't mid April. Oh we'll put a website for people to put in their direct deposit before the money goes out. It's 4/7 and it's supposed to go out in 2 days? 

Look, nothing anyone said they were going to do has happened yet. Oh well no one can be evicted because you lost work because of COVID-19 but they can evict you after for failure to pay during. Oh well there will be more money for unemployment. Okay, where is it?

I feel like if locking down everyone will save lives then okay. Let's save lives. But remember that this isn't our fault and we want to work but we aren't allowed to but oh every company will help. Welp that isn't the emails and letters that are being sent to customers. Some are the opposite.

Called ISDH, still no results. Told to call the questions hotline, I did...same story. Finally I call at 4:15 on Thursday. I was told they had created a hot line specifically for test results. If you were tested at the Fairgrounds and are still waiting on results, you can call **317-518-7184 Monday-Friday from 8am-4pm**. If they don't pick up, the voicemail is full, just keep calling them.

He works in microbiology in the product testing/antibiotic testing area as a group leader in a contract laboratory. I work as a legal assistant for a law firm in Manhattan. We have family in Merrillville and Plymouth (north west and northern IN) - we would have a place to stay in Merrillville while we got ourselves situated. A few questions- 1. Where is the furthest from Chicago that we could still reasonably live/commute in? 2. Is train access reliable/ a thing in IN or do people mostly drive in? 3. Our family tells us that the NW area of the state is becoming a medical corridor for Chicago- would you say that is true? 4.

Holcomb emphasized that all elective procedures should stop, including elective abortions. He then went on to say that medical professionals determine what is necessary and the legal counsel provided additional clarification saying that any procedure that would have a lasting effect on a patient's life or was time sensitive should still be performed. She then emphasized that per the Supreme Court, Hoosiers have a right to abortion services, and the doctors and patients need to be the ones making these decisions, not politicians or lawyers. 

I'm genuinely proud of Holcomb. It may be genuine, it may be to avoid lawsuits, but it was the right position and not one that I'm hearing other GOP governors taking.

I am an EMT in New Jersey and my town has been lucky enough to get two trucks and crews from a company in your state to assist us in dealing with the amount of extra calls because of COVID-19. They have been a welcome addition not just for work, but as friendly faces that we look forward to seeing them. Now a lot of what they need is being taken care of by the state but we are trying to figure out a way to make home feel a little closer. Unfortunately, we are at a loss on that front. So I have thought to turn to you for help. What is something that we can source or create to make it feel like home? We are all open to suggestions. Thanks in advance.

238,238,Slinkwyde,1587176315,g3fpvz,Nan,"Texan here. I've never been to Indiana, but I recently watched some documentaries (like 
 [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVNKiGCD9r0)) about Gary's decline, and they said its best chance at returning to some level of hope and viability lies in its black churches (inspiration, community, church programs, volunteering, and outreach, with pastors from different churches collaborating on ideas), in tearing down blight, and in taking advantage of the city's strategic geographic location (roadways).

That all got me thinking. This pandemic has got to be hard in Gary. Obviously, people should not be congregating in churches. We're supposed to stay apart. In such an impoverished city, I'm guessing there's a fair number of people with bad Internet or no Internet at all, as well as people who are uninsured or underinsured. With so many businesses having left the city, residents were having to travel outside the city just to get basic necessities. I'm not sure if they have delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, Instacart, Uber Eats, etc, and I don't know what the healthcare situation is like. Gary's population was 85% black in 2010, and Covid-19 has hit black communities disproportionately hard. In nearby Chicago, blacks make up 30% of the population but 72% of Covid-19 deaths. And if the elderly are particularly vulnerable, then that means Gary could lose a lot of the people who still have positive memories of what Gary was like in the '50s and '60s. There's also the economic toll of this disease, making unemployment even higher than it already was, further adding to the sense of hopelessness there. By the time the pandemic itself starts to decline, this country could possibly find itself in something like the Great Depression.

Basically, I'm thinking that if there ever *was* any real hope of Gary slowly getting back on its feet and eventually returning to some level of viability, this pandemic seems to have dashed that entirely. But this is all just my own speculation as an outsider. As people in Indiana, what have you actually been hearing about how the people of Gary are faring right now?",Indiana,"How are the people in Gary, IN holding up during this pandemic?"
