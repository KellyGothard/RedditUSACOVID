With the new law that officially designates the left lane as a passing lane and makes it unlawful to slow traffic in the left lane, this is even more important. If you are in the left lane and someone is behind you please just move over. Don't brake check them or try to slow them down, just move over.

61,welltraveled13,1577995242,ej3bxm,Nan,"  

About me; I’m an early 30s professional who is from TX originally, where I also did my undergraduate and have also lived in AZ, CA (for my MBA), and TN. This is a frequently discussed topic and so I think I’m well traveled enough to put in my 2 cents.

PROS:

1) **Excellent Economy** – This applies mostly to the F500 level 

2) **Ability to be a “big fish” in a small pond –** I can’t think of another metro where I could do this so easily. There’s just plain not that much competition and it’s easy to be a “big fish” in a small pond compared to other metros, especially considering the ability to do business with other F500s in the area. This is well documented of well educated professionals coming to MSP/MN early in their careers and then moving on… I suppose I am a good example of that! 😊

3) **True friendship/relationships -** the handful of people I met here at a personal and professional level have/will be lifelong friends, which is something I cherish. It’s a quality over quantity thing in this State

4) **Great infrastructure**\- well documented as great for biking and they do an OUTSTANDING job of handling the snow storms which has always impressed me

5) **All major sports** \- although there are no “winners/champions” here, you can support sports at all levels here which is nice

6) **Great suburbs** – You can honestly say this about any other metro in the country honestly but I like Wayzata, St. Louis Park, Plymouth, Maple Grove, etc

7) **Excellent Airport** – This is actually my favorite airport in the country due to cleanliness, amenities and it somehow allows for flights in inclimate weather lol

CONS:

1) **Isolated location** – you are AT LEAST 3 hours to any other metro worth a damn and 6 or so hours from Chicago. This also correlates to other negatives that I will explain later

2) **Brutal Snow Seasons** – I actually don’t mind the “cold”(unless it’s in the NEGATIVE degrees) but the actual “buildup” of snow makes commuting a nightmare and some times just plain dangerous. Although they do a great job of handling the snow during most months, come March, when you’re driving down 100 and it’s just a layer of snow, it becomes dangerous. This make commuting anywhere outside of a 5 mile or so radius an “adventure” in the winter months.

3) **Little Brother Syndrome** – Although there is a good F500 presence, there is a bit of a “wannabe” mentality. The reality is that this is a 3rd tier city and a great “starter city”, this has to be because it’s not a “destination city” I suppose. But it’s annoying. It’s as if locals have to “tell themselves” that it’s better than it really is… 

4) **Covert Racism** – I’m all about judging people based off how they carry and present themselves, but if you’re:

a) A well educated successful, upper middle class Black who isn’t an Athlete or a Criminal

b) A well educated, very successful, attractive Asian that is from the U.S. and has family in the U.S.

c) A well educated, successful Latino that isn’t an illegal and has family in the U.S. and went to college

You might as well be from another planet here. I don’t think they’ve been “exposed” to other metros, or the rest of the U.S. for that matter(lol) so it’s kind of sad. But may be due to the location. No idea. But for a “progressive city” I never understood this. It’s just a faccade.

5) **Wealth Gap** – The drop off between the wealth of the F500 (and say everyone involved in Cargill and Big Tech) and the rest of the metro is OUTSTANDING. There is not really a “middle market” economy here. This kind of always “surprised me” as I feel that everyone within the F500 economy, we all kind of “know each other”, but then there’s the rest of the State that is “cut off” per say. This also leads to the well documented stories of people joining a F500 early in their careers and either getting married to someone else WITHIN or leaving for another bigger/better metro due to good experience, exposure, and connections within industry

6) **Overrated Lake Scene** – The lakes are nice, but some act as if it makes MN “special”. The reality is that the rest of the country has nice lakes, rivers, beaches, etc and are arguably nicer than the ones in MN. I don’t get it. It’s not like you can’t find a good lake/boat scene in TX, CA, NY, TN, etc. 

7) **Passive Aggressiveness** – The true friendship/relationships I mentioned before are great, but that also comes with a caveat of the passive aggressive nature of some of the locals. Again, I think this has to be with the location and MN/MSP not being a “destination city”. Due to this, as many transplants have noted, it can be a bit “tough” to make friends at first.

8) **Minnesota Nice** – I don’t get why people bring this up. I’m from the South originally as I mentioned and “Southern Charm” really does mean “Southern Charm”. I feel like people were just 100% honestly “nicer” in the South. So I don’t understand where this term came from. I don’t find people in MN to be all that friendly to be honest with you.

9) **Fly Over Central** – This is correlated to a few others but I bring this up because when people think “Midwest” they think more like Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Cincinatti(sp?), St. Louis, etc. And the culture of MSP/MN to those areas is VERY, VERY, VERY different. You might as well not include MN/MSP in the Midwest and include it in Canada. Due to this, people often “disregard” MN/MSP unless it’s for a connecting flight to another location(lol) and you get that Little Brother Syndrome. Due to this, I don’t see that changing here for awhile considering the weather, location, etc.

**Doesn’t feel like a “Midwest” State**\- I may be a little biased but I do work with clients in Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Kansas City. And the overall vibe and culture in those areas is MUCH different than in MN/MSP. It’s definitely a different or “weird” culture compared to those metros and States. It’s hard to explain, but if you have friends, do business, or have other reasons to go to other States, you can tell. I would classify those other metros as  the “Midwest” and MSP/MN as “something el",minnesota,PROS and CONS from a transplant

**When**: Weds Jan 8 at 1pm ET

**More info**: As the climate crisis intensifies and federal inaction remains, governors across the nation are taking matters into their own hands. A bipartisan coalition of 25 governors, known as the U.S. Climate Alliance, have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  **Minnesota Governor Tim Walz**, **New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham,** and **Hawaii Governor David Ige** are three governors who have prioritized climate action since coming into office. 

Join us for a webinar on gubernatorial action on climate change, featuring the executive-branch officials leading climate efforts. From Minnesota, Environmental Quality Board Executive Director **Will Seuffert** will speak on the state’s recent executive order to create a Subcabinet on Climate Change. Representing New Mexico, Sustainability and Resilience Officer **Laura Tabor** and Environmental Protections Director **Sandra Ely** will discuss the state’s recent emission-reduction recommendations, which evaluates the adoption of an economy-wide cap-and-trade program. From Hawaii, **Anukriti Hittle**, who helps lead Hawaii’s climate change mitigation and adaptation work at the Department of Land and Natural Resources, will discuss some of the state’s recent initiatives. From Maryland, Department of Environment Secretary **Ben Grumbles** will provide an overview of what the state is currently doing to address the climate crisis.

My fiancé and his two teenage kids will be moving to Minnesota from Louisiana at the end of the school year. I'm from the northern suburbs, but left for college at 18 and never lived here as an adult. I'm living with family for a couple months now before everyone else relocates up, so I've had a lot of time to browse rentals online and get an idea of what might be available in the future. I'm just not sure of when exactly we should expect to more seriously tour places, meet landlords, etc. We are not interested in buying until my fiancé finishes grad school here, but we know we'd love to rent (and eventually buy) a home or townhome in the Arden Hills/Shoreview/Mounds View area to be close to my family and in the Mounds View school district. Anyone have personal experience renting in this area? My only experiences renting were in Louisiana, and rentals moved lightening fast there and it was much better to hit the pavement and look for rental signs in yards or through word-of-mouth rather than look online-- is that the case here as well?

I'm moving to the twin cities area from out of state with my wife who is from Minnesota. I've visited a few times including the time I met my wife but have never explored the city. We are moving back and we are looking for a good bar to unwind on Friday nights. 

We are moving from Tuscaloosa Alabama where our normal haunt was a bar called Loosa. If you are in Tuscaloosa, I highly suggest visiting this bar. 

The things we love about Loosa is the laid back atmosphere where they have couches for resting, normal bar tables, free to play emulators, and pinball machines. The bar is both big and small at the same time. Bartenders are wonderful people who know your taste and can tell you what you want before you know it yourself; not to mention, 63 taps of craft brews. Not a Budweiser in sight.

I am moving to Minneapolis after living in Georgia for my whole life. I am concerned about keeping my car running. I am curious about battery warmers specifically, the flexible insulated pads that you wrap around the battery and plug in. Is this generally necessary for a car that sees daily regular usage? I will be driving to work, errands, the gym etc every day so I am not concerned about the charge so much as just getting it going in the morning. Can these things be left around your battery all day long, and just plugged in before bed, or early in the morning? I am having trouble finding comprehensive instructions and guidance on how they are used. 

Beyond the battery stuff, I am interested in any general advice about driving and car maintenance that a life-long southerner might not be aware of.

In reference to Beltrami County’s recent vote against refugee resettlement, I’ve heard many arguments that have been used time and time again in the past: We can’t afford it. They may not assimilate. We have to worry about “our own people” first. Time and time again, these cases have been made. And time and time again, they have been proven wrong.

Communities thrive when immigrants and refugees are welcomed. They are workers and consumers. They are parents and teachers. Most importantly, they are people; human beings who want the same thing “our own people” want: A better life for themselves and their children. They are our people. And their story is our story.

Most of us in the state of Minnesota are the children of immigrants. Our grandparents and great-grandparents left behind everything they’d ever known on the gamble of a better life here in America. The fact that we are here today is a testament to their courage and the risk that they took for us. Who are we to deny that opportunity to the next generation?

How can we as the sons and daughters of immigrants deny refugees the blessings of liberty and freedom that we hold dear? What do we say to them? “You aren’t welcome. You don’t deserve the same freedoms as us. Some lives matter more than yours.”

Beltrami County must join the rest of Minnesota and welcome refugees in need. You may hide behind your walls and your excuses and your cowardice that you have mistaken for patriotism. As for me, my home, and my country, refugees are welcome, now and always.",minnesota,In Response to Beltrami County’s Refugee Resettlement Vote

&amp;#x200B;

Neat article about how Minnesota is completely leading the way when it comes to community solar. They've installed nearly three times as much capacity as the second-best state, Massachusetts. The article goes on to highlight the main community solar states and their total progress so far, but it also argues that Minnesota's is much more successful than others because of one thing - the way the program was designed. The state places no caps on the development like many other states do. It simple, but it's still quite uncommon.

&amp;#x200B;

I [work](http://powermarket.io/) in community solar, so I'm obviously an advocate of it. Quick explainer if you're not familiar - rather than building your own solar array on your property, you just buy the electricity a large farm produces. People like that they don't have to install or maintain anything. And 99% of the time you're guaranteed to save money. Renters typically like it, so do people who can't afford the steep cost of building their own system, or others who, for whatever reason, are unable to build it on their own properties, etc.",minnesota,Minnesota has over twice as much community solar than any other state!

My fiance too (also a transplant) to a lesser extent. I've noticed the long Ohhh come out some time, but also ""yah"", and the hard R. People often mention the ""o"" but not the ""r"" but the upper Midwest ""r"" is very prominent. It's similar to how Irish people say their ""rs."" I've also notice it creep up in the way I say ""tire"" and ""fire"" sometimes. Sometimes it's more neutral general American, sometimes it's a laidback ""tahr"" and sometimes it's a very northern ""ta-yer."" Hard to write it out but if you listen to the way some people say it you may know what I mean. I have even said ""beg"" for bag on the rare occasion. I think the fact that any native born roommate I've had, has had the accent fairly noticeably, plus many coworkers and clientele. 

Now, people try to say that in the cities, the accent is hardly there. Not true lol. It's very noticeable for me. It's not as thick as in Bemidji, of course, but it's definitely there.

389,check_my_references,1579211216,epq6ou,Nan,"I'm in my late 20's, live in the northern suburbs, and have yet to move out due to the crazy housing market. I have the philosophy that I'd rather skip the risky and junky 200K starter homes of today and save for something better. The thing is, home prices and selection keep getting worse and worse, and the price for a nice, problem-free (or minimal issue) home keeps jumping higher and higher. I'm at the point now where I'm so frustrated that I'm considering alternate, weird options.

For those of you that say ""Just buy the cheapest home and fix it!"", I would, but home values are so high that current prices leave no room for a repair budget. Most of the homes I've seen in the mid-100 thousands are practically in tear-down condition, and would need at least 80-100K in repairs. As a single person with a moderate salary, this isn't doable (both financially and labor-wise). Cost is one thing, but also I don't want to put 250K in a house that sits in a neighborhood full of houses that go for 199K. I'll be stuck for years if I ever need to move.

I looked at shipping container homes (Black Box homes out of Minneapolis), but after research of similar container homes, ballpark costs went straight into the mid 200-thousands (finished) for roughly 1500 square feet. I'm not against spending 200-230K (my budget), but there's no way I'm throwing the dice and spending that much on a non-traditional home. Who knows what the resale will be in the future. I wish I could build a 1500 square foot container home with a two or three car garage for about 150-175K (with lot / turn-key). 

There are prefabs, modular homes, and I even watched a video of a guy that converted a 727 to a home. But there's another problem; where can I even use one of these alternate structures? I'm sure it wouldn't matter in the middle of the woods in cabin territory up north, but I live/work about 30 minutes north of the metro. 

I know there's a lot of discussion around the most important issues for the next election cycle, but it's disappointing that there's almost nothing being discussed around our current housing crisis. I know Minneapolis has the 2040 plan, but I'm skeptical this will cause enough people to move to open up inventory and lower prices in the 'burbs.

We're planning on staying in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, and we're going to rent a car and possibly rent a cabin on a lake. I guess I just have a few questions:

1.) Any recommendations for cabin rentals?
2.) What sights are the best to see? From a local and tourist perspective
3.) Are the people really that friendly? (I hope they are!)
4.) ...How bad are the winters? We're used to pretty cold winters, but from what I've heard it's pretty brutal in MN.

**Step one**: Contact your state representatives and let them know you want them to vote for or against a thing. That information can be found by plugging your address in here: [https://www.gis.leg.mn/iMaps/districts/](https://www.gis.leg.mn/iMaps/districts/) 

**Step two:** Get other people to contact their representatives. So, share the link from step one to other like-minded people.

**Step three:** Show up to your local caucuses, prepared with a resolution form. Optimally, you'll be using the same language as other people at multiple locations, so work on the language with people across the state and come up with something that is simple and drives the point home. 

Here's the resolution form for the DFL: [https://www.dfl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Resolution-Form-2019-09-24\_Call\_FINAL\_Rev\_A\_adopted\_21\_September\_2\_001.pdf](https://www.dfl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Resolution-Form-2019-09-24_Call_FINAL_Rev_A_adopted_21_September_2_001.pdf)

I could find no form on the GOPMN site, so here's one from 2018 by people wanting to ban the hunting of wolves: [http://www.howlingforwolves.org/sites/default/files/HFW\_2018\_MN\_GOP\_Resolution\_Form.pdf](http://www.howlingforwolves.org/sites/default/files/HFW_2018_MN_GOP_Resolution_Form.pdf) Edit appropriately.

**NOTE:** Don't check out once your topic is covered. That shows you're a single topic flake, and are only in it for yourself (which is why I'm sick of your shit). If you expect your neighbors to help you, you better be prepared to help them as well.

**Step four:** County based petitions. Each county has different requirements for getting things on the local ballot. 

**Step five:** Learn from errors and repeat. It's not going to immediately succeed, and you'll need to continue to put effort in for it. When people say they don't want to vote for it, ask why, and record that info down. Just shut the hell up and let them speak and take notes. Then address the notes the next year in your resolutions and petitions. 

Eventually, with that, you'll legalize marijuana. 

**BONUS HELP:** Here's the statutes for Minnesota that mention Marijuana: [https://www.revisor.mn.gov/search/doc\_result.php?keyword=marijuana&amp;keyword\_type=all&amp;stat=1&amp;search=stat&amp;stat\_year1=2019&amp;stat\_year2=2019&amp;stat\_chapter=](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/search/doc_result.php?keyword=marijuana&amp;keyword_type=all&amp;stat=1&amp;search=stat&amp;stat_year1=2019&amp;stat_year2=2019&amp;stat_chapter=)

Now I'm back in Minnesota and have been scouring tappd for triple IPAs but to my surprise they're super rare to find. Maybe it just hasn't reached us yet? Until a couple weeks ago I had never even experienced a triple IPA so I didn't know what I was missing. Heck I feel like double IPAs have only just recently exploded in popularity in Minnesota. Maybe we're just late to the game. I honestly think if more breweries offered them more consistently they'd be a hit. They're certainly the rage in Arizona right now. And I for one am 100% onboard.

If anyone can recommend a good Triple IPA that is currently available please let me know, thanks!

For reference check out Wren House Brewing company. Look at their Instagram @wrenhousebrewing to get a glimpse at the thick smooth juicy triples. Their Cold Boy Wally is the best beer I've ever had.",minnesota,Where can I get my hands on a good Triple IPA?

# BARK Rangers at the park

Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is kicking off a new dog program in the new year! [The BARK Ranger program](https://www.facebook.com/pg/MissParkConnection/events/) is an opportunity to learn more about the ecosystem restoration at Coldwater Spring and for dog owners to commit to doing their part to ensure this space is the best restored oak savanna prairie it can be. It's a fun and inclusive solution to help dogs and their owners enjoy the park while keeping it safe through stewardship.

Prospective BARK Rangers will learn about the history of the site, go on a walking tour with national park staff, get sworn in as a BARK Ranger, and receive a BARK Ranger dog tag. Join us on [February 20](https://www.facebook.com/events/781556265689320/) or [February 29](https://www.facebook.com/events/2609302955854070/) at Coldwater Spring.

-You or someone you know knows someone who has a Denny Hecker or Prince story (I haven’t heard any Bob Dylan stories). Maybe you have one yourself.

-You laugh on the inside when people say Iowa or Texas have the best state fair, before telling them in your best MN Nice way that their opinion is objectively wrong

-You went to your county fair.

-Your county fair had a demolition derby or tractor pull, and you watched while eating some damn good cheese curds. 

-You ponder the necessity of a new plague at the state fair, or at the renaissance fair.

-You hate suburban drivers. This goes for anyone, from people in Minneapolis/St. Paul, to suburbanites themselves, to residents of small towns that are popular cabin destinations.

-High school hockey is about as important as high school football

-Heggie’s is the most likely pizza you’d get at a bar.

-Casey’s pizza is THE shit

-Red’s Savoy Pizza or Carbone’s are, if you’re from the Cities

-You’ve gone or regularly go ice fishing, and only enjoy it because of the liquor consumption. If you don’t drink, you have trouble ignoring that this is what purgatory is.

-Fishing, four-wheeling, snowmobiling, and hunting are a straight up good time (or at least you’ve done one or more of these)

-Most of your friends are from school or work.

-You think Minneapolis is comparable to Chicago in terms of being world-class

-If you’re from a very small town, there are 2 churches: a Catholic church and a Lutheran church.

-If you’re from a small town (mainly north of the Cities), the best place to go out on a Friday night is the VFW canteen for the meat raffle. 

-Booyah is more than an interjection (mainly Central MN it seems)

-You don’t have an accent like the people in Fargo, you tell out-of-staters who only believe that you sound like someone from that movie even more.

-“Ope, sorry! Let me just scoot right behind you.”

- The word budge means to cut in line (I didn’t know that this was a regional thing until about a week ago)

-Your grandma put egg in the coffee grounds to stretch it out.

-Duck, duck, gray duck is the only acceptable way to say it. When you were going around the circle, being the little shit-head you were (okay, at least that I was), you would use other colors before gray to make the person who was gray duck hesitate.

-The Minneapolis Miracle made you very enthusiastic for the Vikings, even if you couldn’t care less. 

-Fran Tarkenton and Herb Brooks are sports heroes.

-Mosquitoes are an irritating fact of life, and bathing in bug spray will allow you to only find 10 new bites or so.

-Stopping at Tobie’s when driving between Duluth and the Cities

-Some of the following foods are absolute comfort food: Hotdish, Gravlax, Lefse, Lutefisk, Potica, Porketta, Chicken Wild Rice Soup, Walleye (gotta love me a Walleye sandwich), Swedish Meatballs, and game meat of some sort (primarily venison, goose, and pheasant).

-If you’re from the suburbs and scared to go to St. Paul or Minneapolis.

-If you’re from St. Paul or Minneapolis and scared to go to the suburbs.

-You’ve seen an Ole and Lena joke book before, and might know a few jokes.

-An utter disdain for the Packers, and if you’re still angry from 10 years ago, the Saints.

-You feel disappointed whenever the Winnipeg Jets win.

-Perennial disappointment in sports (except for people who follow the WNBA and some college sports)

-Small Christian Liberal Arts College rivalries (Johnnies/Bennies vs Tommies vs Oles vs Gusties)

-Every winter you think about moving away

-The Mall of America is not a fun time on the weekends

-If you live in the Cities and take public transportation, you have a major love/hate relationship with METRO Transit

-Kris Lindahl haunts your dreams and your commute (from Rochester to the Cities to St. Cloud area)

-Your extended family is almost all in MN

-Your grandma loves the Chanhassen Dinner Theatre

-Ole and Lena jokes

-Hamm’s, Nordeast, Surly’s, Schell’s, Leinenkugel (even if that is a WI beer)

-If you’re from an affluent suburb, you have a cabin.

-If someone describes something as interesting, it means it’s batshit

-You are passive-aggressive without trying. Minnesota Nice is painfully ingrained for better and for worse.

-Being the Minnesota Nice person you are, you resist the urge to break someone’s neck when they talk down on MN, but then get really defensive, and keep on talking until you’re pulling straws. Even if you made your point already.

-You laugh when cities down south shut down over an inch of snow.

Rent is too damn high!!!

I have been living in a house share for nearly 5 years as the idea of renting an apartment by myself became unaffordable. House shares are not ideal living situations for a myriad of reasons, so I have taken on rideshare/delivery side gigs and started looking for places (have been for nearly a year).

How is nearly everything near the TC $1000/month or more?? How are ya’ll affording to live? Most places want income to be 2.5-3x rent. How many hourly workers make this amount of money? 

Highlight from last nights search, a 275 sq ft apartment for $975. What. The. Hell?

It is really now an expectation that a single person needs to have a salaried job to afford to live alone? Am I missing something that everyone else has figured out? 

Maybe my post sounds entitled, but the lifestyle of constant rotation of renters in a house share is obnoxious, especially for a third shift worker. I am sick of it. Rant over. And if anyone has useful feedback or a hidden gem of an apartment I would appreciate it.",minnesota,"Fellow TC Residents, how you affording rent?"

January- Clear cold blue skies after a heavy snowstorm with the fresh snow glistening.

February- Those late winter thaws that give us a glimpse of spring coming.

March- Finally seeing grass with snow piles scattered around, and seeing the first of the tulip and lilies sprouting.

April- The budding of the trees, fields covered in blue Siberian squills and the first tulip blooms.

May- Days that are quite warm followed by the last cool nights of the springtime.

June- Watching fireflies on a warm summer night by a campfire.

July- A hot sunny day at the lake followed by a sudden thunderstorm.

August- Hearing cicadas on a sultry afternoon.

September- A warm day at the state fair followed by a refreshing cool night, welcoming the fall.

October- A picture perfect autumn day with clear skies, cool air, changing leaves and pumpkins for picking.

November- Foggy damp mornings with the last of the autumnal foliage clinging on as winter creeps near.

December- A heavy evening snowfall as Christmas lights shine bright and your breath hangs in the air.",minnesota,What do you appreciate about each month in Minnesota?

What the October 1st deadline does is make it so that your regular driver's license won't work - by itself - for getting you through security, you'll have to prove it through other means.  Since I have a nonphoto driver's license they've accepted anything from a couple of credit cards to calling a number and answering questions based upon my credit report.

So - people, stop freaking out about this.  Don't worry.  Sure, get a Real ID if you want to next renewal, but I wouldn't freak out about this.  The TSA/DHS has been playing chicken with the states with this issue ever since 2005 - (because it lacks the constitutional authority to require ID in the first place, still being fought in the courts)

""Forgot Your ID?

In the event you arrive at the airport without valid identification, because it is lost or at home, you may still be allowed to fly. The TSA officer may ask you to complete an identity verification process which includes collecting information such as your name, current address, and other personal information to confirm your identity. If your identity is confirmed, you will be allowed to enter the screening checkpoint. You will be subject to additional screening, to include a patdown and screening of carry-on property.

You will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint if your identity cannot be confirmed, you chose to not provide proper identification or you decline to cooperate with the identity verification process.""",minnesota,"Stop Worrying about ""Real ID"""

And wouldn't polling the home state of a candidate be a great way to test her viability? (maybe the Klobuchar campaign has conducted internal polling and didn't like the results?)


The last poll was conducted *september/october* and it was from a pollster than 538 hasn't even ranked... and it was only 249 likely voters. I won't even post the results.

Meanwhile New Hampshire has had over two dozen polls conducted in just the last ten days.

I have gotten in to some legal issue in the last 2 yrs due to family problems and with that came felonies. Thes are my first felonies at the age of 39. Mostly driving problems are on my record. Few weeks ago police called me from the metro area and said ""I been looking for you for a long time and just recently got your number. Can u come down and talk to us about something?"" I said no and if u have been looking for me a long with no number, why didnt u knock on my door. Well he didnt laugh. He offered to meet somewhere I said sure my house. He didnt wanna drive that far but I wasnt going anywhere for him. Welll him and a partner came up and recorded the conversation. They said the BCA got a hit on a case that happened about 10yrs ago where a rape kit was done. The DNA hit came back to me. The lady's name I have never known and i havent been in that area for for over 15yrs. They had a warrant for a sample of my DNA and did so.  Now my brother has done things that are close if not worse and lives in that area.

Not sure of the situation I am in with no money no lawyer and no family. But like I said. Never have I done anything that would put me here as my brother did 25 yrs ago. I have always feared of being falsely accused of this. Always having the worry of it has made me caution of my sexual partners and types of acts to engage in.... 

Do not know her and was not even near the area around that time and wasnt drugged or drunk.. Are there mix ups at the BCA? Could it be a better match to my brother with a hit from older DNA test yrs ago? What other then rape is a rape for?

Ok, I hate to be one of 'those' people, but I'm just hoping for some extra knowledge beyond what I've been able to research. We are coming up to house hunt but I want some backup plans if things fall through.  Springs at Apple Valley seemed promising. Mostly been focusing on apartments that have dedicated websites since that's what I am more used to and seems less shady in general. Woodlands of Minnetonka and Cliffs of Minnetonka looked ok too but Cliffs had some bad reviews. I don't mind an older apartment but my priority is safe and reliable because i have small children. Does anyone have good experiences (or bad) or general warnings against some areas so I know what to avoid?

If you use TurboTax online and have it automatically generate your M1PR based on the amount you enter off the Certificate of Rent Paid (CRP), I'd HIGHLY recommend checking that the correct amount is filled in on line 16 (total rent from CRP). 

 I was a part year resident this year, and paid $8445 in rent.  I entered that amount into TurboTax.  On the M1PR it generated, the amount was 7601.  After looking through the M1PR instructions, nowhere does it say to alter the amount entered on that line (line 16).  After manually calculating my refund through the instructions/table with the new amount, I realized TurboTax was shorting me about $200 on my M1PR credit.  

Not sure why this is happening, but I'd suggest going over your M1PR again.   And just to cover my butt on this post.. if there is something I'm missing that is the cause of that reduction, please let me know.  Maybe it's just a bug in my account.  Idk.

We've already done the generic job fair, career placement type stuff where they just put you into a generic starting position, I'm looking for services that really sort out your strengths and weaknesses to help you identify an ideal fit for a long term career. A professional counselor or therapist would be fantastic.

When I do a Google search it mostly just gives me things like career centers rather than a professional, has anyone had a good experience with a counselor that they'd recommend?

Thank you!

1037,squintingman,1581719216,f3zyjy,Nan,"Hi there, I'm a health insurance broker and I have recently been assisting consumers trying to get insurance policies through MNsure. For those of you who don't know what MNsure is, it's considered Minnesota's health insurance exchange. Its main function is to dish out subsidies (advanced premium tax credits) on monthly premiums for consumers who can't afford the full price of their insurance policy.

In 2020, they changed the way and process that individuals need to apply for policies. I can tell you that the process makes absolutely no sense from the consumer's point of view. They have made this process so confusing and difficult. I fear there are thousands of people in Minnesota that will either think they're enrolled when they're not, or simply give up on enrollment. This will mean people will end up broke, bankrupt or dead because they refused to face the fact that they'll be broke if they paid for care. 

Just saying, we need M4A. I wouldn't even care if it put me out of business. MNsure is THAT despicable. People need healthcare.  

TLDR: MNsure's health insurance enrollment process is so obnoxiously difficult now that it's going to discourage and confuse more people than ever before. What can we do to help?",minnesota,Whats your worst MNsure Experience?

I was 5 years old, my sister was giving me a ride on the front of her bike, but my shoe fell into the spokes causing us to crash into the street head first. I was badly injured, but thankfully a man driving on the road saw the accident and carried me to my home. I was hoping I could somehow find the driver who helped me that night - let them know I was ok, and very thankful! :)

* Date: Evening - fall of 1980 or spring of 1981
* Location: Mounds View, Minnesota  
The crash was likely on the 5200 block of Irondale Road, but could also have been on Ridge Lane or Skiba Drive ([map of location](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pIXu7G61S_N_9dyp3C1mtJqwF7-vJ-87&amp;usp=sharing))
* Us: My sister was about 11, and I was 5 years old. We were both caucasian with brown hair, but probably the most memorable thing was that the front my skull was exposed and I was covered in blood, so yea, it was a bad accident :P
* Driver: The driver was travelling down the same road as us and saw the accident. He came up to my sister and asked if we needed help. He saw how badly I was hurt, and he carried me to our house (5100 block of Irondale Road) where my mother put me in the car and rushed to the hospital.  
I'm uncertain if this is true, but I recall being told that the driver was an Irondale student (would probably be in class of 1978-1981).

My sister and I had been talking about the accident and how traumatic it was for her. I also thought about the driver, who after my mother's car left, was left alone, covered in my blood, probably wondering if I had died. Had he not stopped, I may not have gotten to the hospital in time for help.",minnesota,"1980/81 - man who helped an injured girl in Mounds View, Minnesota"

I'm from Wisconsin, and my hubby and I go rock hounding often. I can't even count the number of jars, trays, or containers filled with rocks in my house. It's a lot! The last two summers, we went to Two Harbors/Grand Marais and found some nice but humble lakers. I'm interested in both lake and non-lake spots we can peruse, like if you are aware of smaller lakes with agates, roadsides with agate-rich gravel, big gravel piles public for the picking, or if you've spotted any other good collection spot. We also metal detect, so if you own land somewhere cool and might want your spot scanned sometime, we'd do that! (I sound like a weird old person, but I'm only 31, and I promise we're kind! We've never dug anywhere other than our own property or a public beach, and we'd like to try somewhere new. We fill in our dig spots as best as we can, and we recycle our junk metals, which is most of what we find!)  We're planning a spring and a summer trip north.

1258,Stalock,1582414032,f80tli,Nan,"TL;DR Below

I originally posted this in r/rant, but I want to post here to get feedback from my fellow minnesotans.

The main reason I am posting this is because there is very few places that I can go for pond hockey.  Anyways, here are some of the talking points/reasons as to why WSU needs an Ice Arena 

The University could afford it (and could have built it) - No more than ten years ago, the IWC (integrated Wellness Complex) was built. It houses three floors of various workout equipment, basketball courts and a walking track; as well as classrooms, the on campus clinic and McCown Gym (Volleyball, basketball gym) No Ice rink was included in the plans. Even worse, there has been talk of relocating the baseball field a few blocks off campus to a local park (next to the softball field) and building a field house on that land.  This Field house would include a 40 yard practice field for football, a track for cross country, and the field house would supposedly connect to the football stadium with the renovation of the stadium. All that, and still NO PLANS FOR AN ICE SURFACE.

Now, you may be asking why is this a problem? Allow me to elaborate...

1. There is an Ice Arena operated by the city, but there is only one rink. That rink is mainly for youth and high school hockey; which doesn't leave much ice time for college students. Not to mention it is fairly out of the way of campus.
2. The (Club) Hockey Team - This one of the biggest reasons Winona State needs an Ice Arena... The team doesn't get any ice time at the city operated ice arena, so they practice and have their home games at the La Crescent Ice Arena. Which is a nice 25 minute drive one way.   
3. There are various outdoor ice skating locations. However, seven of the eight locations don't allow hockey at anytime. The eighth place is Lake Winona. Which does allow hockey, but only has two nets. That means that you have to rely on mother nature if you want to play hockey. That also leads me to my next point, you can't skate or play hockey at any of the outdoor locations during the summer, so it sucks for those who would like to skate year round.

It just sucks, because I can't do anything about it. I am going to be a senior next year, so even if construction was to start tomorrow; I will probably be long gone by its completion.  If any architects are reading this and want to try and battle bureaucratic incompetence and try and build one, be my guest. 

TL;DR - There is no Ice Skating surface that is available to students year round on or around campus. which sucks for those people (like me) who want to skate/play hockey year round.

That is all, if you made it to the end, I appreciate your dedication.",minnesota,Winona State Needs an Ice Arena/Ice Rink... Bad...

Jean Malle visited a small town of \~5,000 in 1979 and interviewed a bunch of people there-- farmers, newlyweds, the sheriff, even a cow inseminator (dubbed the 'most eligible bachelor in Glencoe.') We spend most of the time observing small town life at the end of the seventies: mowing the lawn, going to pizza ranch after a softball game, harvesting grain, etc. Malle talks with the people he encounters and asks all kinds of questions about their lives, aspirations, and opinions. He's sometimes startlingly blunt in his questions about divorce, sex, the tension between traditions and change, racial prejudice--and people are startlingly honest with him in return. I really loved [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9eft7_vD3c) of a woman talking about marriage as a 26 year old who's ""not young anymore"" (!!)

Then in the final half hour or so of the film we flash forward to 1985, after Reagan's first term, in the midst of an over-production crisis and consequent drop in prices for things like milk. We see first hand how much things have changed for this town over just a few years and how farming has become financially unsustainable, even ruinous, for many farmers. Although the movie doesn't really have much structure or plot, I loved getting to peek into life in this town and the people there in a time when so much was changing.

I’d really like to do some fishing while I’m there, but there’s so much water I’m at a loss of where to go. I’ll rent a car in St Paul and I would like spend a day sightseeing on the North Shore/Boundary Waters area (even though I won’t have time to do a proper canoe camping trip) but I haven’t really heard great thing about fishing in that area - especially from shore or near roads.  I’ll be solo and won’t be able to afford a guide, so I’ll be DIY fishing. I have fly, spin, and casting gear I can bring. I prefer streams and rivers, but I’m fine with lakes if they’re fishable from shore and wading.  If possible I would like to catch a pike (never caught one before, so it doesn’t need to be a trophy) but really I’m happy to just catch anything - bass, trout, walleye - it’s all good. 

Any recommendations any of you care to share? I don’t need a specific honey hole or anything like that, but since so much of what’s online is geared toward large water, boaters and trophy hunters I’d appreciate any direction you all could offer on some scenic areas with shore access, willing fish, and any suggestions on lures, flies, or techniques I should focus on. Feel free to PM me. 

My initial thoughts were to hit the upper St Croix or upper Mississippi and then head north and try the Cloquet or St Louis, do some hiking on the north shore, and then turn around and then fish my way back to St Paul where I’ll be staying for a couple more days for work.  Thanks so much for any advice you can offer!

1353,TorbenOleHammarberg,1582774746,fa5y21,Nan,"I grew up in a community along the St.Croix River in Minnesota, having worked and spent much time on the Wisconsin side throughout my life. I can't help but notice some fundamental differences between the two states the moment I cross the bridges into Danbury, St.Croix Falls, Osceola, etc... It just changes.. Less development and property values, more farmland, less diverse workforce/industry. Statistically the education system just isn't as advanced, and poverty is more common..  Folks I've befriended/met are still using old wood stoves and preserving lifestyles that are 30 years in the past by Minnesota standards. This is obviously somewhat generalizing, however I think anyone who has spent significant time between the two states notices there is a difference between the way Minnesotans and Wisconsinites live. I'm not saying one is better than the other, but the question remains: How and why are they so different? Politically, historically, socially, why is Minnesota seemingly more ""developed and progressive"", even though some of these Wisconsin communities are generally rather close to Minnesota and its sphere of influence? Hudson comes to mind as a city that seems more close to the Minnesota standard. One would think ""it's just a border"" but it seems to be much more than that.",minnesota,Why is Wisconsin so much different than Minnesota?

It's heavily based in Minnesota because despite it's anti-hero/sci-fi nature, it's also influenced a lot from my life and experiences.  The problem being is, unlike a lot of people from the area - my families weren't deep-rooted in the history of Minnesota. 

So while some of that may or not matter much to a story, I was wondering what sort of locations would be interesting to set parts of my story in to vary the influence a bit? 

Cause legit, I grew up in East St Paul, I went to Hayden Heights, I went to Roseville Middle School and Roseville High school.  I can't set everything in Witches Woods (near Sherwood ave in the Hayden heights area) - Maplewood OR Rosedale lol - Let alone in Mall of America. 

(My mother's from ohio, and my dad was born and raised in MN - near White Bear Lake, my uncle still lives in his parents house that he inherited.. but Dad's parents were from Montana and Delaware. Weirder still Grandma's parents were New York and Tennessee.  (Grandpa's were Pennsylvania.))

My wife is about to take a grad school admission with assistantship out in St Cloud. We went to visit it a few weeks back and loved most of it! Cheaper rent, Dinkytown was cool, way less traffic, everything looked good as far as I was concerned except for one thing...

I went to school in Bozeman, about an hour north of Yellowstone and nestled in between some cool mountains, rivers, and spaces to get outdoors! I got used to the cold so I don’t mind that part!

I couldn’t help but notice that MN was pretty much flat. From the Twin Cities/St Cloud area, are there National Forests/Parks that are within 3 hours or so?

1478,GopherFawkes,1583196493,fcmbqv,Nan,"Friend had gotten 2 speeding tickets within the past year, and got mail from the state saying if he got a 3rd his License would get suspended.

Well, over the weekend he got pulled over for speeding(I know stupid), it was on Highway 10 by New Brighton area. The Trooper told him that was his 3rd and that he couldn't let him drive his vehicle anymore(fair), but then he proceeds to cut up his license. He also then got the vehicle Towed instead of allowing my friend to call someone to get his vehicle despite my friend insisting he could have someone get it within 15mins(Tow truck took nearly 45mins).

So is this completely legal? I thought Tickets didn't mean you were guilty until you paid the fine or took it to court and found guilty, what would happen if my friend would have taken this to court and won(He plans to do so), he has to reapply for a license over ""false charges""? Also what about the towing thing? I once picked up a vehicle for someone who had gotten arrested for possession.

1580,helpfulsmile2020,1583586535,feuwwo,Nan,"Hy-Vee, for the first time in my 20+ year career with the company is laying off employees. About a month ago every store director in the company was called to Des Moines for an emergency meeting where over 80 store directors were demoted and received paycuts ranging from 20-45%. They were then tasked to go back to their respective stores and reduce the number of full time employees and cut wages. Some employees were offered positions working overnight at a lower wage, some were reallocated to local Aisles Online fulfillment centers (announced they are shutting those down yesterday), and some were let go on the spot. Experienced, loyal employees were targeted due to their higher wage. 

Failed concepts and programs over the last 10 years have led us to this point. Market Grilles, Clothing &amp; Basin departments, centralizing fresh food production (lower quality), product and celebrity endorsements (Mark Wahlberg), just to name a few. Hy-Vee lost its identity trying to be something it was not. We sacrificed operating a clean, service-oriented grocery store with a wide selection to try and sell you a bath bomb and a sit down meal before you shop.

Hy-Vee operates 4 Aisles Online fulfillment centers in its trade area. 500+ employees at each location will be let go as of March 24th. There are no guarantees of placing existing employees into Hy-Vee stores. 

When you shop at Hy-Vee you are paying a premium, you can get the same items at competitors significantly cheaper. You're paying for the better service and selection that is lost at most retailers today. Hy-Vee is now no different than its competitors other than being priced higher. When you shop your local Hy-Vee, take a look at the employees or lack thereof. Morale is at an all time low, employees who weren't let go now suddenly have 2 or 3 extra jobs to do. Fully stocked shelves with product that is properly rotated and not out of date will be a thing of the past at Hy-Vee.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

Greetings,
 
We are aware of the growing concerns around COVID-19 (coronavirus) and wanted to provide you with an update on the most recent developments.
 
Both the Minnesota Department of Education and the Minnesota Department of Health are recommending that schools not be canceled. They are, however, recommending we move into the next phase of response to this pandemic to minimize the spread of the disease.
 
To reduce the impact of this virus on students, families and staff, we are continuing to recommend that people who feel unwell stay home in order to protect those who are most vulnerable. Everyone should wash their hands often with warm water and soap or sanitizer.
 
In order to reduce large gatherings for staff and students, we are now recommending that after-school activities such as the following be canceled as of tomorrow, Friday, March 13: 
plays
concerts
inter-district events
field trips
school assemblies
fundraisers
 
MPS activities that will continue as long as school is still in session:
Academic supports for students with teachers 
Staff/teacher-led clubs 
Extended day/Area Learning Centers 
Minneapolis Kids 
Youth enrichment activities 
Clinics and school-based mental health service- Open as usual
Adult Basic Education  
 
MPS Athletics  
Game cancellations are determined by the Minnesota State High School League. Schools determine practices. See your school’s athletic director.
 
The Davis Education Center at 1250 W. Broadway will remain open for staff and community. We are still evaluating whether MPS buildings will be available for community use.
 
COVID-19 is an unprecedented situation for our school district, our state and the world. I recognize that our responsive actions, including those I’m announcing today, may raise questions for many of you. Frequently asked questions for families and staff are available on the MPS website. 
 
While there are more questions to be addressed, please know that we are constantly monitoring the situation and will update the MPS community as more information becomes available.",minnesota,MPS to stay open. Extra-curricular activities canceled as of Friday March 13th.

We all are well aware of the economic impact we’re going to see in the coming weeks and months.  Some are going to be far more affected than others. Let’s do our best to help out our local community as much as possible. Obviously people working directly with the public will have a high likelihood of coming into contact with the virus and have a high likelihood of being shut down. If something occurs in your community, ask how you can help. 

I was discussing the possible ramifications with my daycare provider and even though she may have a low likelihood of being shut down, if it were to happen, she won’t get paid. I told here we would work it out if it were to happen. In all likelihood I would be able to work from home and still get a full paycheck but she would be left without.

1773,nemilar,1584192363,fiibph,Nan,"From the press conference yesterday, it sounds like MDH is using their influenza monitoring to also monitor for COVID.  It seems that what they are doing, is taking patients who are hospitalized with respiratory illness, and in addition to testing them for influenza they are now testing them for COVID. 

First, that's a great step and I applaud them for doing it.

**HOWEVER**, it seems that MDH is taking the lack of COVID in these tests to mean that we do not have pervasive community spread. This is an extremely dangerous false-negative and shows a misunderstanding of how this disease actually works. 

The CDC has published\[a\] the following:

&gt;Some reports suggest the potential for clinical deterioration during the second week of illness.\[[2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot02),[5](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot05)\] In one report, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia, just over half of patients developed dyspnea a median of 8 days after illness onset (range: 5–13 days). \[[2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot02)\] In another report, the mean time from illness onset to hospital admission with pneumonia was 9 days.\[[1](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot01)\] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients, and secondary infection developed in 10%. \[[2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot02),[4](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot04)\] In one report, the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was 8 days.\[[3](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#foot03)\]

This is a conclusion that seems to be shared by Italian and Chinese health agencies, as well.

What this means, is that we will not see COVID cases showing up in our hospitals until 5-13 days (median 8 days) *after* those cases become infected.  And we know that COVID-infected people are most contagious during their first weeks of infection\[b\].

Therefore, once we see infections showing up in this hospital-based monitoring, **it will be too late.** Those patients will have been contagious for a median of 8 days before hospitalization and testing. This means that the disease will have already spread in the community. 

The MDH and the governor must take more decisive action, using the force of law to ban all gatherings over 250 people, shut down all universities, mandate work-from-home for all those who can do so, and require workplaces that cannot work from home to implement staggered start times. These actions are already being taken by other states. We have a ample warning and we still have the opportunity to save lives; we musn't squander it.

Of that, just over 1.5 million are over the age of 50.

Initial infection rate estimates for people over 50 are running around 100,000.   (This assumes that social distancing across all ages is not well practiced)

Fatality estimates come in around 3,600 for people over 50, with the majority of fatalities amongst those who are 70+.

Now, aside from the fatalities, evidence suggests that needed hospitalization rates, of two weeks or more, for the infected run about 10%,

That means, just for people over the age of 50, we need 10,000 hospital beds.

Across the entire state of MN, there are 10,,518 hospital beds.  That's not extra.  That's total.   And most of those are currently occupied by sick people.

More than anything else, we need to do whatever we can to slow the spread of COVID19, or else our entire hospital system will implode.

My dad lives currently in Hennepin county, specifically Brooklyn Center (i don't think it was Brooklyn park. I could be wrong, I forgot where he moved to but it was one of those two places.)...

He has YET to respond to my emails, or text on whether he's OK or how he plans on stocking up, etc. He's almost 60, so not deathly elderly - but he's mildly autistic and severe ADHD.  I'm not there to contact him easily, so I'm starting to panic a little on how to get him checked upon.  I'm worried he's gonna kick the bucket with nobody there to announce it or figure out he's gone.  I'm all the way down in New Zealand (ahem, with his ex-wife, my mother XD) - and can't afford monetarily or infection wise - to fly up there in the next month or two. 

Are there any apps or resources I could look into that could help me get ahold of him in an emergency?  He's got crap credit history, so he's renting a room inside someone's apartment - so he's not on the lease as far as I know...  So finding him that way isn't easy. 

I do understand i may be out of my brains, taking this too far - but he's burnt a few bridges with the rest of our family and he's a bit of a loner.  So asking anyone like his family to ask him if he's ok is like pulling teeth.  (The only cousin of mine who COULD is all the way in Woodbury, and with the social distancing and non-essential travel - it's not a good idea unless i could get him to ring him...)   


The other downside? I don't know if he still has a working mobile phone number, i texted him the other day to see if it was still in service and I got nothing.  I'm not sure ringing it /calling it is a good Idea because it's highly expensive here to do that via mobile (i think, i don't remember) - and it sometimes wastes his minutes as well.  He doesn't have a landline, and the only family member that does have one still is in Maplewood, and he's my godfather and not blood family.  My uncle's probably gonna go ""No, i haven't talked to your \_\_\_\_\_ father in \_\_\_\_ stupid weeks, he's all the way up in \_\_\_ why would we connect anymore if he complains that much?""   


Ugh. I'm so sorry i'm in such a panic, we've got 12-13 cases finally in the whole of New Zealand and 2-3 are locally in Dunedin.  I have posted in here before, and if anyone wants to know my validity of being from MN - i went to Hayden Heights elementary, went to Roseville Area Middle School and then Roseville Area High school.  As well as finally getting my GED from the Roseville Adult High school. (I also went to Art Institutes for a while in downtown MPLS)

Our healthcare system is not overwhelmed and the more data that comes out the more it supports that a majority of people are asymptomatic or mild. I understand all the reactions after Italy, but Italy is in a different situation for a number of reasons:

1. Their population is \~12% higher in age than the US.
2. Their population is full of many more smokers than the US
3. If you’ve traveled to Italy you’ll see their everyday interactions are breeding grounds for things like this: kissing on the cheek to greet each other, personal bubbles way smaller.
4. Their population is greater in density than a large majority of the US

We obviously need to monitor the situation of the hospital capacity, but I think right now some of the reactions by cities/states are overblown. This is going to have long term ripples throughout the economy and financially effect people’s lives way worse than the virus ever will.

Ultimately we are trying to delay the curve for herd immunity, but at what deep economic costs? The at risk demographic should obviously stay quarantined for the next 2-3 months, but the others need to expedite the herd immunity process and that’s what will need to happen unless we pull a vaccine within a timeline that’s never been accomplished before.

Subject matter experts can likely correct/refine errors in this analysis, and I hope they do.]

Being data driven, I've crunched the numbers for Minnesota, and obviously they're grim, but we're likely in better shape than other states.

Some basic context numbers:

Total hospital beds in Minnesota: 10,518
[https://www.ahd.com/states/hospital_MN.html]

Assuming ~65% are already occupied, ~35% of beds available 
= ~3,680 available beds

About 10% of beds are ICU beds
= ~368 available ICU beds

NB: most hospitals indicate they can increase # of beds 20-70%, so let's conservatively assume a 30% increase for ICU beds, so: augmented number of available ICU beds
= ~478

As you will see down below, the # of likely available ICU beds is far below what is needed, even in a best case scenario, as most Covid-19 hospitalizations will need ICU level care, so: we’re already way short of the kinds of hospital beds we’re going to need.

Meanwhile…

The average American hospital has ~40 ventilators
Smaller facilities likely have less
Upshot: Minnesota hospitals likely have very roughly 2,000 ventilators, total

This is also short of what is ideal, but if we stay more towards a best case scenario, we may have sufficient supply for both baseline ventilator demand along with the surge demand caused by Covid-19 patients — but we need to start addressing this supply issue immediately, right now, and should have local ventilator production underway within 2 weeks, however that can be arranged, because we are unlikely to be able to get them from suppliers, given crisis-driven demand.

[Using MNDH Covid-19 data
https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/situation.html]

[Using business analyst Jason Warner's projection method:
https://medium.com/@Jason_Scott_Warner/the-sober-math-everyone-must-understand-about-the-pandemic-2b0145881993]

3/18/20 MN Current Identified Covid-19 cases: 77
Projected # of Actual Infections, Including Asymptomatic: (x50) = ~3,850

**Scenario A (pre-quarantine Italian pattern, doubling every 3 days):**
# of MN infections in 30 days: 3,942,400 infections [Projected x 1024]
# requiring hospitalization (~15% of infected) in 30 days: 591,360
# requiring ventilators (~5% of infected): ~197,120

**Scenario B (extreme social distancing by 3/23, doubling every 7.5 days):**
# of MN infections in 30 days: ~61,600 [Projected x 16]
# requiring hospitalization (~15% of infected) in 30 days: ~9,240
# requiring ventilators (~5% of infected): ~3,080

**Scenario C (extreme social distancing by 3/18, doubling every 14 days):**
# of MN infections in 30 days: 15,400 [Projected x 4]
# requiring hospitalization (~15% of infected) in 30 days: 2,310
# requiring ventilators (~5% of infected): 770

Thanks to current policy implemented by Gov. Walz, we're likely much closer to Scenario C, thankfully, so about 63% of all currently empty hospital beds will be needed for Covid-19 cases -- and that's the best scenario, and just bed space, and those are regular beds, not ICU-level beds, of which we only have ~360 to maybe as many as almost 500... a lot will depend on the ability to set up more ICU-level hospital beds.

The really bad news is, there will be a high demand for ventilators, and assuming a pre-existing baseline demand for ventilators for all non-Covid-19 hospital patients... even in the best case scenario, the supply of ventilators is going to be inadequate.

Upshot: 
	•	MN government needs to create a task force specifically focused on acquiring or -- realistically, given universal demand everywhere -- start *manufacturing* more ventilators here in Minnesota ASAP, now, to ensure our supply will be sufficient to prevent deaths.  We have 3D printing capacity in this state: we need those experts coordinating with government and hospital/healthcare leaders to help address this critical supply shortfall.

	•	Additionally, we need to ensure all front line medical personnel in Minnesota have a complete complement of PPE, gear, to prevent their infection and ensure staffing levels remain adequate throughout the crisis (minimizing personnel going into quarantine or being infected)

	•	Finally, we need to anticipate the loss of quarantined/infected front line health care workers, and impement strategies for augmenting our hospital work force.  Italy just ""drafted"" 10,000 medical students, authorizing them to start working by waiving their final exams, etc.  We may want to look at similar strategies for engaging MD, PA, NP, and nursing students temporarily, or training up personnel to supplement hospitals (like MAs handling routine medical needs, etc.)",minnesota,Covid-19 Projections (or why social distancing really is important)

2127,trevre,1584741284,fm3kfm,Nan," 

Fresh new data analysis, not because things are getting better, but because knowing your fate is much less unnerving than trying to guess.  Also the main conclusion of all this analysis is STILL:

STAY AT HOME AND SOCIAL DISTANCE UNTIL TESTING RAMPS UP. I that doesn't continue, we will never get ahead of this.

Just a reminder of the previous post, everything comes down to testing. Until we can test about 2% of the population randomly things won't get back to normal (everything changes if spread rate doesn't decrease though).  For Minnesota that is about 100K/month.  As of 3/19 Minnesota is testing 12K/month, progress from the 3K/month we were testing last week.

The rest of this is sausage making.  If you the boiler plate interpretation of what is going on there are tons of good sources out there.  If you want to be able to predict more accurately, or with more granularity what might happen, and in particular ask the questions no one is asking (e.g., What is your plan to randomly test and clear geographic regions in your state?) then you need to dig deeper.  

Now we have enough data from multiple states to start to granularize their progress.  The next few weeks we are going to see some states handle this thing really well, and others aren't.  

First is the table summarizing all pertinent statistics as of 3/19.  You can see, MN ranks 5th in testing (by % population).  Testing also must be considered in relation to spread status, so obviously states that are further along have more testing and more cases (like WA and NY).  The best place to be on this list is lots of testing and not a lot of positives.  

HOWEVER...there are likely a lot of states with unknown numbers of positives so this must be considered carefully.  For example FL has a low number of cases, because it hasn't tested a lot and it is a prime location for community spread. 

One other interesting observation.  I plotted % positive rate of population vs relative % of population tested.  This illustrates a clear trend of the undertesting that is going on (read: % percentages for a majority of state represent the number of actual positive cases in that state, rather the percentage of cases which have COVID-19 like symptoms which are actually COVID.  Those states all fall in a linear grouping near the origin.) Based on this the ONLY states where the COVID-19 testing might actually be representative of reality to some degree are WA, VT, SD, ME, and

MN. COVID-19 cases in all other states bear little resemblance to reality.  This will transition from a national emergency into a granularized emergency in various states and cities.  Some areas will be just fine if they properly mitigate spread now. 

All data is sourced from [https://covidtracking.com/](https://covidtracking.com/) 

The rest I leave to you to interpret with a table and two figures.

I’m living in a house that will be selling on May 15th, and that means I need to move out in the meantime. Are landlords readily excepting applications during this time? Are they more willing to except those who have enough money to pay rent during this pandemic? Would they even want us to move out during a time where spreading this virus is a big deal? Since the government has put a temporary stop to evictions, does this mean a person shouldn’t move out right now?

2168,MrDrAbe,1584822357,fmlqa4,Discussion,"As the title says, don't be fooled. 

I was tested Monday evening for Covid-19 at M Health Fairview Hospital in Edina. It is now Saturday and I have not heard back regarding whether or not I tested positive.

The only place who is running the test (not swabbing, but running the tests on the swabs) is the Minnesota Department of Health. When I took my test, the Doctor and Nurse both told me I would hear within 24-48 hours.

Today, the MDH's website lists approximately 4090 patients tested, 137 confirmed cases, and 1 death. This information is already skewed considering the bulk of tests are being made pre-emptively on the immunocompromised and the elderly, with a few smattered here and there from people who have come in contact with individuals with confirmed cases and/or travelers. Not to mention, they have yet to confirm any of the swabs they HAVE received since at least Monday evening.

I was tested Monday, today is Saturday 3:24pm. If they haven't even made it to confirming my test, I imagine there are still thousands that are waiting in queue from the rest of this week.

Sure, the Governor has made some great speeches, has promised a lot, but the reality is that our testing facilities are extremely ill-equipped/prepared for this outbreak and the number of cases is very likely MUCH higher than the released statistics are showing. 

Don't be fooled. Self-isolate if/when you can, please! Don't contract and pass this virus onto your loved ones. It is out there, and the real numbers are likely WILDLY higher than the MDH has released.",minnesota,Covid-19 statistics in Minnesota: Don't be fooled.

Subject matter experts can likely correct/refine errors in this analysis, and I hope they do.]

[Update 3/21: Just updating this post with some new information. 

* MNDH has announced our first Covid-19 death in MN, on March 19th, an 80 year old patient who got the disease from community spread, not travel.  
* We're seeing more press about the danger of this disease to young people, and of the nationwide shortage of Personal Protective Equipment for front line healthcare workers, some of whom are posting to Twitter's #GetMePPE]


Some basic context numbers:

**Total hospital beds in Minnesota: ~10,518** 

[https://www.ahd.com/states/hospital_MN.html]

Assuming ~65% are already occupied, ~35% of beds available 

= ~3,680 available beds

About 10% of beds are ICU beds 

= ~368 available ICU beds

NB: most hospitals indicate they can increase # of beds 20-70%, so let's conservatively assume a 30% increase for ICU beds, so: 

**Projected augmented number of available ICU beds = ~478**

As you will see down below, the # of likely available ICU beds is far below what is needed, even in a best case scenario, as most Covid-19 hospitalizations will need ICU level care, so: we’re already way short of the kinds of hospital beds we’re going to need.

Meanwhile…

The average large American hospital has ~40 ventilators

Smaller facilities likely have less

**Twin cities hospitals = ~450 ventilators** (per *StarTribune*)

**Minnesota hospitals projected total = ~750 ventilators**

This is dangerously short for projected need.  If we stay more towards a best case scenario, we will still need the entire state supply of ventilators for Covid-19 patients, which does not allow for the baseline demand.

* Some good news: per the *StarTribune*, regarding ventilators MN-based Medtronic reports it can produce “several hundred devices per week,” so arranging to get enough will be mostly an issue of logistics.

Again: we should have local ventilator procurement underway ***immediately***, so we'll have them when we need them.
  
* It has been reported in the national media that ventilator manufacturers have some available excess supply, but hospitals are reluctant to buy them, due to cost, and lack of need after the crisis is over.  The solution here is obvious: *government* buys them, and provides them to the hospitals, as-needed, to meet demand.  We worry about what to do with them later, post-crisis. (I mean: **duh**.)

I just came from a small town in Kansas with a population of ~1400, after having worked at the local Subway restaurant for a year, then the local garden center for another year, before going back to subway in order to transfer to Minnesota. During that time I've mentioned I've studied Japanese entirely on my own, and I feel I've become acclimated to its grammar. I did it anyways though, to better myself in some way, and to better enjoy media that I partake of, music and anime primarily. I also began doing so to hopefully connect with others, though it unsurprisingly only distanced people from me due to varying interests. Surprise, surprise, nobody except my mom really cares how skilled I can be. 

So, I moved to Minnesota, the far south portion of it though. Despite not living in the Twin Cities, my current town is assuredly an ""upgrade"" from my last one in many ways. However I'm sure most of you know, it's the people that make the experience, not the location. And then a week and a half after I move here, this pandemic-panic has swept over us all, and encouraged people to ""socially distance"" themselves to prevent the spread of infection. That's good and all but I can tell everyone is in this weird mindset about meeting someone new, let alone someone of such character as I.

Now, you might be saying to yourself, why don't I just add some friends on social media or the like. I'm not the type for it though, I don't use Facebook, Instagram, tik-tok or kik. It's not that I'm old (in fact I've got something of a baby face for my age, 27 looking 18-20), I'm an in-the-moment kind of guy,  I want to really be someone's friend, not just a name in an electronic list. This is very out of the norm from what I can tell, this social media form of interaction has taken away the ""tough"" part of conversing with someone new and allows the individual to make their own interpretations of text messages, rather than ones intended meaning.


So, within three weeks of me being here I've;

Been socially distant from everyone but not by my volition. Went to a couple bars with brother-in-law but I'm more of a reserved person than a loud-bar person, so it's wasn't really my crowd. I only began drinking in Dec. 2019 after having abstained since Aug. 2010.

Given my business card to a handful of people that looked to be my age, with contact info in English and Japanese, only to hear back from nobody since I only have a cell phone number or email, not Facebook. I'm certain I'm avoided because of that.

Had a police officer came to my house and told me he's had a couple reports on my front liscence plate and I'd need to remove it some the reports would stop, even though I have 60 days to change my plates and my front is a vanity plate from Daft Punk's Electroma film. This does not feel welcoming at all.

Been fighting YouTube copyright claims on several videos as I upload them, then only to have my laptop stop booting its OS yesterday when I have 5 more to post and only one to make, out of this series of mine.

And! I've been scheduled poorly at work since I moved here, despite me having filled an old employees schedule. The manager distributed the old employees' hours amongst the rest then giving me 2-day work weeks...only to then be told I'm not to return to work due to the pandemic effecting our hours. So now I'm on an zero-hour schedule till who knows when. I'll receive my last paycheck next Friday, here's to hoping I can make ends meet.



So, yeah. I'm having a rough time in my own way, though I'm certain somebody would love to give m me a piece of their mind and tell me why I should shut up and be grateful. I can't tell you how accustomed I am to this lack of emotional support from others. I have actually no irl friends besides a handful from high school that I chat with occasionally from across the country.

PM me anything positive, please. And sorry for the bother, I'm just kinda tired of being strong all the time for only myself.",minnesota,"Casual Conversation, moved here March 1st."

My plan is to get reusable masks to anyone and everyone that needs them or wants them. I plan to produce cotton masks with an internal filter made of nonwoven fabric to provide similar protection to an n95. The internal filters can then be decontaminated via UV light or heating to 70 degrees centigrade to kill the viruses, and the outer ""shell"" can simply be machine washed to eliminate external contaminants.

I'm looking to finance the project by taking donations and or selling 5 masks to non healthcare workers for say, 20$. Taking the 20$ to get more fabric and filter material. Producing 20 more masks, donating 15 of them to hospitals and clinics, and then selling another 5 for more material, etc to keep the cycle going. 

I currently have a pattern that works for both masks and filters, it's very simple. I'm putting together a how-to on how to make them. Takes approximately 15 mins to make one from start to finish.

Materials needed.

Fabric: cotton 100% Either bolt or reclaimed from old tshirts. 

Filters: HEPA furnace filters.

Nose and chin underwires: 21 gauge stainless steel or aluminum. 

Elastic or heavy string for ear loops or ties.",minnesota,When the going gets tough the tough get...sewing? Looking to team up with others to pitch in on the PPE and mask shortage.

* Executive Order 20-17 to clarify that Executive Order 20-09, ordering all elective surgeries and procedures be postponed, applies to veterinary surgeries and procedures to conserve protective equipment. Surgeries and procedures that prevent loss of life, permanent dysfunction of an organ or extremity, or risk of metastasis or progression of staging for non-COVID-19 patients should not be postponed under this order.

2294,nato19020,1585018758,fnxnnd,Nan,"I think we can all agree (dems/repubs) that Governor Walz has done a fantastic job with his proactive response keeping our cases low when compared to other states.  With this, our cases continue climbing and eventually we will need to get people back to work before our economy is in ruins. Therefore we need a solutions now that will help prevent spread.  

The CDC has given guidance that only medical workers need to be wearing masks.  This is clearly utter **NONSENSE**.  COVID-19 is a respiratory virus that is obviously being spread through coughing and breathing.  We also now know that up to 60 percent of cases could show no/mild symptoms but still spread the virus.  [https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/people-with-mild-or-no-symptoms-could-be-spreading-covid-19/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/people-with-mild-or-no-symptoms-could-be-spreading-covid-19/) 

The CDC guidance is only meant to limit people hording masks from medical workers.  Since the CDC has discouraged the wearing of masks, I believe we have allowed even more unnecessary spread.  This is a downhill impact since more cases cause more people to be hospitalized which increases the mask shortage. 

So what is the bold action that MN should take to help curtail the spread? Governor Walz needs to mandate anyone that is out of their home needs to be wearing a mask. People who don't will be punished with a monetary fine of $200. The reasoning behind this is,

1. The mask wearer reduces chances of contracting the virus through breathing. 
2. The COVID carrier who doesn't show symptoms, reduce the spread of the virus in public. 
3. The last and **most important** part is the psychological impact.  If you are forced to put on a mask when ever leaving the house you will be 10x more likely to wash hands and avoid face touching because its a huge interruption to your normal daily life causing a constant reminder.  Also the psychological impact of seeing everyone wearing masks will force people to take it more seriously. I honestly didnt take this virus with the proper seriousness until I saw the airport filled with mask wearers. 

Obviously we don't want to be taking face masks from medical officials who desperately need them so is there a way we can do this without impacting their supply? This is where the idea is so crazy only Minnesota could pull it off, what if people from our communities sewed their own and distributed them?  We already have a story of people banding together to create masks by themselves.  [https://www.twincities.com/2020/03/22/mn-sewing-army-creating-facemarks-to-help-fight-coronavirus-free-kits-available/](https://www.twincities.com/2020/03/22/mn-sewing-army-creating-facemarks-to-help-fight-coronavirus-free-kits-available/)  My family alone with minimal supplies could turn out a couple thousand within a couple days.

I think if we had coordination from the state government for supplies, MN could easily have enough produced in a couple days for our major cities like Minneapolis and St. Paul.  Then the rest of the state over the next weeks. Yes homemade masks are way less effective than N95 but the psychological impact is what will help us the most.

Testing update through 3/22/20 - all analysis is draft and subject to change. 

I cannot emphasize enough how important the next week or two is.   We know this for sure, the worst decision the country could make right now is to give some blanket order like 'SHELTER IN PLACE' or 'START THE ECONOMY, WE'LL TAKE THE HIT'.  Not because either of these are wrong, but because it is wrong to apply a homogeneous strategy to a heterogeneous problem (as born out by the data). For a hundred reasons every state is orders of magnitude apart in ways we are just beginning to understand.  New York, NYC in particular is a perfect example where it makes sense to shelter in place for 2-4 weeks to 'flatten the curve' and avoid compounding a problem.  Conversely ND, NM, MT, WY, are low risk and could be controlled by contact tracing and blanket testing so they can keep operating as nearly normal.  

And that brings into stark relief how this can be managed through careful planning, a spectrum of approaches, and a sea of experts with thoughtful and dynamic leadership.  WE DO NOT HAVE THIS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OBVIOUSLY.  We do have this in most, if not all states. Thankfully the federal government has lost most of its power/credibility to lead anything or tell anyone what to do in this crisis.  The little power they retain is in the form of providing aid.    

Now, give your states a chance to understand these concepts above, not be overwhelmed with medical problems, and build their testing and treatment capacity.  Two weeks is all they need.  The economy is not going to tank in two weeks.  After that you'll start to see a transition to a strategic approach which balances economic costs with health risks in a manageable way.  

What a difference a few days makes.  Updated stats on testing show MN dropping down in ranking, essentially testing about 500 ppl per day for the last week.  Everything is changing fast though as labs come on line there are many states which have jumped from testing dozens to thousands of people per day like AL, FL, IL, LA, NY (winner 15K/day), TN, TX.

MN has a few other things going for it.  We are still on the low end of the detection rates meaning we have some capacity to contact trace, not just test symptomatically test.  Lower cases/population also means we have more time to ramp up testing.  I'd like to think we are helping out other states who need it more, which is why our numbers haven't been rising.  

Other things to watch are NY which falls into its own category.  NJ and LA are also coming on the radar as areas for increasing community spread with positive rates rising higher than the national average.  

All the states with low total cases have a high fraction of positive results.  This could indicate areas ripe for community spread if social distancing isn't taken seriously.

I'm assuming this is supposed to mean there are 5100+ tests which have been done by places like Mayo, etc. BUT - do the associated number of confirmed cases include the results from these tests?  I mean since yesterday, if you add up MDH Lab tests + this new 'external labs' test numbers, we've conducted 11,000+ tests, but the confirmed cases went up by only 27 since yesterday's report.  You would expect by doubling the number tested, we would see a bigger bump in confirmed cases.

So does the state choose to discount any positive results from external labs, or are the positives from the external labs just extremely low?

OR is the 5100 the number of tests out of the 6300 MDH tests that were NOT done exclusively by MDH, but rather were done in partnership with Mayo, etc?  If this is the case, we haven't done 11,000 tests, and I shouldn't be adding the numbers together.

Good Evening Mr. Governor,

I am writing you to encourage you to provide guidance for school districts. My spouse is a teacher in NW Minnesota and her district appears to be still poised to require teachers and staff to come into the school buildings to deliver distance learning next week Monday.

It seems very counter intuitive to me that they are required to deliver an ONLINE curriculum to students at home from the actual school building. Our teachers are clearly more than capable of delivering an online learning experience without the need to physically go into the school building. This decision by some school districts puts teachers families unnecessarily at risk.

Would appreciate your enlightenment on this matter and a clear guidance to school admin to do what is truly in the best interest of the health of their staff and all Minnesotans. There is no reason all district staff needs to be physically on site.

On another note - your leadership in this difficult time for our state and country has been exemplary. It’s an honor to have your leadership... I wish other states and the country were as lucky as we are and have been under your leadership.

Our owner has gotten some letters signed by actually critical businesses like grocery stores stating they 'need' our services during the shut down. These customers use us for advertising  and packaging 99% of the time.  My company has scrambled to come to with some Covid related products to justify staying open, including face shields and stickers that tell people to stay 6 feet away. Still, 95% of what we are producing  as of today has nothing  related to essential services informing or protecting  their customers. For example, I spent all day making signs for faucet fixtures for a high end plumbing fixture  company.  Our owner is basically taking the SIX jobs (out of maybe 500) related to covid 19 to justify us remaining open. Of course everyone making a livable wage has been sent to work from home-  but on the production floor we work in close contact, have to touch products and tools touched mmby ten or 15 or other people every couple minutes, and dont have masks. The last two days we've been having products returned by the literal semi load (5) today of products we are now throwing away because  the customer no longer needs them (because store are closed).

So i hurred over the VA, walking through 10 feet of snow both ways.  When I arriced good old Olie and Sven checked me over, gave me a mask, and sent me to be screened.  There I was given a look over and spoke to a lovely doctor on some new fangled teleconference doo dad.  I was told the bad news that I have covid but I seem to be managing my symptoms well.  This was likely due to my heavy consumption of lutefisk and tater tot hotdish as well as my refraining from the devils spice AKA ketchup.

I was letting my dogs out and a yellow lab ran into our yard.

Here are the details:

Male

Yellow Lab (maybe mix?) - Very large head

Super sweet yet a little smelly

Had a broken tie out attached to collar 

Has a bark or shock collar that is plastic with a wood grain or brown pattern

Has a fabric collar with a peacock design but not tags

We attached him to our tie out while we decided what to do.  We called it in to the non emergency police line with all the details.

He is safe in a XL kennel in our laundry room with water and a blanket.

Please cross post as I do not have facebook.

If we do not hear anything we may take him to our vet in town to see if he has a chip.

Will prob be in bed soon b8ut can message me here.

Again he IS SAFE and will be well looked after.  We have two dogs of our own and would hope someone would do the same if ours got loose.

This interesting new report out today from the American Enterprise Institute recommends moving to phase II (reopening schools, restaurant, and most businesses) after the following four conditions are met. 

“A state can safely proceed to Phase II when it has achieved all the following:

1.	A sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days,
2.	Hospitals in the state are safely able to treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care
3.	The state is able to test all people with COVID-19 symptoms, and
4.	The state is able to conduct active monitoring of confirmed cases and their contacts.”

We are nowhere near a reduction in daily cases; in fact, today’s increase was the second-largest daily increase so far. We also are nowhere near able to test all symptomatic individuals, as #3 requires.

Except I can't change or update what I need to online. And because my application already submitted, I'm not considered ""new"" anymore.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

With articles like this: [Latest on COVID-19 in Minnesota: State seeks makeshift hospital sites](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/03/31/latest-on-covid19-in-minnesota) starting to crop up, I'm also seeing speculation in this sub and other places about how to draw up backup shelters; could we use US bank stadium? Would schools work better?

So just so people know, MDH has reams of info already prepared - well before this emergency  - about backup places for all sorts of different emergencies.  

They run scenarios called 'tabletops' where they try to simulate different disasters, and how to deal with them.  They get *crazy*.  What happens if a train carrying chemicals derails next to an art festival?  What happens if a train carrying nuclear waste collides with a train carrying crude oil?  (this is *SO* not possible)  How about if that happens in downtown Minneapolis, in the middle of a severe weather event?  (It's like that scene in Parks and Rec where they get hit with bird flu, then a quake-nado, only less silly and more professional)

They tend to not talk about these, because the public and media tend to latch on to things weirdly (If a stellar hypothetical response kept the deaths from a combo tornado-earthquake-terrorist-pandemic-fire-chemical-nuclear event down to 30,000 the headlines would read ""STATE ESTIMATES 30,000 DEAD IN EMERGENCY, RESPONSE HELPLESS"") but I just want to stress they look at all sorts of scenarios to be leaning the right way.

So they have lists of the best places to set up backup hospitals, where they'd work best for different issues, who has the best facilities for different types of emergencies, who has backup power, road access, where could be converted to labs, etc. etc.  

I realize the federal response hasn't inspired everyone with a lot of confidence, but our local resources are good, our leadership is behaving superbly, and we have been locally preparing for these for a while.  Hell, Dr. Osterholm, who has been one of the big voices in this response, has helped plan our local response for decades now in various roles.

There's no way this situation can be taken as a positive, but I think we are locally well positioned to make the best of a very bad situation. . .  we should be proud of our state, civil servants, and leadership.

Someone called me from the number in the title today and I rarely pickup phone calls from the numbers I don't know. I did some search and it came back to Saint Paul Emergency Notification System. I picked up the call when they called back the second time.

The person asked me if I was interested in helping in case of any state emergency. She didn't ask this right, so I was a little confused as to what was going on, but I remember that I had signed up for the Medical Reserve Corps a few days ago, so I said yes.

This is not the person's normal duty, so please understand if whoever is calling you is a little awkward. People are doing what they can.

She was very surprised and told me that I was the first person to say ""yes"" all day and that I was just being contacted to make sure that I was still able to help.

She asked if I had felt the effects of the virus and I said no. I have quarantined myself for 17 days now and I live alone so I could positively tell her that I have not been infected.

I don't have any medical skills. But I have a functioning body that is healthy. I don't have much going on as I was planning on going overseas for work.

&gt;Thank you for contacting me about the EARN IT Act. I appreciate hearing from you regarding this legislation.

&gt;The EARN IT Act would create a national commission to study and address the exploitation of children online. Under the direction of the Attorney General, this commission would produce best practice guidelines for internet-based messaging services to prevent, reduce, and respond to child exploitation. The bill would also shift some liability to these messaging services in some criminal matters.

&gt;The Fourth Amendment protects personal devices and data from unreasonable and warrantless searches. I understand that provisions in this bill have raised questions and concerns about the internet and digital privacy. Those questions and concerns should be part of the debate as we work to ensure that our nation's law enforcement officers can do their jobs and protect public safety, including protecting children from online exploitation. Should this bill come before the Senate, I will be sure to keep your thoughts in mind.

My husband works for New Flyer of America.  They basically had to be bullied into a partial shutdown/layoff ( anyone who wanted to go in for work was volunteer )  

They wanted everyone to use up their vacation or take unpaid leave.   If this goes on longer, they stated they won't continue healthcare for all their employees after april 30th because basically "" why should we, you don't work for us ""

They love to use legal loopholes , so people might not even be able to qualify for unemployment for these two weeks ( we'll find out for sure next week ) 

There's a lot of unavoidable close contact while people build /work on parts of the bus.    Cleaning is handled very poorly.  They keep saying they hired a company but no one has seen anyone cleaning during work hours.  If they clean only once at night lets say, thats not really helping the workers.

Quit Partner offers many free support options and resources so people can quit in a way that works best for them.

With Quit Partner being available online, by phone and by mail, Minnesotans looking to quit nicotine and improve their health during the COVID-19 outbreak don’t have to go it alone.  According to the CDC, smoking can compromise the immune system, which makes people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. People can use as many of the support resources as they would like and can access them from home. Using coaching and medication together can more than double a person’s chance of successfully quitting.

Free quitting help for Minnesotans was previously offered by QUITPLAN® Services, which stopped accepting new enrollees after March 31, 2020. In 2019, the Minnesota legislature approved funding for MDH to continue providing all Minnesota residents with free support to quit commercial tobacco.""",minnesota,Minnesota Dept. of Health just started a free program to help people quit smoking

If you weren't already aware there's a statewide stay-at-home Governor Walz mandated quarantine taking place here in Minnesota. Based on what I've seen from social media posts from friends, views from my house that's next to a walking path, and from what I've observed from my vehicle when venturing out for car-side pickup a few times a week for the essentials I see many people out in groups of two or more closer than 6 feet apart visiting local parks, taking walks, hiking, bicycling, rollerblading,  driving across the twin cities for brewery runs, and generally going about your daily life with no concern for the mandate, the rules, or anyone else but yourself. It's almost as if people are treating this like it's a vacation. It's not.

I canceled two trips over March and April, canceled multiple appointments for various things that aren't considered essential, have homely looking hair since barbers/salons are closed, am going to be celebrating a quarantine style birthday this month all by myself, and have been staying at home practically all hours of the day except to go out for car-side pickup from locations no more than 5 miles from home all in an effort to take the necessary societal precautions for what now feels like an entire month already. I'm not just taking these precautions for me, I'm doing it for your grandma and grandpa, our Boomer parents, and for everyone with weakened immune systems who could be impacted by transmission of COVID-19.

This isn't a joke, guys. The more people keep ignoring the rules the longer we're all going to have to deal with this. If you want us all to be quarantined during the summer months keep at it with the selfishness because that's where we're headed based on the look of things. 

Personally, I'd prefer to play the long game and quarantine now instead of being shortsighted and risking more outbreaks due to recently nice weather and not taking the mandated orders seriously.",minnesota,𝗣𝗦𝗔 𝗼𝗻 𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙮-𝙖𝙩-𝙃𝙤𝙢𝙚 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗲

Taking a break from my work to make some plots. **Keep in mind these plots are from limited testing. So don't over interpret the results.**

Top two plots both show Number of daily tests and positive case percentage.

Top left plot is not very informative except for showing daily fluctuations of cases. However, if we look at the top right plot. Looks like there is a negative linear relationship between number of tests and positive case percentage once our testing number is over 900.

For the bottom plot, looks like our current ICU percentage is around 40 to 50%.... I hope we can see this percentage goes down......

(c)Unless a failure to do so would violate federal law or regulations or cause an employer to lose a monetary or licensing-related benefit under federal law or regulations, an employer may not discriminate against a person in hiring, termination, or any term or condition of employment, or otherwise penalize a person, if the discrimination is based upon either of the following:

(1) the person's status as a patient enrolled in the registry program under sections 152.22 to 152.37; or

(2) a patient's positive drug test for cannabis components or metabolites, unless the patient used, possessed, or was impaired by medical cannabis on the premises of the place of employment or during the hours of employment.

I currently reside in the PNW (live in Tacoma, but work in Seattle) and am heavily considering moving back to the Midwest. I'm a Yooper born and raised (the COVID-19 pandemic made me realize I want to move relatively closer to my parents should they need me, but far enough from them should I need space), so the cold weather and long winters are not a problem to me, nor is the relatively flat topography. I wanted to ask your opinions of areas that would be best to move to should I finally pull the trigger?

Like many people, I was temporarily laid off from my job in Minneapolis. My current job I started in December 2019. My previous job -before-  that one, I left late November 2019 and transferred to the one I just  got laid off from. This past week, the state asked for more information  about my previous job, such as the date I quit, if I put in notice, the  date I put in notice and my last day working, who I put in my notice  with, why I left, etc. They also sent that same previous job a document  asking what I presume are the same questions.

It's  making me a little paranoid because I left on bad terms with that  specific place (and I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to fuck with  my benefits out of spite, but that's a whole other story) and I'm  wondering does anyone know if having a job that you quit anywhere in your recent job history can change your UI benefits, even if it's not the reason you're currently out of work? I just specifically put my reason for leaving as  ""Quit - found another job"", put in the exact date I put in notice (2  weeks), and I didn't write anything negative about the old job in the  questionnaire. I'm just not sure why they requested more info about it.

In case this is  convoluted, to be completely clear, I'm currently out of work because  the job I had I got laid off from a few weeks ago due to COVID-19, the  job that I quit I stopped working at late November 2019.

**Background:** I started working for Fleet Farm when I was laid off last year. Following the summer months we saw a sharp contraction in our labor force. We are under-staffed in all departments and areas. This is partially because the work is harder than you'd find at any of our competitors, and the pay is worse (Aldi pays $2.5-4 more per hour, and they have electric pallet jacks that elevate stuff up to chest-high level, we don't). No employee works in ""one"" department, they work in several. So one area covers pet food, pet care, farm animal care (chicken, goat, cattle, horse), tractor and farm equipment, automotive repair and maintenance, and wild animal feeds (e.g. bird seed). There is no plumbing department, no electrical department, it's all one department: hardware, who, until recently, also included the seasonal department (toys for Chirstmas, patio furniture, gardening, etc). Except for specialists (and there are only a few specialist areas) everyone is a generalist across a wide band of disparate areas. This, combined with the fact that we can hardly make a dent in the labor shortfall, makes the burnout rate anywhere from 30 days to 7 hours (no exaggeration, multiple people have quit before their first shift have ended). For those of us who seem to be suffering Stockholm Syndrome and haven't quit yet, it's not unusual for one of us to be left alone for a whole shift covering all the stocking, customer service, phone call, online order, and cleaning needs of 20-40% of the floor space. That was *before* the pandemic.

And before I go further, I do want to emphasize that local management, the superiors who work inside the store, are, for the most part, good people. They are just as overworked as those of us on the sales floor are, and their hands are tied in what they can do. They know who is good and who's a slacker. Who needs to be *managed*, and who can be trusted to keep the wheels spinning. And most of the people I work with are *good* at their jobs, and there is a definite sense of comraderie between us, as we try and help each other out when one area is short handed. Managers will run around filling online orders, people in clothing directing customers to goods in farm, automotive helping people find small engine parts in lawn &amp; garden, customer service helping work out returns.

The problems are coming from corporate. Fleet Farm has been hemorrhaging money since they bought it off the Mills family. There's been a lot of cost cutting measures, and no shortage of them have affected us working people as benefits, shift differentials, bonuses, and raises have effectively disappeared. In the era of COVID-19, corporate has been doing the bare minimum and giving us as little as possible.

The first time Fleet Farm adjusted squat in response to COVID-19 was March 15. Fleet Farm occasionally does ""Friends and Family"" days, where stores stay open late so friends and families of employees can shop with a discount that exceeds our ordinary employee discount (employees working during this time can take advantage of the discount before their shift or the day after, at their discretion). During special events (like F&amp;F, Orange/Black Friday, etc) hot food is provided for us to enjoy on our break. It's nothing fancy, but, hey, beats a cold sandwich! March 15 was a Friends and Family event, at the last minute it was decreed that prepared food, everywhere in the company, was gone. We were instead rewarded with Halloweening-sized pieces of candy.

Prior to the pandemic we were only provided PPE where absolutely necessary. Protective shields for those cutting cable, gloves, a smock, and spatter shields for anyone dealing with battery acid, HiVis for people outside, that was it. Cashiers had hand sanitizer at every register, but I don't know if that was company policy, or the store. A week after Walz' stay-at-home *request* gloves were available beyond where required, but not required. No guidance on who should use them was provided. Virucidal sprays were provided to all areas of the store, and a cleaning regiment instituted. For anyone concerned, the maintenance department (who retrieves carts from the parking lot) disinfects the handles of all carts when they bring them in the store. The original plan was that the company would have people come in to do nothing but sanitize the store, this quickly turned into us on the sales floor doing it instead.

Social Distancing markers were placed at the check-out lanes, signs suggesting social distancing, and dispensers of hand sanitizer at the entrances were installed, but that's it. Store hours have not changed (please, stop calling about that). People can still come in the store like normal (please stop calling about that). We have only just this last week instituted a system where people can order things online for pickup outside the store.

The company has done absolutely squat to discourage customers from coming into the store. I'd estimate roughly 60-75% of the customers I interact with say they're ""just browsing."" Some bring their kids and don't give a damn about what they touch. One guy let his kids swarm all over a thing full of stuffed toys and touch every damn one in there. People handle product and put it back as if nothing out of the ordinary were happening.

Rules regarding sick time have been relaxed, but part time employees get no paid time off of any kind, and full timers still have limits on PTO. Masks have not been sourced by the company, nor have they been provided, nor has any advice or guidance about them been provided.

Last week was ""employee appreciation day"" where we were allowed to wear jeans and were given a single-serving bag of chips and a bottle of Pepsi or Diet Pepsi. That same day all water fountains were sealed off. The ATM is still open, and all registers still accept cash (and customers are still paying cash).

We have received no bonuses, raises, temporary or otherwise, no overtime increases (part time gets no overtime, and overtime for full timers is strongly discouraged to the point where they are only scheduled for seven hour shifts knowing they will run over that in meeting their required goals).

The running joke is if we ""feel essential yet."" The other day HR offered us more candy in appreciation. I know the HR person, she's doing what she can, and all of this absolutely came out of her budget as a department in the store. Company ain't doing shit for us. Frankly, some customers aren't helping. One gaggle of teens asked me if I, while filling online orders, would open a register just for them so they wouldn't have to wait in line.

On the sales floor we're being run ragged. Before it was directing customers to new places products were stocked and asinine planograms that had us hand-stacking three 50lb bags of pet food that an entire customer would buy out in one stop. Now we're having to combat panic buying, a questionable distribution center (don't get me started on Chippewa), spikes in phone calls (about stuff unrelated to individual departments, and product availability because our online inventory is totally shit, again, don't get me started on Chippewa), and online purchases plus our cleaning regiments.

We appreciate the customers who **are** taking responsibility and care about distancing and being careful about what they touch. We know some folks needs dog food for their pets, feed for their flock of chickens, brakes for their car, potting soil to keep them sane during isolation, we know that's reality. But the fact is the company hasn't limited hours (like many retailers have), they're not offering us additional ""hazard"" pay (as many stores are), they're not putting up protective barriers for anyone (as other shops have), they're still accepting cash (as many shops have refused to do), they're not discouraging people from coming in (as many stores have forbidden), and we're not going online purchase only. All of that combined with clientele who are being flippant about how they conduct themselves in the store, plus the minimum of PPE, has us all rather woried, upset, and feeling less than ""essential.""

Like I said, it feels like name and shame is the only way things will change here. I've reached out to local media, and they've been silent. Only the Historical Society has reacted to my account, and that's because they (rightfully) want to record things for history. We feel forgotten, unappreciated, and, frankly, disposable, along with our families.",minnesota,Fleet Farm is not doing right by their employees

Someone at my work is sick...

I work in an essential services job.  I was away for almost two weeks because my husband had a sore throat (not Covid-19) and I work with a vulnerable population.  I found out the day I came back to work (Wednesday) that a co-worker of mine is super sick.  She’s been to urgent care and told she couldn’t get tested for COVID-19 but that, judging by her symptoms, she either had COVID-19 or influenza.  I don’t think anyone has informed our clients and our place of business is still open, never having closed for thorough cleaning or anything.  Do you think I should report?  Peoples safety is more important than my job or my business, but I don’t know if I’m overreacting.
