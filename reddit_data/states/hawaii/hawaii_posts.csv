We then decided to go back to school to get nursing degrees. In about 2-3 years we will both be nurses. Here the thing: I no longer have family in hawaii. I won't have professional contacts in hawaii either. That said, it is my dream to return to Oahu and live out my days. How feasible is it for 2 nurses to move to hawaii with no job lined up. How hard is it for a new grad nurse to get a job in hawaii? I can fall on my HTL but I don't think there are many jobs for that. Can we make our dream come true? What advice do you have in regards to making this move? What is nursing pay -really- looking like on the island right now?

A little bit about me:

I’m a recent college grad. I majored in Family Studies and Psychology. The job I have right now isn’t lined with my degrees. I work as a restaurant manager and earn about $16/hr.

My plan is to save all year this year and then make that move to Hawaii. By then, hopefully I’d have saved up a good amount of money. Based on previous posts about moving to Hawaii, I understand that getting a job prior to moving or as soon as possible is the best.

I guess my question is, which island would be ideal to live in and how should I go about this. I’m well aware that living in Hawaii would be different and expensive, I’m not trying to live lavishly as well. I wouldn’t mind having to work long hours - that pretty much is what my life right now anyway. I guess you can say that I’m slightly having a life crisis as I’m trying looking for something new.",Hawaii,Thinking of moving to Hawaii in 2020

**When**: Weds Jan 8 at 1pm ET

**More info**: As the climate crisis intensifies and federal inaction remains, governors across the nation are taking matters into their own hands. A bipartisan coalition of 25 governors, known as the U.S. Climate Alliance, have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  **Minnesota Governor Tim Walz**, **New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham,** and **Hawaii Governor David Ige** are three governors who have prioritized climate action since coming into office. 

Join us for a webinar on gubernatorial action on climate change, featuring the executive-branch officials leading climate efforts. From Minnesota, Environmental Quality Board Executive Director **Will Seuffert** will speak on the state’s recent executive order to create a Subcabinet on Climate Change. Representing New Mexico, Sustainability and Resilience Officer **Laura Tabor** and Environmental Protections Director **Sandra Ely** will discuss the state’s recent emission-reduction recommendations, which evaluates the adoption of an economy-wide cap-and-trade program. From Hawaii, **Anukriti Hittle**, who helps lead Hawaii’s climate change mitigation and adaptation work at the Department of Land and Natural Resources, will discuss some of the state’s recent initiatives. From Maryland, Department of Environment Secretary **Ben Grumbles** will provide an overview of what the state is currently doing to address the climate crisis. This critical and candid conversation will dive into what three states are currently working on, and what the future may hold.",Hawaii,Register for Upcoming Webinar: Governors Leading on Climate Action

Unfortunately I know nothing about Hawaiian anything, but now that I'm older I'm really interested in learning more about Hawaiian beliefs (religion?), mythology, etc. And please forgive me if I'm saying anything in the wrong way. 

Basically all I know is the story my mother has told me. 

She says when my she was pregnant with me on Maui she met a ""Big Kahuna"" and he touched her belly and told her - ""this is Kaimana"". So when I was born she made that my middle name and I've gone by Kai my entire life. 

Googling 'Kaimana' mostly only tells me basic meanings like sea/ocean and strength. 

But I'm really interested in where the name came from originally if anyone has further information on that. 

Also, another thing - and I may be reading into the etymology of things wrong but - I've found that the name Kane (as in the ""mythological"" diety) and the name Kai/Kaimana share very similar etymologies in other languages. So I'm very interested in if the name gets a root from Kane possibly? 

Sorry if I'm rambling a bit. 

I intend on doing some more reading to further understand the beliefs and ""mythologys"". But yeah, if anyone has any thoughts or knowlege that may be of interest I'd be very grateful to get a jump start on understanding things further through a first hand account.

And yes this post is somewhat sparked by the most recent purse snatching by Don Quixote and I'll speak a bit on my personal experience with our existing problems on at least the island of Oahu, where I've lived for the past 25 years (I'm a 36 y/o Male). Sorry this post will be long but I hope it'll be worth a read if you're as concerned about our problems as I am. 

In the past 5 years (conservatively speaking) I've seen changes in a very worse way, homeless are everywhere, properties defaced, drug use, along with now openly violent crimes. I'm well aware that many of the problems I've mentioned are complex issues that not easily solved by a single solution, but I would like to know what the steps of our PD are taking. Because that at the very basic level when a citizen spots a problem, one of the very first initial reaction is calling the cops. I'll provide a personal example (this really happened):

My parents and I live near Kapiolani in a gated apartment building for 20 years (the gates/fences are not very high, 6 feet in height and are not barbed wired or anything but hey it's something). I moved out about 8 years ago so my parents lived there alone, they're going into their 70s. About 6 months ago I was having a casual phone conversation with my mom and she mentioned one night when she looked down on her balcony she saw a couple guys hopping over the fence, she was terrified and made sure she locked all the doors before going to sleep. 

The very next day I paid a visit to my parents in person and asked them more about what they've seen, and my dad told me while he was waiting at the bus stop across the street around 6am a homeless guy went up to him and asked for money (My parents are old but they're still active, goes to the gym early in the morning is their routine). My dad told the guy he don't have cash on him and were met with the homeless guy yelling at him, luckily the bus came and my dad got on and that was that. After hearing about those stories I became wary about my elderly parent's safety and advised them to beware of their surrounding and avoid going out while it's dark.

About a week later, at Market City parking lot I approached a couple of police officers who happened to be hanging out and requested to have a conversation in regarding to the situation that my folks have told me and I asked them in such event what can I/ my parents do? The answers I was given were mostly unsatisfactory; 

About the homeless on the sidewalk asking for money - the cops said that they have no authority to kick them out because sidewalks are public domain, they advised my dad to avoid the homeless to prevent it happening again (because my dad actively engages homeless people, right?)

About the unidentified guys hopping over my parents apartment building's fences - the cops first asked me if my parents owns the building, uh.. no. They own a unit in the building. Now they can't do anything unless the property manager who manages the building calls the cops. If the residents who lives in the building calls it grants the cops to authority to make arrest for trespassing. So... they can do nothing. 

I was in awe. I can, but I can't believe that our law enforcement is this useless if what he said was true. Now with all these robbery and violent crimes happening I'm really worried about the safety of my parents, and I want some answers.

I'd really love to come visit Hawaii and learn about the culture, but also to enjoy a more tropical environment with nice weather. I currently live in the mid-west and it's 6 degrees F at this time. 

Anyway, I found a program at the University of Hawaii of western Oahu that is a one-year certificate and roughly 30 credits. This directly relates to my program of interest. I'm a current college student, getting a bachelor's degree online (In the middle of my 2nd year). 

I wouldn't say that I have a TON of money saved up for being my age, but I think I could swing the plane tickets 4x a year to come and go. I've inquired via email and on FB about this campus's housing but they haven't responded to me yet... Which makes me think they may not have any available? I mean, I think the only way I'd be able to live and successfully go to school in that area is if I was either on or very close to campus. Does anyone on here by chance know if there is student housing similar to dorms at this university?

The certificate that I'm interested in would be a wonderful addition to my skill set, but the cost would be about $7k after financial aid. I wouldn't mind taking out a loan to pursue this certificate, but dear Lord I'm not sure if I could afford the extra expenses of housing if it's not included. 

Please let me know if you or anyone you know has attended this university. I'd love to know more about it! The admissions team was a bit short with me when I was trying to gather info.

&gt;A feral cat killed an endangered Hawaiian petrel chick at its burrow on Kauai just before it was about to fledge late last year — and it was all caught on camera.  State officials said the chick also happened to be one of three outfitted with satellite tags so researchers from the Kauai Endangered Seabird Recovery Project could track their post-fledging journeys to their first wintering grounds.

&gt;State officials say the recent killing is the latest example of why feral cats pose a threat to native wildlife.

- - - -

Unfortunate thing, but don't expect much progress in reducing the number of Kauai's feral cats, which persistently prey on a variety of native birds.  *Hawaii's cat lovers* fiercely protect feral cats, and have blocked or sabotaged all efforts to cull the animals.

In 2016 [an Outside Magazine article](https://www.outsideonline.com/2127956/hawaiis-crazy-war-over-zombie-cats) surveyed the topic in detail, and reported that feral cats carry a parasitic protozoan, *Toxoplasma gondii,* which can spread to Hawaii's monk seals, with highly deleterious effects to the endangered mammals. The article discussed how Hawaii's cat lovers are contesting state land managers and environmentalists who seek to reduce ""an estimated 20,000 feral cats on Kauai.""  Excerpts:

&gt;(In March 2016) state legislators held a hearing on a bill introduced by Hawaii’s...DLNR that would have outlawed feeding feral cats on state land. Senate Bill 2450 received support from scientists and conservationists across the country...(Officials discussed using cat culling methods common on the mainland, targeting)...cats with fast-acting kill traps, or they live-trap and then shoot them in the head, methods deemed humane by the American Veterinary Medical Association.

&gt;On the Facebook page of the Hawaiian Humane Society, TNR supporters called S.B. 2450 “evil”... When state lawmakers invited public comment at a meeting in February, more than 100 cat advocates flooded the legislative hearing room and delivered two hours of emotional testimony. One woman explained that she lovingly cared for 400 feral cats. She didn’t want politicians starving her kitties to death. Lawmakers killed the legislation.

&gt;(Cat protectors)...advocated a robust, county-operated TNR (cat Trap-Neuter-Return) program with all colonies registered and monitored by certified managers. New litters and arrivals would be promptly removed for adoption or euthanasia.

&gt;(Meanwhile, endangered species advocates say)...there’s not one scientifically verified instance of TNR ever eliminating a cat colony anywhere, not in more than 30 years of practice... “Approaches like TNR are ultimately designed to keep cats on the landscape, not to reduce their population,” wrote Chris Lepczyk, an ecologist at Auburn University, in an op-ed in the Honolulu Star Advertiser.",Hawaii,"Endangered petrel chick on Kauai killed by feral cat, officials say (And 2016 debate on feral cats revisited)"

Since most apartments won’t rent to you unless you have a job in Hawaii and most jobs won’t hire you unless you live in Hawaii, how does a mainlander find a place to live? I’m moving alone with a decent amount of savings, so there aren’t any limitations holding me back (except I’m going to be unemployed when I move there). 

Doesn’t this mean any legitimate landlord won’t rent to you if you don’t have a job in Hawaii? I definitely have the intentions of finding a job as soon as possible but how likely is a landlord to take my word on that? I have a bachelors in nursing and enough work experience to get a job. 

I have a plan to stay and rent a car in Hawaii for a month just to send out applications for apartments while I’m there and tour apartments and eventually sign a lease within that month. My main concern is if any legitimate landlord will even accept my application since I wouldn’t have a job yet.

TL;DR: What are the best methods to make sure you don’t get scammed when apartment hunting when you don’t even live on the island yet or have a job in Hawaii yet? How can I find an apartment in Oahu as a mainlander",Hawaii,"How to find an apartment in Oahu, from the mainland?"

**I would like to know what fees I'd have to pay to drive a car brought from the mainland, and how much they'd be.**

 I cannot use the MotorVehicleInquiry online calculator because (1) it does not recognize the plate and VIN for ""Registered Vehicle"", and complains that a ""New Vehicle"" must have been purchased in Hawaii.

The ""Registration Information"" website refers to an all-powerful "" CS-L (MVR) 27 form (out of state permit application form) "", which apparently isn't hosted anywhere on the internet. 

I have seen things like ""you may apply for an out of state plate waiver to use the OOS plates until they expire or up to one year, whichever is first"". I'd really love to see this form to find out what qualifications must be met to do this, but will appreciate anyone who knows it here as well.

**And, I'd also like to know what the ""transfer"" of an active existing registration costs -- really just $5?** (Yes, I know if/when the registration is expired I would need to pay normal reg fees, plus any penalties if it has lapsed for too long.)

Clarifications: 

\- I am not military

\- I am not asking how to get quotes for shipping a car.

&gt;(HawaiiNewsNow) - Plans to ban overnight parking at the Honolulu Zoo parking lot have been postponed “until further notice.”  The announcement came at Thursday night’s meeting of the Diamond Head Neighborhood Board, which was ready to vote on a resolution against the proposal.

The city also said it would remove one of the two fences that it recently installed on Christmas Eve to block access to the walkway between Leahi and Makalei parks at Diamond Head.  Plans to close the parking lot between midnight and 5 a.m. were supposed to take effect Jan. 22. Business owners, including Jack Law of Hula’s Bar and Lei Stand across the lot, were ready to speak out against the closure.

The proposal had drawn criticism at a time when street parking around Waikiki is getting harder to find and getting more expensive.

The Star-Advertiser editorial and its first sentence.   (It is paywalled.)   [No escaping need to fix coast roads](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/01/10/editorial/our-view/no-escaping-need-to-fix-coast-roads/)

&gt;On Oahu, well over half of sandy shorelines are now subject to chronic erosion, leaving stretches of coastal roadways vulnerable to crumbling and collapse.

An article from Hawaii Island on Friday: [Kailua-Kona:  Problem spot on Alii has been on county’s radar for years, without success](https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2020/01/10/hawaii-news/problem-spot-on-alii-has-been-on-countys-radar-for-years-without-success/)

The reasons for the dysfunction in our coping with shoreline erosion are clear:  State and federal regulations that make it near-impossible to do any work without years of study and permitting. Second, Hawaii environmentalists who abet this state of affairs.  Excerpts from the Kona story:

&gt;The undermining of the seawall on Alii Drive at Oneo ...has been a problem for over a decade....now...the county is jumping through a number of hoops to fix the problem....The permits/requirements...include grading permit, Army Corps of Engineering (ACOE) Section 10 Permit, Special Management Area Permit, and HRS 343 EA Exemption Declaration.  The State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD)... has requested for an archaeological monitoring plan... will require archaeological monitor services during grading activities...

This probably cites only half of the requirements.  The most onerous regulations lie  at the federal level, under the [National Environmental Policy Act,](https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/national-environmental-policy-act-half-century-old-and-long-outlived-its) enacted in 1970s.  NEPA is a major reason for  America’s unrepaired crumbling infrastructure.  [Criticism of NEPA](https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/national-environmental-policy-act-half-century-old-and-long-outlived-its).  Excerpt:

&gt;Agencies must consider the aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic and social effects of proposed actions. This overly broad mandate provides virtually endless opportunities for bureaucratic wrangling and legal challenge.

Locally, Hawaii law prescribes other regulations, and there is a preference for a *go-slow* approach. Some Hawaii environmentalists dislike anything done to or near coastlines.   They find obstructionism valuable; sometimes they threaten lawsuits. 

Environmental consultants also make big fees, preparing assessment and impact statements.   The environmental science for all this is increasingly straightforward; thousands of studies have been done nationwide, providing foundations.  The documents are almost all *boilerplate;* they were written once, usually decades ago, and are revised for each project.  Highly repetitive, most  studies and documentation could be completed in weeks. 

But apparently short timetables wouldn't justify the $50,000 - $100,000 fees that some consultants charge. According to the Kona story, one consultant earned more than $360,000 in 2012. That was for engineering, a much higher value than environmental review, but it is indicative of the fee level.  [In Hilo consultants are lining up ""$1 million or more"" in fees for their involvement the teardown of a shoreline hotel.](https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2018/10/15/hawaii-news/only-one-firm-shows-interest-in-former-uncle-billys-site-study-needed-before-state-can-proceed-with-redevelopment/)

This permitting dysfunction is much broader than coastal road repair.  It is part of the reason the crumbing Natatorium, closed in 1979, has not been torn down.   It helps explain why every small  modification to Waikiki Beach, even a tiny jetty, takes  18 - 24  months of paperwork.  The same Waikiki coastal planners come on TV news year after year, proclaiming the complexity of their jobs.

Can anything be done about all this?  Hard to tell; in [liberal states like Hawaii](http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/23160/Gallup-Hawaii-2nd-Most-Liberal-State.aspx) and California, environmentalists are *Sacred Cows*-- largely immune to criticism.  They operate with few challenges, and have disproportionate influence over the legislatures.  Much of the Hawaii public regards environmentalists as akin to *proverbial wise men.*

I am 24 and trying to rent a boat without a captain in Oahu this coming August 2020.

I have my Hawaii boater safety card, and I literally grew up on a boat. I have been driving a 50 ft, 34,000 lbs sea ray for 6 years by myself. I’m just looking for a small center console or cuddly cabin type boat to rent for 4-8 hours one day in Oahu in late August.

I’m having a hard time as I am 24 and most places want you to be 25. Any suggestions? Anyone here willing to rent to me?

Thanks!",Hawaii,Help with boat rental please

I also have parental consent to go through with this. 

Obviously the state is flooded with tons of farm internships and enrichment opportunities although I’m guessing a lot of these are intended for adults, and I’m currently underage. 

Really just looking for an internship program with a reputable organization, 2-6months ish long and one that preferably has values in organic gardening/sustainability but not required. I don’t really have a preference in terms of what island the farm is on.

Todays event was a real tragedy.  Part of me feels so sad because I had a false sense that we're largely shielded from this kind of violence here in the Aloha state.  I received this e-mail from my co-worker today:

***Aloha \[redacted\],***

***Today’s fire took the home that our good friends have been renting for several years.  They are a great family with 5 children.  They all lived in a small, 2 bedroom cottage on Diamond Head Rd. right behind the home where the fire was started.***

***They lost everything.  Their oldest son is a close friend of our son from elementary school.  They have three other boys and a girl.  The boys are 13, 12, 7 &amp; 4.  Their daughter is 9.*** 

***If anyone has children’s clothes that you no longer need and would like to donate, please let me know and I will arrange to pick them up from you this week.***

***Mahalo for your help,***

***\[redacted\]***

If any of you out there in redditland have some extra clothes for this family and are able to bring them to Kalihi (near Dillingham Foodland) please DM me and I will send you the address.  Maybe we can make a little bit of good from this absolutely senseless tragedy.

&gt;The officers were allegedly shot by 69-year-old Jerry Hanel, described by neighbors as a mentally disturbed handyman who lived at 3015 Hibiscus Drive, the home where police responded to a woman’s call for help...Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard mentioned the difficulty police have when dealing with the mentally ill, saying it is a “weak area” that needs to be addressed by the community.

- - - -

*Opinion:*  It would not be reasonable to conclude the mentally ill, as a group, are involved in a dramatically higher rate of violence crime.  Still, nationwide, the mentally ill are involved in persistent public disorder and crime.  It is time to realize the 1980s move to largely close mental institutions was an error.   [NY Times: HOW RELEASE OF MENTAL PATIENTS BEGAN](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/30/science/how-release-of-mental-patients-began.html)

Without being a Trump supporter, one can agree with this: [Trump Wants More Asylums — and Some Psychiatrists Agree, 2018, NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/health/mental-illness-asylums.html).  Excerpts:

&gt;In the wake of the horrific school shootings in Parkland, Fla., President Trump has called repeatedly for building or reopening mental institutions.  Strangely, perhaps, he has echoed an argument made by some experts who study the mental health care system.

&gt;The proposal to bring back asylums — in a modern, transparent form — is very much alive for other reasons among some policy experts, psychiatrists and bioethicists...the number of public psychiatric beds available has plunged, to 11 per 100,000 people from 360 per 100,000 in the 1950s, according to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center.

&gt;In...recent decades, an increasing number of people with mental disabilities landed in prison, usually for nonviolent offenses. Today there are at least 100,000 inmates with psychosis, far more if those with severe mood problems and drug problems are included, experts estimate.

Unfortunately there is little doubt that liberal reformers will argue fiercely that the mentally ill be allowed to remain unrestrained, for them to take medications and other clinical treatments only if they feel like it.  Reformers want *all interventions with the mentally ill to be optional, not mandated.*   

And reformers want public tolerance for the mentally ill roaming around public spaces, tolerance for their acting up on a chronic basis.",Hawaii,Cop shooter identified as having had mental issues; police chief says treatment of the mentally ill a concern. Time to discuss topic?

&gt;A pair of state Senate bills hope to legalize gambling in Hawaii in order to provide funding for necessary programs statewide. Senate Bill 850 — which was carried over from the 2019 legislative session — and Senate Bill 2669 were both proposed by Maui Sen. Gilbert Keith-Agaran and co-sponsored by Kona Sen. Dru Kanuha.

&gt;The two bills are functionally identical and would establish a Hawaii Lottery and Gaming Corporation to oversee a legal gambling industry throughout the state...

&gt;Presently, Hawaii is one of only two states in the U.S. to have an outright ban on all forms of gambling, along with Utah...

&gt;“We should remember that there’s already a lot of people in the state participating in gambling,” Keith-Agaran said. “The fact that we have direct flights to Las Vegas on every island should be emblematic of that.”   Keith-Agaran acknowledged that legalizing gambling has its pros and cons: Opponents often point to gambling’s addictive tendencies and the harm those tendencies can do to lower-income people. 

- - - -

Legalized gambling for Hawaii has probably been proposed a dozen time in the past 40 years, and it has been overwhelmingly shot down each time by critics.

A simple solution:  Legalize only casino gambling and allow entrance *only to visitors with foreign passports.*  No Hawaii residents, no mainland tourists.   One nation's approach:  [VIETNAM: No gambling unless you can afford a five star hotel, New casinos will be restricted to five star hotels open only to tourists under a new law](https://pokerindustrypro.com/news/article/vietnam-no-gambling-unless-you-can-afford-a-five-star-hotel-08-08).  

Several other nations also use the *locals are not allowed to gamble* approach. 

Gambling is popular with the many Asian tourists who visit Hawaii; it offers the potential for the state to gain major new tax revenues.  

Unfortunately this solution has never gained traction in Hawaii's heated debates over gambling.  Hawaii's gambling critics are so viscerally opposed to gaming that they reject even logical solutions.",Hawaii,State senators propose legalized gambling

I went there when I was a kid with my family but was too young to really appreciate it. I recently had a near death experience and it made me realize that I want to start taking risks and learning how to do more things and how to better myself. I have $20,000 saved and am saving more. There are many people on Craigslist and Facebook market around my age that offer up rooms for around 6 months. I would make sure to have all 6 months of rent and utilities covered before I get there and would have a roommate to cut expenses. I currently work at both Yard House and Hooters and there is a Yard House and Hooters in the Honolulu area and both places told me they’d  allow me to work for them while I’m there. I’ve never gone snorkeling, surfing, and have never hiked and these are all things I wish to do there. I also really just wish to learn more about the culture and island. My main thing is making sure I’m respecting the land and locals. I consider myself a nice and respectful person but that is my number 1 priority. I’m also concerned about feeling lonely when I’m there. I’d say I’m pretty outgoing and easygoing and while people may not want to be my lifelong friend since I’ll only be there a short amount of time, I figured maybe through work I could meet some people. I know Hawaii is expensive but I’ve lived in New York and Southern California and the cost is comparable to those cities.

I am confused as to what the point of this study is and even more baffled by the statements of the researchers. 

Yeah there may be a bunch of stalls there, but those stalls belong to the private parties that paid for them for the use of their customers. 

Is the article suggesting that people just park in the Walmart parking lot when they are doing other activities and can't find street parking? No parking at Don Qs? No problem. Just park at Walmart and walk over!

&gt; It’s this “information asymmetry” that can make it hard to park in the neighborhood — not a scarcity of parking, Sakamoto said. 

Is it though? Is the problem that people don't know there are available stalls, or is the problem really that people are respecting ownership of private property (and even if they do not, they respect the power of the tow truck)?

I'm currently in the process of completing the necessary classes, volunteer work, etc. to be eligible to apply for KCC's EMT program. I've noticed that there are both ""City and County/Emergency Medical Services"" ambulances and ""Fire Rescue"" ambulances (and AMR). I have a few questions regarding this:

1. Does HFD employ paramedics who are just paramedics, or are all medics on those ""Fire Rescue"" ambulances firefighter-paramedics?

2. HFD is notoriously difficult to get in to. Is this also the case for Honolulu EMS?

3. Under what circumstances does the City and County EMS respond to calls, and under what circumstances does Fire respond to calls?

4. What are the relationships between Fire, EMS, and police like in Hawaii? In the nine years I've been here, I see a lot of positive cooperation, but that's from a ""civilian"" perspective. 

5. I just read something from 2012 about the local government wanting to merge Fire and EMS. Is this still a possibility?

Any other information would be helpful. I would like to work for the City and County. I'm not interested in becoming a firefighter and I haven't heard great things about AMR. Thanks in advance.",Hawaii,Questions About Honolulu EMS and Fire Department

&gt;A pair of bills in the state Legislature aims to remove limits on hunting feral pigs on Maunakea in order to protect plant life.  The bills would allow anyone with a valid hunting license to hunt for wild pigs on Maunakea without any bag limit and with the use of dogs...

&gt;Both measures were co-introduced by several Big Island senators and representatives on the behalf of Mark Hanson, a Mountain View resident whose sandalwood trees on Maunakea have been devastated by uncontrolled feral pig populations roaming the mountain...

&gt;Puna Sen. Russell Ruderman, co-introducer of one of the bills, said the goal of the bills is to restore sandalwood and other forests by incentivizing hunters to manage pig populations on the mountain. “Nobody goes to the mountain to hunt pigs,” Hanson said. “If they want to hunt pigs, they can just go to their backyards.”

*Opinion:*  $15 - $17 per hour is a fair wage for unskilled manual labor, including using basic power tools (e.g., weedeater) provided by the person who hired you.  (If you are a contractor, your own truck and tools, hiring out to property owners via contract, then compensation is a different matter.)

I say this as someone who both did grunt yard work--and had many laborers work for me--on a 7-acre family farm for 25 years.

*The Craigslist source:*  [Two guys and a bucket weed pulling Landscaping and home improvement](https://honolulu.craigslist.org/big/fgs/d/hilo-two-guys-and-bucket-weed-pulling/7068397954.html)

&gt;We will do the grunt work for you! Pulling your weeds and more. We will provide 2 people to pull your weeds at $45an hour, with a 3 hour minimum. 

These people have been running this ad for two years; they appear successful.  Anecdotally, I've had several farmers and rural property owners tell me it is difficult to find help, that people are rejecting $15 - $17 an hour and demanding $20 minimum for basic yard work.

Is the $20 to $22.50 demand reasonable for east Hawaii Island, considering the large number of homeless and other idle people we have here, choosing not to work at all and getting government assistance?

&gt;Circuit Court Judge Rowena Somerville was convinced during that hearing that there was no new policy saying, “We all know why warrants have been stepped up recently, it’s because the sheriffs are back in town, they’re not stuck on Mauna Kea anymore.”

Which of course immediately begs the question, if  there has been an enforcement slowdown that is so apparent and obvious to judges, could the recent roughly 10% uptick in crime over the last few months be partially attributable to sheriffs not executing arrest warrants? The vast majority of crime is [perpetrated by a tiny fraction of society.](https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2019/02/broken-windows-theory-policing-urban-violence-crime-data/583030/) The state has said they think there are [probably two groups](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/01/19/hawaii-news/law-enforcement-hopes-capture-of-crime-ring-players-will-help-bring-crime-under-control/) behind the majority of recent sensational crimes. Due to this highly clustered nature of crime Just having people out there arresting people on past warrants and having a few dozen people per day cycling through lockup instead of being on the street could actually have a large effect.",Hawaii,Could state's botched response to Mauna Kea be partially responsible for recent uptick in crime?

&gt;HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Police are investigating a daytime heist at Ala Moana Center in which two masked men are accused of stealing thousands of dollars from an armored car.

&gt;The two suspects were wearing Spider-Man masks and hoodies, witnesses reported.

&gt;Police sources said the incident happened in a parking lot at the mall just before 11 a.m. At the time that the theft occurred, the armored car was left unattended, police said.

671,Phil_D_Snutz,1581014725,ezwt9n,Nan,"My home in Honolulu, HI was burglarized on August 3, 2019. The burglar stole almost my whole watch collection including a 2017 Rolex Milgauss (model 116400GV, serial number 984056Q9), Omega Seamaster (model 2254.50, serial 81475565), Rolex Explorer I (watch was recovered), Seiko (model sarb035, serial unknown), Seiko (model skx007, black dial, serial unknown), vintage gold dial Omega Seamaster, and a few replicas including a Tag Heuer chronograph and Rolex Milgauss.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately reported the burglary to Honolulu Police Department then went out to check all nearby pawn shops. Waikiki Gold &amp; Silver ( [http://www.waikikigoldsilver.com/](http://www.waikikigoldsilver.com/) ) said a woman named Tiana Soto (AKA Tiana Venne)  [https://imgur.com/a/PAG9hFe](https://imgur.com/a/PAG9hFe) came in trying to sell the exact replicas I had stolen from me. They claimed they didn't buy any of her watches.

&amp;#x200B;

I went back to Waikiki Gold &amp; Silver a week or so later so they could put their surveillance footage of Tiana on my USB drive. While I was waiting for the footage to transfer, some guy  [https://imgur.com/a/OvQqqQa](https://imgur.com/a/OvQqqQa) came in trying to sell a Rolex Explorer I. Long story short, I figured out it was my Rolex, put it on my wrist, and he ran out of the pawn shop. He is about 5’5” - 5’8”, 165-175 pounds, maybe 25-35 years old, possibly Vietnamese, and has very short shaved (almost bald) hair with black sleeve tattoos on both arms and no facial hair.

&amp;#x200B;

I posted about my burglary elsewhere on Reddit and someone [https://www.reddit.com/user/jvchristian](https://www.reddit.com/user/jvchristian) started asking me all kinds of questions about it and claimed he knew the thief and was ""on to him"". I answered his questions then all of a sudden he stopped all contact with me. Pretty suspicious.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel Waikiki Gold &amp; Silver may have bought my watches or know who the thief is. The surveillance footage they gave me of Tiana is very clear, while the footage of the bald guy is suspiciously blurry. Plus the worker at the pawn shop said he would talk to the store owner about the footage of Tiana, but I found out after the bald guy incident that the guy I was talking to was actually the store owner. Plus it took a week of nagging him to finally get the footage even though he kept saying he would get it to me that day.

839,TurbowTime,1581872154,f4tc7o,Nan,"Okay, I work remotely, it's a stable job within a very stable industry, an industry that also has a strong work from home culture. I make 50/hour so abput 100k a year. And I'm Married with a 11 year old son. We currently live in the Atlanta area.

I'm Serbian/White mixed with Native American, my wife is Mexican, and my son is like me, in the mainland winter we turn ghostly pale but in the summer we get very tan. I stated this because of all of the ""Hawaii is racist"" posts on the internet. Although, I really don't care. I grew up in very multicultural areas and have pretty much have never been the majority. I grew up in the ghetto most of my life so I understand the respect aspect of it all; *Just be respectful and you're good*.

Here's what I'm looking for and these are my questions:

- A place where we can rent for 2-3 years and then eventually, potentially, buy in that area. I say this so that my son doesn't have to change schools / friends.

- Close to a surfable beach. 15-30 minutes away is fine. We love surfing and hiking, which is why we're not considering Florida. Our favorite biomes are big wave beachs, mountains, and jungle. Florida is no wave, shark infested beaches and swamps. Although I will miss hunting alligators for meat. Also most importantly 90 degree+ weather and sun, lots if sun. So.. Hi Hawaii 😘.

- I honestly don't care about school quality. 

- My main goal is for my son to have an awesome group of friends that he can go hang out with and be a teenager with. Surf, adventure, chill, etc. The good times.

- I require good internet for work.

- I like Oahu and Kauai (visited both) but I think my wife would get island fever on Kauai and I also think if I lived in Kauai that I'd end up quiting my job and moving into the jungle and transforming into a full feral human. *Retirement Goals*...

- Meth infested neighbors are a no go zone for me. I've delt with that before, I don't want to deal with that again.

- I've spent 95% of my life renting apartments. My main concerns are mold and bad neighbors. Also if I can hear my neighbor snore then the walls are too thin.

- I could definitely afford to buy a house here in Georgia but I haven't because I honestly have zero interest in living here. I've been to 49 states and Hawaii is my favorite. Realistically, I'll need 2-3 more years of saving before I can buy in Hawaii.

In Georgia Schools are k-5, 6-8, 9-12. We've kept him in the same school from k-5 and this summer he will finish elementary. So moving this summer is critical timing. Friendships are established from middle-high, puberty, etc.; Moving a teenager sucks for them. So this is why we're choosing to do this now instead of later. Besides my rent is $1600/month now, $2000 with utilities and Hawaii really isn't *that much* higher.

- We cook 90% of our meals, I'm frugal, I understand all of the extra living expenses that Hawaii has. My main question is what area do you locals recommend based on the information I've given?

Thanks

&gt;HONOLULU (AP) — Possession of small amounts of drugs that are considered dangerous would be decriminalized in Hawaii under a proposed bill, potentially reducing the amount of money spent on enforcement.

&gt;The proposed legislation would make it a misdemeanor instead of a felony offense to possess less than 2 grams of dangerous drugs such as methamphetamine, heroin, morphine and cocaine.   The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing Friday. Following the hearing, the bill was amended to increase the amount of drugs from one-sixteenth of an ounce to 2 grams.

&gt;“Enforcement of the offense of promotion of a dangerous drug in the third-degree costs state taxpayers over $13 million each year to incarcerate low-level, non-violent offenders. Hawaii’s experience corroborates mounting national data demonstrating that incarceration has no effect on rates of drug use or overdose deaths, but actually increases recidivism among those at low risk to reoffend,” according to the bill. 

&gt;Acting Prosecuting Attorney Dwight Nadamoto testified in person against the bill arguing that drug defendants are offered multiple opportunities and programs to avoid criminal convictions, including probation even before going to prison...",Hawaii,"Hawaii bill would decriminalize ‘dangerous’ drug possession -- meth, heroin, cocaine, etc."

I lived on Oahu from 1967 through 1970. The overt racism, hostility and violence of Hawaiians was everywhere. The phrase ""haole pig"", directed at whites, was commonplace. If you do your research, you'll quickly discover that the situation is worse today. Hawaiians - ordinary residents, school and government employees - readily ignore, deny, and participate in institutional racism.

If you have children, avoid this state like the cesspool it is. Subjecting them willingly to that place is child abuse, IMHO.

Spend your money elsewhere for vacation. Oahu is overpopulated and hopelessly crowded. Tourists are only safe in the acceptable ""tourist"" places. As for the other islands, racism is rampant. 

Of all the different cultures I've experienced in my travels, there's but a single group of people that I honestly hate - Hawaiians. I would fully support Hawaii's secession from the Union. Let them go. They can revert to living in their silly grass huts and worshipping their pagan goddess Pele.

910,jsrd4,1582339990,f7mf6b,Nan,"So I have been on a bender for the past year reading about Cook's voyages into the Pacific and I have come across some unique and compelling books which include Tupaia: Captain Cook's Polynesian Navigator by Joan Druett, Enlightenment Orpheus by Vanessa Agnew, Trial of the Cannibal Dog by Anne Salmond and Explorations &amp; Reassessments by Glyndwr Williams. I see a lot of accusations from Native Hawaiian and other indigenous rights activists that he was nothing but a ""syphilitic, tubercular, thief, invader, rapist and murderer. 

However this is not entirely accurate from what I have read so far.  There were occasions where encounters between indigenous peoples and Cook's crew were non-violent and amicable, such as in Uawa, New Zealand (1769), Tamatea, New Zealand (1773), New Caledonia (1774), Mercury Bay, New Zealand (1769), Tahiti (1773, 74 &amp; 77), Tasmania (1777), Nootka Sound (1778) and Rapanui (1774) - to  name a few. He also notably refused sexual invitations with island women in Polynesia all over - he was in fact ridiculed in Tahiti and Tahuata and even lambasted by a high born women in Nomuka in the Tongan archipelago. He wrote about Aboriginal Australians being the most ""happiest people in the world"" and Maori being of a ""brave, noble, open and benevolent disposition who would never put up with an insult if they had an opportunity to resent it. He also had an ongoing reciprocal relation with the ari'i (chief) of the Society Islands such as Tu of Mahina, Tahiti and Ori of Huahine. He also took on Polynesian passengers such as the navigator and high priest Tupaia, Mai, Hitihiti, Te Weherua and Koa, who willingly boarded his ships. It is also fairly well documented that he punished crew members who mistreated indigenous people such as on Tanna (1774), Ipipiri, New Zealand (1769) and Tahiti (1769). He also pretty damn pissed off that sailors went an infected women on Kaui with VD in 1778 and he took great pains to prohibit sexual activity (however futile they were).   


However I am very well aware that he was by no means entirely benevolent and according to Salmond, became increasingly short tempered and violent when he left Totaranui, New Zealand in 1777 after refusing to punish a Maori rangatira (chief) who cannibalized crew members from one of his stranded ships in 1774. He proceeded to flog Tongans (as well as his crew members) who stole from his ships and took Tui (chiefs) hostages, although he did exchange names and participate in Tongan customs such as the inasi. He burnt houses and canoes on Mo'orea after a grazing goat was stolen from one of his ships - the inhabitants of the island happened to be enemies of his taio (friend) Tu which might of been a factor. He also cropped the ears and shaved the head of a thief of a quadrant on Huahine, who happened to be a Boraboran - an enemy of Mai, who was a Ra'iatean (Boraborans had invaded Ra'iatea in the 1760s). He also took his taio hostage and his daughter hostage on Ra'iatea after two of his crew members desserted on the island.

I am aware that a great deal of Cook's letters and journals were lost to his wife Elizabeth, who burnt them in the 1800s - much of which contain his accounts of Hawaii. However, even telling from the primary and secondary sources available, I haven't so far found anything that indicates that he was infected with VD, let alone sexually engaged with the Kanaka Maoli. There is an account by the Hawaiian historian Samuel Kamakau drawing on oral traditions stating that he slept with a woman on Kauai, which I cannot that doesn't really have much written evidence to support it. Which leads me to my question: are all Native Hawaiian accounts that are disparaging of Cook based in oral traditions or written evidence? Or they are deliberately hyperbolic to simply draw attention to the fact that narratives of him being the ""discoverer"" of Hawaii are incorrect? According to Salmond's Trial of the Cannibal Dog, negative attitudes towards Cook were a product of Calvinist missionaries, who disparaged Cook as a ""sinner"" and ""idolator"" for allowing himself to be imbued as an akua or ali'i. Despite the attempted of kidnapping of Kalani'opu'u, the end of the Makahiki and the negative relationships between Hawaiians and Cook's crew, he was given the funerary rights of an ali'i and kahuna. Kalaniopu'u spent three days alone in a cave above Kealekekua Bay because the kapu had been broken between him and Kuki. While I think the notion that he was considered an akua is questionable, it seem to me the Hawaiians had a more complex relationship with him than simply hating him for taking their ali'i hostage? According to Salmond, the killing was not premeditated but rather occurred in the ""heat of a moment"" and therefore there seemed to be a bit of remorse following his death.",Hawaii,Did Captain James Cook really have syphilis and tuberculosis and rape Native Hawaiian women when he visited Kauai in 1778 &amp; the Big Island in 1779?

Many many months ago, some of you may have made plans to go on a cruise and are considering canceling. 

My advice... **don't**. Why? I had a family friend who had every intention of enjoying a cruise but decided to cancel once COVID-19 became a thing. Unfortunately canceling meant it was a significant loss; not full loss.

So why am I making this post? A couple of days later the cruise sent an email out to all passengers (including the ones that called in to cancel) and notified them that the cruise was canceled. Unfortunately those passengers who called in to cancel will not get a refund while those who did NOT cancel got a **full** refund.

Essentially the cruise company made money off of people who canceled; refunded some folks and made money either way w/o having to set sail or provide a service.

KHON worked for months to get school-by-school numbers from the Hawaii Department of Education about both serious violence, as well as bullying and misconduct, for every public school campus. 

Last year there were **nearly 4,000 “Class A” violence incidents statewide**. These are things like **assault, fighting, terroristic threatening and sexual offenses** 

An average 15 Class A offenses reported per school for 2018-19, a range of none for many schools, and as high as 201 — the equivalent of more than 1 every school day 

More than **3,100 “Class B” incidents statewide** for 2018-19, things like **bullying, cyberbullying, disorderly conduct and hazing**. There were an average of 12 per campus, and a range of none to 161 

Combining Class A and B offense numbers together, the campuses with the highest counts in 2018-19 were mostly middle schools, and **Waianae Intermediate School had the highest count: 293** in just one school year, followed by **Waipahu Intermediate (247)**, **Campbell High School (235)**, **Kalama Intermediate (198)**, and **Keaau Middle (181)**. 

The trend is moving in the wrong direction at Waianae Intermediate. A look back at Always Investigating’s 2015 school safety report shows the campus experienced a nearly **30% jump in Class A incidents** in the most recent school year (201) compared to 4 years ago (156)

If you have interest and are willing to devote some of your time, perhaps make some extra cash (not sure the legality of this, let me know if I am treading a dangerous line here Reddit) please let me know. 

A little bit about myself: I was born in Hilo. I am a 27 year old male currently living in central Oahu but I am willing to drive out to town. I enjoy hiking, art, surfing, gaming. If you are interested I would love to maybe get coffee or something first. If all goes well we can set up meet times or even practice via skype/discord.

Not surprisingly safety, quality of government services and homelessness stand out as key areas of concern, but a lot of other little interesting tidbits in there as well. 

The thing I find most interesting is my pet theory that social media is destroying society by making people angry and negative about literally everything.  For example I understand how people have genuine concerns about homelessness and crime and that effect would be cumulative and you would see multi year declining trends. But then you look across categories like:

* Recreational opportunities 
* Fitness opportunities 
* Education and enrichment opportunities 
* Religious or spiritual events and activities
* Cultural/arts/music activities

And those are all declining across the board. And that's when I have to call BS. Really? Recreational and fitness opportunities in Honolulu are declining? Religious and spiritual events are getting worse? What, the churches and temples are closing? And with all the street festivals, food trucks, cultural activities and concerts etc people are less satisfied with that category too?

&gt;Gov. David Ige has released $500,000 in state funding that will be used for planning and feasibility studies for the possible restoration of the Pohoiki boat ramp....

&gt;An engineering study released last June...found that efforts to remove the sand and create a channel to the existing ramp would be expensive and full of uncertainties associated with sand movement...DLNR...said dredging had been discussed...but the state likely would have to prepare an environmental assessment and obtain the necessary permits for the work...

&gt;The only boat ramp between Hilo and Milolii, the Pohoiki ramp closed shortly after Kilauea volcano began erupting in May 2018...The closure has affected the ability of Puna fishermen...to easily access the ocean and subsequently has impacted their livelihoods.

- - - -

*TL_DR version:*   Progress on opening the ramp is being obstructed by excessive permitting and environmental review requirements.  Statewide, this obstructionism is also slowing repair of eroding coastal roads.  Sea level rise is inevitable; more and more of Hawaii's coastal roads will need expeditious repair in coming years.  Other coastal modification will also be needed.  Will environmentalists continue to delay essential projects with their outdated, unreasonable environmental review demands?


- - - -

*How about we just use the $500,000 to start work now?*    That money would fund a lot of sand removal.
Can we for once expedite permitting and forgo with an environmental assessment? Award a [categorical exclusion on grounds that there is no significant environment impact](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33267.html#_Toc216859246), so no EA is needed? 

The eruption caused massive alteration and destruction--yes, *destruction*--of miles of Puna shoreline, including massive kill of sea life.  That was the environmental impact.  Proposed action: Restoring the ramp to its original or similar condition.   (Apparently some environmentalists reject the idea that *nature can damage ecosystems*--their view:  Only man can do that.) 

There has already been one study; it correctly identified uncertainties.  Countless tons of lava sand rest along the coast to the north.  When sand is excavated, currents flowing south might fill in new sand in short order.  What's the best way to tell if this is going to happen?  *Start removing sand.*

What is another environment study going to tell us?  How many places in the world have had identical lava flows into the ocean, a boat ramp covered, and currents and shorelines identical to Hawaii Island?  (None.)  What basis or comparative information do environmentalists have to assert that their new EA will provide outcomes on this unique and uncertain situation?  And present information on potential damage caused by the sand removal?

How many months or years do environmental consultants intend to tie up start of work by studying the matter?

This is the second time in as many months that we've had good evidence of *environmental extremism* hindering a needed shoreline project on Hawaii island:   January 2020:  [Problem spot on Alii has been on county’s radar for years, without success](https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2020/01/10/hawaii-news/problem-spot-on-alii-has-been-on-countys-radar-for-years-without-success/)

And on Oahu, a  [Star Advertiser Editorial opined: No escaping need to fix coast roads](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/01/10/editorial/our-view/no-escaping-need-to-fix-coast-roads/)


What is the basis for the charge of *environmental extremism?*

That Hawaii environmentalists' have long opposed 1) modifying the National Environmental Policy Act, 2) modifying similarly restrictive state environmental permitting regulations and 3) allowing exemptions so critically needed projects can proceed without  environmental review.

Every legislator in Hawaii knows it has been pointless thus far to propose changes to Hawaii's environmental laws because of strident opposition from local environmentalists.  *Time to stop kowtowing to environmentalists?*

I've been lurking around for a while and I wanted to say ""thanks"" for all the good/bad stuff- as they are very resourceful.

I've recently obtained my D.C. license and I'm a little confused about how things are working out. Long story short. I got my license from D.C. because I am abroad and working at international schools. That was the most accessible one to obtain. I am planning to move to Hawaii (could be early or later down the road)-- I just wanted to save up enough. I have successfully transferred(?) my license to Hawaii.

Now here are the questions.

1. How was your overall experience teaching from a different state and then in Hawaii?  
2. Did you decide to go to public school or a private school route? Any thoughts on this?
3. Do you write up you have 2 state licenses? Is there a pro or con for this? 
4. I do plan to work at a private school (whether religious or not)-- are there any schools you would recommend / not recommend?
5. Please feel free to drop any tips, concerns (I am aware of the living cost and how some people work 2 jobs).

Thanks in advance, guys!",Hawaii,&lt; Teachers of Hawaii &gt; Teaching License from D.C. (or any state) to Hawaii

What should I do, am I going to get it, is someone around me infected etc etc. Take a breather. Any and all official information about virus specifics (aka symptoms, spreading, and precautions) should be taken from the CDC website or other official health agencies. These are people’s lives at risk. So instead of potentially telling someone something wrong that risks the lives of not only them but the rest of us, send them straight to the CDC’s website for information.  We all, included the people at local health agencies and CDC, have families here.

Imagine you are scared of your house burning down and so you don’t fully trust or get information misleading you that your fire alarm that the fire department put in every house doesn’t work even though they say it does and it has successfully worked in the past. So you tell your neighbor that you don’t trust your alarm and they start to get suspicious too and tell there neighbor who tells their family and eventually a decent part of the city doesn’t trust their fire alarms or the fire department. One day someone starts a fire, they don’t report it and try to put out themselves because they don’t think the fire department will help them. Because they don’t know how to contain fires it spreads from one house to the next until finally it’s too late and the fire department can’t contain the fire and the town burns. One fire that could have been contained if they had just been correctly informed and trusted the fire department turned into a city threatening inferno because of someone who thought they were helping and raising awareness but actually hurting. 

Be informed but be smart and use reasoning. Get your information from official agencies, not reddit, not fox, cnn, or the star advertiser. The CDC is slow but that is because they want correct and relevant information to go out, not quick eye catching but possibly wrong information. CDC has a full page on who to stay health, if the virus is spreading, what is being done to combat it, and what to do if you get the disease. Remember to breath too, it’s ok and as long as we are smart and practical it will be ok. Links bellow:

1. Alcatel Lucent Fiber stuff (looks like so:  [https://imgur.com/a/r2e4lED](https://imgur.com/a/r2e4lED)) 

The weird thing is only the first port (1) works on the Alcatel works. And It *seems* as if it only delivers internet connected to the Pace 5168NV, but I might be wrong &amp; doing it wrong.

Then there is a patch cable (whatever a patch cable is) from the first port on the Alcatel to a Pace 5168NV 

I tried connecting a different router to the Alcatel (Alcatel ⟷ the switch hub in the wall that connects to the different ethernet and phone line jacks in the house ⟷ Netgear Router) and it just didn't work. It seems the Alcatel Lucent *has* to be connected to the Pace to add a different router. (Like this: Alcatel  ⟷ Pace Router  ⟷ Switch hub ⟷ THEN a different router)

Instead, we were just informed that the festival will go on because there is no community transmission *in Hawaii*. If we want to back out, each of these kids will forfeit thousands of dollars that they've paid to the festival organizer. Apparently, we only get refunds if the organizer cancels. 

Which raises the question. Is the state government there looking at banning large gatherings, which would force this festival to cancel?

Thank you for your perseverance and patience through this increasingly difficult time with the rapidly evolving COVID-19 health crisis. Fortunately, at this time, there have been no confirmed cases on any UH campus or significant links to UH.

The decisions outlined below are not made lightly; they are intended to protect the health and safety of our community to the extent possible, while continuing to provide all our students with the outstanding education that characterizes the University of Hawaiʻi. The measures being put into place will also help protect our employees.

The 10-campus UH system will move to online delivery of courses beginning Monday, March 23, the first day of instruction after spring break. If a class needs to continue to be taught face-to-face to meet learning objectives, students will be informed after approval by the campus.

At this time, in-person courses are scheduled to resume Monday, April 13. In the hope that we can return to normal classroom practices, the in-person start date will continue to be reevaluated, and updates will be provided as needed. Regardless of modality, UH is committed to completing the academic semester and enabling students to graduate on schedule.

While instruction will move online, our campuses will remain open, and most services will continue to be provided. University employees will continue to perform their duties, libraries will maintain regular hours and student housing will remain open for current residents who have nowhere else to go. All student employees and graduate assistants will continue their duties as normal and will be paid accordingly.

We are also announcing restrictions on university travel and events. We know that this message will not answer everyone’s questions, and there will be additional clarification provided in the days to come. Given the extreme fluidity of the COVID-19 situation, all guidance provided is subject to change as the situation evolves.

Preparing to teach and learn online

Most, if not all, of our faculty have begun preparing to deliver courses online. Students will be receiving directions on accessing online instruction from their respective campus in the coming week.

The UH Online Innovation Center (UHOIC) has created the Teaching During an Emergency website to assist during this transition. This website includes a Teaching During an Emergency Checklist for Faculty. Your individual campuses will alert you to additional resources and training opportunities, and you may request more assistance by completing the UHOIC request assistance form. Check the site daily for updated and additional resources and tools, and for opportunities to receive training via videos and workshops.

Students who do not have access to their own computers may use those available in campus libraries and computer labs. UHOIC and UH Information Technology Services will work with campus offices and others to ensure support for our students and faculty with particular needs.

Events

All UH Mānoa and UH Hilo sporting events have been suspended indefinitely by agreement of the presidents and chancellors of the institutions in our athletic conferences.

Large public events with more than 100 individuals in a confined space that are sponsored by UH are being postponed or canceled as of Monday, March 16. Similarly, the university will not be scheduling new public events of this kind until further notice. All attendees planning to attend an event already scheduled should contact the event organizer or venue to check if the event has been canceled, postponed or rescheduled.

We understand the concern many have surrounding spring commencement ceremonies in May. The university will continue to evaluate the situation so we can make a decision and communicate it as soon as possible.

Travel

No new non-essential university-sponsored out-of-state travel may be planned, and most already scheduled travel should be canceled. If you have previously scheduled UH-sponsored travel, contact your supervisor and/or fiscal administrator for guidance on canceling or postponing travel.

Campuses will remain open and the semester will be completed

UH’s 10 campuses will remain open and continue to operate as normal, with the exception of in-person classes moving online. All employees, including students and graduate assistants, are expected to continue to come to work. Student housing, libraries, dining and the student recreation centers at UH Mānoa and UH Hilo will remain open to help support the wellness of our students and employees. Research activities on campus will continue as normal.

Student residents are asked to notify student housing officials of their plans to remain in their residences or of their expected return dates. For those students who decide to travel during spring break (or longer), their rooms will be left untouched and ready for their return.

Applicability of guidelines

Again, given the extreme fluidity of the COVID-19 situation, this guidance is subject to change as the situation evolves. Exceptions to these guidelines may be granted only by an Officer of the University of Hawaiʻi: UH Mānoa Provost, UH Hilo Chancellor, UH West O‘ahu Chancellor, Vice President for Community Colleges, other Vice Presidents and the President.

Next steps

We know that there are more questions and we will work to answer them as quickly as possible. For example, we will be issuing additional instructions for individuals who must engage in self-quarantine.

The best way to navigate this unprecedented crisis is for all of us to work together. We have one of the greatest university systems in the world, and it is because of all of you—our students, faculty and staff who collaborate with diligence, dignity and respect. Please continue to exercise compassion and aloha for each other, even as we face the difficult stresses ahead. Our goal is to complete the semester with and for our students. We will not only get through this, but we can emerge stronger, wiser and closer.

Would it be inappropriate to give a Hawaiian first name to our baby girl if she is only 1/8 Native Hawaiian? I’m worried about being judged for cultural appropriation, but my husband says not to be. We also considered naming her differently based on how she looks when she arrives. Like if she gets the NH genes she would be “Iolana Rose S____” and if she looks like me (pale, blonde, blue eyed) she’d be “Eleanor Rose Kekahuna S____” ....I feel like this is kind of silly question though because we love the name Iolana. It means “soar” and my husband is a pilot. Kekahuna is his family’s surname. My husband’s mother is 1/2 NH 1/2 German-American, and was raised on Oahu. My husband undoubtedly looks NH when he tells people, but until he does, people usually think he’s Hispanic or Mediterranean. My husband even lived on Oahu for a few years as a preteen, but we currently are on the mainland. I guess I wonder if my child will be judged for having a “culturally appropriating” name if she looks white. Hawaiian culture was important in his house growing up, and I want my girl to know her heritage, but I think in our house it has become less of a priority.

The last part is what confuses me - if it is all but a near certainty the schools are going to close why not begin self-quarantines at the START of spring break? That way students will miss less school and faculty will not be filing for unemployment or whatever non-salaried employees have to do.

Hawai'i was a sovereign state before America was a country. Consider what that means, really think about it. It had a government, it had a standing army, and it had a population. How did Hawai'i have all those things? Food. They had food. They fished, hunted, gathered and farmed food. Hawaiians did that for millennia. Worse comes to worse, Hawai'i will not starve. Hawai'i will turn once again from the tourist image it shows the world back into the agricultural powerhouse that makes it independent. All YOU have to do, is go out and buy enough canned and bottled food to last you a month. Go do that. You don't have any storage space? Put it all on your bed and sleep on your couch.

I created a survey that is inspired by Condé Nast Traveler's YouTube series of ""[50 People from 50 States](https://www.youtube.com/user/condenasttraveler/videos)"". They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results. This poll will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

1412,JustAnotherGeek12345,1584219637,fipg64,Nan,"On the evening of Thursday, 3/12, I received a text message that Matson was shutting down in the coming days because the infected Princess cruise ship was docked in Maton's Oakland port; which is supposedly interrupting westbound shipments.

At first I thought, ""great, here we f\*\*\*'n go..."" I will admit, I had a moment of panic and started to mull over the many scenarios of what would happen and its impact. After spending about 15 minutes, I realized one thing. Is this even true? How can I validate it (unit test), even though this message is coming from someone I know and trust.

So the geek in me checked the Matson vessel schedules and there were no cancellations. I checked where some of the vessels were and everything appeared normal.

At this point, I'm thinking this is a big fat rumor. Then again, my mind mulls over the many scenarios of what happens **if this is truly a rumor.** And here is the problem: It **doesn't matter** if the text message is a rumor at this point. **Once the rumor spreads widely and if others believe the rumor, then what you saw at Costco will happen - panic buying.**

After we tuck our kids in bed, my wife promptly asks, ""so should I go shopping?"" I tell her no because I think its a rumor.

Early Friday, 3/13, morning I called Matson and asked about the port situation; explaining the text message I had received. **Matson confirmed it was a rumor. Matson is NOT shutting down.**

Friday evening, I'm thankful our local news (KGMB) had Tim Sakahara of DOT confirm that it was just that... a big fat rumor.",Hawaii,"Rumors, Costco and Panic ... sharing my thoughts out loud"

1416,Haiduti,1584240033,fiugn7,Nan,"Based on a lot of the news articles I've read and even some posts I've seen on reddit, it seems like the rumors about the matson shutdown were mostly fueled through text messages, which seems odd. E.g:

&gt; Another version of the bogus rumor came in the form of this text: “Hey. My friend just informed me that her friends brother who works for Matson (the shipping company) said they are stopping shipments for 30 days to Hawaii. So I guess we need to load up on can Good’s.” 

...

&gt; Wagner said the rumors appeared to be circulating via text, and that he had not seen any of the false messages on social media. 

 I guess I don't know because I didn't get one (e.g. were these all worded the same, coming from random numbers, being forwarded by friends etc?) but I have to wonder if this was a cyberattack. I've read stories about small scale russian operations designed to see what kind of ""real world"" effects they can produce. For example creating trying to create real world counter protests (black lives matter / blue lives matter) at the same time and location. What better way to experiment than to see if they can create some small scale panic through strategically sending a few thousand fake texts in a geographically constrained area to see if it fuels panic as an experiment?

1441,Haiduti,1584305835,fj8f23,Nan,"I really fear for us. On Jan 20, Wuhan, population 11,000,000 had less than 200 cases. The communist party of China, despite knowing there was something seriously wrong, had a party where thousands of people from around the province attended a potluck, an event known to have spread the disease widely. 

On 3/14, Maui county announced they are closing all the parks, pools, gyms, community centers and restrooms. Strangely though, there was an exception for community centers. Those wouldn't close until 3/16. How odd, I thought. 

Then, I happened to be going by the Kihei Community Center last night. Hundreds of local families were attending some sort of event (first birthday? not sure). The entire place was packed, the entire parking lot was full. People hugging and kissing each other, shaking hands, dancing, clustered closely etc. Lots of kupuna. Lots of kids.

First, this is just so clearly corruption. Obviously someone knew someone and that's why the declaration for community centers was two nights after everyone else. 

Second, this is literally the type of event that should not be happening in the time of an epidemic, but there it was. It is such hubris. At this phase, there is no possible way that one or more of the hundreds of people in that event didn't have coronavirus. And now, many, many more people have it. All because someone ""did someone a favor"" likely because they themselves don't really believe this is a big deal.

Again, if we had a real media, someone would be asking serious questions about this party and, if I had to guess, whatever party is happening there or in Lahaina tonight that required a special exception until the 16th.",Hawaii,"Wake up, Hawaii"

If you'd like to support small businesses or you own one, I highly suggest your action regarding this matter.

""Aloha, Friend.

Our nation’s small businesses have been especially hard hit by our COVID-19 crisis. This is particularly true in our Hawai’i because our small businesses are a much greater part of our economy and because so many depend one way or another on travel and tourism.

The $8.3 billion emergency supplemental funding measure that Congress passed and the President signed on March 5th includes billions in assistance to our small businesses affected by COVID-19 through the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). For Hawai’i small businesses to qualify, the Governor needs to make an SBA-required economic injury declaration.

I have been working with the Governor and our local SBA to get that declaration made and accepted by the SBA as soon as possible so our affected small businesses can start applying for and getting desperately-needed assistance. We need Hawai’i small businesses’ help to complete and back up the declaration.

Please see [**this notice**](https://case.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx?ID=278-632987) from the State and the SBA, which states that “we need Hawai’i small business concerns that have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of the COVID-19 disaster to submit the estimated economic impact on their businesses by completing [**this worksheet**](https://case.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx?ID=279-632987) and then emailing it to dbedt.cbed@hawaii.gov.""

If you are an affected Hawai’i small business, can you do that? If you know someone who is part of an affected Hawai’i small business, can you forward this email to them?  


IMPORTANT: THE DEADLINE TO RETURN THE FORM IS WEDNESDAY, MARCH 18TH, 4PM.

As always, please contact me [**here**](https://case.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx?ID=280-632987) or at (808) 650-6688 with questions or needs on this or any other matter.

My roommates have all gone to their respective homes in California, leaving me all alone in the on-campus apartment. I am also a graduating senior, in the process of interviewing to work up here in California and I need to also look for an apartment to rent for when I graduate so I can live and work here. 

My home is in Ewa Beach, so my parents and grandparents are living in that house (all 60+ years old). And I am frustrated and confused.

* Low quality internet for online video conference for classes when at home
* 3 hours difference from class time
* Not in California for any spontaneous thing that I need to take care of that requires a physical presence
* Can't tour apartments to move into in May
* Possible contact with the virus during transit 
* Away from classmates and friends to work on group projects

My first claim was a small one since I worked a little.

Shortly after I was injured badly in a domestic violence incident and hospitalized for weeks. My ex was arrested and charged and I just found out he will be pleading guilty to the DV. It took a month after that to be able to walk without a walker and be off oxygen. I couldn't work for another month to two after that and still cannot drive.

I'll admit I lied saying I was able to go back to work for some claims once I got out of the hospital because it was the only way to have any income. I only started making claims again after looking for other help. I had no savings because of my now ex. I've been told theres no such thing as short term disability payments and the only other thing I could get was food stamps but that's it no way to pay rent or bills or anything except my unemployment. So judge me all you want but a bunch of comments saying it's my fault and I wasnt supposed to because I technically was unable to work. I get it.

Now of course that I can finally go back to work theres no work and I've ""exhausted my state and federal benefits"".

Anyone know of other forms of assistance? I work in the tourism industry and there's no way that's coming back anytime soon. It was already tough only having UI as my income for so long with so much medical care and other things piled on me and now....

It may be good practice to start at home also.

&gt; Here are directions on two methods for sanitizing:
&gt; 
&gt;-Chlorine bleach solution method: Soak dishes for at least one minute in a sanitizing solution made up of 1 tablespoon of unscented chlorine bleach + 1 gallon of cool water (hot water stops bleach from sanitizing). To make sure your bleach is at the correct concentration, use test strips (a Google search will bring up many retailers that sell these). Remove dishes and allow to completely air dry. Use gloves or utensils to remove dishes from the solution.

-

&gt;-Hot water method: Soak dishes completely covered in 170°F water for at least 30 seconds. Use a thermometer to check water temperature and time your soak with a clock. Remove dishes and allow to completely air dry. Use gloves or utensils to remove dishes from hot water.

1593,_Belly_of_the_Beast_,1584614765,fl80xr,Nan,"On the afternoon of Wednesday March 18th, I was having extreme difficulties breathing and standing, hold my arms up, I was fatigued. I went to bed and work up about 3pm, I told my wife I was feeling better, and got up. I started having breathing issues and some difficulty standing, my lips are numb.  My wife told me to go to the hospital. I called Maui Memorial ER and spoke with Leilani. While speaking with Leilani she said I should come to the hospital since I was having shortness of breath. Leilani also basically said I should only tell the hospital the facts of my heath and not what I think is wrong. I told my wife I was going to the hospital. I get to Maui Memorial hospital and am met by a nurse outside and asks me my issues. I tell her I’m having shortness of breath, and I am fatigued my lips are numb. Long story short, they ask for my license and take my temperature 98.4. I’m then instructed to see Robin, I make a complaint about seeing cross contamination to Robin, Robin says to me that she wears the same pair of gloves all day, cleans the gloves with hand sanitizer. Robin says I must go through the COVID-19 tent. I told her I don’t have COVID-19, and asked for my license back, that I’m leaving the hospital. Robin refuses to hand my license to me, and says I must go through the tent if I want to be seen at the hospital. I ask does everybody who comes to the hospital in the ambulance go through the tent? I obey under protest and go through the tent. The nurse does her thing and tells me I don’t have COVID-19 and I am released to go home. I blew up. I told her I know I don’t have COVID-19, I didn’t come to the hospital for that. I told her I have breathing problems (remember Leilani told me not to say what I think is wrong). Huge argument ensues. I was told they wouldn’t allow me to see a doctor at Maui Memorial, that her (nurse) decision is I’m healthy and I don’t have an emergency, I should not have come to the hospital. I told everyone that I’d rather die on the street then to ever come back to Maui Memorial. 

This afternoon before coming to Maui Memorial I wrote my symptoms down that I was experiencing, I asked the nurse who said I was fine and nothing is wrong with my health if she wanted to read them. She said no, she did glance at them. These notes I wrote had symptoms that fit the description of a TIA stroke. Which a person is told to seek immediate medical attention for. 

Maui Memorial Hospital believes no other health issues exist, other than COVID-19.

Not only did Maui Memorial refuse to allow a Doctor to see me about a possible TIA Stroke, I am now required to quarantine for 14 days because of incompetent medical staff.

I almost forgot , the male nurse in the tent was coughing. 

EDIT: I forgot some important details it seems .. nothing unusual with me... I was in this same hospital on New Year’s Day for flue like symptoms, and stabbing chest pains (it felt like hundreds if not thousands of needles stabbing my lungs when I inhaled). They took blood and a nasal swap, that came back negative for the flu. Leilani told me today to come back to the ER for a follow-up since I haven’t fully recovered since New Years Day, but the nurse overruled Leilani",Hawaii,My recent visit to the Maui Emergency Room

Goes into effect April 2 and is good throughout December 31, 2020

* Private insurance required to provide free COVID-19 testing
* Expands FMLA
* Expands/requires paid sick leave

EXPANDED FMLA
* Employees in the private sector whose companies have 500 employees or less AND employees in the public sector
* Defines “employee” as anyone who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days
* FMLA leave allows time off to care for family members under 18 whose school or childcare has been closed or is otherwise unavailable due to COVID-19
* First 10 days of FMLA leave are unpaid, but you can use PTO or sick leave to cover those days of the unpaid period
* Employer required to pay full-time employees 2/3 at their regular full-time pay rate for up to 10 weeks
* Employer required to pay part-time or those with irregular schedules at 2/3 their regular rate for the average number of hours worked over their prior 6 months of employment (document is not clear about how part-time pay works for employees who have less than 6 months with their employer)
* FMLA payments capped at $200/day ($10,000 in the aggregate)
* (Small businesses of less than 50 employees can seek an exemption if they can prove that these requirements would jeopardize the business. So if your employer has fewer than 50 employees, this may not apply to you, it just depends on if your employer seeks an exemption.)

EXPANDED PAID SICK LEAVE
* Employers with fewer than 500 employees and those the public sector are required to grant full-time employees with 80 hours of paid sick leave, in addition to any sick leave already provided by employer
* Part-time employees will be provided with pro-rated hours
* You CAN use these 80 hours to cover pay during the above first 10 days of unpaid FMLA

Employers must allow employees to use the expanded paid sick leave under the following circumstances:
1. The employee is subject to a Federal, State, or local quarantine, or isolation order related to COVID-19.
2. The employee has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19.
3. The employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking a medical diagnosis.
4. The employee is caring for an individual who is subject to an order as described above reasons 1 and/or 2
5. The employee is caring for a son or daughter of such employee if the school or place of care of the son or daughter has been closed, or the child care provider of such son or daughter is unavailable, due to COVID-19 precautions.
6. The employee is experiencing any other substantially similar condition specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor.

If you are using sick leave for reasons 1, 2, and 3, you will receive paid leave at your full regular rate of pay. If you are using sick leave for reasons 4 and 5, you will be paid at 2/3 your regular pay rate.

Emergency leave payments will be capped at $511/day ($5,110 total) for employees who take leave because of reasons 1, 2, and 3. Payments capped at $200/day ($2,000 total) for employees who take leave because of reasons 4, 5, and 6.",Hawaii,Families First Coronavirus Relief Act

SHUT IT DOWN or DON'T SHUT IT DOWN. Pick a god damn side Ige!

""Strongly encouraging"" anyone to do anything isn't helpful. It's confusing. 

A better solution to this would be to take a strong stance early, fix the problem, and move on.

Is shutting down flights to Hawaii from the mainland going to be painful? Absolutely. But we'll take the pain, keep the virus out, and we'll be able to open our doors again faster.

By half-assing it like this, we slowly introduce more and more of the virus to the island, while ALSO slowly bleeding out the economy. Worst of both worlds.

After coming to Hawaii (Kauai) to help extended family over a year ago, I was in the process of going back home to the mainland. Last week, I was trying to set the date of shipping my car back home and aligning all of the logistics. Now I’m not sure I can get back at all.

Matson is not answering their phone but Their website states that COVID has not interrupted anything. My family, friends and neighbors keep telling me that travel is “shut down” but I can not find an official source stating that people cannot leave the island. I’ve been trying to contact my county’s office to no avail.  
My plan was to fly into California and drive my car home to Maryland. 

I’m sorry if these question sounds shortsighted, selfish, stupid or naive but am I going to be able to make it home ? Is it even a smart decision to go home now ? I know all “non-essential” is frowned upon, but part of me feels like being with my loved ones in my home during a crisis is essential if I take as many precautions as necessary. 

I am afraid to be here stuck here if shit hits the fan but I am also afraid to be home if shit hits the fan. I don’t know which “worst case scenario” is worse. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I appreciate your patience with me in this scary time.",Hawaii,Am I going to be able to get back home ?

1761,triggerhappygurl,1584948362,fnfw94,Nan,"VISITORS, PLEASE READ:  Thinking of taking advantage of those cheap flights to Oahu you’re seeing online?  DON’T.  

Visitors come to our island to experience and appreciate our beautiful weather, culture, and people.  We appreciate all of you for your years of patronage, but right now the best way to show your love for us is to STAY HOME.

We are a people full of Aloha, but we are scared.  The same fear and anxiety you are experiencing is magnified here.  We live on an island in the middle of nowhere with one major hospital and VERY limited resources.  80% of our supplies come here by  boat/barge.  We can’t load up semi trucks and drive across borders like you can.

We are disappointed in our government for not shutting down flights to the islands.  We understand that our local leaders are doing what they can with the powers afforded to them but it’s not enough.  We’re not politicians so we’ll give it to you straight without all the fluffy politically-correct speak:

WE NEED ALL VISITORS TO STOP VISITING OUR ISLANDS ASAP AND RIDE THIS CRISIS OUT AT HOME.  

We understand that some of you will ignore this message.  Heck, even we touched the burner as a kid when told not to.  That’s how we learned what “hot” was.  Well, if you ignore this request and still choose to fly out here, here’s what you can expect:

1.   A mandatory 14-day quarantine.  You can’t leave your hotel room.

2.  All activities are closed.  No whale watches, sunset sails, volcano bike rides, luaus, you name it, it’s all closed.  

3.  No dine-in options at ANY restaurant, even those within the hotel you’ll be staying at.

4.  Closed hotels or hotels with VERY limited services if they are open, if any at all.  Hotels may also be forced to close while you’re here, forcing to you change flights and fly out immediately.

5.  All parks and BEACH parks are closed.  This includes public restrooms at those parks.

This is only a fraction of what is going on out here.

In addition to the above we have very limited resources and our doctors and hospitals will be overwhelmed.

While our residents are trying their best to hold it together, our patience is running thin, FAST, with visitors who choose to ignore social distancing recommendations and continue to fly out here.  By flying out you are increasing the odds of spreading the virus and delaying our recovery.  

Many are out of work and completely stressed, like many of you.  They can’t possibly provide the same experience you expect while under tremendous financial pressure/stress.  

In closing, we respectfully request that you show your love for us by staying home.  Once this crisis passes, we will welcome you with open arms and an abundance of aloha.  Until then, we are simply trying to survive.  

Mahalo and God Bless. ❤️",Hawaii,Please pass this on to visitors.

Our brains are wired to keep us alive and when *trauma* (i.e. a pandemic, lock downs) is added to the mix thoughts can become obsessive, intrusive, and even catastrophic. 

Setting intentions to acknowledge and observe thoughts as well as (separate) feelings while also focusing on what is happening in the moment, being grateful for what you have, seeking opportunities within the chaos, and practicing acts of self-love lessens the affects of *trauma*. It's easier said than done, and that's really a summary, but setting intentions will help. We have a lot of time on our hands to explore how we can be helping ourselves and one another through this *trauma* rather than essentially feeding into it and making it worse.

And, honestly, creating and seeing a pile of panic posts isn't healthy for any of us. Of course we could just decide not to come to r/hawaii or anywhere saturated with panic. Or, we could be like the ulua guy and intentionally add something more nurturing to the mix.

This is all food for thought.

All our accounts including farmers markets closed down.    We where able to pivot and not take a total loss and still get food to our customers from the farmers market.  

But now this week I'm seeing fb post after fb post from distributors on my island selling food boxes for 25 buxs many cash only(gee I wonder why they need cash) .  I've talked to a few of them and they are basically saying they are pretty much fucked soon so they need to dump into the market to at least make some money and stay a float.  And they still have containers coming so they'll be doing it for a bit. 

So yeah they are feeding people but there is also a shit ton of farmers I know doing the same thing.  The real question is who is going to go insolvent first the farmer who before sold to the distributor or the distributor.  My guess is both.

After reading /u/idk_whats_a_name's comment in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/fofm4q/hawaii_public_school_campuses_to_remain_closed/), I was inspired to offer my alma mater a computer system that I have just laying around. 

I know that there are a lot of underprivileged families here in Hawaii, and it's probable that not all students have what they need to learn from home. 

It hit me that I have some things at home just laying around that could be used to help someone who needs it. It would make me really happy to be able to help a student/family in need. And this way, I know my donation would go to a real student/family in need, rather than someone trying to take advantage. I sent my alma mater an email letting them know who I was and what I had to offer.

Hawaii's graduation rate is low enough without this extra pandemic hurdle on top of it.

I'm not posting this to try and take credit or anything. Rather, maybe we as a community can get something bigger going? I have no idea how to organize such a thing like a mass technology donation to schools, but I think there is a lot of potential to do good here.

It’s critical we are all wearing masks. And it’s important that we make our own masks; So, that way we do not compete for the N95’s. 

We need to share masks with people who interact with the public, like bank tellers, cashiers, food producers, delivery people, etc. They are risking too much. 

These masks are 50% effective when using cotton T shirts. See material list. It’s for use for the short time a person is out of the safe 6 ft zone, like when shopping for food. It protects people from large droplets from sneezing, etc. Smaller chance of getting a strong dose that would put more pressure on people’s immune system. So, this helps everyone by lowering the chance of spreading and lowering the intensity of the dose compared to no masks.

We know that 6 ft is a safe zone. The N95’s are 95% effective for protection when someone sneezes right in your face from less than 1 ft . When shopping, we are probably in the 3-5 ft zone. A 50% effective mask might take us into the 6 ft zone. Anything is better than nothing.

&gt;Chief Justice Mark Recktenwald has directed some top Hawaii judges to work with police and prosecutors to identify jail inmates who can be quickly released...to try to prevent the spread of coronavirus among the prisoners and staff...

&gt;In a related development, the state Office of the Public Defender on Tuesday petitioned the state Supreme Court to commute or suspend the sentences of inmates serving time for petty misdemeanor or misdemeanor offenses in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The petition also would cover inmates who are serving jail time as a condition of probation for felony convictions.

&gt;“It is inevitable that the virus will spread into the jails and prison facilities...” according to the filing by Public Defender James Tabe.  “It is therefore incumbent upon the criminal justice system to reduce our state jail populations to the extent possible without compromising public safety. This is a moral imperative as well as a legal issue,” Tabe wrote.   The public defender’s request is modeled after a consent order in New Jersey that required the release of up to 1,000 low-level offenders by Tuesday in response to the spread of coronavirus.

But prison reform advocate Demont Conner asserted that the percentage of homeless is closer to 50 percent.

Will a significant percentage of the releasees just end up as part of Hawaii homeless population?  And what are the plans for them?",Hawaii,"Coronavirus brings challenges, dilemma for Hawaii's justice system"

Therefore, I have a few questions I need to confirm: 

1) I am a returning Hawaiian resident. Will I be allowed to self-quarantine myself in my own home upon arrival to Oahu, Hawaii? Will I need to present some kind of documentation (I still have my US passport and Hawaiian birth certificate with me right now) to prove that I live in Oahu, Hawaii?

2) Will my father be able to come to the airport if he drives alone? This will result in just the two of us in the car coming from the airport to our home (will this be allowed?). 

3) If my father alone is arriving to the airport to pick me up, will he need to present some kind of 'proof' that he is picking up someone at the airport? Is it enough if he has a hard copy of my flight itinerary?

The military is being more proactive in their testing, and thus is a more accurate barometer of what is happening ... IMO more likely the case.

1. What are your general thoughts on becoming an EMT in the midst of the COVID19 pandemic? 

2. Do you think the pandemic will make it easier or more difficult to try to get into KCC's EMT program?

3. How has the pandemic affected Honolulu City and County Emergency Medical Services? I'm aware that there was already an issue with understaffing, burnout, decrepit ambulances, etc. Has our EMS system experienced the kind of stress we're seeing in other cities? If not, do you think we can expect to?

I had intended to apply for KCC's EMT program at the end of May, but the volunteer program I was set to work for was, understandably, shut down indefinitely. I'm already almost done with my prerequisites, I have already received my BLS certs, etc., and volunteering was the last thing to check off, so it's definitely a bit upsetting.

(I might go ahead and join the Navy or Coast Guard reserves until the horizon is clearer. I had been struggling trying to decide whether to do EMT or reserves first for the last few months, and this pandemic has essentially answered that question for me.)

 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

I’ve been taking extra hygienic precautions and sharing the responsibilities with my brother, but it’s coming to the point that I don’t feel comfortable at all exposing myself daily and chancing exposing my grandma.

I’ve spoken with our HR department and our company does not offer paid sick leave for new employees. I also am too green to have earned any PTO/vacation. Short of having to quit, my only options are to have a reduction in my hours where I would be eligible for unemployment. Work is trying their best to figure the situation out.

Right now it’s looking more and more like I’ll need to reduce hours. My question(s) are should I go ahead and file for unemployment now even though I’m at the moment still considered full time? I only ask because of the time it may take from filing to possibly being approved, plus the grace period before receiving first payment. I also obviously want to be truthful, and the truth is there’s a 99.999% chance I will be in that unemployment-eligibility bracket within the next couple weeks to month.

About four months ago I was on unemployment, so I’m not sure if I should re-file from my original application or file new through the newly minted huiclaims2020 site they’ve launched. 

I really want to keep my co-workers, customers, and family safe, which at the moment is a little difficult as people need groceries. I also have to somehow sanely balance that with staying employed and keeping the lights and water on, if not for grandma’s sake more than anything.

Can anyone please provide some insight and advice on a desperate grandson? And I know I’m not the only one in this situation and I’m not trying to pretend otherwise. So if anyone else is in a similar situation, please help a brother out!",Hawaii,Question about filing for unemployment

According to the U.S Justice Department, in 2006, 32,443 women of Caucasian origin were raped by men of African origin. That same year, the number of African American women raped by Caucasian men.. was.. zero. 

In fact, 90% of all interracial crimes in the U.S. are committed by blacks... against whites.. So what if all blacks were to... suddenly... disappear from the U.S.? Murder would go down 49.7 percent, welfare recipients would go down 40 percent, SAT scores would go up about 100 points, the average IQ would go up 7 points, and AIDS victims would go down a staggering... 67... percent. Significant changes for race that only makes up 13% of the population. 

In biology, races are distinct genetically divergent populations ""within the same species"", with relatively small morphological and genetic.. differences. Populations can be described as ecological races if they arise from adaptation to different local habitats or geographic races when they are geographically isolated. However, if sufficiently different, two or more races can be identified as... sub... species. So how long do two races have to be isolated from one another before they're considered separate species? Earlier this year, Archaeologists found artefacts in a cave on Western Australia's Barrow Island dating back more than 50,000 years, making it Australia's earliest known site of human occupation. In contrast, the domestication of the dog began just 15,000... years... ago. This distance, some several thousand miles between the mainlands of Australia and Asia also caused another kind of distance. Genetic... distance. 

Genetic distance is a measure of the genetic divergence between species or between populations within a species. Dogs and wolves have been found to have a shorter genetic distance between each other than Negroids and non-Negroids. The distance between Eurasians and Africans being even larger than Homo Sapiens and Homo... Erectus. Well, it kinda makes sense. I mean, can two races with diverging skin tones, eye colors, behavioral patterns, intellectual and athletic capabilities even be considered the same subspecies? Is it even a question? Is it even a question you're... allowed to... ask? In October 2007, geneticist James Watson, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and the familiar double-helix model we all had to leam in High School, was lambasted by the scientific community for a response he gave in an interview regarding the divergence of intellect between geographically isolated populations. ""There is no fim reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically,"" James wrote. ""Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so"". 

The response resulted with a suspension of Watson's administrative responsibilities and was forced to... cancel.. his book tour. And tragically, in 2014, Mr Watson auctioned his Nobel Prize medal he won in 1962, stating that ""no-one really wants to admit I exist"". Harsh. 

But people tend to react this way to ideas that go against their own personal world view and... cognitive.. biases. Confirmation bias. It's the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one's. own. preconceptions. This effect, stronger for emotionally charged issues, warps your interpretation of data in a way that keeps you from... being... wrong. There is something fundamental in our minds that makes us hesitant to question ideas that we've... already come to a conclusion to. We all do it. But who could blame us? That's just part of being a member of the human... species. 

And as always, around blacks, never relax.",Hawaii,Good information.

If you are a landlord and have no mortgage, give your renter a break. If you are a landlord and have a mortgage, talk to your mortgage company. The mortgage companies have nothing to gain by forcing you into default. If they can give you a break, you can give your renter a break. Not everyone needs a break, if you do, ask for one. Banks and mortgage companies gain nothing by strong arming you during this crisis. It gives them a bad name in the end.

If you are a property management company, initiate discussions between the owners and the renters. Assist with the negotiations, work aloha into the conversations. Recommend to owners to be nice. Have extra communications with the renters. Everyone is hurting. Coach your staff, be nice. It benefits no one forcing people out.

If you are a lender, a bank, or a mortgage company, consider forgiving your borrowers if they need a break. No one will expect your company’s performance to remain stellar during this time.

2123,boundariesnewbie,1585772181,ft7p8f,Nan,"I searched for similar inquiries, so my sincerest apologies if this has already been well-covered. I've only been lurking for a few days and while I saw posts and comments that intersected this issue, I didn't see anything that was directly addressing this major concern I have: **is it actually ethical to move to Hawai'i?** 

I used to dismiss the notion of moving to Hawai'i out of hand because I didn't want to contribute to the ongoing colonialism of indigenous lands. I am indigenous myself (to mainland US, Anishinaabe to be exact, and my other half is another nation experiencing very active, violent colonial land-grabbing as we speak). I never want to perpetuate what my family has suffered/continues to suffer through.

My mind hasn't necessarily changed on that issue; I am sure that my moving to Hawai'i means another home occupied by a mainland settler that could otherwise house a local family. My arrival would necessarily mean potentially displacing someone else. 

Unfortunately, that's also true of anywhere else I'd want to live in the US thanks to ever-accelerating gentrification. I live in a coastal city with an affordable housing crisis. I was low-income (and have been poor my whole life) when I moved here, so it's not like I alone made a huge negative impact, and I know that I'm not the worst/typical gentrifier. I try to do what I can to consume as ethically as possible and frequent local establishments/vendors. But I am still caught in the dynamic, you know? It's a systemic issue, and know that my individual choices will do little to impact either positively or negatively. But I do try as much as I can. The only (99%) ethical move I could maybe make would be to move back to my hometown...more on that later. 

So for some more background: I now make around $60k and work remotely, with a business on the side that could easily become my full-time gig if I wanted. I'm not a wealthy haole landowner type, looking to buy a vacation home to leave empty all year and driving real estate prices up. If I move here, I'll rent for a year or more and then look into buying a small piece of land and building (I have seen that it's complicated af to build there, so I'm looking into pre-fabs and tiny homes constructed locally on Big Island). My partner, who is of a similar background to me is also self-employed and would love to be able to hire local and at least create a few decent jobs. Neither of us are used to bougie living; we know very well how to manage on tight budgets and don't mind continuing that approach. We also both volunteer a lot and donate extra income when we have it, so we would definitely prioritize giving back to our new community. We do not plan on procreating. 

**Pretty much every list of why NOT to move to Hawai'i -- aside from the ethics of it -- doesn't really apply to us.** 

Nightlife - We are in our early-30s, and not into the club scene. Chill bar patios and house hangouts are our fave and tbh we barely even drink alcohol.

Culture - We despise the rush-around-hustle-culture of the mainland US. Even though I am American, I grew up in the OTHER tropical US state, in a predominantly Caribbean immigrant community. I had to make massive adjustments in order to fit into the standard (dominant, white American) culture when I moved to my current city. I've tried to make THAT lifestyle stick for almost 10 years now, and I've had to conclude that it's just a bad fit. My partner is an immigrant himself and has never felt like he fit in here (this city) either. 

Which actually brings me to the main reason I keep thinking about Hawai'i: It is absolutely essential for us to move to a culturally diverse place. Unfortunately, that usually means cities (NYC or LA, mostly, bc where we live now is a city but it's not truly diverse--people of different backgrounds NEVER hang out together here, and that's pretty common in other metro areas based on my research). There are some diverse ""non-metropolitan"" areas in the US Southwest (AZ, NM), but those areas also seem too vulnerable to very immediate climate change and are landlocked. California is even more expensive than Hawai'i (comparing south and central Cali to Big Island, more specifically) and catches fire all the time.

Climate - Relatedly, we need warmth. My partner and I are both affected really negatively by the 6-months of rainy, freezing gloom we have now. We are both from very warm weather localities that never had distinct seasons. I've seen seasons now for a decade and I'm very okay with trading in gorgeous fall leaves for NOT having to contend with Seasonal Affective Disorder and chronic vitamin D issues (both of us). This limits the regions of the country we can relocate to. We both also really value being near the ocean, we both grew up with it. Obviously, thanks to colonialism, it's now a massive privilege to live near the sea, and we would be willing to give that desire up for a place that met our other criteria...but so far nothing else really matches. Unless we move abroad, which would be even harder as working-class people, and especially since he's awaiting his citizenship. 

I don't have any illusions that Hawai'i = easy. I know that there are myriad challenges. I'm familiar with a lot of them coming from my home state. Family elsewhere used to think I lived in paradise and went to the beach all the time. I mean, the latter is sort of true, at least compared to the bullshit vitamin-D deficient lifestyle I have now. But as soon as I told them about the shit economy, the amazing array of deadly bugs and critters, humidity, drug abuse, racism, and weird crime, they backed off quite a bit. So I'm prepared for all that noise again, y'all! If it means living somewhere where my boo and I can better fit in (and I know that's contentious, but I mean that our values are much more aligned with what I've observed about Hawai'i folks'), and have a slower--even if much less convenient--lifestyle. 

You may wonder why not just move back to my home state, but if you haven't guessed already, that would be Florida. So that's a firm nope. Even aside from the deeply, often violently racist white population (Confederate types), the politics are bananas and keep moving further and further to the right (""purple"" state, my ass). Also...hurricanes keep ruining everything, and I know that's rarer in HI. 

**TL;DR: WILL I BE A COLONIZER!? Even as a working-class brown person, trying to do things the right way? Should I still look elsewhere?**

I'm interested in hearing from both locals and transplants!

For me, I am having a hard time getting my father to wash his hands.  Prior to COVID 19, he didn't always wash his hands after using the bathroom to begin with.  I know this because my bedroom shares a wall with the bathroom and I can hear everything that goes on in there.  I usually heard the faucet go on after #2 but never after #1.  The few time I brought it up to him, he got really mad and defensive so I've had to grit my teeth for years.

Ever since this COVID19 thing, he has gotten better about washing after using the bathroom.  But now he gets annoyed when I ask him to wash his hands when he comes home from the store.  I've tried not saying anything but then he just doesn't think to do it on his own!  The other day he got upset because he came home from the store, brought some stuff in the house and sat down on the couch for a bit.  I asked him to wash his hands and he snapped and said he was going back outside to do yardwork, he'd wash it after that.  In my head, I'm thinking is it really that hard to wash your hands twice?!?!  He'd still be touching the doorknob and the TV remote and the refrigerator door handle even before going back outside.

Biggest thing is this:

* Besides filing, you also need to create an account asap at https://www.hirenethawaii.com   You can do this before you file too.

* Make sure **everything** is filled in

* You will have to upload a resume of some kind.  Make something quick if you need to, you can always change it later.

* If your account or resume is over 6 months old, you need to update it or the system counts it as invalid for UI. (Even if you upload the same resume again, system will count it now as new)

* In this account, you also must make sure that your info is open for view by employers. If you have it set to private/non-searchable, it will also be considered invalid for UI Claims.

If you don't have Microsoft Office, no worries.  You can use these free options to make resumes.  www.libreoffice.org and www.openoffice.org

Some more tips:

* If you get an error on your UI claim like: PENDING WORK REGISTRATION OR DETERMINATION ON WORK REGISTRATION. Contact the folks at Hirenet Hawaii (not the UI office), they are the ones that will help and clear this error.

* Yes, the waiting week has been waived.  You will still see your claim status as ""WAITING PERIOD"", it's ok.  Your claim still has to be viewed/approved by a human.  Usually you are not paid for the ""Waiting Week"", but now you will be.

* If you can afford it, select the option to have Taxes taken out now. (Like your work paycheck used to do).  This will save you from having to pay all those taxes in a lump at the end of the year. Aprox $25/week

*  DO NOT miss any filing deadlines.  Set a reminder on your phone, and write it on the calendar.  Each time you file, it will tell you when your next one is due.  At first it's weekly, then it jumps to bi-weekly.  If you miss it, they will freeze your claim, and you will have to call and beg for them to unfreeze it.  Do it more than once, and kiss those benefits good bye.  Also, they're overloaded, so getting unfrozen can take a long time now.

*  DO NOT try and file from out side of the state. (This will freeze your claim, see above)  If you start traveling in a few weeks, they will know. They know if you are connecting to the system outside of Hawaii.  You'll have to get a friend in the state to file online for you if you do decide to leave the state.  

* If you decide to move from Hawaii, no worries, let them know, and they will transfer your claim to your new state of residence.

*  Save everything.  All documentation/communication/job-logs between you and UI.  If you're ever called in for an audit, you will be glad you have it.

*  If you get denied:  Don't panic.  Immediately go online and file an appeal. (You only have a short time to file this).  You will be given a hearing date (via phone) where you can make your case. Make sure to have all available evidence like earnings, past good-reviews, emails/communications about your dismissal from your employer, etc.  

* It can take a few weeks to get your first check during ideal conditions, but try not to fret. Your first UI check will have all the ""back pay"" for weeks that you've filed.

2209,codincatio,1585961636,fukbri,Nan,"Hello! I'm a marketing professional who's preparing to start a company. I am not Hawaiian but have lived here for many years. 

I aim to work with nonprofit orgs and businesses in industries like healthcare, wildlife conservation, public health, and education. The goal is to launch ad campaigns and PSAs that benefit individual consumers and the culture as a whole rather than just run ads for any company trying to turn a profit.

The time I've spent here and the stories I've read about Hawaiian history and folklore has drastically influenced my personal and professional philosophy. It's partly why I feel compelled to pursue ""social responsibility"" in an industry that is all too often exploitative, manipulative, and invasive.

Anyway, I've come across some Hawaiian words that perfectly capture the philosophy behind my work and mission. While I'd like to include them in the brand name, they should ultimately serve as reminders to myself, employees, and clients and maybe spread some Hawaiian wisdom to those who could certainly use it (consumers and corporations). 

Is it okay for me to use these concepts as ""anchors"" in my business? I don't plan to use any Hawaiian imagery or icons in my branding. 

What are your thoughts? When does cultural exchange and admiration become cultural appropriation and exploitation? How can I courteously embrace and promote Hawaiian philosophy?

**TL;DR How can I be respectful and thoughtful while including Hawaiian language and philosophy in my work?**

At this moment I do believe this is perfectly acceptable because

1) I am genuinely moved by Hawaiian culture and wisdom and hope to promote it through my work. I don't think I'm shallowly using Hawaiian language or icons to appear exotic or interesting. There simply aren't English words with equivalent meanings.

2) I am not ""borrowing"" or ""stealing"" these ideas and passing them off as my own. I want to describe how our place of origin (Maui) shaped the business's purpose and philosophy while also providing relevant historical context and explaining why these concepts matter beyond business.

3) This is meant to be an *exchange* of ideas and resources*.* I plan to launch PSAs about preserving our wildlife, offering pro bono/discounted work to nonprofits and small businesses located in Hawaii, presenting free workshops to local students and professionals, etc. It is about more than just branding—my goal is to help Hawaii-based businesses grow while preserving wildlife, promoting compassion and empathy, and strengthening that sense of community, purpose, and Aloha.

But hey! I could be totally wrong. Just because my intentions are ""good"" doesn't mean I can do whatever I want. I do recognize that cultural appropriation and misappropriation often comes from a simple lack of awareness, so I wanted to get some feedback before I move forward.

Thanks so much if you even read this far ha ha this was longer than I expected x",Hawaii,Is it appropriate to use Hawaiian language in my business name if I'm not Hawaiian?

I saw stuff online, and apparently there are chances of encountering locals that have ill-will towards mainlanders and/or caucasians in general.


I was wondering about the credibility of this, especially if I were to succeed in living there in the future. Here are some questions:

-Is it even true that locals may be racist towards caucasians?

-Are they mainly prevalent in specific areas, and if so, which areas contain less racism and which contain more?

-Are the racism claims out of “spite” after disrespect, or is it actual racism? 
Ex. I visit Hawaii, and am rude to people. They are rude back, I pull the race card.

-Is it towards tourists, or ANYONE non-native?

-What would be the daily life of a caucasian living there, and how would it even be encountered?

-Does it affect things such as getting jobs or anything like that?

I'm not a fan of Governor Ige, but overall I think he did what he needed to do (even if it was slow). He pulled the trigger and made some bold decisions that probably saved lives.

Hawai’i Challenges Top Statistics In The Nation Dealing With COVID-19

Preliminary Analysis II

While the response of certain elected officials have been questionable in Hawai’i, data shows that our island communities are taking COVID-19 seriously. The data shows that the population of Hawai’i have dramatically decreased their mobility in the last month in response to the global Coronavirus Pandemic. Additionally, testing rates in Hawai’i per-capita are above average in the United States, and the amount positive test results returned are significantly below average.

Compiling data between Hawai’i Department of Transportation, Google’s COVID-19 Community Mobility Report, and the Unacast Social Distancing Scoreboard, shows that Hawai’i as a whole have made significant changes to their normal routines and behaviors.

Testing statistics have also returned encouraging results in Hawai’i when compared with the rest of American states. New York State maintains the highest per capita testing in the nation, yet the rate New York is returning positive COVID-19 test results is a magnitude higher than Hawai’i.

Stats Used In Determining Social Distancing

Since Mid February:
Traffic volume across Hawai’i state drops off 45.6%.

- Hawaii DoH, last update 3.25.2020

Retail &amp; recreation like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, etc, are down 56%.

Grocery &amp; pharmacy, including farmers markets have gone down by 36%.

Parks and beach usage is down 65%.

All public transit stations are down 72%.

Workplace mobility is down 45%.

Places of residence usage, people being at home, is up 16%.

Stats for each Hawai’i County are broken down in an attached image. To compare how Hawai’i compares to other states, see: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/

Nationwide Testing Statistics

Nationwide,

the ratio between positive test results and tests taken (hit-rate) is 19%.

The nationwide testing per-capita is 430 per 100,000 people.

- COVID Tracking Project, as of April 3rd. 2018 Census.


NOTE: A wide testing program in a given region can be indicated by the per-capita testing rates.

The higher the per-capita testing, the more thoroughly the testing has been conducted to date between different population densities.  The ratio between positive test results and total tests conducted (hit-rate) indicates how saturated a region is with COVID-19 infections in the population. A low hit-rate gives some indications that there is a low underlying infection in the community, with some reservations noted in LIMITATIONS.


Per Capita Testing In Hawai’i:

In Hawai’i,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 2.5%,

per capita testing rate of 865 per 100,000 people.

(12,283 tests, 317 positives)


Comparing to Testing In A Few States:

In New York,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 38%,

per capita testing rate of 1,387 per 100,000 people.

(271,002 tests, 102,863 positives)


In California,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 30%,

per capita testing rate of 892 per 100,000 people.

(35,300 tests, 10,701 positives)


In Louisiana,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 19%,

per capita testing rate of 1,096 per 100,000 people.

(53,645 tests, positives 10,297)


In Colorado,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 19%,

per capita testing rate of 387 per 100,000 people.

(22,071 tests, 4,173 positives)


In Alabama,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 16%,

per capita testing rate of 198 per 100,000 people.

(9,722 tests, 1,535 positives)


In Texas,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 10%,

per capita testing rate of 192 per 100,000 people.

(55,764 tests, 5,330 positives)

In Florida,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 10%,

per capita testing rate of 479 per 100,000 people.

(102,067 tests, 11,111 tests)


In Washington,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 8%,

per capita testing rate of 1,150 per 100,000 people.

(82,599 tests, positives 6,966)


In Utah,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 5%,

per capita testing rate of 767 per 100,000 people.

(24,248 tests, 1,246 positives)


In New Mexico,

the hit-rate on COVID-19 test samples is 3%,

per capita testing rate of 746 per 100,000 people.

(15,632 tests, 495 positives)

-  Compiled data from COVID Tracking Project, 2018 Census, Hawai’i Department of Health, 4.3.2020.

----

Summary

Data would indicate that Hawai’i has had a significant drop-off in the movement of people in Hawai’i. This is initially encouraging data for Hawai’i. After processing 12,283 COVID-19 tests for Hawai’i, the initial hit-rates are also encouraging (2.5%). Many areas in the United States are seeing significantly more positive cases per test taken, or have not seen the reductions in mobility that Hawai’i has seen.

Personal Note:

There is plenty room of improvements in Hawaii’s testing capability relatively, but using the data available suggests Hawai’i is taking the threat of COVID-19 seriously.  There is also room for improvement in social distancing.

When combining the metrics to determine social distancing and testing for COVID-19, Hawai’i ranks among the strongest in the nation. Social distancing statistics strongly suggest the adoption of recommendations by medical professionals, like Hawai’i Lt. Gov. Josh Green.  However, there are considerations to be made in these findings for tourism, and other visitors that have left the island in the last month, and those that have canceled their vacations. On a typical day in 2019, there would be roughly 30,000 visitors traveling to Hawai’i on average.  Yesterday, there were 94 visitors to the state, according the Hawai’i Tourism Authority.

Considering the limitations in testing, and the differences in recording and testing methodologies across America; this data suggests Hawai’i Island, Kaua’i and Maui are “ahead of the curve” on testing.  Looking at positive cases reported by Hawai’i Department of Health the rates of growth currently focus on O‘ahu. O’ahu accounts for approximately 72% of the population in Hawai’i, and represents 77% of positive test results in the islands.

EDIT: The hit rate on today's testing (4.4.2020) was 4.7% in Hawai'i (679 tests, 32 positives), not a good trend. Stay-at-home is highly important at this time as can expect the infection to be more widespread than the testing indicates.


LIMITATIONS

•	Known Faults and Limitations in Testing - Nationwide and in Hawai’i, not everyone that desires a test are being tested, even some with symptoms. Delays in testing are creating issues, the most common testing methods can take several days to receive results. The amount of infected can be assumed to be significantly higher than the official totals.

•	Tourism in Hawai’i - It’s possible that even significant portions of this data is skewed by tourism, and the current lack there-of. The use of GPS data and sensor data on roadways could still potentially be misleading when considering resident’s movements. If previous averages are incorporated, and the majority of visitors are now no longer on island, then data used can be misleading in determining mobility alterations by the residents of Hawai’i.

•	No public stats exist that distinguish the rate each county in Hawai’i is testing, only state Department of Health statistics exist.

•	The bulk of this work was done over the course of a day, there may be errors.

•	Visitors testing positive for COVID-19 are low statistically. One possible explanation is that to cases are being accounted for upon return home, if tested. 80% of cases for COVID-19 do not require hospitalization.

•	This is not a precise analysis. The goal of this post is only to show in general how Hawai’i is handling relatively to the mainland.

 “So you’re telling me we cannot requisition the individuals in state government who are sitting at home because they can’t go into work, and cannot perform their functions via telework, to help the private citizen taxpayers who are paying their paychecks to facilitate quicker distribution of the unemployment benefits? And you cannot help in that process because you don’t have the information either?” Sen. Keohokalole slammed.

 Wada said his agency is working to identify three different groups, or “buckets” of workers. Bucket 1 is essential workers; Bucket 2 is non-essential workers who can work from home; and Bucket 3 is non-essential workers who cannot work from home.

  They asked Wada how many workers are in each bucket, which opened up 45 minutes of annoyed conversation when he couldn’t answer them. Wada said he would tell them by next week, to which Senator Donovan M. Dela Cruz answered, “We’ve been talking about this for quite some time – even before we recessed – and it’s still not done.”

  Sen. Dela Cruz pressed Wada for an answer soon. “If it gets to the point where these things are not completed by April 30, which seems to me is the track record of the department, that’s an awkward situation.
