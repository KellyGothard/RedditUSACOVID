Just imagine what the towns in North Dakota would look like with every adult there getting an extra $1000 every single month. Completely invigorate the local economy. Imagine finally getting to car repairs, being able to support local diners or bakery’s and new businesses popping up and actually sticking around. Heck actually update/remodel houses instead only after a flood or tornado to hit. Then it’ll really help slow down the brain drain to the big cities and even attract some folks back from the city wanting their dividend to go farther and be back near family. 

It would be so transformational for small town rural America.  The difference it would make to my family members who just want to farm and to pick back up the great little towns that are just drifting away right now. Ugh, it’s such an epic opportunity!",1577770577,fcmcm8m

Met a juggling reporter at Annapolis, Maryland.

Met a juggling patent owner for something in the store industry at Raleigh, North Carolina.

Ran into a group of protesters in Montgomery, Alabama, protesting against the prison system in AL.

Ran into a security guard in Nashville, Tennessee that told me it was disrespectful to juggle against statues (this prompted me to inform a security guard about my shenanigans beforehand at future capitols).

Had some people yell “oh look, he’s juggling potatoes!” in Boise, Idaho.

Had a guy help me up a tree in Sacramento, California.

Had a security guy kick me off a fountain in Salem, Oregon.

Had a security guy tell me 3-legged tripods aren’t allowed on Capitol grounds in Columbus, Ohio.

Had all sorts of interesting looks on a very crowded warm winter Sunday in Boston, Massachusetts.

And this doesn’t include taking pics with some people and just kicking it with other tourists that were visiting that day, including two guys that were setting up for a concert for the day after in North Dakota. I love that your Capitol hosts events.",1578618930,fdp37v4

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; The hearings started with the whistle-blower complaint about quid-pro-quo, but during the hearings it became clear as witness after witness stated that there was no quid-pro-quo, or that QPQ was not even possible. At that point, Democrats began shifting their opinions from QPQ to Extortion being the issue. Then, in mid-november sometime, Pelosi said in a press conference that his impeachable offence was bribery. The impeachable offenses seem to keep shifting from one thing to another when the last thing didn't pan out. In a legitimate trial, the prosecutors need to have stated all factors in their brief when bringing charges against someone, they cant just add things to the list mid-way through the trial just because their last points arent holding water. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is pretty far from being open minded. How could you say there was no quid-pro-quo when the only witness with first hand knowledge literally testified in his opening statement that there was quid-pro-quo. Let's put this in context. Zelenskiy, a very anti-corruption, western sided, new politician wins HUGE. After his election, Trump calls him and immediately invites him to the White House - April 21. Trump says he'll go to Zelenskiy's Inauguration, he then cancels and tells Pence to go. He then cancels Pence. Trump has no personal contact with Zelensky until July 25th, when they have a congratulatory phone call because Zelenskiy's anti-corruption party wins a huge election in parliament. This phone call is where Zelenskiy says he wants to purchase some javelins, Trump immediately follows up with ""do us a favor though"" and requests Zelenskiy follow through with the 'investigations' (that Guilliani has been pushing). 90 minutes after this phone call, Trump orders a hold on the aid. September 9th, Trump gets notified of a Whisteblower report, September 11th, Trump release the military aid.

&amp;#x200B;

Trump has refused to allow ANY witness to testify. Trump has refused to give up documents. They only thing he has released is 2 memo's of phone calls with Zelenskiy. Not transcripts. The transcripts are reportedly locked up in one of the US most secure servers for confidential information.

&amp;#x200B;

Trump is acting guilty af. Let people testify and relaese documents. He calls himself the most transparent president in history, but he's not behaving that way. Impeachment Article 2 is Obstruction of Congress, because of this. The courts ruled after Nixon's Impeachment, that the House has a right to all documents requested in an Impeachment proceeding.

346,346,marwin23,"Slightly disagree based on own experience - this is not a bias, it is often reality.

We moved to USA from 100% white country ca. 10 years ago and started to live in NYC. Diversity, sodom &amp; gomorrah on streets etc. In 2nd grade my daughter was unable to answer me the question whether any child is black as she did not feel a difference. From that point we started to speak more openly at home about our feelings, and both me and wife agreed, that it is not a bias - we can simply not stand some behavior.

Loud music on streets till night, shouting on each other in a subway, permanent arguments in a store, obscene behavior - that is a diversity in reality there. And believe or not, it was not caused by immigrants like we, but by 100% American which were different from us only by one visible feature.

Slight suggestions in office not to bring pork for lunch, as our muslim co-workers can not use the same microwave then. Being asked not to wish loudly Merry X-Mas to others, as not everyone is Christian - that is an untold fact rarely mentioned in newspapers. Going for an office lunch (15ppl) was a huge challenge: some groups do not eat pork, and can not eat in restaurant serving it, the same or others need to eat only in places certified by their religion group, the others were plain vegans etc. At that point, for us, people from Europe, Chinese immigrants who eat everything were the best company - we could order pizza together, and do not care what toppings are there;) 

First shock when me moved to Midwest was that NOBODY in restaurant was mentioning 'we serve it with pork/bacon/etc'. Who cares: when I order potato soup I expect to have bacon there. In NYC in 75% of situation just after ordering any dish you heard: 'sir, we serve it with pork meat'.

I really believe that before one says something about diversity and equality it is best to experience it from a first-hand, instead of copying media slogans.

399,399,killerklaws,"I don't like this as written, and hope it fails. But here's what I'm very disappointed that this discussion is missing:

The current system sucks and has major flaws. If you have enough money you can buy whatever you want into the ND constitution and there's little recourse to fix the fuckups. 

Example - Marsy's ""law"" was actually a constitutional amendment, bankrolled by a California billionaire who's probably never been to ND, and was designed as a constitutional amendment so it would be next to impossible to change, even with the unintended consequences.

The stupidity of trying to put weed into the ND constitution is another example. 

As much as I hate saying this, sometimes the legislature DOES know better than the voters or has the ability to fix problems.

403,403,transcending_pork,"Yeah maybe a lot of the other commenters are okay with the legislature handling things after the people have already spoken, but I've seen enough of that shit in my lifetime already, I think.  You know that once the power is there that they're going to use it to (as somebody else here already said) tie up anything that they don't approve of with red tape for an eternity.  I mean we already saw that on how long it took for them to roll out anything meaningful after the medical marijuana bit passed.  Absolutely ridiculous how long it took.  All because the backwoods legislators have their pantaloons in a bunch about allowing such an awful gateway drug to be legal for helping people where it's medically proven to have benefits.  


Legislators are good at two things, and those are writing legaleze and kissing enough ass/making enough promises (whether kept or not) to be able to obtain office.  They certainly don't hold any credentials on the science, the technology, or the civics of the legislation that would cause them to be held in any moral authority over the voters.  They're just damn lawyers, and we all know enough quotes about trusting lawyers.  If they're not any more educated than the citizens on the matters that they legislate, why give them any more power than the people have?  It's foolish.  


Last, but not least, in many cases you can actually count on the legislators to vote *against* what is in the best interests for the people, or the environment, or whatever beneficiary there could be.  That is due to the fact that there are entrenched interests and industry that need to be torn down or bypassed in order to pass what is sustainable and good for the people.  You know, those great big moneygrubbing companies that screw over a huge percentage of the population to help the CEOs keep making bonuses that make what we earn in a decade seem paltry by comparison.  These companies have lobbyists, and lobbyists pay money and give significant favors to legislators in return for promises that they'll vote against the best interests of the constituents and in the best interests of the company and CEO instead.  If this sounds like bribery to you, that's because it is.  And because it's legal in this country it happens every day.  Why do you think so little meaningful change actually happens?  


So yeah, let the morons on here say go for it, let the legislators handle things.  I, for one, say that the legislators are, in the majority, corrupt and greedy lawyers who should be bypassed at any opportunity.  I'd insert a meme here for comic relief but I don't want to detract from my point.  We can't even elect a damn president by popular vote any more because the electoral college will change things how they see fit, let's not let that happen with votes on measures here now, too.",1579372940,fet9e24

Some schools have pretty decent arenas that can seat over 1,000 fans and they definitely fill all of those seats for big games. The state tournament is at the UND Engelstad arena, which is pretty cool. Fans tend to travel well, since long drives are a way of life in ND. It’s pretty crazy to think about how much money schools have invested in their hockey teams. Since the state is so spread out a lot of the time they have to stay at a hotel which is easily over $1,000. Then you factor in the pads that are provided by the school, custom quality jerseys and then there’s the cost of maintaining the arena and a lot of ice time. So yeah, it’s pretty big.

1. There is a long trail that follow along the Missouri on the Bismarck side, if you go down to the river at memorial bridge by Fraine Barracks if you hike to the south (can't promise I'm not turned around with my directions but pretty sure) it will turn to a gravel nature trail after the zoo that is pretty nice.  Fort Lincoln is the nearest state park, but honestly I didn't go there much, it seemed more like public events and historical stuff.  Depending on the oil traffic one of the best places to head out to is Little Missouri State Park but it's a bit of a drive, and about 45 minutes North is Cross Ranch along the Missouri (I've never been to that one).
2. I've cross country skiing my entire life and I only remember there being a poorly groomed trail along the perimeter of the golf course.  Though I did go with a meetup so it maybe was the beginner track.  If they were to groom anywhere it would probably be close to that path that goes along the Missouri I mentioned.  It's a pretty long trail.
3. In my experience it wasn't great, but admittedly it never has been for me.  The non locals will go to Bucks and get wasted and that's probably the hookup spot, or Rockpoint in Mandan.  Online dating is very slim in North Dakota outside of Fargo (you can swipe through a town while taking a dump).  If you're religious that would be a good place as Bismarck is very religious.  The oil field rough necks never really came out to Bismarck, it was two other groups.  The skilled support staff, your medical and engineering what have you and then the others that thought it was a guaranteed job.  There were a lot of people in Bismarck that were homeless guys because they blew their bit of cash to get to the oil fields, but they aren't just taking anyone to roughneck anymore.  There's more workers and it pays well so there is some competition and I think drug use ended up exempting a lot of them (I found a bunch of syringes and old cottons swab filters by the garbage when I was moving out so someone was shooting up). Also had people squat in my laundry room and in my basement.",1579829724,ffdv68c

The dating scene is going might be rough. As a whole, people in this part of the country get married young and have kids young. In North Dakota, men marry at 27.9 years old on average, while women marry at 26 (from a [2019 study](https://www.insider.com/when-people-get-married-every-state-2019-1)).

&gt;Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?”

(Ivanka was 16 at the time)

&gt;“I don’t think Ivanka would [pose nude] inside the magazine,” he added, “She does have a very nice figure.”

&gt;If Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.”

&gt;After Trump commented, “My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka,” Stern asked, “By the way, your daughter … Can I say this? A piece of ass.” Trump didn’t hesitate to agree, simply responding, “Yeah.

&gt;She’s actually always been very voluptuous. She’s tall, she’s almost six feet tall and she’s been, she’s an amazing beauty

&gt; And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She’s 6 feet tall; she’s got the best body.”

&gt;Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen reported that when Ivanka was just 13 years old, her father asked, “Is it wrong to be more sexually attracted to your own daughter than your wife?”

(There are several more examples)

How about when he was accused of raping a 13 year old?

&gt;The first major scandal to hit the Trump campaign besides the typical “what a racist, such a sexist, yada yada yada,” came from a lawsuit stemming from the infamous sex parties held by billionaire and known pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The woman named in the suit is Katie Johnson, who says Trump took her virginity in 1994 when she was only 13 and being held by Epstein as a slave.

&gt;Johnson says in the complaint that Trump and Epstein threatened her and her family with bodily harm if she didn’t comply with all of their disgusting demands. The Trump campaign has been on this immediately, calling it absolute nonsense and not even remotely true or possible.

In 1983, Giuliani was appointed US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he spearheaded the effort to jail drug dealers, fight organized crime, break the web of corruption in government, and prosecute white-collar criminals. Few US Attorneys in history can match his record of 4,152 convictions with only 25 reversals.  [http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/rwg/html/bio.html](http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/rwg/html/bio.html)

I'm going to leave you with a couple more facts about Giuliani and then I'm done here. 

There is no point in debating with somebody who whines and cries fake news whenever they are faced with facts.

This comment comes from U/Kichigai who covered this topic months ago.

&gt;When New York City was creating it's office of emergency management the group in charge wanted to put it in the Bronx because, among other reasons, it was less likely to be a target of attacks there. Rudy overruled them and put it in the World Trade Center.
&gt;
&gt;NYC Police, Fire, and Ambulances all received new radios in 2001, however they didn't work and had to be returned prior to September. Rudy was responsible for the no-bid contract on the defective radios.
&gt;
&gt;FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers offered to run the initial response to the 9/11 attacks. Rudy said no, and invented a new NYC office to coordinate efforts through instead.
&gt;
&gt;When it was discovered that toxic waste had been spread over a larger area than initially speculated Rudy told FEMA, ACE, and OSHA to stand down and left it to individual landlords to handle the toxic clean-up.
&gt;
&gt;OSHA worked diligently to ensure Ground Zero recovery workers had face masks and respirators. Rudy actively interfered with their efforts to make sure everyone was using them.
&gt;
&gt;When during recovery Rudy prioritized the recovery of precious metals over the recovery of bodies.
&gt;
&gt;For Rudy this was all a vanity exercise. A chance to say that under his leadership NYC Stronk. He didn't want photos of people in bunny suits with federal agencies names on them, or images of face masks as if NYC had been wracked by a major disaster.
&gt;
&gt;And that's how America’s Mayor™ got more of his own citizens sick, dead, or buried in empty graves than if he had cared more about his city than his vanity.

&gt;**Edit:** Whoa, this blew up. I don't think I've ever seen a comment that has a 41:1 ratio of karma versus the post it's replying to.

Those people will happily still go to a designated caregiver and purchase their medicine with the proposed tax rate in place, benefiting our state revenue intake by a big amount. I understand that somebody growing poses risks like fires, robbery, and smell but any grower with an ounce of brains would be very adamant about the stipulations of their grow operation.

I have job jumped a little in the professional career, so not as much of a big deal, but ND has always given me job security. Hobbies, you can fish most anywhere now days, but finding places to hunt is becoming more limited. Finding ppl to golf with, be a part of a softball team, play poker with, darts in the garage with, beer darts and Cornhole/bag toss, tailgate, patio drinks, would all be a lot harder.

I have had 2 friends move to Denver and Florida to give it a try. Both knew it would happen that they would crave home, but I was surprised how quickly that happened for them (4 years and 1 year).

The older you get the harder it is to meet new people. When your in your 30s co workers are the only ppl your meeting. Many of them have there own families and hobbies. Organized sports are less and joining new organizations are limited.

Correct.

&gt; The government bailed them out so we wouldn't loose thousands of jobs. 

Incorrect.

&gt; Because of poor business practices they tanked themselves.

Me be correct, may be incorrect. Many factors contribute to why businesses fail. Unions and unnecessary regulations have tanked businesses and are factors that the business itself had no control over. You seem to be the type of person who assumes all business failures are the fault of the business but all business successes are because of outside factors the business doesn't deserve credit for.


&gt; Then to keep our economy from taking an even bigger hit they had to be bailed out. If they hadn't then unemployment would have gone up even more and caused a worse recession.

They didn't have to be bailed out. The economy is cyclical. Government intervention only prolonged the pain by not solving the original problems that led to the failure.

&gt; The government is there to protect the people, business are there to make money. These are two very different things, a government regulates the economy, businesses are players in the economy. That's how capitalism works.

You may think so. You have the right to be wrong. If you want to give more money in taxes, you're welcome to. Enough of the money I earn is wasted on things that have zero value to me.

Agreed, but lets not pretend that this is a one-sided issue, afterall we did vote Obama into a 2nd term.

Obama made a big to-do about dismantling the government surveillance on US citizens in his first campaign, then once in office he [demanded the surveillance be continued](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/08/us/politics/08obama-surveillance-history-video.html?_r=0) and condemned Snowden for whistleblowing on the extent to which the government surveillance had gotten to under Obamas watch

Then there was the unlawful war waged in Lybia in 2011 where many argue that he violated the constitution

Also, another of Obamas central themes in his 2008 campaign was ""closing the revolving door"" to political lobbyists, and what happened after he was elected? The doors were swung wide open, with upwards of 60+ lobbyists finding their way into the Obama administration during his tenure in office.

If not, I’d still contact those that would be similar to your idea and arrange to chat with their directors. In my multi-decade experience, the non-profit world is pretty friendly and folks tend to be all to happy to talk shop with someone that’s interested.

Chiropractors focus on the spine and surrounding muscle groups, whereas physical therapist training mostly covers all over the body.

Physical therapists also cost a shitton more compared with chiropractics, and take longer sessions.

So im not sure you really understand what youre talking about. A specialist is always better than a generalist, so if you have spine or neck problems, why not give Chiropractics a try? Theres really no down side.

I got run over by a truck when i was 19 and it scewed up my back terribly. 8 month of physical therapy with minimal improvement to the pain or my range of movement. 4 visits to the chiropractor and my movement was back to near normal, and the pain virtually gone.

906,906,darthmarth,"Physical therapist have 6 years of schooling, sometime more. The fact that they cover ‘all over the body’ doesn’t mean that they aren’t experts in a specific part. Studies have been done about the costs and they found that they are comparable. Maybe it’s different for your health plan. The more important factor in cost is the number of visits. Physical therapists typically treat a patient for at most three months. Chiropractors require more visits, up to a year in a lot of cases. As far as specialist be generalist: I would much rather have a generalist use scientifically based treatments vs a “specialist” who is practicing pseudoscientific woo. The fundamental chiropractic treatment is vertabral subluxation. In real medicine, the term subluxation generally describes a dislocation. Chiropractic associations define it as spinal nerve issues. It is common practice for chiropractors to C-Ray patients to identify this. That is an entirely unnecessary dose of radiation that a real doctor would never use for diagnoses soft tissue problems. The founder of chiropractics based his theories on his communications with a doctor that had been dead for 50 years. Seriously. Supposedly spinal manipulation can cure literally any disease or ailment of the human body. Some chiropractors are wholeheartedly behind this theory 100%. Fortunately a majority of them have integrated less ridiculous practices. As I said before though: Why not go to a physical therapist who has had more schooling that is 100% based on scientific fact vs someone who has not only gone to less school, but also has spent much of that schooling learning about treatments that are proven to be ineffective? There is mountains of evidence that says that there is no discernible benefit to chiropractic interventions. The one outlier being minor lower back pain. Chiropractors also tend to practice preventative care. This is simply a ridiculous money making scheme. There is significantly more evidence of harm than there is of positive benefits. Discs are sometimes herniated from spinal manipulations or already herniated discs are worsened. Lower spine manipulations can cause compressed nerves, sometimes leading to permanent bladder problems and sexual dysfunction. Last but not least neck manipulations are known to cause stroke in some cases. People have literally died from having fake, unproven treatments. You are trying to discredit my citation of anecdotal evidence, but none of the self reported “benefits” consistently happen in studies. You state that there are plenty of studies that disagree with me. Can you produce an example of one of them? I would prefer to read one that was done by a neutral source, not by quack chiropractors trying to prove that their money making scheme is legitimate. You say that I don’t know what I’m talking about, but if you do one iota of research you will find that what I am saying is accurate.",1581000990,fgpaw86

You list a bunch of stuff that ""could"" happen or ""has happened before"", and the same kind of statistics could be done with physical therapy or any form of medicine/health wellness practice. Get a large enough pool to draw your data from and you can find anything if you look hard enough.

tbh it sounds like you or someone you know is a physical therapist so you are just super biased and dont want to think about there being legitimacy in anything that competes with it.

1029,1029,Deaglesringin,"Pre-written responses are frustrating, but did you assume he hadn't already made up his mind?

Republicans were pretty transparent that they would vote to acquit, similar to how Democrats were pretty transparent they would vote to charge, before any of the witness testimony. Both sides were being transparently partisan, as they should be. It should take a lot to unseat a sitting president, otherwise it would constantly happen from the opposite side, and completely undermine the electoral system.  

The usual response to that is, ""wasn't him using his power to sway his re-election enough?"" Two things: 1. Name a president who didn't use his position to sway something in his own personal favor. 2. Is that really what happened? Because that's not what I got from the hours of testimony I watched, or the 500 times I read the transcript. Whether you disagree or not that the phone call was legitimately meant to root out possible past crimes, you can't prove it, nor can I.

Witnesses in trials are for two purposes. They are either an eye witness to an actionable crime. ""I witnessed him go into the store and shoot the lady."" ""I saw that dude put the candy in his pocket and try to leave."" The other reason is to comment, with their expertise, on a piece of physical evidence. ""I, Dr. \_\_\_\_\_\_, confirm that is his semen in the ashtray, as I am a semen doctor."" ""I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, confirm to the best of my knowledge, that is his signature, as I am a signature expert.""  The witnesses called during the Congressional hearings were all just people with opinions and a completely objective transcript.  ""I think, imagine, believe, etc."" 

The ""star witness"" of that charade stated, explicitly, that Trump never told him that U.S. Military Aid was contingent on Ukraine cooperation.  Yet, because he said that he was ""under the impression,"" it is somehow damning proof. You cannot convict with testimonial evidence alone, because it is only intended to paint a picture of the circumstances.  In order for any of that testimony to lead to even forming a charge, there would need to be documents to back it up, there are none that we are aware of. 

I don't like Trump.  I like our justice system. Innocent until proven guilty. Beyond a shadow of doubt. It's very well possible that he wanted the investigation to shine a spotlight on Biden during election season (the call was before Biden announced he was running). It's also likely that it was to find out what happened with Burisma and the defunked anti-corruption inquiry. It can't be proven either way, unless he wrote it down.  

The Democrats are acting like Bolton would be a slam dunk witness. A disgruntled, former employee who was fired is speaking out against his boss for his perceptions of how bad he was at his job, haven't seen that one before...It still would have not mattered. It is also moot, because they should have had that testimony BEFORE charging, not rush a charge through and try to back it up later.

I had a lot of break downs and honestly didn’t feel much at all. That’s when I realized that it doesn’t matter where you live, your happiness is controlled by you and only you... 


Loving or hating your surroundings is not and should not be related to how happy you are, you can change your surroundings and if you choose to put in the effort for yourself because you deserve it. I picked up and moved halfway across the country to try to escape my own mind and I ended up confronting it instead. I had a place to stay for free for a few months and got a job and my own place within 3 months. My situation was a little easier than some, BUT it is still possible.


If you are upset about living somewhere and it affects your happiness, move, absolutely. I can not tell anyone to stay where they don’t feel happy. HOWEVER I can say to do it slowly...methodically...have a game plan and execute your goals to move somewhere that you will enjoy more. Do not move as a knee jerk reaction because you’re sad and are taking your emotional turmoil out on your surroundings. 
It is not hard once you make the choice to get yourself to somewhere you enjoy. Take your time and work toward your goal of moving out if you genuinely dislike where you live....


All of that said; one must be warned, no amount of distance- no matter how far you run, nothing can separate you from your own mind and thoughts. You will be unhappy everywhere unless you address the core problem; whatever it may be.

1204,1204,Vesploogie,"I’m really curious why you’d move from a big East Coast city to little ol Stanley. It’s a fine enough town by North Dakota standards but you may as well be moving to the moon. 

Outdoor stuff is pretty much all you’ll have. You’re close to a few lakes with decent fishing and a short drive away from the big lake, so if you like fishing, boating, or hiking, Stanley is in an alright spot. 

You’d have to check local ordinances but it’s rural enough that you probably don’t have to worry about trails for ATV’s, cause you’ve got all the space you need. Just don’t ride on other people’s property without asking. 

I hope you like drinking, because the Main Street bars are it for nightlife. 

If you have the means it’s certainly worth giving it a shot. I’d recommend being comfortable with occupying yourself on your own time for most of your life to be happy in a place like Stanley. There’s always community things going on in the nicer months but winters get oppressive for those who aren’t used to them. 

Be friendly, be open, be involved, because you’ll attract a little attention considering where you’re coming from. People are friendly but set in their ways.",1582049741,fi139jv

Where on the east coast are you from? If you're moving from Florida you won't mind how *flat* ND is. I moved there from Arizona and the lack of decent topography almost killed me. You don't *hike* in North Dakota, you just go for pleasant walks. If you're a vehicular enthusiast, it's a wasteland of a state. All the roads are straight, flat, and boring. 

That said, Fargo was the tiniest city I had lived in at the time and I loved and still miss it. Stanley looks way too small for me, but the people across the state were super nice and I enjoyed my interactions there a lot more than I do here in southern Maryland.

For indoors or when it’s cold outside, we visit the maysa arena to ice skate or watch hockey games, at home, we play cards or any other games that we have around the house or watch a movie on the couch.

The western part of the state has some really nice areas but you would have to get off the interstate to actually see them.

There are also a few spots that look straight out of MN in the northern part of the state around the Belcourt to Bottineau area.

North Dakota is the worst place I have ever lived so far and I thank God every single day that I no longer live there. The only things I miss about that place are the people I met through work and town, Ebeneezer's or ""Ebs"" and the state fair. I was stationed out there in Minot. 

I am a black guy, so what someone else said about not being white is true. The weather is terrible and there isn't much to do. I really miss my friends I made there, both in the air force and civilians. That's it. I don't miss the place at all. I got laid a lot and I drank A LOT. That was to try to fill the empty void from living there. *spoiler alert* it didn't. 

Fargo is the only place as a whole that is somewhat redeemable to me. If the preface for anything is ""is what you make of it"" or ""you have to find your fun"" you know you're in for a bad time. No one ever says that about fun places where people actually want to be. I also lived there during the oil boom and everything was ridiculously overpriced. 

I haven't lived there in almost 4 years and I say good riddance. I never wanted to go there in the first place. Once I got there I hated it and couldn't wait to leave. When I got a chance to leave, I was excited. Now that I no longer reside there, I never want to go back. I don't miss it as a whole.

One guy was driving to his land and told me the local game warden lives down the road and target practice isn’t allowed on PLOTS but hunting is.  When I told him it was a .177 and I was just sighting it in he told me just to be aware of it and that probably wouldn’t be a big deal.

The same goes for ATV, just know where you’re allowed to ride.  Like CRP and PLOTS are probably off limits.  If you’re on a public minimum maintenance road be mindful of how wet it is, if you wanna piss a landowner off quick leave some ruts in a wet road.",1582059438,fi1kd7s

1235,1235,Rusharound19,"Born and raised in Bismarck, here. I moved to the west coast for a few years but had to come back to get out of an abusive relationship. I'm *literally* counting the days until I move away from ND again, and, this time, I'm moving permanently.

The oilfield money is not going to be as good as you think it will be, because the cost of living here in ND is outrageous. Plus the cost of relocating here and leaving again...

I hope you are both white, because NDans are abhorrently racist, especially against Indigenous Americans. My home county, Burleigh County, where the state capital, Bismarck, is located, is currently up in arms because the city commission approved to relocate 25 refugees to our county in 2020. Many of us are trying to get the name of a local park, Custer Park, changed, because George Armstrong Custer was an awful person who came here in an attempt to extinguish the Indigenous populations. People in Bismarck who I once respected are acting worse than those in the South who are fighting the removal of confederate statues. It is disgusting, and, as a white woman who is about to become engaged to a black man, I have legitimate fears for his safety here.

Summers here are the best. We have LONG days, with the sun coming up by 6 am and not setting until nearly 11 pm. The temps are wonderful, with hot, dry weather (temps often reach the 100s throughout the second half of July/first half of August), and incredible thunderstorms that are fascinating to watch as they build up in the sky during a hot afternoon. These storms do, however, often lead to tornadoes and extremely damaging hail. 

I've been exploring and photographing abandoned towns/farms/etc throughout the state for about 13 years now, and I LOVE the peacefulness of getting out to the middle of nowhere and being truly alone. However, if the locals know that you're from somewhere else, they will not treat you well, and if you have an out-of-state license plate, expect to be stalked by the local sheriffs.

One of our local Bismarck artists does wet plate photography, and he simply *proposed* that we put up a downtown mural of his picture of Greta Thunberg at Standing Rock. His other downtown mural (completely unrelated) has since been vandalized, and his name has been dragged through the mud by the locals.

Also, it is too cold to go outside for 6-8 months of the year. And when I say ""too cold to go outside,"" I mean that the air/wind chill temps will literally cause severe frostbite on any exposed skin within minutes. That is getting better, though, due to climate change (though the locals here don't believe climate change exists, and they will have a problem with you if you do).

1257,1257,SicEeyore,"First off, any place you move has its own kinda feel. Stanley is very good for families, work, and high paying jobs. It’s not so good (along with the rest of the country) with the schools. They’re usually over packed with teachers who don’t have enough help. But that doesn’t mean your kids will have a bad education. As for the outdoors, there’s a lake strait south of there about 45 minutes that’s one of the largest man made reservoirs in the nation with some of the best walleye numbers in the nation. With Northern Pile reaching up to 20 pounds, and a healthy smallmouth bass population that’s very fun to catch. 
If your looking for easy trails you’ll be sure to find some that follow the lake at what’s named Lewis and Clark State Park. I believe that’s about 60-90 minutes away from Stanley. If you farther south and west you’ll find our national parks, Theadore Rosevelt National Park. Having two separate locations and both having trails ranging from a few hours to ones that are for more experienced hikers. Speaking from experience, the north unit is absolutely amazing. The trails are as beautiful as any other and fraught with wildlife. The parks are mostly known for their wild Bison that are very abundant and visible. But watch out, there’s also rattlesnakes and the Bison are territorial.
As for bears, Grizzlies were native to North Dakota but that has long not been the case. We have no native bear populations. Moose are becoming a regular sight around our parts on the western half of the state. Massive and beautiful, they demand your respect and if toyed with they can and will attack. You’ll probably see bald eagles, a rare golden eagle, a ton of deer, the only part of the state that has rattlers is in the SW region. 

People from our state are usually very nice and quick to help, but like any other place there’s gonna be some assholes. Don’t let these people talking shit ruin it for you. It can get pretty cooped up in the winter at times. Books are nice for that, or Netflix. The internet speeds are probably a bit slower than your used to.

It's an orientation session that helps new folks like you adjust to the new environment you will have pleasure of experiencing! Now don't let the name fool you, we don't do any of that strange BBQ like they do in those muggy humid places down south I've read about.  This BBQ will be hamburger, usually from a cull cow that broke her leg at the local dairy barn, and then we boil it in watered down ketchup before slapping it all on a bun.  It is most often paired with Old Dutch potato chips.

When you meet your first bonafide local, you are in for such a treat!  But there are some tips you should follow, for your safety as well as those of the local.  Do try to avoid direct eye contact, it is seen as threatening.  Speak in a slow, calm manner but with enough volume to overcome the years of hearing loss that locals have suffered from firearm usage, and running heavy equipment on the farm. And I can't stress this enough, NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS!!  It will trigger their fight or flight instincts.

North Dakota is a prime state for new energy development, whatever it may be, but the future economic opportunities are being wasted because of people afraid of “liberal propaganda” and a teenager. 

Not to mention the longer it takes to move away from oil and gas, the more sudden the shift will have to be once this era of regression is over. There will be a point when there’s no choice but to abandon things quickly, and the longer we wait now the worse the effects will be.

I don't know about that specific Courthouse, but I presume based off of other courthouse's in the state that that building also the office of the recorder, auditor, Treasurer, Clerk of Court, ect, all of which are offices that he's allowed to be in.

The way I see it, at its heart this is an issue of negative vs positiveliberty, ie, whether you as citizens have only the rights that are granted to you by the government, or, inversely you have all those rights except for those that are excluded from you by the government. Of course that is a gross oversimplification, and I hope you can forgive the blunt blade, but I think it's a functional definition in this contacts. Our model or government is largely based off of the concept of positive freedom. Thus, regardless of whether or not most people would wander around the building, that is his prerogative and choice of expenditure of time; he has a right to walk around and be in there in whatever capacity he likes as long as it's not violent or destructive. Its not how I would chose to spend my time but that doesnt have any bearing on his right to be there. If the standard is that he can be there so long as he can satisfactorily quash what suspicions without iterable basis, then we're transitioning in my mind to a negative freedom schema : you can be here as long as we  believe your reasons are satisfactory.

He was fishing.

They did violate his rights.  He had the right to sit in a public courtroom and watch a case. The problem you don't understand his, the police need the whole story, or at least proof/facts to throw him out for causing a problem. There are NO facts to support any problem or any crime. NONE.

No, the burden of proof is not on me or the guy in the video. The video was filmed int he USA so the police have the burden of proof to prove he committed a crime, and later would need to prove it in court if they brought charges. Again, USA, not Yemen!!!

1370,1370,Vesploogie,"This is the mindset I’m talking about. You’re choosing to ignore the big picture for reasons that are relatively minor in the long run. If you would’ve read my comment you’d see that I’m not saying to drop oil immediately; that is not the point of any of it. Of course there’s no solar powered anything around the corner, and it’s because of people’s refusal to think of any future without fossil fuels. Again, investment needs to start shifting away from fossil fuels to newer technology. Do you really think farmers would *not* benefit from not having to spend money of fueling their machinery? Not to mention the incoming loss of farmable land in the future because of the effects of oil and gas. 

You’re also completely ignoring the big economic picture as well. How stable is oil? How sustainable is it? The state has already projected oil growth to stop for good within the next few years, it’ll just stay at a plateau. Remember the times outside of the brief oil booms where things weren’t quite as nice? And how many of those jobs were filled by North Dakotans? How many were filled by out of staters? How much of that development that grew alongside the boom is beneficial to our state right now, those shitty homes and man camps built by corrupt contractors, those empty hotels, those miles of unmaintained roads dug up all over the west? Oil is not sustainable. Of all states, North Dakota should know that best. 

What about all of the businesses that suffered once the boom ended? Do you know how bad it hit the housing industry? The restaurant industry? The retail industry? Oil sure is great for our basic economy. 

I used to live in Medora, I’ve seen the oil rigs pop up and the landscape be eroded away over the years. I’ve seen the spills, the rollovers, the drunken drifters. Anyone with eyes or a brain can see that it is a destructive industry, that can’t be argued against. 

Again... if you read my comment, you’d see I’m not calling for anything but the development of technology to move away from fossil fuels. North Dakota has the ability to lead the nation in new energy development, and at what downside? 

If you think that the continued destruction of the state through chosen reliance on unsustainable energy is the path forward, then you’re part of the problem. Regardless of what reasons you want to drum up to keep defending it, the reality is is that there’s a whole world of new cleaner technology that our state can be the forefront of developing.

1373,1373,Vesploogie,"The environmental impact of oil drilling has been well studied, it doesn’t take much more than a quick google search to see some of what has been studied. 

[From 2012](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/north-dakotas-oil-environmental-damage-economic-prosperity/)

“Companies produce millions of gallons of salty, chemical-infused wastewater, known as brine, as part of drilling and fracking each well. Drillers are supposed to inject this material thousands of feet underground into disposal wells, but some of it isn't making it that far.

According to data obtained by ProPublica, oil companies in North Dakota reported more than 1,000 accidental releases of oil, drilling wastewater or other fluids in 2011, about as many as in the previous two years combined. Many more illicit releases went unreported, state regulators acknowledge, when companies dumped truckloads of toxic fluid along the road or drained waste pits illegally.

State officials say most of the releases are small. But in several cases, spills turned out to be far larger than initially thought, totaling millions of gallons. Releases of brine, which is often laced with carcinogenic chemicals and heavy metals, have wiped out aquatic life in streams and wetlands and sterilized farmland. The effects on land can last for years, or even decades.

Compounding such problems, state regulators have often been unable or unwilling to compel energy companies to clean up their mess, our reporting showed.

Under North Dakota regulations, the agencies that oversee drilling and water safety can sanction companies that dump or spill waste, but they seldom do: They have issued fewer than 50 disciplinary actions for all types of drilling violations, including spills, over the past three years.”

[2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132645/)

“In North Dakota alone, well operators have reported nearly 4,000 spills to the state since 2007.”

“About 1–2% of fracking fluid is a proprietary chemical mixture that performs a number of important functions in the fracking process, from increasing the viscosity of the fluid to keeping the mixture free of bacteria that could foul well passages. 9 , 10 These chemicals include known or suspected endocrine disruptors, carcinogens, and other toxicants. 11 The chemical mixture varies from well to well, and wastewater from a single well typically contains only a small fraction of the more than 1,000 known fracking chemicals.”

“Drilling-related wastewater spills and leaks have been shown to increase concentrations of methane and other markers of fracking-related contamination in local water supplies, as well as metals in drinking water, and salinity, radionuclides, and total dissolved solids downstream of discharges.”

[2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311843.2018.1443666)

“Research shows a link between oil and gas development and the decline of grasslands species in North America (see, for example, Bernath-Plaisted &amp; Koper, 2016; Hill &amp; Olson, 2013; Nasen et al., 2011; Northrup &amp; Wittemeyer 2012). Nasen et al. (2011) conducted a cumulative impact assessment of oil and gas development in the mixed grasslands of southwestern Saskatchewan, and found significant long-term, and spatially long-range, impacts. Notably, there were changes in soil structure around well sites, which can have ripple effects across the ecosystem. Unfortunately, no similar research has been conducted in the Bakken region.”

Direct and Circumstantial Evidence 2013
A fact can be proved by either direct evidence or circumstantial evidence, or by both.
If an eyewitness testifies about what the witness saw, that is an example of direct evidence.
If the ground is bare when you go to sleep but is covered with a blanket of snow when you awake, this is circumstantial evidence that it snowed while you were asleep.
The law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence. You should give all evidence the weight and value you believe it is entitled to receive. A conviction may be justified on circumstantial evidence alone if the circumstantial evidence has such probative force as to enable you to find the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

That being said, if there is irrefutable concrete evidence, that always supplants inference or clusions absent showing that the concrete fact is unreliable. Thus, your call for concrete fact is entirely appropriate and should not be rallied against.",1582570446,finuizb

4. Sorry I'm getting a 404 error. If it's from the USDA or the forest service I'm writing it off as for years we've tried to get them to enforce their laws pertaining to the national grasslands (such as stay on trails, no dumping) and they refuse to even meet with us and proceed to tell us that we(farmers, ranchers, hunters) are the ones dumping and the solution to that is to remove all livestock and not allow hunting. Which has almost nothing to do with the current issues.

The first and third links are not abandonment that's illegal dumping and not doing reclamation work. I don't know on the second one as it won't let me read it until I subscribe to them

Even ignoring that it would be more than reasonable to expand the event recording window to 1 or even several minutes, storage solutions are apparently very reasonably priced. 

To quote from a 2018 report on body cam costs and benefits by the Police Executive Research Forum:

“Costs of storing video files: The maximum annual storage cost reported by a responding agency was $4 million. Again, the median cost was much lower, totaling $1,000 per agency, reflecting that most police agencies are quite small. These figures demonstrate considerable variability in costs, with the largest sized agencies serving as outliers in the data. Large agencies had maximum and median costs far higher than small agencies.

  Respondents said that their officers spent an average of 25.5 minutes each day reviewing and tagging video footage produced by body cameras. They also responded that they received an average of about 9.1 Freedom of Information requests for camera footage per month. Each of these requests was estimated to take an average of 9.8 hours of staff time to respond to, though the median value was 1 hour.”


I would imagine dash cam video takes up a similar amount of space to body cam video, so I don’t see how it would be even remotely unaffordable to store ALL recordings of police activity.

They probably just don’t want evidence of all the traffic laws they routinely brake documented.",1582601712,fipaf16

Williston has an estimated population of 27,000 people in 2018 and given that it's at the heart of the oil boom out there, it's possible that given that the population as doubled in size since 2010 Census was conducted that there are going to be growing pains where this type of activity wasn't that common to now it's more common (although I could probably something better to do than watch court cases all day).

“ Gov. Doug Burgum expressed optimism for the funding mechanism of ""Operation Prairie Dog,"" which relies on oil prices and production. ”

I said it elsewhere but relying for funds on a boom bust style industry is not smart long term. The state already knows this and has already experienced this. It’s good that that much money is going towards infrastructure, the state badly needs it, but I’d like to see a breakdown of where it’s going. The vast majority of North Dakota’s infrastructure is privately and locally owned, very little is under direct control of the state. And the infrastructure areas in most critical need, being the states dams and bridges, are not mentioned here as being recipients of any money. While a few hundred million will be very helpful to bring up ailing road conditions, especially out west where roads have been destroyed by oil traffic (gee isn’t that funny?) much more is needed for the very long term, and we already know that oil production isn’t growing for the long term. The Prairie Dog Bill is good for right now, but it is not a long term solution. We need a more sustainable and growable infrastructure source for the future.

1507,1507,lovensic,"That is quite a change. Like a couple of others, I’d say to check out Fargo. That is my hometown and it is a lovely combination of what cities and small towns have to offer. There’s many options for things to do but it’s not overwhelming. The food scene is pretty great and lots of activities (more have popped up recently). I think it’s a pretty safe place, of course use normal caution. Lots of people are pretty nice. ND is overwhelmingly conservative, people here love church, beer, and guns. Fargo has a more moderate approach because it’s a bit more diverse as cities tend to be. Driving is just fine, it is pretty easygoing. It’s damn cold here, I know Chicago isn’t too further down but this place is seriously freezing out. 

I’ll be blunt, for most places in North Dakota you’re gonna have a tough time coming up with stuff to do. People here usually take up their time by drinking and working. I know others also love some outdoor activities here but I can’t speak much for that. If you want somewhere with a more homey feel that isn’t completely lacking of options, Fargo is your best bet.

The commute to Fargo is not as bad as people say, I can go a few times a week and the drive does not bother me, though maybe not the best option if you are trying to save on gas. Valley is beautiful in the summer and there is a scenic byway that extends about 20 miles north and south of town- a must drive come summer. If you need groceries, leavers is fine enough for most things, but overpriced. Again, if you don’t mind the drive I’d either go to Fargo or Jamestown for groceries.

Life without parole is much more straightforward and ends the uncertainty much more cleanly.

But there's a big part of me that's kind of old testament about this. The crime was committed, we have ample, essentially bulletproof evidence, and the act was unquestionably, irrefutably heinous. Drop the gavel, open the courtyard door, take him out and shoot him.

In cases like this the ""death penalty is an ineffective deterrent"" argument doesn't even enter into it. This particular person, in this particular case, deserves death (whatever the individual case may be). Deterring others isn't the point of the sentence.

Where to draw those lines is why I wind up falling back on the abolition side, because finding the place to draw that line without ultimately being unjust to people is tremendously hard.

The damage done is widespread and will be largely irreversible for the sites left unreclaimed and full of waste by now defunct businesses, and it’s a shame because it’s the last remaining natural grassland left. Over 90% of the Midwest’s natural state has been turned to farmland and the other 10% is being steadily chipped away by the oil companies, and you’re sadly correct that all that development benefits no one who lives here. Sure we get a big chunk of our tax money from it, but if you take a look at the areas where it goes like our states infrastructure, it’s not even enough to see a net positive. More roads and bridges are destroyed by heavy oil traffic than get repaired, and that doesn’t even consider the lack of a long term plan to figure how to get more revenue now that the boom is over for good.

I'm kind of surprised it's dipped this low this quickly.

1908,1908,god_dammit_dax,"Well, off the top of my head:

1) While I wasn't in favor of that war, it's easy from our perspective in 2020 to condemn that vote. I'm gonna assume, like most of Reddit, you're fairly young, so I'll make sure to reiterate: The vast, VAST majority of the country was in favor of that war, including most of Biden's constituents. Like ridiculously so, *especially* in red states like ND. Biden and other moderate Dems would've been keelhauled for a vote against it, and the Republicans were more than ready to jump in with attack ads about ""Votes against America"" for it. It didn't become a quagmire overnight either, and it retained its relative popularity well through the next few election cycles. 

Lots of our fellow Americans believed what the administration was saying. They were wrong. They couldn't conceive that an American President could just make up a threat to us. They were wrong. It does happen sometimes. 

2) Sanders doesn't have a prayer of winning Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Florida. He's categorically unpopular with white rural voters, and that's not gonna change. Biden doesn't have that issue.

3) What you call Fiscally Sensible social programs the Republicans are gonna call Socialism and Communism. And while that's nonsense, it'll be supported by old Sanders statements (and video!) praising the USSR, Venezuela, Cuba, etc. The attack ads write themselves, and they'll WORK. Biden's social plans aren't as far reaching ($15 minimum wage, universal health coverage, a public buy-in to Medicare, premiums capped as a percentage of income) but they're a LOT more likely to become law in the next four years.

4) The plans Sanders does have he doesn't have a hope of getting through Congress, even with House and Senate Democratic majorities, which he's unlikely to get. Sanders voters have long had problems with downticket races, and that doesn't seem likely to improve. Biden's plans, as stated earlier, have a much likelier chance to pass, and as a longstanding member of the party, he's well versed in pushing downticket races as well. He's been here before, and he knows how to do coalition building. Sanders doesn't.

5) The Sanders general election strategy hinges upon youth voter turnout. If you've had any experience at all in politics, you know that's a losing strategy 99 times out of a hundred. It bit him last week, and it'll bite him again in the General. Biden's strategy revolves around turnout *as a whole* which he managed to do on Super Tuesday, and it seems likely he can do it again.

Look, you like Sanders and you like what he says. While I don't care much for Sanders personally, I have very few disagreements with his platform, and those are mainly based around his Economic Protectionism and Immigration stances, both of which are right in Donald Trump's neighborhood. I'd absolutely cast a ballot for him in the General if I had to, but I don't think he's the right guy to win a national election, and I find a lot of his rhetoric tired. Biden, on the other hand, is a known quantity, and his platform's acceptable to me. What's more, I think he can win. Simple as that.",1583597138,fjshoqg

What? Lower oil prices will make prices lower around the economy , food prices, gas prices, travel prices, even things like manufacturing and delivery prices. This lowers inflation , when inflation is lower there is no need to raise rates. With these low oil prices it will push oil bonds into junk status (most are already) but unless you are an oil company that doesn't affect you much.

Also the 7% crash today isn't because of oil, these two things are somewhat UN-related oil is crashing because Saudi Arabia said they were going to flood the market with oil, in turn Russia called their bluff and said so will we.They both think they can weather low oil prices better than the other, or possibly they are working together to try to put a halt on shale producers.

However that is not why the market crashed , it crashed because of  COVID-19 virus scares , tourism is taking a huge hit, countries are pushing themselves into a recession trying to quarantine and contain this.

For example tourism is huge in Italy and it probably is the largest sector , they just shut down all museums ,  many historical sites , even in restaurants and cafes they are trying to require all people site over a meter apart. This 100% is going to push them into a recession, people are afriad the same thing is happening here

People are very definitely going to die and it is just a matter of how many. National numbers are starting to come into focus and it isn't looking awesome.

And are you going to try to tell me that isnt the very thing that happened during Trumps impeachment proceedings? 

And lets talk about the impeachment. Pelosi was so concerned with the proceedings being given a fair consideration after the impeachment was given, yet during the trial she refused the precedent set in former impeachment proceedings such as Nixon and Clinton - both of which has the ability to subpoena their own witnesses and cross examine, which was denied to the Trump administration.

Then theres the fact that Pelosi herself voted for impeachment before even one shred of evidence had been presented at trial (talk about ""due process"" and ""fair proceedings"")

2682,2682,cheddarben,"I think the apparent suppression of numbers and lack of transparency in testing will prove to be a huge problem for this state. 

Cass had almost no cases while 300 tests were sent off to CA without public discussion (until later) and the rest of the state was getting positives. Why did Cass have so few cases early on compared to the rest of the state? Was it because they weren't testing and the testing they did do were being sent off to CA? 270 still haven't been returned and there was 1 in the other 30? This is outside all of the people that weren't getting tests. 

So, meemaw was silver sneakering at West Acres because she thought Cass basically had no cases, but the reality is that testing here might have been a debacle and reporting was low because testing was worse compared to the rest of the counties. So, everybody was running out to get TP when maybe they should have been ordering it. 

I went for a drive early last week. Downtown was legit slow, but I saw a few places that were bumping with activity.

Also, we see ND stats and we see MN stats, but I am not seeing anybody owning the entirety of the FM area or GF/EGF areas. Cass has 6, Clay has 4... and there is the 1 out of the returned 30 that I am not sure is being reported anywhere, but is likely cass? 11 cases right now.

Now? We are likely one of the states that Donald Trump is referring to as having no or very little spread. Yet... 10 of our 52 cases are hospitalized, which is WAY above the average. Is it because our population is old? Maybe. Or is it because people aren't getting tested until hospitalized. Are people being tested now or are tests being diverted to places with apparently more spread? How many aren't currently listed as positive because the test didn't come back from CA, but are presumed positive?

It bothers me that people aren't asking tough questions at these news conferences and they don't answer questions that get mailed to them.",1585243927,flkmyxr

This is looking significantly less deadlier than was initially anticipated according to the Royal Institute.

The feds cant lock everything down, that is up to the states, and probably too late already

Even in locked down states people are still going out in droves. I was just in Chicago and some places are still busy, they had to ban people from parks, I saw a while soccer game going on.

My understanding is that the death rate is actually much lower, most cases aren’t tested and it’s going unnoticed because symptoms are trivial. South Korea had a rate of 1%.

Our death rate is lower which is interesting, we have better hospitals but a much unhealthier population. Don’t know what to make of it.",1585326109,flnuhev

2821,2821,cheddarben,"The Case Mortality Rate is probably partially low in the US because 45% of all cases have been logged in the past three days. There is going to be some delay in outcomes. This is the same reason that the recovery rates are also pretty small. 

On the 24th, the WHO data (so actually the 23rd as they are a day behind) had the US as having a Case mortality of 1.1%. It has been creeping up and right now is at 1.8%. EU as a whole is currently at 5.8% and Italy is at 10.5%. Globally, it is at about 4.6%. But the rate is one part of the story. People becoming dead is where the story really happens and we are on the wrong side of the curve that will come. How that plays out has yet to be determined, but our path... at least partially... is already set.

People who are looking at this and guessing it is going to be *only* as deadly as the flu are looking through some pretty rosy glasses. Hopefully, it comes in far less deadly... but this is going to take a toll.

A particularly bad flu season in recent years have an estimated 61,000 deaths (they have a pretty high margin of error) in the US. With coronavirus, we have been averaging a daily increase in deaths of approximately 30%. 

Hopefully, this goes down sooner rather than later... but we are likely going to be over 1000/day in just 3 days. I think that is inevitable. If the same rate continues, we will be up to 20,000 deaths/day in 14. Although my optimistic side says this rate will level off a bit at 5k deaths/day for a period of time. This will likely be right around the time frame when it is predicted that New York will be at its peak.

They better hurry up with those ventilators and PPE, yo. 

NY is likely the first place that is going to peak and hopefully, all the steps our nation has taken will dampen the rest of the states. 

Fortunately, it looks like our national rate of infection looks like it is slightly dropping, as our last several data points have been 16% (yesterday), 17%, 19%, 7%, 18%, 19%, 25%... so maybe.  I think we still, as a nation, have a big backlog of tests... so we might see a bunch more positives that get funneled into the stats. And we can push numbers around all day long, but it gets harder to fudge on the dead people.

I hope I am wrong. I hope the experts are wrong. Stay home. Buckle in.",1585452196,flsvyeg

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the United States, a similar pandemic appears to be following in its shadows. This pandemic is one of peddled conspiracy theories, unproven products and an ever surging litany of dangerous disinformation infecting homes the world over.  


On Tuesday March 17, North Dakota's District 36 Rep. Luke Simons posted a product on his social media account that he suggested treats COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.  


The Facebook post from Simons, a Republican who ranches near Dickinson, read, ""All joking aside, this virus that is going around is very treatable. This book was written I believe 20 years ago and address the coronavirus specifically. Please share so this gets to the right people my doctor shared this with me.""  


Included in the post was an image about a product called VIRA-Pel made by Weed Botanicals Inc., which claims the product is effective against respiratory viruses including coronaviruses.  


Weed Botanical Co. is a family-owned and operated wholesale medicinal herb company. A disclaimer on the company's website states that ""It is not intended to replace qualified medical care. Consult your doctor if you are considering supplementing with our herbal extracts. Please note that the information provided here has not been evaluated by the FDA. Herbs and plant nutrients are classified as dietary supplements and are not approved as medicine.""  


Rob Keller, public information officer for the Joint Information Center, cautioned against products that have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  


""We're starting to see things come up trying to get you to buy into it because it's a proven cure for coronavirus or COVID-19. We just caution people, buyers beware ... At this time, people are concerned about the future and sometimes there are those people out there that will prey on that just like they prey on the elderly because they have an emotional connection to it ... Don't let emotions drive the decision to purchase something.""  


Multiple attempts were made to reach Simons for comment, but were unsuccessful by the time of this article's publication.  


Rep. Luke Simons, R-Dickinson  
Simons is not the first person to share treatments for the coronavirus that have not been approved by the FDA.  


The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission have been sending warning letters to companies that have made unapproved claims about the coronavirus and their products' ability to treat it.  


New York's attorney general, Letitia James, sent a cease-and-desist letter to radio show host Alex Jones for marketing and selling products as a treatment or cure for the coronavirus. Televangelist Jim Bakker was sued by the state of Missouri for selling Silver Solution as a treatment for COVID-19.  


There are currently no approved treatments for the coronavirus, although the FDA is exploring possible treatment options.

Who determines them?  Not Congress.  Not the Courts.  The Attorney General.  


What are the limits on these best practices they can require?  None.  


Add an Attorney General who already is publicly on record as believing encryption should provide back doors to government with a legal mechanism by which he can require compliance with arbitrarily determined standards, and what do you get?

3076,3076,DiamondIceNS,"If you've never bought snow tires for your vehicle before, invest in some. You won't need them until December or so, but you'll be a sliding sled without them when the deep freeze returns. Rotate them twice a year with your summers and keep the off tires in a shed or garage if you got one. Or just get all-season tires -- those will also work fine. Just make sure you don't have tires rated for summer weather on your car by snow season.

If you don't have a winter survival kit in your trunk, make one. No joke. Jumper cables, tow cable, shovel, flashlight, thick blanket, extra boots+gloves+hats, candles, hand warmers. If you biff it on a lonely highway in the middle of a blizzard, you are *fucked* for at least 24 hours. It probably won't ever happen to you, but never risk it. It would be an awful way to go.

If you don't know how to jump a car, learn. It's actually really easy, just a little intimidating at first. Batteries freeze here all the time in the thick of winter. If it doesn't happen to you, it could happen to someone you meet and you can give them a hand. Jumping a fozen battery is something of a rite of passage here.

I don't mean to fearmonger the winter weather to scare you. It *really* isn't that bad, if you adequately prepare yourself and don't do stupid shit. But it has potential to be extremely dangerous if you don't use caution.

So called ""big government"" people don't go around with signs saying ""Bigger Government!!!"".  They don't argue against programs just because they don't need them.  They argue about things like EARN IT because it's a violation of our constitutional rights in addition to just being wrong.

There used to be a week where benefits did not accrue, but with the new legislature, benefits will now accrue immediately (not entirely certain if this is both state and federal, or just federal). However, it takes 4 weeks for your first direct deposit or prepaid card to be funded. At that point, you’ll get a hefty check for the 4 weeks you’ve accrued. This check is bolstered by the new legislature that adds in $600 of federal unemployment to your state unemployment. This should be a minimum of $2,400 ($600 federal per week) plus your variable state unemployment amount for your first distribution. If available, use a credit card to hold yourself over until receiving the funds.

This is all taxable income to you, the state can withhold 10% of federal taxes if you choose to do so. Unclear on if they will do the same with the federal unemployment because your state should distribute that as well. This may create heartache at tax time for 2020, so please set 15% aside for taxes on everything you get. Some people will end up owing 2-5k next spring if they are unemployed for an extended period of time and not withholding properly.

Not mention the avenue vs. street thing. I'm used east-west numbered streets, and north-south named streets. I thought I was having a stroke when Google told me to go right/west on a road and then take a left/south onto that same road a few miles down. It took me a little bit to realize the Ave and St make a difference here. That's going to take some getting used to. If you can explain that I would greatly appreciate it.

I digress. Everyone here has been very kind, but I've seen about 4 beggars in less that 48 hours and three trips outside. I went to a grocery store and it looked like an AA meeting; everyone looked like they they had been smoking and drinking for years. I even had a personal encounter with a younger more healthy looking dude that was apparently homeless and then had his car repoed. And that was at 4 a.m. when I ran out to my car to get something. No one has made me feel unsafe or anything, and I'm not judging them for anything.  But I feel like this particular corner might be, uh, down on it's luck.

545,545,kokes88,I said you were trying to discredit him. You still need to go to med school to be a plastic surgeon. No it's not exactly the field he works in but his opinion holds more weight to it than mine. But for the curve he is referring to staying under the hospitals capacity which is currently under 1% so it's practically flat. And I guess we will see if what he says is disastrous by looking at Sweden. I don't think we should do what they are doing but taking precautions by wearing masks etc and start getting people back to work would be a good thing. We don't have a large population in North Dakota so I think it would be possible.

While bored on lockdown, I've been looking on Reddit for wild west pictures. I found an interesting one and shared it with the Idaho sub because it was an Idaho picture. While browsing their sub for the first time in my life, I seen this cowboy with a banana covering face meta meme for the pandemic.

Now, I am a cowboy's daughter in New Mexico. I've been telling my cowboy father that he should be wearing his wild rag for awhile now.

I'm not an artist, or a meme maker, or much of a photographer. But Reddit encourages cross posts. I thought this was an apt meme for the pandemic in western states where there are lots of cowboys still making a living, and most probably have bandanas.

I only shared this post in cowboyish state subs. 

And I'm not a karma farmer. Please look at my profile. I've had this account for 3 years. 2 weeks ago, I only had about a 100 link karma because I rarely if ever posted, and when I did, it was usually r/neopets

With the lockdown, I was just being friendly and visiting other state subs to say hello, found a cool meme that had been posted a week ago, and not since.

2. Mass testing must be taking place. Someone presents at the hospital.. symptoms or not.. test them. Make sure critical staff (docs, nurses, and the like) are being tested on the regular. 

3. Ensure stringent contact tracing process is in place. 

4. Formulate a rolling, but defined, personal and regional plan to turn on and off isolation.

5. We need to be working with surrounding states.

You know what is going to stop the economy from moving? People dying. Having a plan to ensure that this thing is closely monitored and we can react efficiently is critical to making this happen.

Turning the economy on and off like it is a lightswitch is nonsense. Unless we want a parabalic spike, there needs to be some thought and strategy behind this. That isn't going to be how it works, even if that is the dream. As South Dakota shows, it doesn't take much for somethign to spread.

In 2009, the worst month of the recession for job loss was February, and 851,000 people lost their jobs. In the last month, the number has been 22,000,000. That's 22-million.

For the record, my wife was furloughed, qualified for unemployment, qualified for the ""Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation"" payments, and if she gets it all, she's still making less than she made when she was working.

Oh, and also, she's owed two or three 600 dollar payments, none of which she has received yet. But carry on with your envy arguments.",1587147122,fnpkk0t

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration Partnership allows NRCS and FS to ***collaborate with agricultural producers and forest landowners to invest in conservation and restoration at a big enough scale to make a difference***.  Working in partnership, and at this scale, **helps reduce wildfire threats**, **protect water quality and supply**, and **improve wildlife habitat for at-risk species**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The objectives are: to **reduce fuels and the threat of wildfire to communities**, **private property and oil and gas facilities**; manage encroachment of juniper into adjacent woody draws and upland mixed grass prairie; and reduce the density of juniper within remaining juniper areas with the overall goal to ***increase the pace and scale of landscape restoration in the badlands of North Dakota***. 

&amp;#x200B;

It will require the right soil and restoration techniques and technology, probably nitrogen and carbon soil boosting and restorations. Possibly manage Bison and grazing too.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Partners include the North Dakota Forest Service, North Dakota Natural Resource Trust, McKenzie County Grazing Association, Medora Grazing Association, Little Missouri Grazing Association, North Dakota Game &amp; Fish, McKenzie County Grazing Association, Medora Grazing Association, Little Missouri Grazing Association, Horse Creek Grazing Association, North Dakota School Trust Lands, National Park Service, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, National Wild Turkey Federation, Mule Deer Foundation, and the Holmes Family Trust.  
&gt;  
&gt;Through the new three-year projects, l**andowners will work with local USDA experts and partners to apply targeted forestry management practices on their land**, such as thinning, hazardous fuel treatments, fire breaks and other systems to meet unique forestry challenges in their area. 

&amp;#x200B;

You would need the forest health and species, ecology diversification plan. Measurement tools for Air and soil, and all analysis. Animal and wildlife, river and water analysis and a way to boost the health. And then mitigation of anything that creates harm or pollutes, decreases health of the landscape and wildlife.

Also, endangerment and hunting rules will have to be managed well for the best optimization, and also Water quality will be managed and if needed, they will need the best technology to improve or optimize it to its best. Some aspect of nature can restore itself over time if you give it the room to breathe and to do it.",1587153597,fnpx4s4
