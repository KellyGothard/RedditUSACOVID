136,Darth_Stig,1578065571,ejgxuo,Nan,"I've got a project car at my old house I've sunk $20k or so into already and I need it towed (preferably on a flatbed) to my new house in Roswell. Here's the problem: the car doesn't move under it's own power and my old house's driveway is so steep that rock climbers would find difficult to scale. That last bit is hyperbole of course, but it is VERY steep. I'm thinking the best thing to do is to winch it up from the street. The problem is, if the car comes off the winch, I have a 4200 lb rock able to travel into my neighbor's house, my soon-to-be-not-my-house or it simply runs down into my backyard where there's a ravine and creek and well, you get the idea... no more project car.

The car is currently uninsured, I do not have AAA and my questions are these:

Should I buy car insurance for the car just for the trip to my new house?

What should I look for in a tow service in regards to paying for any damages to the car and other things if the worst should happen (licensing, bond, etc)?

Is there a tow service you can recommend either in East Cobb which technically is Marietta even though it's pretty far from the square or Roswell or in between? I have no problem spending a little extra money if it means getting a better tow company.

The final issue is that I know how insurance companies work, how do I go about getting the car insured for say, $25,000? If the car does get wrecked, I don't want a dumbass insurance claim person tell me my rare car is a rust bucket and only blue booked at $4k or something.",Atlanta,Need towing advice from Marietta to Roswell

311,nawanugg,1578414263,eldpzn,Nan,"Hi!

I'm a high school teacher in Atlanta, and my co-teacher and I are currently doing a three-week unit on tabletop game design. We're focusing on the iterative design process, and their final project for the unit involves the creation of a prototype tabletop game incorporating our content (generally using this to teach about probability, marketing, game flavor and mechanics, etc.)

We've been told that we are approved (and encouraged) to take the students out on a field trip. However, I want to make sure that the field trip is both engaging and relevant to their learning. 

Some ideas being tossed around:

1) An escape room and follow-up reflection/discussion on how that experience is designed

2) Maybe a local design studio/firm

3) Board Game/Comic shop to have a conversation with some knowledgeable folks in the market?

Factoring in transportation and meals, our budget is relatively meager (~$500ish leftover), but if something pops out as incredibly relevant I'm sure we could swing something.

So, question: Are there any specific locations in Atlanta (preferably in or on the perimeter) that would make a good location for a field trip of roughly 18 high school students?

DC drivers are bad, no doubt about it, there are plenty of drivers in the ATL area too who do ""normal"" idiot stuff. But there is one thing which drives me absolutely BONKERS, because it is so stupid.

Why do so many drivers in this area think that cars in a right turn lane must yield to the oncoming left-turn lane when the left-turn lane does not have a green arrow and there is no relevant yield signage? I have been in so many close calls because morons turning left blitz out into the intersection and cut me off when I'm turning right.

We both plan on trying the entertainment scene, but not dead set on it if it doesn’t work out. 

We’re trying to find:
Safe as possible given budget.
Decent location towards downtown, MARTA and/or good restaurant jobs.
Creative circles/opportunities somewhat nearby.
Reliable landlords/apartment complexes.
Rent no higher than $1200 (we want to be able to save to invest in our futures).

Ive heard Atlanta’s entertainment scene is growing and a good stepping stone/place for establishing yourself. Is that true? If not, where would be good besides LA or NY? (Those are way too expensive)

A good friend and I are headed to your city at the end of next month to watch the Olympic Marathon Trials. We will be there for a couple of days and want to experience what Atlanta has to offer. We figured that Reddit was a good source to gather information, so here are a few of our questions for the community:

1) What tourist attractions are a must-see and which ones are overrated?

2) Any restaurants or food establishments that stand out above the others?

3) Which areas of the city are safe to roam around and what areas should we definitely avoid?

4) My buddy and I are both in our mid 20s and are single. What bars do you recommend we hit up if we want to meet single women in our age group? I've heard the Buckhead area isn't too shabby.

5) How's traffic in and around the city? I'll be renting a car and want to get a general idea of what to expect.

6) Is Clermont Lounge worth visiting or do my friend and I have to be pretty hammered to genuinely enjoy it?

7) Given what I have provided, what would be a good area to stay in regards to a hotel?

* The use Google Flights to find a date that works for you. Click the date to the right and let the calendar populate with the prices.

* Some of the airlines are only showing prices for the shitty basic economy (Can't pick seat, etc), so expect the price to be a little more. Especially with Delta.

* I would recommend buying from the airline's website instead of third party (priceline, expedia, etc).

* If you find a better deal, post the link.

[Inspirations](https://imgur.com/gallery/0PR4mnh)

I've posted here before and it was a great success. I'm looking to build my portfolio and reviews to help grow my clientele. I am offering huge discounts for hair models. I work in a upscale salon boutique in the center of Buckhead. I am skilled at all areas of hair design. I am seeking all genders. Here are some pics (not mine) of some hair designs I'd like to have models for. You can check out my IG and reviews on Yelp at The Godiva Salon. 

I just want to be clear this isn't a ""free service"". But I've been doing total hair transformations and giving $100-$200 off. Each client will be quoted an individual price, depending on what it will take to achieve your desired look. I can't take black box dye to platinum blonde for $50.00. But I will completely transform your hair  at a very discounted cost. I ask in return tears of happiness, a few photos, and maybe a nice review. 

Comfortable with all hair types and textures. Looking to start doing extensions. Comfortable with all cuts and colors. Will have my 3 mentors helping me with extensions. This post is mostly help me gain more of an online presence. I've been doing hair for 13 years, but I moved and had to start a new clientele here in Buckhead. 

PLEASE LOOK AT MY INSTAGRAM AND REVIEWS AND COME LET ME MAKE YOU YOUR MOST BEAUTIFUL SELF!!!

As I do some searches using some real estate websites, I've identified a lot of properties that seem affordable (compared to Seattle prices) but I've noticed that many are in neighborhoods that don't have sidewalks.

Is there a history around this?

In Seattle, it was generally the case that anything that was developed prior to 1940 that was inside the city limits in 1940 -- have sidewalks because it was required by city code. Areas developed prior to 1940 that were outside of the old city boundary -- were not required to have sidewalks and often don't -- even now that they are inside the city boundary (the city has expanded the boundary a few times from 1940 to present day).

805,killroy200,1579269271,eq0ngb,Nan,"When talking about the need for taking actions to create affordable housing, and to provide cheaper transportation alternatives to cars, I often see someone bring up the idea that Atlanta is, despite everything, still cheaper than [Insert Stereotypically Expensive Metro Here]. This point seems to be used as a rebuttable to acting, as if, because other places are more expensive, there's no need to make things more affordable in Atlanta and the metro.

Now, that's a fallacious argument already (things being worse elsewhere doesn't mean we shouldn't make things better here), but it's not even one that's backed up by the data.

[Car-Dependency Makes City Life Too Expensive](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/01/15/car-dependency-makes-city-life-too-expensive/)

&gt; Three of the nation’s poorest cities are actually the most expensive places to live — when you factor in how much it costs to get around, and not how much it costs to pay the rent.

&gt; That’s the takeaway from [a new report from the Citizens Budget Commission](https://cbcny.org/research/rent-and-ride) that looked at median combined housing and transportation costs as a percentage of area median income, instead of housing costs alone. When it comes to that expanded affordability metric, transit-rich, but housing-dear New York City actually ranks as the eighth most affordable metro among 20 peer cities. The Center for Neighborhood Technology says spending 45 percent of your household income on housing and transportation combined is a good rule of thumb; New Yorkers are paying just a touch more, at 45.3 percent.

&gt; Meanwhile, three of the nation’s most car-dependent cities fall to the bottom of the list: Miami, Detroit and Phoenix.

**Atlanta is the fourth most expensive of those examined.**

That's right. Relatively speaking, New York, Washington D.C., and San Fransisco are all more affordable than the City of Atlanta. This holds true when you play with the data available through the [H+T Index](https://htaindex.cnt.org/map/), a different tool doing analytics in much the same direction. When you look at more affordable, though steryotipcally expensive, cities, you'll see that relative housing costs tend to be higher than for Atlanta, though not by much, so what gives?

Playing around with the H+T Index map to gauge intrametro Atlanta comparisons, it's worth noting that the City of Atlanta itself is, for all its issues, one of the more affordable areas within the core metro. Of the core 5 counties (Fulton, DeKalb, Clayton, Gwinnett, and Cobb), only Clayton has a lower H+T cost than Atlanta, and that's driven by the much lower housing costs despite higher transportation costs.

The relative transportation costs are so high in Atlanta that they offset even the (really quite minor) relative housing cost advantages. Those costs are directly related to the lack of a robust transit system, a lack of bikeability, and a lack of walkability.

To create a truly affordable city, and metro, the City and metro as a whole *must* take a [multi-pronged approach](https://old.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/bu2e16/west_midtown_isnt_a_real_place_its_a_sign_of/ep6igue/). Public investment, coupled with enabling private investment. Housing as well as transportation. [Multi-modal networks](https://i.redd.it/xf9fumddjuf11.png) that aren't just a guise for more car-infrastructure. Only then will Atlanta truly live up to its image as being an affordable city.

***

**Data Disclaimer:** All of these use a relative, median regional income as a baseline for determining affordability. This means that what's considered affordable shifts based on average incomes for a given region. It's important to point out that, just because a place is affordable to the median income, doesn't mean it's an end-all target for affordability. After all, depending on the spreads, lower quintile earners may not actually be able to afford lower quintile units of housing, creating a miss-match in affordability. This could hold true for housing costs that have grown [beyond inflation](https://realestatedecoded.com/case-shiller/), even at the lower ends, where [real-wages have grown slower, stagnated, or even fallen](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45090.pdf).

Additionally, displacement, or even simply growth concentrated at the higher income range can drive up median wages, without there necessarily being an increase in earnings for individuals. Though there are trends of higher-income persons lifting wages of the whole job spectrum even more than rising costs (I'll refer you to [Enrico Moretti's *The New Geography of Jobs](https://www.amazon.com/New-Geography-Jobs-Enrico-Moretti-ebook/dp/B008035HQQ) for that analysis), it's not a guaranteed thing.

Basically, there are subtitles to this data that create plenty of room for apparently contradictory situations on individual levels, which can even be aggregated into apparently contradictory data. I suspect the potential for such situations is higher, and more extreme in the higher direct (as opposed to relative) cost metros, which can give the impression of relative unafordability.

None of that gets Atlanta off the hook, though. Atlanta is not immune from displacement. Atlanta is not immune from lower-quintile wage stagnation, and upper-quintile wage growth disparity. Atlanta is not immune from the very same contradictory opportunities as any other city.

For that reason, I believe the comparisons above hold. If not to definitively prove Atlanta's lack of comparative affordability, then to at least end the definitive insistence of Atlanta's comparative affordability.

For Christmas, instead of materialistic gifts, my sister and I exchanged bags of items to hand out to those less fortunate (hats, gloves, body wash, toothbrush, non-perishable food, etc.). I am not exactly sure where in Atlanta to go to hand out the bag. I never really see homeless people sitting about or walking around, other than the occasional person asking for money at a random stoplight.

885,sarieesar,1579384655,eqn1g4,Nan,"Today, the Atlanta Humane Society held an event in downtown for their free vaccination clinic. They held a much bigger event today, and they were able to see up to 500 pets with five vets on site. Doors opened at 10am and it was available until 4pm. 

I arrived at 9:30am, and there was already a line going around the building. I received a ticket in the 200s. The line was advised to wait in their cars and keep coming back periodically as to not miss their group number. The line was predicted to move rather efficiently. However, my group number was not called into the building until 2:30pm. By the time I got seen by a vet it was 3:30pm. 

Arriving that early and waiting around until then was very stressful for my dog, and it was obvious that all the dogs there were also very uncomfortable and anxious. Being restrained for 7 hours and being in close quarters to so many other pets is enough to bring out the worst in any animal. There were a few fights that broke up between some dogs and there was blood visible on the sidewalks and in the building from the dogs being hurt in those fights. I don't imagine many of these dogs were normally aggressive, but as I said, these conditions are horrible to put an animal through. 

The vet I saw was very stressed and apologetic that my pup was as anxious as she was. I can only imagine how uncomfortable these vets were trying to give vaccinations to animals that had just been put through so much. 

My advice to those who would like to take their animals to future free clinics that are held is to find out how many animals they will be able to treat that day (the site listed only 100 today but we were told differently upon arriving). If the next clinic is up to 500 again, I recommend coming in later in the day after the line has gone down to prevent having to put your dog or cat through the trauma of waiting. By the time I got into the building, the line behind me was minimal. Seeing how I was in the 200s, I would guess that only 300 or so pets were seen today which would mean there was plenty availability left if you come later in the day to avoid the long wait time. 

I appreciate all the humane society does for the community and that they were able to vaccinate so many animals today. I have nothing against them or the vets at all. But with any free event like this, there is bound to be some issues with the process. I really just want to prevent any animal for feeling the way they mine did today. 

TLDR: If you are going to attend the free clinic, come later in the day to avoid the long wait time.",Atlanta,FYI for future Atlanta Humane Society free clinic events

973,weeeeeee12345,1579573309,ernycr,Question,"Hi all, I'm in the process of looking to buy a place in the metro area this year and have basically narrowed down my options to homes in these two areas. Was just wondering if I could get any input on which might be a better place for me to consider and why? 

Some things about me: young professional (mid-20s) working in tech who currently works remotely, so either location is fine for me commute-wise (I just want to be in the north metro in case I ever had to switch to a job that is in office, as more in-office tech jobs/companies seem to be in the north metro in general) ; don't care about proximity to nightlife/the city, as I don't go out that much or to the city much (although I do want to be located near rail transit in general for home value/traffic/possible future work/etc. reasons, which is why I've narrowed down to these two areas). 

For clarification, by Sandy Springs I mean the part located near OTP across 400 from the Perimeter Center area, and by Brookhaven I mean the part generally around the Brookhaven MARTA station. I'm from the metro and have visited both many times, so I know a few of the pros and cons of each area, but am trying to figure out which would be better to buy in now from an investment/life perspective given my current situation? Let me know if there's any other info that could be useful in providing a better recommendation/advice.",Atlanta,Buying Place - Sandy Springs vs Brookhaven

I would be curious to hear if you have additional suggestions to expand this list, as well as your *reasoning*. With your suggestions/feedback, I will work on expanding this list in the coming days.

I realize there is plenty of *subjectivity* and personal preferences here, but there's also a way to be methodical about it with respect to space, availability of free Wi-Fi, and access/availability to wall outlets/chargers. (If you have some other criteria to share, please do!)

I also realize some of you may not want to share your personal favorite coffee shops best for coworking/remote work (for fear of it becoming too crowded, a possible change in policy, etc.) So I respect your decision to not provide any comments/feedback.

I recently learned of a potential job available for me in Atlanta so I’ve been doing a little research on my own regarding places to live. I’ve never even been to Atlanta so this would be an entirely new place to me. After looking at tons of apartments online, the thing I’m still unclear on are the different neighborhoods.

To make it easy, let’s say I’ll be working at the airport. I have a car so public transportation is not a concern. I don’t want to be more than, say, a 20 min drive away. Looking to pay no more than 2k.

Now the part I need help with is finding the right neighborhood (borough??). My biggest concern is obviously safety. I’m a single female and unfortunately that’s just asking for trouble so the safer the better.

The next requirement would be more of the social life aspect. I don’t mind living a little bit away from all of the action as long as I can easily Uber/metro. A late 20s to early 30s dating scene would be a plus. I like trying different local places to eat and discovering the culture of the area so that’s also something I’d like to be around.

However, despite all the luxury condos and fancy restaurants, there has been several self storage buildings constructed in the past few years. I actually count four different self storage places in the one mile stretch on Northside between 10th and Deering.  
  
I guess my question is why are so many of these places being built? How on earth is it profitable given the (probable) high property costs? Are there really that many people out there that need a place to put all their extra shit? Is there some wired zoning or tax mechanism that is encouraging these things to be built?  You’d think there would be a hundred other type of businesses that would generate more revenue per acre given the premium location.

I have reached out to Buckhead Jiu-Jitsu and American Top Team Atlanta but neither offers flexibility. Their prices are north of $129/mo.   


When I lived in Orlando I used to go to American Combat Club and they were very flexible with pricing. They aren't corporate at all. The same guys who own the place are the ones you roll with and receive instruction from. It was a gym that was for the people, per se. They were $80/mo for strictly BJJ.

This morning at Bagel 101 near the Cumberland Mall my wife pointed out a lady who was acting very strangely.

The woman used a sample cup to try the coffee and did not purchase anything. She set up shop at a table with a binder, a lunch box and a manila folder of documents. She repeatedly mixed cream with samples of coffee, stirred them up and walked back to her seat and then returned to the coffee station to try another selection after sitting down for about 11 seconds. Sometimes she would sit for a moment and take out a small salad she had not purchased at Bagel 101, have a small bite and then return the container to her lunch box. At one point she made a scene posing as she put on lip gloss. She would also try to use the very small sample cup to get ice from the fountain drink machine, the ice would pour all over the floor and she would sample the soda. She too did this several times.

   
3 times during the duration of me eating my bagel, she used her lunch box as a tripod to hold up her phone she set on top of the trash can. She took a few steps back and posed while whispering into her headset.

  
She must be 60+  ,  5'2"" and weigh all of 99 lbs. She dressed fashionably in muted colors but with eccentric pops of color in her scarf and jewelry. She had the hair of Tammy Faye Bakker meets  Jerri Blank from Strangers With Candy.  


My wife has spotted her acting this way before at the Panera Bread by the Home Depot Headquarters.

I'm Allison, a 28 year old singer. I'm looking for someone to jam with and perform with on open mic nights/the beltline/etc. Down the road it may evolve into more serious gigs, but for now I'm more interesting in making great music with someone who also loves music. 

About me: Took voice lessons from ages 15-18, stopped for college/initial post college career, then picked them back up in 2018. Currently I'm really into acoustic/folksy sounds and songs from video games (if it would sound ""in-place"" at the Renaissance Faire I'm probably into it). I also have experience with pop, broadway, disney, and am fairly adaptable.  As far as personality, I'm super geeky/nerdy, outgoing, and generally friendly and easygoing.   


Other Notes: I am currently in lessons with a very skilled voice instructor, and he would be happy to have the guitarist also attend lessons so we could work on songs in a professional environment as well. These work sessions would be at no charge to the guitarist. Guitarists of any gender welcome!

1. I am visiting primarily because I'm looking around for a place to move, hopefully by the end of the year.
2. The is the first trip I will have taken on my own as an adult. I'm 30 and I live in Oregon. The farthest I have visited is Nashville, TN. I have been to Minnesota, Wyoming, Seattle several times, and Canada twice.
3. I will be staying at an AirBnB for a week. I'm planning on visiting at least a few medium sized or small music venues. I also want to walk around a lot and get an idea of what some of the different neighborhoods are like.
4. I'm bringing my camera and a laptop. I would love to take some street photography and maybe some concert photography. I've done this a bunch in Portland.
5. I used to live in Portland, and I liked it a lot, but I had to move back home for a while to get my freelancing career in shape. I want to move to a city that has a large music scene with a decent amount of guitar-based bands. I have had some success shooting music videos for bands around Portland, and I also play guitar and bass and I would like to start up a band again when the time is right.
6. Finally, I have an 8 hour layover in Las Vegas on the way back, so if you have any suggestions on what to do then, feel free to mention that.

I'm most interested in Atlanta because it is warmer, drier (although I hear things about the humidity...), more culturally rich, has a larger population, and is far less expensive to own a house in than Portland. I've been checking out some local bands that a blog mentioned. So far, I like All The Saints, Floral Print, Gringo Star, Dot.s, DiCaprio, Deep State, and Breathers. I'm getting into Deerhunter, too.

I'm currently saving up for a down payment on a house. I do freelance video editing and audio book narration. I have assisted shooting some weddings, and I used to make music videos as well. It seems that Atlanta might be one of the better places to do video and media based work. If anyone has relevant experiences related to that, please share. :)

Overall, I'm excited to be travelling, regardless of whether this trip confirms any major life decisions. I've been reading other posts on here, and I appreciate the thought that most people put into their comments. Cheers, and thanks in advance for any suggestions or tips you might have.",Atlanta,"Visiting Atlanta Feb 5th, Also Las Vegas"

1274,Spongemage,1580129948,eunkbp,Nan,"I'm in Smyrna. About three months ago a pregnant cat came to my house and was just crying on my back patio. She was starving and I couldn't resist feeding her some lunch meat because I'm not a monster. It became a thing, and she had her kittens in my yard. Now they all live around my yard but more cats have begun to show up. I'd love to bring the original three cats inside but my wife is DEATHLY allergic to cats. She can't even really be near them. It breaks her heart because she wants to help them too.  


Anyway, my neighbor is intensely mentally unstable. He is an older man who has hated us since we moved in. Old, racist dude who likes to yell the N word at passing cars and hates ""those dirty, lazy fucking liberal millenials!""  


A few weeks ago I was mowing my lawn while my kids played and he stops what he's doing and starts flipping me off and screaming that I'm human garbage and a fucking piece of shit and he's gonna come over and beat my ass (all in front of my kids). He then claims its because I'm training cats to be in his yard. I tell him they are ferals and I'm not ""training"" them to do anything. He reiterated that he was going to kick my ass and he would ""deal with the fucking cats"" if I didn't. So I called the police and sent them to his house.  


I'm aware that the cats have sort of become ""mine"" and I need to deal with this situation but every place I have called says they are full and no one will help me. They are the sweetest animals and I'd take them in if I could. I know I should have never fed them but this is the mess I'm in now. I'm truly, deeply afraid that this guy will either poison them or hurt them somehow. He has suddenly started putting strange bowls of water in his yard and I'm afraid of what may be in them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know of anyone or an organization near Smyrna that could help me with this? I don't want to take them to the pound for them to be euthanized. They are so well tempered and sweet. I just want to help them.  


Thanks.",Atlanta,A family of cats has congregated around my home in Smyrna. I made the mistake of feeding them and now they kind of hang around all day. I need to find a way to home them or I'm afraid my neighbor will either hurt them or have me fined by the city.

The house has a new dishwasher, an older washer/dryer and microwave. The stove is gas which is great for potential chefmates out there.

 Georgia Prevention Project (GPP)is a statewide prevention program aimed at reducing the use of dangerous drugs among teens and young adults. We accomplish our work through awareness campaigns, educational programming and strategic partnerships with national and community-based organizations. 

So GPP tries to have coalitions with students within Georgia Universities with our College Prevention Partnerships (CPP), but our student liaison at  Spelman recently graduated and we are struggling to find someone who will respond to our requests to start another CPP group!

 The purpose of the CPP is to promote the prevention of prescription drug misuse by equipping college students with the tools and knowledge to promote Rx prevention across college campuses through campus outreach and events. Through the Generation Rx Collegiate Toolkit, students receive educational lessons on the misconceptions, realities, and dangers of prescription drug misuse among their peers.  

If you are at Spelman and want to get this started, OR you know someone who will want to get this going, OR you just want more info on what the GPP and the CPP do, PM me and let me know!

I’ve had a lot of knee surgeries and I gained a lot of weight from 2013-2017, then lost about 100 in the last 3 years. I think because of this, my quads and hams are always super tight because of being weak, which makes my hips tight and cause lower back pain (I can’t lay comfortable flat on my back on hard surfaces). Also, the muscle just under my shoulder blades that runs kind of parallel with my ribs are always super tight. I’ve had “attacks” on the left where it’s so tight I can’t breathe well and I can feel it starting to tighten up again this week after I had one on Friday night. My boyfriend convinced me to try laying down and sleeping and if it hadn’t gone away by morning we’d go to the hospital. Luckily it went away. Not for long enough. 😐

I’ve seen several massage therapists, but I think my body is just super off kilter (and I need to spend more time stretching for sure), and I need someone who can really work the knots out. I have a higher than usual pain tolerance from chronic pain and I don’t want a relaxing massage. Make it hurt because that’s what is needed. I just don’t want to wind up in the ER because of back pain again. Most massages I’ve gotten just have not been deep enough, and cupping has actually gotten me better results many times.

Any recommendations that also don’t cost an arm and a leg would be great (esp. since I’m saving for a car since mine is 20 and dying, moving states soon, and medical expenses are costly). Willing to drive for a good massage therapist, but not to Timbuktu. I live in Stone Mountain but work in West Midtown. So preferably around there somewhere.

Another man contacted the police, presumably using the number for MARTA police/to contact the train operator. He calmly identified the car number and gave an assessment of what had transpired. This phone call earned him a specific death threat from the man in question.

One stop later, two policeman boarded the train (not sure if was APD or MARTA PD), and quickly removed the threatening gentleman without incident.

We currently have space for several more people without cars. However, depending on how many people show up and how many are ready to drive, we can't necessarily guarantee a spot. If more people come who are willing to drive, then we will be able to accommodate more.

2041,aldoneedsanewhome,1581279052,f1e9pq,Nan,"Hi r/Atlanta,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for a new home for my pup, Aldo. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some facts about Aldo**

* 10 Months old
* Great Pyrenees Mix
* Neutered
* 65 lbs
* Up-to-date on all shots
* Housebroken

**Why Aldo is an awesome dog**

Aldo is the type of dog that eagerly awaits as you come up the stairs, using his helicopter tail to express his joy. Aldo is the type of dog that gives it his best darn attempt to eat whatever you give him so he doesn't appear ungrateful. Aldo is the type of dog that makes a derpy face as he runs full-force to you when you call him. Aldo is the type of dog that acts like he totally wasn't sniffing the trash and was definitely just drinking water. Aldo is the type of dog that patiently waits for you to wake up even though he's ready for his morning walk. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why am I looking for a new home for him?**

I started experiencing congestion and coughs in the past month and recently decided to get it checked out at the allergist. She conducted allergy testing and concluded that I developed an allergy to dogs. My two options are to limit my contact with him or try immunotherapy.

Hope you are doing well. 

My wife, toddler and I live currently in Alpharetta, GA; I work here. Recently, my wife got a job offer from a company located in Peachtree City, GA, which is around 65 miles from Alpharetta. We are looking to move to a location that is closer to Peachtree city so that we can make this work. Ideally, a location in between Alpharetta and Peachtree city - that will be around 20-25 mile commute for my wife (towards Peachtree city) and 40-45 mile commute for me (towards Alpharetta - I could start early in the morning around 6AM and start around 3PM in the evening to beat traffic). Or is this wishful thinking, considering the traffic? Ideally looking to find a location along I-285. Any advise would be great and I look forward to hearing from you

We are sitting in his truck in East Atlanta because he refuses to let me get an Uber. He is INSISTENT that he’s as sober as he could possibly be (but also he’s being a huge dick and slurring literally every word)

I’ve never been in this situation. His dogs (well - his other friends dogs he’s watching who’s out of town) need to go out and eat. I know he would be MORTIFIED if he knew he was being this way, he LOVES those dogs and takes the responsibility seriously. But he had his childhood best friends in town and didn’t self moderate properly (recovering alcoholic kinda). I am trying to be gentle and also authoritative and nothing is working. 

I know not to take his anger at me personally. I’m worried if I call an Uber he won’t get in. He insists on sleeping in his truck until he’s sober (won’t be for hours). And insists he’s more sober than ever. There’s no one else we can call, we are kind of each other’s only friend right now and his friends we were with aren’t picking up. 

I love my best friend and have no idea what to do right now. We’ve been gone since 1pm so it’s not the WORST, should I just let him sleep it off a few hours?? I’m not even sure he’d be sober by then, he’s more drunk than I’ve ever seen him. Please help, I have no idea what to do :(",Atlanta,"Best friend is drunk with me in East Atlanta.

So we’ve been seeking out unconventional places for gigs, like driveways/parking lots/in-stores, etc. For example, on February 29th, we’re playing our first show upstairs at camelis pizza in little five points. 

We’ll play on the day your closed, after hours, during the workday( but only after 3:30 because that’s when we get out of school), really any time. And whatever money we make (if any) we could split it between you and us. 
So if there’s any business owners on here who would let a band play in their parking lot to a crowd of fifteen kids maximum, let me know! We just want to play for fun and to be able to say we’ve played in a parking lot because that’s funny to us. 

also- it’s worth mentioning that although we’re young, we aren’t stereotypically snotty teenagers. our band is just odd. we will treat your space and you with respect. if you’re unsure feel free to dm me and we’ll all make our case to you.

I'm born and raised in Atlanta, but moved to California when I was 18 and have been there for the past 12 years (mostly in the SF Bay Area). I've always loved Atlanta. My family is there, as are many of my oldest friends. And while I've long considered the possibility of moving back there, now that I have a real concrete reason and opportunity I'm panicking a bit.

I know all of the good things about Atlanta, especially the ones that are advantages over my current situation. However, what I fear most is losing three things that are pretty specific to living in the Bay: easy access to magnificent nature, walkability, and a general acceptance and pervasiveness of weird counter culture / psychedelic art scene.

I'm curious to hear from folks who may have moved to Atlanta from the Bay (or LA) and how their experiences have been in light of those fears of mine and just in general. It sort of feels like the time is right to make this move, and though I am excited about coming home I am very sad to think about leaving this beautiful place behind.",Atlanta,Who moved here from Northern California?

The job is in Alpharetta and I live in Sandy Springs/Roswell. I've been here 4 years now and to be honest, I'm ready for a change. I'm getting hit with an increase in rent at my apartment every year and I'm sure I'll get one this year as well. I'll be at basically $1300 a month and I don't feel it's worth it. I've been wanting to move closer to the city so it's not as much of a pain in the ass to get around. You guys living here know what I'm talking about with the traffic. AND if I""m closer to the city maybe I can keep my eyes open for a job closer to where I'm living if I move to Decatur, or even Midtown, Buckhead, anything so I don't feel like I'm out in the middle of nowhere. I LOVE having a short commute going 400 North in the morning but again, tired of living way out here.

ANYWAY, today I took my regular route home on the train from work. A middle aged man gets on and sits down but keeps looking at me. It’s really weird because his seat faces the side and so he has no reason to look over at me who is a facing forward. However anytime he catches my eye he looks away weirdly but keeps trying to catch me unawares. Anytime the train stops he looks to me as if To see if I’m going to get off. When I don’t he remains seated. 

To test if I’m paranoid I wait till the last second for when my stop arrives to get off and he does a weird hesitation thing and follows me off the train. I walk towards stairs I don’t normally take and when he moves to follow me I fake left and take off towards my usual stair case in a rush. When I look back over my shoulder he’s stopped and confused.

2316,wet_willy_,1581708398,f3xait,Nan,"Hey everyone,  


I'm trying to set up a date night for ice skating plus dinner.  Wanted to get you guys (generic term, girls inclusive) thoughts on what the best Ice Skating venue is for a nice date.  


I'm interested in the ice skating in Ponce.  I'm concerned that it may be too kiddish though.  I've never been, but it seems the surrounding amusement park is more for kids.  


I saw that the St. Regis has a rink.  Looks like it could be fantastic if I went for the whole St. Regis package.  Certainly something I'll do, but I'm thinking to save it for a later date. (Maybe not!)  


I know there's a handful of other venues.  Sandy Springs, Centennial Olympic Park, etc.

I don't want a place that's too crowded as both of us are rookies.  I don't want a place that's too empty -- watching the ice skaters who know what they're doing is part of the experience.  


So I wanted to ask you guys for your opinions.  What are the best ice skating experiences in Atl?  Ambiance matters.  We're new to ice skating - that's part of the fun. We get to fall on our butts and laugh at it.  We will need an instructor-led crash course.  I can make this happen, supposing the venue does not offer lessons.",Atlanta,Thoughts on best Ice Skating in Atlanta and surrounding cities

About a month ago my wife and I moved clean across the country to California because I received a job offer from a very well known Silicon Valley tech company. We left Atlanta feeling disappointed...my car had been stolen...almost got robbed a week before we left and we had made up our minds that we were ready for something new....

Well...let me tell you Silicon Valley is NOT a place for black people. Everywhere we go (Sunnyvale, San Jose, Palo Alto) we get stared at. My wife who is Natural gets stares from women when she dresses up to go out and it’s very annoying. 

There are NO black people...actually in the month I’ve been here I’ve seen about 10 total. We all know each other on a 1st name basis and speak when we see each other out and about. 

This is a BIG culture change from Wakanda. 

Oh and the housing situation is HORRIBLE. We put in applications for places and they say sorry there are 2 applications in front of yours so if the others decide not to get it I’ll let you know...or we go to visit an open house hoping to edge out the competition so we arrive an hr early usually and there are lines of people already there...it’s just not Atlanta. 


As of right now...we will probably head back to Atlanta after a year of this place.

As an everyday bike commuter, there are a few spots where as a bike, I'm not sure I should be required to sit in traffic with the rest of the humanity as 1) I'm on a two wheeled vehicle with no motor and limited padding.  2) I'm taking up very little room and will always yield to pedestrians 3) I should be granted certain privileges as I'm on a bike in Atlanta (?)  Is there any gray area here or is it black/white like many like to suggest?

Few scenarios for you:  

Cheshire Bridge southbound at rush hour.  As you come under 85, traffic consolidates into a couple lanes and one is sometimes blocked by a left hand turner.  It's basically a 5-10 minute intersection.  Is this okay here to use the sidewalk?  Nice wide sidewalk with no pedestrians or am I required to sit in traffic on my bike?  If there was another N/S path from Buckhead to Midtown I would take it, but sitting in really bad traffic is something I'm trying to avoid by taking a bike.  Additionally, further southbound next to the bridge, people fly down around the bridge and the hill on the other side is long and hard.  Can I take the sidewalk here to save my life?

Shady Valley Lane southbound at Buford highway.  Friday, it was backed up from people trying to cut through the neighborhood to avoid other traffic probably a half a mile or a 15 minute wait to turn right.  Normally it's pretty easy, but when cars start to invade my route of back roads, it becomes a bit ridiculous.  What are my options here on a bike?  Am I required to sit behind these cars and wait?  Or since I have a bike can I go around them to the sidewalk?

4th &amp; Crescent:  I was yelled at this morning while making a right hand turn slowly.  I did not come to a complete stop on my fixed gear (but neither did the two cars in front of me) and just went slow through a few pedestrians who were crossing outside the crosswalk. Am I the asshole here?  It's not like I'm flying through the intersection, and I'm being courteous, just ""start acting like a car if you want to ride your fvcking bike"" was a little over the top for me.

Thanks for helping.  Roast away.",Atlanta,Am I the Asshole? Biking in Atlanta

TLDR; Bought home last January, setup water account 6 months later in June. City of Atlanta insistent that I pay $200/month estimated usage for the 6 month period before my account was setup (totally $1200), where we now have data showing my actual usage is consistently $50/month - of which I've already paid and caught up on.

I purchased a home last January 2019. As I moved here from a state that includes water and utilities lumped into one bill, I didn't setup my water account until June 2019 after receiving door knocker. At the time of setting up my account, the representative informed me to pay \~$300 to cover the back bill of 6 months (estimating I used an average of $50/month). Since setting up my account, I have been current on all bills, and believe it or not I am spot on with \~$50/month of usage). To be clear, I am up-to-date on these bills and happy to pay for actual usage.. now to the frustrating part.

Immediately after setting up my account, I received a bill of almost $1200 for usage. It's taken me another 6 months of back and forth with the city (including initial disputes and appeals) leading to a formal in person appeal today at City Hall to get an answer on where it exactly this amount came from. The city effectively estimated my usage from Jan-Jun 2019 and 'unfortunately we estimate at the highest usage tier' according to the representative I spoke with today. What this means in dollars and cents, is they estimated I used $200/month of water versus the actual (and now backed up with 6 month of data from July 19- Jan 20) usage of $50/month. My jaw dropped after they mentioned they would not be adjusting my bill. The hearing board stated 'no further questions asked' and mentioned my only next step would be to file a civil action to the Fulton County Superior Court.

Hi guys, I’m a current GA state student. I was wondering if you guys could sign this petition. It’s very important to hold government workers accountable, and this case means very much to me. 

Tell Speaker Ralston to Censure Trey Kelley!
On September 11, 2019, an innocent man was hit and killed by a car. The driver's first call wasn't to 911--it was to Georgia State Representative Trey Kelley, who helped to sweep the matter under the rug. While the man was dying in agony in a ditch, Kelley and the driver stood together just down the road. Neither of them called 911. Neither of them tried to help the man.

Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned Rep. Kelley. Tea Party activist Amy Kremer said that Kelley ""should be arrested and charged in the death of this man."" Georgia State Representative Shelly Hutchinson called Kelley's actions ""unacceptable, harmful to our state, and beneath his office."" State Rep. Renitta Shannon, State Sen. Jen Jordan, and more have called for his resignation.
Kelley’s continued presence in the Georgia State House is a disgrace to the institution. While both sides of the aisle have condemned Kelley, there has been deafening silence from the House Leadership. Speaker Ralston has made no meaningful effort to condemn or punish Kelley for his corrupt actions.
Rep. Trey Kelley has undermined his office, the public's trust, and the entirety of the Georgia House of Representatives. The General Assembly cannot be taken seriously when it allows someone like Kelley to continue to be a member. If Speaker Ralston respects Georgia and the dignity of the General Assembly, he will immediately censure Kelley and Kelley will resign. 

Call Speaker Ralston's office to demand he censure Trey Kelley: (404) 656-5020

Call Trey Kelley's office to demand he resign: (404) 656-5024

Both 11 Alive and WSBTV have done segments on this.

I am a first-year Physician Assistant student at Emory involved in planning the Emory School of Medicine Art Gala and Silent Auction. This event is a fundraiser for student-run clinics in the greater Atlanta area, as well as for our class. **We are looking for local galleries and artists to contribute art to the Gala, whether it be as a donation, for sale with a portion of the profits going to the clinics, or for display-only during the gala.** The event will be held on Saturday, April 25th, 2020. 

Each year, this function is well attended by Emory physicians, medical students, and community members interested in purchasing works to benefit this cause. Last year’s event was a great success, allowing us to help student clinics provide better care to the most underserved populations in Atlanta. The team working on this year’s Art Gala has strong ambitions to surpass the goals of the past and host the most successful event to date.

Our aspirations to help the community can only succeed if we have the support of artists like you. If you would like to learn more, please check out our website [https://emorymedartgala.wordpress.com/](https://emorymedartgala.wordpress.com/) for more information. 

Please send me a DM if you are interested in helping our cause in any way! As Emory is a 501(c) charitable organization, if you choose to donate, your donation can qualify for a deduction in federal income taxes.

Thank you so much for your consideration!",Atlanta,Calling All Artists!

I went to the Chastain Park location shortly after 10 since it's the nearest one to me with free parking, though I might have reconsidered if I'd remembered those damn speed bumps.

I recommend checking it out if you have the opportunity because the process is *not* as easy as the old cast-and-hope touchscreens, and the poll workers could use the practice as well. I waited about 20 minutes for them to check in the only person who got there before me. The check-in process happens on another touchscreen now, and it's not clear when you're supposed to turn the thing around to face the poll worker again.

The process of picking votes is easy enough, but you can't drag to scroll the ballot. The biggest hangup, and a mistake made by the one person before me, is that after casting the ballot, instead of the card instantly popping out of the machine, you have to stand there and wait for the printer to print your selections, and by the time it's done you're likely to want to grab the sheet and run over to the collection box. **Don't forget to pull out your card (it doesn't pop out) and take it with you.**

25F

Diagnosis/Symptoms: Lupus, Fibromyalgia, Sjögrens, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Mixed Connective Tissue Disorder, T12 Compression Fracture, Sciatica, Seizures, TMJ, Neuropathy

Currently I’m unable to walk for more than 5 minutes, so I’m in a wheelchair most of the time, I seize about 3 times a week, I’m not allowed to drive, and I’m not allowed to have a job. 

I currently see many specialists to keep it under control, but the pain is unbearable. My rheumatologist has talked about referring me to a pain clinic, but hasn’t. I really can’t take it anymore. I’ve been to the ER 10 times just this year and now when I go they don’t even treat me (they literally gave me Benadryl and discharged me after I had a mini stroke and seizure in front of them), so I’m stuck dealing with the pain and other symptoms. On top of that, I can’t take Tylenol or Advil because the lupus is attacking my kidneys and liver. 

Can anyone recommend any PCP or doctor that can help? I don’t care about the location. My husband is allowed one day of the week off and can drive me. I just can’t take it anymore. It just gets so bad that I’ve passed out from the pain.

I'm considering buying a house and moving to Center Hill, and staying there for the foreseeable future with my girlfriend and future wife. It's close to the West End, Bankhead, and Collier Hills, and convenient to I-20. From what I can tell, it hasn't really been touched by gentrification, but also is not a super rough area, with most crimes being petty larceny. Being an Atlanta native, I know a lot about the city but am fairly ignorant as to this neighborhood.

They mix hip hop, ambient, electronic, and psychedelic vibes with completely insane shred. If you start the link at :30 you’ll bare witness to one of the most insane guitar duels I’ve seen in my life. All their details are in the video description. These guys are very dear friends of mine and they routinely inspire my own playing.

Guitarists: Justin Tolan and Senam Palmer 



[Little Tybee —“Empire State”](https://youtu.be/MfY8Wsjbv9I) Start the video at 4:30. This is arguably the most well established/successful group on the list. They’re kind of like folk prog or bohemian indie prog. They’re very difficult to categorize. But their guitarist has reached wide acclaim at this point for popularizing/inventing a number of playing techniques including: glitch tapping, butterfly tapping, and under strumming.

He’s inspired my own playing a lot and I’ve even taken lessons with him. He teaches at Atlanta Institute of Music occasionally as well. 

Guitarist: Josh Martin


[Paladin — Carpe Diem ](https://youtu.be/U_X2L2ixbXA) If any of you are total metal heads this band is for you. Solos at 1:25 and at 2:20z They’re like Children of Bodom meets like... every good thrash and power metal band you can think of. I’ve had the good fortune of playing a gig with them and they’re Insanely talented and kind fellows. 

Guitarists: Taylor Washington and Alex Parra 


[Tiny Scissors — their whole ep pro shot](https://youtu.be/JgHfCGCXqOU) This is for all the Math Rock/Metal nerds. I don’t really have a suggestion on where to start. The whole thing is nuts. This is less so about guitar technique and more so about sheer creative genius and originality. Both these dudes are completely phenomenal and really kind and wonderful fellows. Jason is easily one of the best drummers in the entire South East. 


Guitarist: Clayton Curtis



[Gabriel Levi](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2MxyfCA722/?igshid=3srfidlgyt5o) I actually don’t know this cat all that well though I stood next to him at a show very recently 😂 He’s Really goddamn good though.


[Odd Squad](https://youtu.be/embqdNxEAGo) Alright so technically this is a bass guitarist but he’s easily among the best in the state hands down. They’re like if Hella and Primus had an evil baby. 

Bassist: Bryan Estevez 


[Ede Wright](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8MnTIIhpby/?igshid=j3658krtgqvm) This guy is pretty much a veteran at this point but he’s entirely too good not to mention. He plays all styles and genres but his jazz shred chops are next level.


If I haven’t bored you to tears by now, here’s [me.](https://youtu.be/WesPjL_-g8Q) There link to pro recorded stuff/ Spotify and all that jazz in the description. We’re heavy psychedelic prog rock essentially.

2712,atthebarre,1582387025,f7ubzd,Nan,"Hi everyone!

My former college roommate and I are planning a weekend trip to Atlanta sometime in April. We have done Atlanta once before after having been evacuated out of Charleston due to the hurricane last year. As you can imagine, that was a very last minute trip that we had to throw together in a little over a day. I think it's safe to say we absolutely LOVED the city. We anticipated being there for 4+ nights so we ended up at a Wyndham property just outside of Sandy Springs that had great reviews, offered free parking, and could accommodate my 75 lb pitbull free of charge. 

While Sandy Springs was great for what we needed at the time, we'd like to stay downtown for our upcoming trip. We drove downtown several times while we were there and did the very basic things: Lenox Square Mall, dinner at Fogo De Chao, visited a friends high-rise apartment in Midtown. We also went to Perimeter Mall. 

We are thinking about staying in the Midtown area or possibly in Buckhead close to the mall, but I am totally open to neighborhood suggestions. We don't have a specific budget, however, hotels like the Ritz Carlton or a Four Seasons property are a bit out of reach. Ideally, I'd like to spend between $150-$200 per night. We would also be interested in some kind of boutique hotel or a chic Airbnb, so I'd love hearing experiences with that. 

Restaurants. This one is important. I'm looking for some good local restaurants. Italian, French, Asian, Sushi, Seafood, Southern, Acai/smoothie bowls, brunch spots, anything really. In Charleston there are lots of restaurants with cool concepts in unique spaces and I'm hoping to find similar places in Atlanta. We definitely aren't cheap eaters. I'd say we easily spend $150+ when we go out together if that helps with narrowing down suggestions. We aren't really interested in fast casual/fast food places.

Things to do. While I'm aware of the more touristy activity options in Atlanta, such as Coca Cola World, Georgia Aquarium, etc, I'm also looking for other options. Including things to do at night. Are there any cute neighborhoods to walk around in with boutiques and restaurants? Best clubs in the area? Maybe somewhere with al fresco seating for a cocktail? Rooftop bars? 

That said, I am looking for any and all recommendations of places to stay, restaurants, things to do and anything else that two twenty-somethings would find fun in the area! Thanks in advance for everyones help.",Atlanta,Girls Weekend in Atlanta

I'm getting married next month and I have some questions around how best to handle this legally re debt that I was hoping someone would answers.

We are relocating to Atlanta soon and am in the process of setting up utilities;  I was surprised to find that I can't just order gas service from Atlanta Gas and Light, but rather need to select a 'marketer' -- this is very different to how things are in my current area.

How much variation is there in the different marketers in terms of price? Having never had to make this kind of decision (for us the gas company in your area is _the_ gas company) I'm hoping for any guidance.

I'm looking to connect with local grocers, farmers, and growers so I can satiate my mushroom needs.  I'm thinking a CSA might have the best connect here?  Whole Foods has a somewhat above average selection, but then its just that, above average.  Kroger and Publix haven't gotten it done.  Trader Joe's?  Sevenada didn't have much selection when I went, but maybe I went on a bad day?

Shiitake, Oyster, Lion's Mane, Enoki, Portabello/Cremini, Maitake, Beech, King Oyster, Chanterelle, Porcini...I could go on and on.

Does anyone know where to start?  Where to go?  Will YDFM be the answer?  Random grocery store on BuHi or up in Mableton or Duluth?  A mushroom-specific CSA or hydroponic grower?

Any and all help is welcome, loved, and appreciated.",Atlanta,Mushrooms

Although I knew that I didn't have the proper setup to care for him long-term, I couldn't stand to leave him there in that awful environment.  So, I paid $10, took him home, and put him in my spare 35 gallon tank, and he's been happy for over two years now.

However, he's about 6 inches long and is (of course) rapidly outgrowing his habitat.  I would also like to convert that tank to a planted aquarium, and he destroys any plant I put in there.

He's a very pretty fish and seems to be perfectly healthy--I'm hoping that I can get him into a proper pond soon.

If anybody on here has a pond that could house him, please let me know.

As I was discussing this with a friend of mine, she told me that her kids have a bunch of loose Lego they don't play with anymore, and that she wants to get rid of them.

&gt;To former listeners of AM1690, ""The Voice of the Arts,"" I want to invite you back into the world of literature, music, comedy, and culture with a new podcast. I will be bringing you much of what you came to love at the old station, all at the high fidelities of internet broadcasting. It will be a platform for the exploration of ideas and the appreciation of classic and contemporary forms of artistic expression (and some good laughs along the way.) As the world grows coarser, angrier, and louder, I'm hoping that the quiet and thoughtful sound of a good short story or piece of music can bring you comfort and joy.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are already four episodes available online, and you can find them wherever podcasts are available. Please click on the link provided here OR on the button below to access all of the episodes on iTunes, and stay tuned for the next editions as they come out.

My name is David and I was born and raised in Atlanta. My parents are immigrants and so English is not my first language but my Russian is not quite as strong as my English. Lots of people are actually surprised to hear that I'm a Grady baby but anyway.. I write you from a bit of a disadvantaged position and I am absolutely determined to turn it around. I've been searching for some work and not sure if Indeed and Craigslist are just garbage resources as I have a decent resume of accomplishments and letters of recommendation. I'd like to perform magic full time but it can be very ""sink or swim"" so a regular paying job is welcome.  


*A bit about me:* I've been performing magic for fun since 2012 and professionally (*or semi-professionally*) since 2018. I have experience with construction projects, health insurance (*pretty much all aspects*), software development, and am exceptional with people. I love to learn and meet new people but most of all, I enjoy meeting people through magic. I've performed close up magic at Christmas parties, at corporate events, for GSU, and even for Microsoft. It's a huge passion of mine and I'd be delighted to share it with you.  


So I ask, would anyone like to grab some coffee and meet a magician? I am always looking to network but I'd also greatly appreciate any advice for job seeking in ATL. Also comments and DM's are also welcome for those that are less inclined to being outdoors at the moment.  


And a joke to close out: A duck walks into a CVS and orders some chapstick.

None of us mind that they are here, in fact they have helped immensely with the rodent problem my neighbor and I were having. But my next door neighbor is an angry, lonely, miserable asshole who hates cats and thinks they are a nuisance. Thinking they are a nuisance is understandable, it’s more the crazy delusion he has that I am training feral cats to shit in his yard and his incessant staring at me and my children. He will even walk to the end of his driveway and watch us drive away when we leave. A few months ago, while I was outside playing with my kids, he screamed that I’m a piece of shit and he was gonna kick my ass in front of my kids. Cops were called and he backed off. 

Today, while out playing with my wife and three year old. I noticed him staring at us by his fence. I stood up and said “look asshole, you need to quit fuckin’ staring at my KID before I call the cops and report a pervert. Got it?”

He screamed back “KEEP YOUR GOD DAMNED CATS OUT OF MY YARD” 

I screamed “not my cats and suck a dick dude” as I went inside and slammed the door.

Point is, these cats have gotta go. They aren’t my cats but I’m afraid this psycho is gonna have me fined by the city or some shit. He’s a real nutcase. He’ll literally stand by the road and yell the n word at black peoples driving by and somehow hadn’t gotten his ass kicked for it. 

I need to figure out if the best option would be to catch and relocate them or catch them and take them the shelter. TNR isn’t gonna work as I can’t control the movements of wild cats and his issue is that they are on his property and somehow that’s my fault?

That’s fine. I knew it was a 1 yr plan. Anyway the plan dropped by ~15 dollars. Awesome, right? I purchased an Arris surfboard sbg10 around 7 months ago and it’s been great. It handles the speed I pay for and has never given me a problem, consistently tested 250+ mbps. The technician comes and sets up my internet in the new home (had to be rewired) and my Arris is now only giving 12mbps, 20 max. A call to xfinity has them insisting that it’s my equipment. So I get the xfinity router and of course I test 350mbps immediately. their router costs ~15 a month to rent. anyone else think they were doing something to cause my router to not work properly?

One of the biggest misconceptions is that you need to be dirt poor to receive food stamps. Obviously, the worse your situation, the more you will likely get. Nevertheless, if you are struggling and able to get ANYTHING, even the $20-50 minimum, this will obviously help you. My roommate and I have received $190 and $170 respectively. In 2004-2010, my mom and I received $250 in Florida, as she is severely disabled and cannot work.

Never leave eligible free money on the table.

[Here is where you can download and print the forms.](https://dfcs.georgia.gov/food-stamps) I would recommend faxing or mailing via certified mail so you can have a receipt of delivery.

I grew up in Florida where the entire IDENTICAL system is online, yet Kemp recently removed the SNAP application from the website, forcing everything to be submitted via mail/fax/walk-in. (Please rip him a new one for this. It is in no way more secure than online as every case needs to be verified over the phone. He's just a major asshole.)

The guidelines for who qualifies are truly an enigma. I say if you make under $40k, it's definitely worth a shot. If you make under $50k, it's still worth a shot, but you're probably less likely to get anything or you may just get the bare minimum.

&amp;#x200B;

IF YOU HAVE ROOMMATES WITH WHOM YOU DO NOT PRIMARILY SHARE MEALS NOR PAY FOR EACH OTHERS' MEALS: DO. NOT. LIST. THEM. UNDER. HOUSEHOLD. INCOME.

The legal definition for 'household' is someone who SHARES AND PAYS FOR MEALS WITH YOU. So, partners, children, parents (usually) count under household but ROOMMATES DO NOT.",Atlanta,Please apply for food stamps/EBT/SNAP if you are financially struggling. End the stigma. (Guide)

I am an LA Fitness member, and I have a problem:

Ever since I started working from home, I have slowly and lazily become a slob who sleeps in on weekdays and then ends up working late into the night. It has totally messed up my schedule. As a result, I don't wake up early to go to the gym anymore, and the rest of me is becoming gross.

I have tried everything from alarm clocks to sleeping pills and so on. I feel like an idiot. I know it sounds ridiculous but here's my idea:

If you are a fellow ATLien who has an LA Fitness Membership, I will pay you five bucks a day, Monday to Friday, to:

A) Call me at 7AM and make sure I am out of bed,

B) Show up at my apartment, which is walking distance from an LA Fitness, by 8AM, and

C) Go with me to the gym to work out. I don't need a PT, just someone who makes me go!

Hours are negotiable, but it has to be early. Partly it is to get my ass to the gym, partly it is just to keep me on schedule.

I know it sounds ridiculous but I think there are also some benefits:

\- We'll both use our gym memberships

\- We'll both be waking up bright and early

\- We can be friends!

\- 100 bucks a month is 100 bucks a month.

If you are interested, message me off-list and we can arrange to meet in person at LA Fitness tomorrow morning so we can both confirm that the other person isn't a crazy person, and then we can go from there!

Thanks.",Atlanta,LA Fitness Goers Who are Awake Early? I need your help.

I am very upset about this. I’m immunocompromised, and my mother and I take care of my grandparents who are in their 80s.

Brewery Closing Taprooms
Schoolhouse has taken the last couple of days to take inventory of the safety of our employees and our customers. With the recent update from the federal administration, strongly recommending that people not gather in groups of 10 or more, it saddens us to say that we will be moving to limited hours for the foreseeable future. 

These hours are going to be for to-go beer and homebrewing supplies. This means that all taproom events, both public and private, are canceled. We will be open from 12-6 pm Monday-Sunday until the safety of everyone is without doubt.

Employee Compensation
Schoolhouse brewing started this business as a family, and that includes our employees. Schoolhouse Brewing is going to make sure that the pay of all our employees, both full and part-time, is covered. Compensation will include all tips that our bartenders rely on to survive.  
Our corporate culture at Schoolhouse is to compensate well above the minimum wage for servers, allowing our staff to have a living wage.  


Schoolhouse Charity Outreach.
Former teachers at Marietta Middle started Schoolhouse Brewing. This is one of the main reasons we chose Franklin Gateway to be our home. One of our core missions at Schoolhouse is to give back to this community and to further the Mission and Vision that Marietta, Georgia, has for Franklin Gateway. 
With that said, we are gathering food for the kids who are going to be without the assistance they receive from the school system. Marietta City Schools is doing a fantastic job of preparing and delivering food once a day. However, one meal a day will be hard for these students. 
Schoolhouse is collecting as many kid-friendly foods for these students.  

Needs:
Juice Bags/Boxes
Microwavable foods (mac and cheese, Soup, shelf-stable, etc..)
Snacks (they are kids let them have fun)

This is a **free** service. Please don’t take advantage of it. 

Although a lot of schools are closing, for certain school systems students are still expected to learn. From the Cobb County Schools website: ""While our school buildings will be closed, the education process will not stop. All staff will work remotely to best support students, including delivering digital and physical instructional resources to students while they’re at home.""

This might be difficult for a myriad of reasons, so I wanted to offer assistance with what I can. I’ve been tutoring for almost a decade now in the Cobb County school system in SAT, ACT, AP Calculus AB/BC, IB HL Math, AP Statistics, K-12 math, IB HL Physics, AP Physics 1/2/C/C:Emag, and Physics. I would be happy to meet with your student to go over 2 lessons/week that they’re having trouble understanding from their online lessons. 

If you’re a parent who CAN help your student with math or physics, please consider doing so yourself, as well as offering what assistance you can. Starting a (digital) home-school co-op in your neighborhood might work out well to support the digital learning set-up being implemented. 

Remote learning is not always the best choice for certain students or certain classes. I’m just worried what this might mean for students who are behind or taking a difficult class load or even taking a difficult class.

Regardless of what College Board decides to do with AP exams and how counties will handle GPAs, finals, and standardized tests for the rest of the semester, this interruption in the school-year is a set-back for a lot of students who *do* learn a lot better from a more structured, traditional classroom setting. I can’t offer that, but I’d like to offer at least something.",Atlanta,Offering Free AP/Other STEM Tutoring

* Only want people getting tested who are high risk or healthcare workers, I guess everyone else can take a hike
* Businesses still have to pay their state taxes tomorrow
* No curfew or anything else to stop spread
* They may consider letting you buy beer to go at restaurants but sounded doubtful
* Stop going to church
* Stop going to funerals 
* Won't ask business to close

Toomey:

* **We have 500 test kits** 
* Maybe we'll have more next week
* She is saying we will have high capacity sites but is stumbling over her words. Doesn't sound like a very fleshed out plan. 
* **Oh. Even at these high capacity sites, ONLY symptomatic people who are a) high risk or b) medical professionals will be tested.**

We will NEVER know the true number with tests being restricted like this. 

I just watched the entire trump phone conference with every governor just before this. nearly every Governor said that when they ordered swabs and reagents for their test kits, the supply orders were canceled and were sent to the federal government instead. Our governor didn't complain about this but it was clear that the process of sending tests to states has completely failed. And it sounds like we will continue to spread this and stay in the dark as to the true number. Astounding.",Atlanta,Governor Kemp's address just now and his plans for the state.

4507,LarperPro,1584853619,fmugv9,Question,"I have a job interview on Monday that I am really interested in, and if all works out I will be potentially moving to Atlanta for work.

I wanted to prepare myself better for the job interview by researching living costs in Atlanta. I've found a thread about cost of living in Atlanta but the replies are more tailored towards that guy's specific situation which is [cost of living for a family of four](https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/bliubu/atlanta_cost_of_living/).

There's another thread where [people cite their salaries and rent costs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/8jpwie/how_much_do_you_make_how_much_is_your_rent/) but, as a non-Atlantian, or even as a non-American, the rent costs are all over the place and I have no idea what to expect.

My research about average salaries for the position I am applying led me to a conclusion that it *might* be around $35k /year after tax, meaning around $3000/month.

The job is located walking distance from the [Kensington metro station](https://goo.gl/maps/GJoVApK9FarU824WA), and finding an apartment or a room to rent in that general area would be awesome as I love walking/cycling to work. 

I am also open to other neighborhoods if that would mean cheaper rent but then I'd have to take $100/month for a metro card, [based on Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Atlanta), into consideration. 

I am looking on trying to save at least $1500/month, meaning I'd love to have my food and rent be around $1000/month, with $500/month left for healthcare, socializing and transportation. How many roommates would I need for this to be possible?

If not, what would be more realistic living costs for the area mentioned above?

I'd love if someone could make a list of average expenses such as:

* rent + bills:

* food: 

* necessities (healthcare, phone plan, hygiene, condoms, etc.): 

* transportation: 

* entertainment budget:

4548,dead_hat,1584905130,fn5fx9,Politics,"I am sorry for this rant, but I really need to get this out. 

Every single day we see Governors of New York, Ohio, Illinois, and California provide updates to their citizens with their teams. Obviously, some of those areas have been harder hit so far but it's clear that our situation here is going to get worse before it gets better. Right now, concise and honest information is absolutely critical and it is baffling and frightening that all of the information we are getting is from other states. 

I am not a native of Georgia but this has been my home for the past 4 years. I have always felt a sense of community here and it is clear that native born Georgians have an intense pride for their state.  I am very pleased to see how the communities and the people are banding together to help each other. I feel like the municipalities are doing everything they are able and local leaders are running themselves night and day to protect their citizens and enable everyone to do whatever it takes to stay afloat. 

But where is the State of Georgia? Where is the Governor? Where are the leaders of the state government and legislature?  Will it be too late by the time they decide it's appropriate to give daily briefings? 

I realize that counties and cities are responsible for handling things like the crowded parks, crowded Beltline, street racing idiots on major thoroughfares, non-essential businesses remaining open, and all of the things that at this point we KNOW are irresponsible and dangerous. But it matters when the state government steps in to say ""no more."" It carries weight (or at least should) when the most powerful people in the state provide leadership and guidance to its citizens. Unfortunately for all of us and more terrifyingly so for those in the most vulnerable of situations in Georgia, our government has been largely absent while its citizens continue to be infected at rapidly growing rate.

I have never felt like more of an outsider and abandoned by my government than I have for the past two weeks.",Atlanta,Where is our Governor?

With everything happening right now, there’s a part of me that’s concerned with the moving process and wondering if I should delay moving in. I’m in an apartment right now and can stay until April 30th - so packing and such has been slow bc in my mind, “I have time and I’m only down the road” (this of course was my thought before everything escalated). My concern is that the state will go on lockdown and it’ll be several months before I can move into the new house.

I’ve been inside for 2 weeks working from home, but today I had to handle a plumbing emergency and a fencing issue at 2 communities respectively, so I was forced to brave the outside world. In between appointments, I stopped to grab some drive thru and pulled into a clearly empty parking lot at a clearly closed outdoor store in Smyrna. I’ve had over an hour to kill and when I got here I noticed someone pull up, get out of their car, go to the door, stand there reading a sign, then walk back to their car and drive off. So now here I am, people watching, and counting how many of these morons are walking to this store and expecting it to be open. 

Since 11:45, I have witnessed 17 people pull up. Of those 17, 13 have gotten out of their cars and walked up to the door. Of those 13, 6 have gone to the other entrance to see if that side would open for them.

So I work at a restaurant and we have all been laid off since the 15th. Our owner/boss encouraged us all to file for unemployment and he filed on our behalf as well.

My claim has been approved and today was the first day i was suppose to be able to collect my benefits for the week ending in 3/24. I checked online and entered my SS and PIN to which it said $ was forwarded to my account. I opted for the direct deposit.

I still have not actually received any of that money yet. I went back to check that they had the correct account and routing numbers(which I had entered previously when i first filed). 

At first it showed that payment would be sent to the debit card they send to you if you request to be paid that way. I quickly reentered my bank info and insured that it was set up for direct deposit again.

I did not ask for a debit card nor have I received one. It said that the money was forwarded to my account but I have not received any of it yet. So the question is how long does it usually take to receive the direct deposit? Or is it possible that there was some mix up and it was sent to the debit card account which I didn't ask for?

I've called and left a few messages. They are understandably very busy right now. I was wondering if anyone could maybe shine some light on this problem for me or direct me to where I should ask this question?",Atlanta,Unemployment question

If you're one of the unlucky Atlantans with English Ivy running crazy around your house, spend a little time each day ripping some out from the ground.  It is a good all around workout and pulling it out versus trimming it is more effective in controlling it in the long term

Some tips:

For ivy growing up trees, cut the stems at the base of the tree. Leave the cut vines on the tree. They will fall off over time. Pulling them now may pull out bark, damaging the tree.

For a more permanent control, paint a little Roundup on freshly cut thick ivy roots. If possible, put Roundup on a cotton swab, and Saran wrap the root.

If you have kids, have a contest to see who can pull the longest continuous vine. Makes it more fun for them.

Use a landscape rake if you have pine straw and other debris that makes it hard to get to the vines close to the ground.

Throw vines away as leaving them on the ground may lead to rerooting.

The state of GA is requiring employers to file partial claims for unemployment benefits due to COVID-19. I have asked my general manager if the owner/ company has filed. He said something along the lines of, ""I think so."" When I went to sign in to the ""check my UI status/claim portal"" the gdol website said that my SSN didn't match their records. This implies that my employer has not actually filed like they are supposed to.

Should I go ahead and file for myself? Or should I wait to see if they actually will file? Will I be notified if my employer does file?

First off, let me get this out of the way: I did not come from a upper class wealthy family. I actually came from first generation immigrants started with $500 in their pockets. I am lucky enough to game the system. I understand currently it is a tough time and I hope all of your get through this economic burden especially to the people of local commerce.

Anyways, looking for some guidance here.

Info about me: I am currently a full time 9-5 private equity for a small and early fund in Atlanta making 60K a year with potential 10% bonus (not guaranteed) and 1% carried interest. I went to school with a military scholarship that ended up paying only up to my 3rd year due to no fault of my own. I owe 40k of student debt currently. I have thought about this for a while as I am getting fully acclimated to my main job and finally decided to pull the trigger.  I really don't mind the sweat and honest days of work and have a good attitude about it.

Relevant experience: Closest experience I've had was working part time at Best Buy as my first job and a bar staff as my second job.

Where to start? What are the part-time jobs to look for? What to avoid? What's not recommended? What have you done in my position? and most importantly, wheres the fun?

I rent from Havenbrook Homes and to seems they've completely avoided acknowledging the situation until yesterday AFTER rent was due. After about 8 emails of prying, I was finally asked to provide proof of my lack of work to get assistance. Even with that, they said they still expect rent paid by the 5th. So, if I pay, I would hate to find out that I was eligible for an extension or no late fees. 

It's concerning that they waited: 
1. Until the 3rd when rent is late after the 5th
2. Until I asked about it at least 3 times

Has anyone else experienced anything like this renting from a larger company vs. directly from a landlord? It seems like they are trying to minimize profit loss by only giving assistance to those who badger them. 

I contacted my property manager and her assistant for nearly 2 weeks before I got a reply.

I was just wondering if anyone could verify that Fulton county had less strict rules than Dekalb county. From my research it seems that way, but I just wanted someone with more knowledge to confirm.

Dekalb seems to say: 3 goats Max per acre of land and you must have 2 acres minimum to have any livestock 

Fulton seems to say: 150 sq feet per goat and it must be 150ft from any businesses or residence.


That's the gist I got when I read the ordinance. Can anyone confirm??

Long story short, 2 years ago working out one time I hurt my wrist. I did not let it heal and helped some friends move furniture. Ever since then, I've had a problem with my right wrist, and sometimes my left wrist. I always wear wrist wraps when I work out because I need to, now it hurts often in both wrists for normal day to day functions. 

For example, I am always cautious of using my hands now. Like getting out my car, picking up stuff in the house, picking up my back pack, shifting, etc. It has gotten to the point will I really need to get it checked out, I do not want to suffer with this when I get older. (I'm 22 and a male)

The pain is very weird in wrists, sometimes its the actual wrist bone that is sore, then sometimes my forearm tendons get sore and causes pain to radiate to the wrist. This makes me believe something may be wrong with a tendon, like a nerve or something. Any suggestions?",Atlanta,Anyone recommend a place to get my wrist pain checked out?
