The only time I've used satellite internet was way back in the day when EVERYONE was slow and the hint of rain meant you're cut off until it clears up. The only time I've used ATT was when I was in North Charleston and it was not reliable at all but the speed was good.


I work in technology so transferring 30-50 gig databases for work is pretty common but regardless of speed (within reason) reliable up time is more important.


I'm using Spectrum now and wired gets me 10 up and 230 down. Even wireless is ""good enough"" at 10 up and 30 down.

In my view, it was largely this issue that led to Trump being elected; he knew how to commiserate with those who'd been made redundant by technology and seemingly forgotten about. A speech he gave to a group of Carrier employees jumps to mind. In it, he promised sizable investment in their industry. As it turned out, Carrier used that investment to automate a great deal of their production, putting many of those employees out of work.

I've been to (stopped and spent time in) Greenville, but have only driven through Columbia when headed to the SC coast or Savannah.

I'm planning to move late spring. In choosing a state that offers easy access to mountains and beaches (under 4 hours for either), employment relevant to my experience and education, and a cost of living roughly comparable to where I am, I can't shake the feeling SC is the place.

About me- I'm 27/M. Have a bachelor's degree (business), several years of experience in the logistics/supply chain field, and am from a state more often classified ""southern"" than anything else. I may pursue a graduate degree later and SC appears to have great options.

I've been browsing job listings in both cities and the market seems similar to what I have available to me now. I'm not drawn to high population areas like Atlanta, but do appreciate mid-sized cities, so either appear to fit the bill in that regard.

I haven't ruled Charleston out but understand its location brings another set of traffic and housing issues. It's nice as a tourist, am sure being a resident is another ball game. It also seems the gap between salaries and cost of living is a bit narrower in Greenville and Columbia. Between the two, I'm all ears to hear local perspective on which is better for the following:

1. Amenities/events/personal enrichment (such as foreign language classes)
2. Unmarried people (I'll move alone)
3. General quality of life - would you name an obvious winner?

If there's a compelling reason I should equally consider Charleston, I'd love to know. Because of Greenville's closer distance to mountains and being within 4 hours of Knoxville, Asheville, and the coast, it's pulling ahead right now. I want to be sure I'm fully informed in my thinking.

Good, bad, ugly - that's what I'm after.

It’s been several days of searching and reading and me and the fiancé are longing for more personal accounts. Not just what you can read on trip advisor or the cities home page on the internet. We are looking for real perspective.

We are planning to move to SC in the late spring to early summer. Our deliberation has left us to choosing a state that offers easy access to mountains and beaches (under 4 hours for either), employment relevant to our experience and education, and a cost of living roughly comparable to where we are now. We have always had a desire to travel to SC, but are looking to move there to experience it for ourselves. 
It also helps that many close friends of ours all highly recommend the Carolinas (more so SC). 

About us. My fiancé has a Masters degree in Public Administration &amp; Policy. She’s held her same job now for the last 4 years. I’m currently in school, but will soon finish with a DVM. 

I've been looking into different clinics in both cities and the market seems similar. I'm not drawn to high population areas like Charleston, but do appreciate mid-sized cities with opportunity to travel into nearby larger cities. Hence why Irmo and Aiken are on our radars. 

We are looking for perspective on the benefits of living close to Augusta and Columbia, but I’m also nervous to experience the larger cities. However, I'm all ears to hear what the locals have to say on which is better for the following:

1. Amenities/events/culture (such as art festivals, thriving downtowns, and small town vibes)
2. Growth of the city (not necessarily in size but in progressive ideologies such as wanting to see the city develop and change instead of remaining stagnant)
3. Ability to own land / potential acreage for livestock. 
4. General quality of life - would you name an obvious winner or loser? 

We would love to hear all sides of the story as well as other locations that may fit my “criteria” described above. If there's a compelling reason why we should consider another town, we would love to know.

I know an okay amount about U.S. state politics; primaries are held to determine which delegates are able to run as senators or whatnot, and from the research I've gathered South Carolina uses an open primary system, meaning registered voters can vote for whoever they please, correct?

Did you know that a landlord can refuse to renew your lease for no reason. Doesn’t matter how long you have been there or if you always paid your rent on time. I didn’t.

I thought I lived in the United States of America and the right to complain is as American as apple pie. But not in River Ridge. River Ridge is now little Russia. People are afraid to say anything. My old neighbors are terrified that they will be next. 

So am I next? I don’t care because I am moving anyway. She had a heart attack because of all this stress. Wasn’t there a more adult way to handing this? Couldn’t you have just talked to her and given her some warning before kicking her our of her home. Who is next? What is happening to Asheville?

Now we visited my Wife's side of the family a year ago in Conway enjoyed the area. People are friendly in SC and the area is clean/new. Brought back memories from my childhood of summers at my grandparents in Lexington area.

Now my Wife and I both work in healthcare. Wife is an LPN and I am mental health worker/EMT. Any recommendations on areas where you find an abundance of 2bdrm rents for $1200 or less? Think Lexington/Irmo is a good start?

Social security and Medicare are both socialist. 

Your idea of pay first and I get better care is unfounded not to mention morally and ethically wrong. You don't buy lives.

2. Healthcare. 

I really love paying 600 for a bottle of insulin to stay alive. Don't you? 

It's not like every other first world countries made it work or anything. Most Nordic countties are socialist. Highest on the chart for quality of life and lifestyle options. Whereas we're the richest country and feed billionaires. Fucking ass backwards. 

3. The current presidents a fucking joke. 

Orange overgrown manchild whose dossier of accomplishments are predatory allegations, gross abuse of governmental power, high treason at the highest levels of government, fascist tendencies, idolizing dictatorial regimes as friends while isolating our closest allies, openly calling for foreign interference and Holy shit an entire encyclopedia of shit beyond this. 

Really that wasn't enough for you? Are you actually brain dead?

6. Trump family are grotesque human beings

Trophy hunting, shady deals, obvious Russia ties. For the dumbass that says the Mueller report failed and he wasn't impeached.... 

Wow you're dumb. The Mueller report wasn't meant to charge the president. 

The only reason he's not in jail is you quite literally can't throw the current sitting president in jail. 

It also helps the entire republican party is commiting gross abuse of power and turning a democracy into a fascist government. 

Supporting this is quite literally saying I value party over country. That's by definition fascism. Go back to school.

451,hbi01R,1582864176,fap4c3,Nan,"So, I graduated from high school last year and it's time to finally get things rolling. I want to enter the workforce instead of going to college as i'm definitely not getting a full ride anywhere or enough money in scholarships to make it financially viable (at least in my mind. I really don't want to be one of the millions of Americans with crippling debt 10-20 years after they graduated. High Schools Pushing college on students seems like a scare tactic, or someone with a useless degree telling you how important it is to go to school and have a useless degree)

Before I graduated, I got a CompTIA A+ certification. I have zero employment history in the field and have only worked one other legit job in high school (restaurant). I was led to believe that this certification would make me very desirable as an entry level employee coming straight out of high school. Also, I feel that a fresh high school graduate would rarely have a decent IT cert as I was one of two people in that year to have passed the exam. I've looked at Indeed daily for the past 2-3 weeks, applied to about 7 jobs marked as ""entry level"". No luck. Only one response 15 minutes after I sent the application to say that I didn't qualify for the position of IT Intern/Apprentice. Something that really bothers me is that on that job website, half of the things marked as ""entry level"" still have a minimum requirement of having 1-2 years of experience.(I haven't bothered with those)

I guess overall i'm pretty discouraged at this point. The capital of tech. business growth in South Carolina doesn't seem to be nearly as competitive as I thought. I've started to consider setting up employment and moving back to San Diego where there is a more rich bank of opportunity available.  Maybe being a slave to the college industry is the only way to get into a decent career these days. I just want to get my foot in the door and gain the experience to move onto bigger positions. Does anyone have tips for finding an entry level position somewhere, or am I being worrisome and impatient?",southcarolina,Trouble finding IT job in West Columbia area. Am I doing this wrong?

We are academic researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and would like to invite you to **participate in our research study in return for scientifically valid personality feedback.**

In the last few decades, psychologists have rigorously developed empirical tests that assess the core aspects of personality**. You will receive scientifically valid feedback about your personality after taking this short survey (less than 5 minutes).** The feedback will be customized to your responses using the scores of thousands of people who have participated so far.

The test is non-commercial, entirely free, and as anonymous as possible. And, you will have our gratitude—this research is not possible without the help of people like you!

**Survey Link:** [**Here**](https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIN4BFvn94TPzOB?Group=southcarolina)

\*As a quick aside, we know that there are communities for survey-takers (e.g., /r/SampleSize); however, sampling only groups that are designed for survey-takers would introduce sampling bias and threaten the validity of any results.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like, this is all part of life

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

Bonus rule

Try to remember the lessons of past.

According to the alert, Isabella and Audrianna Blanchard were last seen with Neely Blanchard last week.

Kentucky State Police say Neely Blanchard does not have custody of the girls. Their grandmother is their legal guardian.

Police say Neely visited the twins on Friday, March 20 at the grandmother's home.

Neely took the girls to a friend's home in Dawson Springs, Ky., but did not take them back to their grandmother's home.

Neely has not been seen or heard from since Monday, March 23.

The girls were last seen wearing pajamas but may have changed clothes.

The girl's grandmother, Susan Blanchard, believes Neely may be headed to South Carolina where Neely's 11-year-old daughter lives with her grandmother.

Police say Neely, 33, has a history of mental illness that is made worse by the coronavirus pandemic.

Police believe Neely has a handgun.

I've seen some on here that seem to have a good understanding of the proposed stimulus bill, so I figured I'll ask here.

My wife is a teacher on hourly wages for a preschool tied to a church that has been closed now for it's second week. I'm not an expert on these things, but I was not surprised when the UI claim was denied as certain non-profits, especially those tied to religious based organizations, are exempt from UI.

I've read articles about the stimulus bill including UI benefit payment for self-employed, but I haven't see anything related to this. I read [this](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/thought-leadership/self-insured-nonprofits-and-unemployment-insurance) article and underneath ""Who is Covered?"" seems to indicate that a federal relief package such as this may benefit her and her coworkers. Has anyone reviewed the bill and has any information on this detail?

Also, a commentor on my original post led me to [this](http://kentuckytoday.com/stories/church-child-care-workers-among-eligible-for-unemployment,25078) article where Kentucky made church child-care workers eligible for UI.

716,Jelfff,1585341033,fq517w,discussion,"Here is an interactive COVID-19 map I produce as a **public service**.  Data for the map comes directly from the same GIS (Geographic Information System) server that feeds the map produced by Johns Hopkins University.  The team at Johns Hopkins updates the data multiple times during the day.  Each time you open the map or click on a symbol, you will see the most recent data that is hosted on the GIS server.

The map has **multiple GIS overlays** that you can turn on/off/restack.  For the USA there is one overlay that shows **cases** by county and a different overlay that shows **deaths** by county.  Other overlays show cases and deaths in the USA by state, for Canada by province and for the rest of the world by country.

When the map opens, the overlay layer showing COVID-19 cases by county is displayed.  If you zoom in several steps then you should see county boundary lines.  If those lines do not appear then the federal GIS server hosting that data is likely too busy.

Looking for the legend?  Need help?  Please read the **""Map tips""** \- link in upper left corner. 

If you take a moment to read the ""Map tips"" then you can learn (1) how to make your own custom map links, (2) how to make any overlay clickable and (3) learn more about the data the map can display.

There are people working on developing a GIS layer that will have authoritative data on the state/county/city “stay home” orders that have been issued.  When that GIS layer becomes available, then I will add it to this map.

Finally, by using a small yellow dot to show counties with 1 case and a small magenta dot to show counties with 2-9 cases, the map shows counties where the virus is just starting to get a toehold.  Hopefully extra  care can be taken in those areas to help prevent a fast increase in the number of cases.  Doing so will help to flatten the curve.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

 Carolina Country Music Fest will be postponed until September, organizers confirmed Wednesday. The four-day event was slated to take over South Carolina’s Myrtle Beach June 4-7 but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will now take place September 17-20.

“We are grateful for the collaboration from all involved who have worked with us tirelessly to reschedule CCMF for September,” festival president Bob Durkin said in a [**statement**](https://carolinacountrymusicfest.com/rescheduled/). “Working to move this year’s festival to the fall was uncharted territory for all involved, including artists, their management, local government officials and the Myrtle Beach community. We appreciate everyone’s flexibility and we are excited that we will still be able to have CCMF this year.“

Headliners Darius Rucker, Luke Combs, Eric Church and Jake Owen are confirmed for the new fall dates. However, the lineup will see a few changes.

The state released [more finer-grained data on cases per zip code](https://www.scdhec.gov/sites/default/files/media/document/Covid%20Zip%20Analysis%204_3_2020%20No%20Estimates_0.pdf).  Previously this was only available at the county level.

I'm guessing that this more fine-grained data on hotspots is now available since the virus has spread to all counties, and it's no longer practical to simply avoid visiting a county.

* [Total count of tests performed in private labs](https://www.scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/testing-sc-data-covid-19) is now available

The state has now released data about the number of tests performed in private labs.  Previously only the data about tests performed in private labs was publicized.

This is probably in part thanks to news articles which ranked SC very low (48th in the nation) in terms of per-capita testing.  This new data  is good news, since prior to this SC was only publishing that it had tested 6,995 people, which works out to only about 1 in every 1000 persons (about 1.34 / 1000 to be more exact).  **[As of today, the total number of people tested is now known to be 18,097](https://www.scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/testing-sc-data-covid-19)**, which works out to about 3 in every 1000 persons (3.47 / 1000 to be more exact).  This puts SC slightly ahead of NC, but still falling short of our neighbors in TN and GA.

* **SC**
  * Population: 5,210,095
  * Total Tested (negative and positive combined): 18,097 
  * Per capita total tested: 3.47 per 1000 people

* **NC**
  * Population: 10,611,862
  * Total Tested: 31,598
  * Per capita: 2.98 per 1000 people

* **TN**

  * Total Tested: 37,839
  * Per capita: 5.49 per 1000 people

* **GA**

I’ve googled and called unemployment but can’t get anyone to answer so thought I’d ask here to see if anyone can offer me some help or insight. 

I’ve been working abroad about 4 years, each time on a 9 month contract for the school year. Our schools have been off since February so I ended up having to come back to SC to wait out the situation and because we have no work there and I wasn’t getting paid. Am I able to file for unemployment while I’m in South Carolina? I’m a permanent resident here, but I haven’t had any work (in the US) this past year for taxes  (but I pay taxes overseas where I live). I did get hired recently for online teaching(Chinese company) which I would be paying taxes towards but realistically I won’t have hours for that for another month or so. When I googled it seemed I don’t qualify since I don’t have a US employer, but when my brother filed he said they don’t ask any type of tax ID number for his employer, etc so maybe they aren’t requiring all of the steps right now due to the situation. I’m going to have to stay here for a while due to the travel restrictions but with this virus I’m not able to find work, obviously.
