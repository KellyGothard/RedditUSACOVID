I was emailed today saying my score is 85. That was it, there was literally no other information anywhere that I can find. The score is valid only for that one specific job posting. It was based on questions I answered when applying. Just general questions about my experience in an office and creating documents and reports and the like. 

Does anyone know what a score of 85 means? Is it good? Did I fail? Can I expect an interview?

28,28,austin-coverthisnews,1577979557,eizq9f,Nan,"Hello again /r/pennsylvania  I'm back with another local news post! This time instead of town halls it's parking, specifically: [How much money did West Chester Borough raise in 2019 in parking tickets? How much came from West Chester University?](https://coverthis.news/campaigns/how-much-money-did-west-chester-borough-raise-in-2019-in-parking-tickets-how-much-came-from-west-chester-universitys-campus-and-the-immediate-surrounding-area/) 

So, what I want from all of you is simple. First off, do you live near/around Chester County? How has parking been in West Chester for you? Would the information we want to obtain about West Chester parking be useful to you? What if I told you we want to try to make some kind of interactive map of all the ""worst"" places to park in West Chester? Also, even if you don't live here, is this a story you'd like to see done for your area of PA? We could always expand our scope depending on how many backers we get! 

And also, besides all that, I just want to hear some personal anecdotes, complaints, possible changes, specific spots, etc. anything and everything you think I should know. Whether you lived here for your whole life or you just passed through and got ticketed, I want to hear from you! Consider this a little survey leading up to a bit of an ask (:

All I'm asking of all of you here today is to check out our sponsored story and become a backer of it if you think it's news that needs to be made! We had 17 PA residents back our town hall story and now we're making our representatives address their failure to properly meet with their constituents, the same can and will be true of the West Chester Borough Parking Authority once we reach our goal. So, if you'd like to see West Chester have a better parking situation in the next decade than we've had in the last, this is the story I'd highly suggest you back.

And if not, please feel free to still share your thoughts and feedback, we're a new startup but we're made up of people who have lived in this community for years (in some cases their whole lives) we care about what goes on here and are here for the community good. To get covered what wouldn't be covered otherwise. Thank you for your time, I hope everyone had an amazing New Year, looking forward to see what sort of stories you'd like to see on [https://coverthis.news/](https://coverthis.news/) and what you think of West Chester's parking situation.",Pennsylvania,Do you live in/near Chester County?

Our first, WEIRD FICTION, getting picked up by Wild Eye Releasing and our second, SPINE CHILLER, which got picked up by Scream Team Releasing.

We've had so many people take part in helping us with our film funds which with the last two films helped with theater screenings, making merchandise and more.

Our next film which we are filming at the very moment is CREATURE IN THE DARK. It is very exciting to me because this is our first full length film. Not an anthology, an actual full length. Another reason I am so excited is the main cast consists of myself, my wife and our one year old daughter.

The synopsis is this: On New Years Eve the sun disappears. The next day creatures begin showing up that are attracted to light, forcing people to live in the dark if they hope to survive. We follow River, a man who is on the search for his missing wife, meanwhile dealing with what it means to be a good father to his daughter.

With this indiegogo, you are helping us with the funds to get everything we need to make the creature, and everything else such as theater screenings and merchandise but for our first time we are going to try to bring this to film festivals once it is finished.

Below is a link to our indiegogo. If you feel like contributing, that's great and we thank you or if you know of someone who would be interested that's amazing too.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you have any questions I can answer them below.

Okay so basically last week I was heading home from a friends house in an Uber around 12:30am. I had been drinking, not a crazy amount but enough to be noticeably drunk after a bit of conversation. In general I have an easily upset stomach, and will often puke randomly without drinking(although I will admit the drink did not help), and I ended up puking in the back of the Uber, getting it all into a plastic bag. The lady then said she was uncomfortable finishing the drive which I understood, and I offered to be let out at the next parking lot. She ended up stopping on the side of the road right after a stoplight, and right as I‚Äôm going to get out, 2 cops pull up. I was asked to stand by their car talking to one while the other talked to my driver. I immediately asked if I could call another Uber, which they allowed, so I was talking to them for about 10 minutes. The officer mentioned I sounded a little drunk, and I admitted to having a drink or two as I figured they would field test me anyway and it would make it worse to lie. This was while he was taking down my info-name, phone, address, etc.. They looked me up on the computer while we waited for my ride, and when my ride came the one said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôll probably be receiving an underage drinking citation‚Äù. I said I understand thank you officer then got in my Uber and left. My question is what penalties will this situation likely carry? I‚Äôve researched online but gotten mixed messages. I feel like I was respectful and easy to deal with which I hope will help but I‚Äôm not sure as I‚Äôm not familiar with pa law.",Pennsylvania,Underaged drinking citation

One map shows all the states and **U.S. House of Representatives** districts with semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  You can turn that data off and turn on other data that shows semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the **U.S. Senators**.  I was surprised to see how many states have senators from different parties.

There is also one map for each state that can show the state legislature lower chamber and upper chamber.  For 16 states, including **Pennsylvania**, the maps can display semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  (I will work on contacting the other states and request they improve their data so I can color their maps.)

All of this political district boundary data is hosted on various government GIS (Geographic Information System) servers.  The maps are displayed by **GISsurfer** which is a general purpose web map I developed.  Each map has a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with general information to help you get the most benefit from the map.

For the maps with semi-transparent fill, an intriguing thing to do is turn on more than one fill overlay.  For example, turn all overlays off then turn on state house fill, congress fill, congress black line.  **You might see that some areas get more blue, some get more red and some areas become purple.**

If you have trouble figuring out how to turns overlay layers on/off and restack them, then please read the **""Map tips""**.

If you want to know exactly where data for a particular map is coming from, then notice that each map link includes an address that points to a txt file.  Copy \*just\* that txt file address, paste it into a browser bar and hit enter.  That file has the addresses for the GIS layers the map can display.

Here is the link to the web page with the political district map links.

I recently lost my job because my company went under and due to some really bad luck with rainy days I'm really low on my savings. I'm a young adult so I wasn't getting paid very much in the first place so it's not like I ever had a ton to begin with but...it's bad now. Am in the process of filling for unemployment but apparently it takes quite a while to hear back from what I've heard.

‚Äã

I owe rent to my landlord for my room I rent out in a couple days. It's $600 and I pawned my PC recently for $200 but don't really have any other assets I can pawn out I also don't really have anyone I can turn to. I'm a bit of an introvert and I haven't spoken with my family in a while because they're pretty...toxic. Very racist, very negative, the kind of people who will step on people to get their way. Mom is basically a big Karen. And it's not even so much about I can't stand them it's just the bridge has been totally burnt.

‚Äã

So, I'm going to be homeless soon. I haven't lived in this place very long so I don't have a leg to stand on with making him give me an eviction notice...not that I would want to, that's just a dick move. He's not willing tow ork with me because he has 4 rooms he rents out in his house, and he uses them to pay his mortgage so he can't afford to lose a months of payment, which It otally understand. It's just not possible for me to come up wtih it. Between my Paypal, Venmo, Bank account and Real world wallet I have $22.53 combined.

‚Äã

So...basically, I'm going to be homeless. I've never been homeless since I was a child and I didn't think it would ever happen to me as an adult but...here we are. I'd be lying to you if I didn't say I was having panic attacks and feel like I'm going to pass out at any moment.

‚Äã

I got new employment lined up, but it's going to be 2 weeks before I can take the position. (I'm a junior tradesman who specilizes in Waterjet) but suffice to say I am going to be homeless. It would take a miracle to save me from it. I need advice on here I can go, what I can do, from other people put in this situation.

Looking at PennDot's website, I see you need the following to get a Real ID

Birth Certificate or Passport. I have that covered.

Two forms of proof of current address. I have my vehicle registration and insurance card, so all good there.

**Proof of Social Security number:** Social Security card. 

There's my problem. I lost my SS card at least 15 years ago. I thought I would have to replace it, so I went to [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov) and the Social Security Administration says:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 **Note:** For REAL ID document purposes, you may not need a Social Security number (SSN) card as proof of an SSN. Instead, a recent pay stub, W-2 (wage and tax statement), SSA-1099 (Social Security Benefit Statement) or other tax documents showing your full name and entire SSN may be acceptable proof of your SSN.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I thought to post here since it seems like a state specific thing, but I'd love a recommendation to another sub if it means a better answer. 

So, the property is this adorable updated duplex in a small borough near Harrisburg. It's got pretty much everything my fiance and I are looking for, and both halves are for sale (yay rental income!). The one thing I've spotted so far that I'm not liking it a handicapped parking space - smack in front of our would-be front door. Now, there are two possibilities - either it's for the tenant who's currently renting the other half of the house, in which case I have no issues with it and will go out of my way to make sure they have access to it. The other possibility is that the tenant doesn't have a placard. Since neither of us have one either, it would be a bit of an inconvenience to have it where it is, and here lies the crux of my question - if it turns out the space is not really useful for anyone, is there anything I can do to get the space removed? 

Again, I'm not trying to screw anyone out of their parking space and I 100% intend to do my due diligence to find out who the space is for and if that person uses it, I'm purely curious at this point.

&gt;*We‚Äôve been lobbying against this bill for months, and are so close to lining up enough votes to block it. If we can generate hundreds of constituent emails into every single office, we can stop it.

Believe me, you do ***not*** want an expanded petrochemical industry in PA. These plants are often called ""superpolluters"" because **when operating** ***properly*****, a single plant will emit HUNDREDS OF TONS of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other carcinogens every year.** Petrochemical plants are so inherently dangerous to human health that the area surrounding these plants in Louisiana has earned the infamous nickname [‚ÄúCancer Alley.‚Äù](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/louisiana-cancer-alley-getting-more-toxic-905534/)

**Petrochemical plants are also a ""carbon bomb"" for the climate crisis.** Because each new petrochemical plant emit as much greenhouse gases annually as nearly a half million cars, **scientists have warned that these plants are** [**‚Äúpoised to be the next big carbon superpolluters‚Äù**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/plastics-plants-are-poised-to-be-the-next-big-carbon-superpolluters/) **which will lock in ""dangerous levels‚Äù of greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come,** ***even if the energy sector decarbonizes.*** 

It is critical for us to speak out against this bill before it's too late. You can use the link provided by Conservation Voters of PA to submit a quick message, or if you prefer a more personalized approach, I like using [**Resistbot**](https://resist.bot/) \-- it's a great tool that automatically routes your messages to your legislators and can help you call them (just use the command ""state"").

460,460,meinkampfortzone,1581093156,f0cw7r,Nan,"Thank you for contacting me about the impeachment of President Trump. I appreciate hearing from you.

In 1999, then-Senator Joe Biden posed the following question when he voted against removing President Bill Clinton from office: ""\[D\]o these actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors necessary to justify the most obviously antidemocratic act the Senate can engage in-overturning an election by convicting the president?"" It is this constitutionally grounded framework that guided my review of President Trump's impeachment and, ultimately, my decision to join a majority of Senators in opposing his removal from office.

The Constitution gives the Senate ""the sole Power to try all Impeachments."" I took this duty during the three week trial of President Trump very seriously. I carefully studied the information presented during the trial, which included video testimony from 13 witnesses, over 28,000 pages of documents (including the House testimony of 17 witnesses), and more than 30 hours of presentations from the House Managers and President's counsel. The Senate is not required to hear from live witnesses (it did not do so in several prior trials), nor in this case was it necessary. As Vice President Biden explained during President Clinton's impeachment, the Senate's ""constitutional role as a sole trier of impeachment does not require it to take new evidence or hear live witness testimony.""

The president's actions were not ""perfect."" Some were inappropriate. But the question for the Senate was not whether his actions were perfect, but if they constituted impeachable offenses that justified removing a president for the first time and forbidding him from ever holding office.

House Democrats alleged that President Trump briefly paused aid, and withheld a White House meeting with Ukraine's president, to pressure Ukraine into investigating publicly-reported corruption matters. When House Democrats demanded witnesses and documents concerning the president's conduct, he invoked constitutional rights. This resistance to their demands was the basis for the article of obstruction.

House Democrats alleged the president lacked ""lawful cause or excuse"" to resist their subpoenas. This ignores that his resistance was based on constitutionally grounded legal defenses and immunities that are consistent with longstanding positions taken by administrations of both parties. Instead of negotiating a resolution or litigating in court, House Democrats rushed to impeach.

But as House Democrats noted during President Clinton's impeachment, a president's defense of his legal and constitutional rights and responsibilities is not an impeachable offense.

House Democrats separately alleged President Trump abused his power by conditioning a White House meeting, and the release of aid, on Ukraine agreeing to pursue corruption investigations. Their case rested entirely on the faulty claim that the only possible motive for his actions was his personal political gain. In fact, there are also legitimate national interests for seeking investigations into apparent corruption, especially when taxpayer dollars are involved.

Even if House Democrats' presumptions about President Trump's motives are true, additional witnesses in the Senate, beyond the 17 who testified in the House, were unnecessary because the president's actions did not rise to the level of removing him from office. Nor did they warrant the societal upheaval that would occur with his removal from office and the ballot months before an election. Our country is already far too divided and this would have only made matters worse.

As Vice President Biden also stated during President Clinton's impeachment trial, ""the Constitution sets the bar for impeachment very high."" A president can only be impeached and removed for ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" While there's debate about the precise meaning of this phrase, it's clear that impeachable conduct must be comparable to the serious offenses of treason and bribery.

The Constitution sets the impeachment bar so high for good reasons. Removing a president from office, and forbidding him from seeking future office, overturns the results of the last election and denies Americans the right to vote for him in the next one. The Senate's impeachment power essentially allows 67 senators to substitute their judgment for that of millions of Americans.

Vice President Biden's framework for judging an impeachment was right then and it is right now. President Trump's conduct did not meet the very high bar required to justify overturning the election, removing him from office, and kicking him off the ballot in an election that has already begun. In November, the American people will decide for themselves whether President Trump should stay in office. In our democratic system, that's the way it should be. It is my hope that Congress can now move past this extremely partisan and divisive episode and get back to working on issues that will strengthen our economy and make our communities safer.

Thank you again for your correspondence. Do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of assistance.

Sincerely,

Pat Toomey  
U.S. Senator, Pennsylvania  


I recall Toomey stating:

Toomey studied all of the evidence carefully but wanted the trial to end as quickly as possible? Give me a break. He already knew how he was going to vote. His questions during the trial that he signed on to were non-progressive anyway and did not bring any new information into light. Take his response as you will, but I personally believe his views and responses are BS and not conducive to the state of Pennsylvania.",Pennsylvania,I sent an email to Toomey saying how disappointed I am in him on voting nay for tabling additional evidence and testimony during the Senate Impeachment trial.

He's filling out the Foreign Registration Statement (link below), and it asks for either the ""address of the association‚Äôs proposed registered office in this Commonwealth"" or the name of the association's Commercial 
Registered Office Provider. Dad's trying to save some money (he says it's about $100/year to go through a CROP), and asked if he could use my address. 

I've lived in PA for several years, and own a house here. I'm fine with my dad's request if it just means I get his mail and scan it to him. But would the state think I was running a business out of my home? Would I be required to pay fees or extra taxes? Are there any other consequences I'm not thinking of?

If there‚Äôs no open space near the entrance to a Wawa, they just simply invent their own parking space next to the dumpster or side door and narrow the thru-way for any cars to pass or exit off the property. And when they do need to park it always to be backing in holding everyone else waiting to park or get out. And they don‚Äôt mind parking over the lines that way you can‚Äôt get into your car.

I get there and no one is beside me when I park, but as soon as I exit there‚Äôs two big pickups parked right next to me on each side. And one of the sides isn‚Äôt a parking spot.

It‚Äôs not really intended for a lazy person. 

When it comes turning onto a road from an adjacent driveway or road, they don‚Äôt bother to yield at all, they drive their truck onto the road regardless the oncoming traffic.

We're currently in the Rockville/Germantown area of MD so we're used to high taxes, high house prices, and high property taxes. But I'm very confused on how property taxes work in PA due to the school taxes. Here in MD, you file a State Tax return for your income and you have a Property Tax bill you pay at the end of the year. Do you have several separate bills in PA? 

My brother in law said he pays over 12k in property taxes due to school taxes on a town-home worth 338k (assessed at 238k). That just sounds insanely high. When I found some tax estimate websites, it shows it more like 1.2k so I'm thinking he mispoke? I used this site and it showed about $1,100 for his place: http://www2.county.allegheny.pa.us/

When i google a bit, it seems he could be anywhere from 3k to 5k total.

I'm just trying to see if there's a way I can get an accurate picture of what housing actually costs. It's odd to me that they would frame the school tax as part of your property tax but then not actually show it on the property tax bill. If you can share links of sites that give better examples, or if you can share examples, I'd appreciate it.

For comparison, my current town-home was purchased several years ago at $235k, is assessed now at $233k, and has a property tax of 2k.",Pennsylvania,Property Tax Estimates

Just wanted to plug a new subreddit project that I think would be of interest. It's called /r/PennsylvaniaLaw and it's focused on developments regarding change and going-ons with laws and legislative efforts in the Commonwealth.

This will be a great forum to alert people of things that will be coming in effect soon so they might prepare themselves but also to bring awareness of bills that might need activism to stop or promote that bill. It is also the entire of this project to promote discourse and provide a platform for information and learning. It would also be rather neat if local state congresspeople got involved as well.

621,621,Bethlehem_Dame,1582153870,f6j9zr,Nan,"On January 22, 1987, after having been convicted of corruption, Pennsylvania State Treasurer Robert Budd Dwyer held a press conference. A resignation was expected by many, but the press conference ended with a dark surprise ‚Äì Dwyer's public suicide.

The 2010 documentary *Honest Man* attempted to provide more context to Dwyer‚Äôs character and conviction. The title suggests that Dwyer's conviction was wrongful, but the film did a pathetically weak job making that case.

The facts of the case were mostly ignored in the film. The evidence presented against Dwyer was completely written shorthand. The film vaguely mentioned two pieces of ""evidence."" (1) Notes on Torquato‚Äôs computer alleging his intent to bribe the Treasury. (2) The fact that Bill Smith changed testimony about offering Dwyer the kickback.

I‚Äôm not sure Torquato‚Äôs notes were even admitted as evidence in court. They were found when the FBI raided Torquato, at which point, a magistrate judge had already issued a search warrant, the contents of which were completely glossed over.

The film laid out absolutely zero facts about how Computer Technology Associates (CTA) was selected for its contract with the Treasury. Many accounting firms wanted the job of calculating the state's FICA reimbursements. *How and why was CTA ‚Äì a firm all the way on the West Coast ‚Äì vetted or selected?*

At 26:19, the film insinuates that Dwyer was just a naive bumpkin from Meadville who ""didn't know what he was walking into."" That is preposterously stupid. A several million dollar contract with a company in California was coincidentally signed because the State Treasurer didn't know any better. That notion is pathetically stupid. The contract obviously has more backstory.

I highly doubt the confusing mystery of CTA‚Äôs contract was not presented to the jury to consider. The film attempted to discredit the jurors as too uneducated to understand such a complicated case.

Ample time is spent interviewing Dwyer's friends and family. I can sympathize with Dwyer's family, but their perspectives are obviously biased and do not vindicate Dwyer. History has shown several instances of otherwise honest individuals failing to turn down remarkably large sums of money in return for a quid pro quo. I do not know if this happened with Dwyer, but hearing his friend's and family say how he would never do such a thing is not convincing.

Most people do not know the facts of the case. This documentary was a rare opportunity for Dwyer's defenders to lay out the facts explaining why the conviction was wrong. It instead focused on how people feel about the case, and said nothing about the actual prosecution.",Pennsylvania,Honest Man does a terrible job attempting to clear Robert Budd Dwyer's name.

About 6 years ago I had 2 overdoses while at home in the span of a few months and PennDot suspended my license for this. I was unaware until recently as I have long since moved on with my life and moved across the country. 

I had requested and received a Substance Use Form from PennDot this past week, however I am a little unclear on a few things. It is a very short form and only has 6 questions.

First, here are the questions:

1- How long have you been seeing the patient?

2- Does this patient use any drug or substance, including alcohol , known to impair driving skills or functions?

3-In your opinion, does this patient abuse any drug or substance?

4-Does this patient take any medication  to control substance abuse?

5-Does this patient require treatment and/or counseling for substance abuse?

6-In you opinion, does the individual's substance use impair his/her ability to drive?

Has anyone completed this before? I have been clean for years and don't use any medications or drugs at all. I am a little unclear on how I can prove this to a doctor. Can they do a hair test or do you believe I will need to see a doctor repeatedly for a stretch of time and take multiple drug tests? I have no problem doing this other than that I desperately need my license for work and don't know if I can get it renewed after a visit or two, or if I will be seeing a doctor for months to have them sign off on the form. 

Any experience or knowledge is super appreciated. Thanks!",Pennsylvania,PennDot Medical Suspension on License

770,770,ajpa6,1583025719,fbmlqy,Nan,"Hello everyone. I'm wondering if any of you have any experience or knowledge about removing a suspension on your license due to substance use?

About 6 years ago, I had 2 overdoses while at home in the span of a few months and PennDot suspended my license. I was unaware until recently as I have long since moved away and never had any DMV say anything.

About 2 weeks ago I realized my license was about to expire. I went to renew my license in the state I am currently living in when I was made aware of the suspension. I was told that I was also suspended here and that I could not renew my license until I resolve the suspension in PA. My office is about a 25-minute drive away and I have no public transportation available so my license is very important.

The necessary form to release the suspension is called the Substance Use Form from PennDot. I have requested and received one, however, I am a little unclear on the length of the process and which type of doctor to contact. It is a very short form and only has 6 questions for a doctor and then requires their signature. Then PennDot will review the form and decide to remove the suspension or not.

Here are the questions:

1- How long have you been seeing the patient?

2- Does this patient use any drug or substance, including alcohol, known to impair driving skills or functions?

3-In your opinion, does this patient abuse any drug or substance?

4-Does this patient take any medication to control substance abuse?

5-Does this patient require treatment and/or counseling for substance abuse?

6-In your opinion, does the individual's substance use impair his/her ability to drive?

Now, I have been clean for a long time with no overdoses, 0 police interaction, and 0 legal trouble since this occurred. I don't use any medications or drugs at all now.

Also, I don't know which type of doctor to contact and the only doctor I use has told me that their office doesn't do this type of thing.

Due to the nature of the first question, I believe a simple drug test may not be enough. I am a little unclear on how I can prove this to a doctor to sign off on it in a short amount of time, while also having it be sufficient for the reviewer at PennDot. I believe I will need to see a doctor repeatedly for a stretch of time and take multiple drug tests. I have no problem doing this other than that I desperately need my license for work and don't know if I can get it renewed after a visit or two, or if I will need to see a doctor for months to have them sign off on the form and make it sufficient for PennDot.

Has anyone gone through this before? Any experience or knowledge about which type of doctor to contact or the length of the process is super appreciated. Thanks!",Pennsylvania,PennDot License Suspension due to Substance Use.

My job site has a physical security plan and security department so there are cameras places which we can see, are told about and know about. At certain points I k know I'm on camera, that footage can be seen in real time by Security or reviewed by corporate. But, I just found a hidden camera. This camera and that system is NOT part of the physical security plan and we employees are NOT told about it.

How is ""expectation of privacy"" interpreted in PA? I expect that I am on camera when I am in an area where I've been told I'm on camera. I do not expect to be recorded secretely or by spy-cams in wall clocks. Again, to me the crux of this issue is that the clock camera is a hidden camera which is not part of the security plan.

I am Union and I will take this up with my Pres in person when I go back to work. But, this Local is quite a pushover to be honest. I would like to know what kind of legal precedent or situation this can fall under before I even start to speak about it. Thank you!",Pennsylvania,Can an employer watch me on a hidden camera without telling me?

* The testing process was mentioned briefly, that a doctor can contact them and request to do a test. I found this to be odd and worrisome. They didn't say what their criteria was to give the go-ahead to do a test, but shouldn't anyone with symptoms be tested? Why is there a need to call the state?

16 cases as of this afternoon, latest is resident of Monroe county. They were in contact with a known patient.

They provided a few more numbers today than previous:

* 173 identified for testing

* 100 negative

* 14 presumptive positive

* 2 confirmed by CDC

* 1 individual from another state (positive, not included in state totals)

* 57 pending (testing is in progress)

Plans for policies are being considered once community spread has been detected, but mitigation efforts such as cancelling group events are supported, but not mandated at this time.  

Reporters asked about how the tests are done, and they gave an excellent answer: ""machines and chemicals"" (not a direct quote, but close).

Criteria for testing: in close contact with a close case, travel history, and/or severity of current health condition. This criteria is for the state lab, tests can be done via commercial labs at doctor discretion. There are at least 2 commercial labs testing in PA. The state lab can handle up to ~100 tests per day. 

Question was asked about coronavirus vs flu. For coronavirus: no one has immunity; no one has had a vaccine; we have anti-flu medications, while we have none for coronavirus.

Contact tracing: they interview the patient on where there were from the time symptoms started, and also do things like review security camera footage to determine who might have been within six feet. Not a perfect system, but the best they do now. 

They do not know if coronavirus will be affected by the change in seasons.

From the governor, a social distancing policy starts tomorrow.

For Montgomery County,  this means:

* All schools, community centers, gyms, entertainment venues will be closed. No conferences, rallies, concerts etc. 

* All healthcare facilities are to remain open, plus gas stations, grocery stores, mass transit. (Ardmore station will have a reduced schedule (or closed?) for two weeks)

Statewide: 

* All large gatherings with 250+ are encouraged to be postponed

* Discouraging people from going to public places like gyms, movie theaters, stores

* Encouraging religious leaders to prevent spread of virus.

The above are for 14 days.

There are currently 22 cases in PA

1 from pike county (the cases are all on the eastern side of the state at this point)

* 219 identified for testing

* 116 negative

* 20 positive

* 2 confirmed by cdc

* 1 from another state

* 81 pending (testing in progress)


Question was asked around the limited testing, the main answer was vague, but state permission is not required for doctors to send tests to a commercial lab.

How many masks are on hand? The state has stores of masks. If the outbreak gets to Italy levels, there will not be enough masks or other equipment.

What about childcare for folks in Montgomery county? No answer today.

Has a doctor called and asked for a test, have they been denied the test with the patient being told to isolate themselves? Governor's answer: ""I sure hope that no doctor has called with a patient who they think is having a problem that we've denied the test"". Answer from health dept: ""Yes, that has happened"".

There are currently 33, up 11 from yesterday

* ~300 identified for testing

* ~140 negative

* 27 positive

* 6 confirmed by cdc

* 1 from another state

* ~130 pending (testing in progress)

Testing guidance from the CDC has been in flux. If you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, no testing is needed. If you have a temp &gt; 100, shortness of breath or cough: please call your doctor to determine if you need a test, or call the emergency dept at your local hospital. Do not go directly to the doctor or hospital. Call first!

If a doctor feels a test is warranted, they can order the test from a commercial lab. All insurance companies will cover the test. Later, they mentioned that they are working on guidance for doctors on how to request tests from the commercial labs, so apparently there is still confusion about these procedures. 

Are people being tested who need the test? We are striving to make sure that everyone who needs testing will get the test. 

Is there a greater concern for the counties that border Montgomery county? Yes, that was a real question. 

What is being done to increase testing capacity? We‚Äôre dependent on getting the kits from the CDC. There are no current backlogs of tests. 

How have the testing guidelines been relaxed? Old guidelines focused on exposure (did the person have known contact with someone with Covid). Now if a physician sees symptoms, they should consider a Covid test.

1000 people are expected at a funeral tomorrow in Cumberland county. Is this a concern? Social distancing is important. Covid-19 can travel about 6 feet through the air. If you‚Äôre six feet from someone, you are much less likely to be exposed by them. 

Dr Fauci has said we don‚Äôt have enough tests, it seems you‚Äôre suggesting that PA has dodged this issue? Following CDC criteria, we have the capacity to do those tests. And, the addition of the commercial labs is great. It will be even better when hospitals can do the tests themselves.
 
Because of the lack of testing, is there an undercount? We‚Äôve only been able to do testing for 2 weeks, and we‚Äôve made a lot of progress in that time. For the first month, testing was very limited. We have now been testing anyone who has met the criteria, and now we‚Äôve relaxed the criteria.

There is a new pediatric case. Just got those results back, no further info at this time.

Yet we are required to keep teaching.

For the departments lucky enough to have a college or university fund us, we may be ok. But those departments without guaranteed funding is told ""oh well"", and ""hopefully"" the Governor ""might"" close everything down.

Extending mitigation is being implemented across the state (instead of just focusing on specific counties). This means that effective at midnight all non-essential stores should close, including bars and restaurants (except for take-out), and things like programs for seniors. This is for two weeks, and then re-assessed.

Currently there are 76 cases in PA. 

Reminder to avoid gatherings. Stay safe, and stay at home. There are mental health resources available. Text ""PA"" to 741-741

Questions: 
Is PA on its own in getting ventilators and other essential supplies? Doing everything we can, we're not along in getting that equipment. Already have some equipment stockpiles. This is why the mitigation effort is so important.
	
Will PA put a curfew in place? Governor wants people to stay home 24 hours a day, but no official, legal curfew

Will the national guard be used to help in mitigation efforts? No.

Does the closure apply to penndot? Working to determine which employees are essential.

Is there community spread? Yes, there are a few cases (1 or 2) where they cannot find a specific contact. 

What impacts on the upcoming primary and other elections? Not sure at this time. 

What about disaster assistance loans for small businesses? What about We are working with the Small business administration to get PA's share of the small business loans, and there are funds we can free up at the state level. 

What about state parks? They will remain open, though there is a concern re the park employees. 

What about driver license centers? In certain areas, they have been closed. No state-wide decision at this time.

What about testing for people who have symptoms, but who have not traveled or been in contact with a known patient? If symptoms are mild, stay home. More serious? Call your doctor. The doctor can request a test from a commercial lab. (Trying to shift testing from the state lab to the commercial labs and hospitals). Having an emergency? Call 911, and mention that it might be Covid related.

UPMC said they would have created their own in-house test earlier than they did, but the CDC and FDA said they would take care of that. Was that a mistake to discourage clinical and commercial labs from creating their own testing ability? Governor: ""I was not aware the CDC made that directive"". Health Sec: ""We have had no discouragement of academic centers developing testing, and we encourage academic centers to do that.""

As far as I know these programs apply to people who are currently receiving benefits, or people who have exhausted them. They are apparently used in times of high economic stress.

**From the state website:** 

 The EUC program has ended. EUC was a temporary federal program which provided additional unemployment benefits to eligible claimants following exhaustion of their regular Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits. **The EUC program was only effective for weeks of unemployment between July 12, 2008 and December 28, 2013**.

The following information is provided for informational purposes only. **EUC is not available at this time.**

**From the state website:**

Extended Benefits are additional weeks of unemployment compensation payable to qualified workers when certain adverse economic conditions exist in Pennsylvania. These conditions are based upon the state's unemployment rate reaching a certain level prescribed by the Pennsylvania UC Law. When these conditions exist statewide, the Department of Labor and Industry declares an Extended Benefit period.

Extended benefits are only payable during an Extended Benefit period, and only to qualified individuals only after they have exhausted all rights to regular benefits under the Pennsylvania UC Law. **Pennsylvania is not currently in an Extended Benefit period.**",Pennsylvania,Will the state-wide shutdown affect the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) or the Extended Benefit period?

So here are some suggestions and feel free to ask anything else you may have.

&amp;#x200B;

1. You are NOT always working even though you are always ""at the office""! This is the biggest issue with WFH. It helps to ""Log in"" at your normal time of office arrival, and ""log off"" when you are done. When you Log Off, shut the laptop down, and put it away.
2. Find a secluded spot if at all possible, working from the kitchen table isn't going to be ideal for putting in 8 hours+ of work, especially if you have kids who are home from school
3. If you are WFH for at least 2+ weeks, it may be worth it to get some home office supplies. Try to make your setup as close to what you have at work... laptop keyboards suck for long term use. Buy a wireless keyboard and mouse. Amazon Basics work just fine.
4. Kind of goes with above, but make sure you are setup in an ergonomic fashion, if possible run a 24"" monitor instead of laptop screen to ensure you aren't hunched over, and make sure your chair is comfortable and supportive
5. If you have kids at home, try to make sure you are either the most upstream device on the network, or are prioritized. Having conference calls lag out and drop because your kids are watching youtube while downloading their entire steam library gets old really quick
6. Stay in your normal routine if at all possible! If you are used to getting up at 6am, getting dressed and out the door, keep doing that! Trying to break your routine AND get used to WFH and being shut in can really cause issues
7. If you are an extrovert, or rely on work for your social interactions, be aware of whats going on in your head, depression can creep on really quickly, especially when added to the stress of all the unknown shit going on now. Be aware, be alert, and don't be afraid to get help.",Pennsylvania,Working from home questions / thoughts / concerns? Maybe I can help

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

I worked strictly in Pennsylvania while I lived there that year. I'm trying to figure out how to fill out a couple things on my local income tax return. I figured out that I have to fill out a tax form and mail it back. But, I'm having problems filling out a couple spots. I feel like I can fill out everything except line 12 and line 14. 

On line 12 (out-of-state or Philadelphia credits), I have amounts on my 12a and my 12b. But, it looks like i have only enough room on the form to write down only one of those two amounts. How would I fill out this line?

On line 14, I have a S125, PA-CRAF, and PASUI to fill out. Again, the form only allows me a spot for one of those to go into. How do I fill out this line?

I‚Äôm a 23-year-old currently living in Hanover. My mother and stepfather live south of Gettysburg in a golf community called The Links of Gettysburg, right by the Mason Dixon line. My stepfather works at the golf shop as a manager. He also has pretty regular respiratory issues and is coming up on being 70 years old. 

On Monday, at 3:06PM, the owners of the Links posted on their Facebook page that ‚Äúgolf, while it may feel essential, is not worth the risk.‚Äù They closed the golf course. Wise. 

Yesterday at 1:40PM, they issued a second statement, reopening, with ‚Äúspecial precautions‚Äù. And I quote, ‚Äúgolf can be good for our mental and physical health.‚Äù

From an ER doctor in NYC. The situation will be similar in PA soon enough. 

1) The ED (emergency department) is now separated into two areas: one for traditional emergencies and what has been dubbed, ‚ÄúThe COVID pit.‚Äù

2) A vast majority of folks in the COVID pit aren‚Äôt sick enough for any intervention and because of that fact, they cannot test them for COVID unless they are being admitted for breathing difficulties.

3) Those ‚Äúworried-well‚Äù folk jamming up the ED all have to get seen by law. So they (doctors/nurses) have to change into new clean protective-wear to talk to them. They (doctors) wind up giving them Tylenol (which costs the patient like $300) and sending them home. Now, they‚Äôve just wasted a set of clean protective-wear. The reason we‚Äôre in such a dire shortage of protective equipment for hospital staff is because these worried people come and need to be seen. STAY HOME UNLESS YOU HAVE SHORTNESS OF BREATH.

Sadly though the whole covid thing has happened however there is an issue.

The contract says non-refundable but if i'm not mistaken that is if HE chooses to refund not them. Otherwise by such logic i could advertise a service with a ""no-refund"" policy in contract and just go ""Oh yeah well i'm not doing it and you aren't getting your deposit back"".

The photographer is outright just refusing and the caterer is saying no but we can reschedule? Its a fucking wedding yeah lets just change that?

They are just going to go to the church since the priests say they will do it out in-front (shes catholic so guess its a big deal to them) and just say hang they rest of it.

Do they not by law have to refund the deposit because they are failing to uphold their end of the agreement by refusing to provide their service on the date agree'd upon.

1183,1183,Dredly,1584914094,fn822c,Nan," Philadelphia residents ordered to stay at home starting Monday morning

 

 Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney‚Äôs administration has ordered all  residents to stay in their homes except when engaging in life-sustaining  activities beginning at 8 a.m. Monday.

 

 The order is an escalation of the city‚Äôs previous attempts to encourage  social distancing to stem the spread of coronavirus, including bans on  large gatherings and restrictions on non-essential commercial activity.  The order prohibits all gatherings outside of private residences, city  Managing Director Brian Abernathy said.

 

 Philadelphians are still permitted to leave their homes for necessary  activities such as buying food or seeking medical care. Outdoor  exercise, practiced with social distancing, is also still permitted.  Kenney said he decided to issue the ‚Äústay at home‚Äù order after observing  that many people did not get the message.

PA Dept Of Health

615 Howard Ave #101

Altoona, PA  16601

Hello:

Pardon the grammar/lazy typing, I am typing with one hand...

I am composing this letter today because I have been so horrified from my treatment by all medical staff in the Altoona, PA medical community.  Some 2-3 weeks ago I fell down the steps to my basement at \~12 pm, carrying a case of glass beer bottles and suffered a laceration to my hand, severing the artery, nerve, tendons, etc‚Ä¶ and also an injury to my elbow that caused it to become black and blue and misshapen.  I was stocking my basement beer fridge for the inevitable lockdown.  Was not intoxicated..  Presented myself to the UPMC Altoona ER with said injuries. 

In my early twenties, I was in trouble with the law and had an overdose at the same ER.  They evidently keep some sort of ‚Äútreat this guy like shit‚Äù flag in my file.  This has to be nearly 10+ years behind me.  

Since then, I am a 10 years married father of 2 girls and have been a successful Retail Executive and pulled myself out of the gutter.  I now own my own business that could rival one of these brick and mortar businesses I used to work for.   And, by the way, haven‚Äôt used a drug for 6 years, let alone break the law.

So back to the ER, I was treated like I was not in the room after my injury.  I expressed the injury to my elbow to the ER staff.   They did not even acknowledge that they heard what I said.  I was immediately treated like I was seeking pain meds.  Which given that my finger was nearly severed I should have at least had my pain eased while I was in the ER.  All the male PA said to me while I screamed, cussing in pain while they squeezed it is, ‚Äúyou need to calm down, or I‚Äôll have to call security, there are kids here!!‚Äù...  I was in AGONY!  I was treated with an absolutely abhorrent bedside manner.  They assumed that someone who has a bad past is still the person they were in their youth.  What the Altoona medical field may not know is that I am every bit as educated as they are, my credentials I need not disclose..  I did not receive instructions to even take ibuprofen or even receive a prescription for an antibiotic.  I left the ER in tears, a man of 37 years, not only from physical pain, but from humiliation‚Ä¶

I called my family physician‚Äôs PA (a rare non judgemental gem of the profession)(and only doctor I trust) to follow up as my limited discharge instructions stated  (which were vague and nearly blank) and they referred me to University Orthopaedics Altoona, PA office.  I went to my appointment there and was inevitably scheduled for much needed surgery very quickly.  Surgery went great and I was treated great at Advanced Center For Surgery in Altoona.  Surgeon electronically transmitted a prescription of post op Norco which I used responsibly to ease my discomfort, post-op.  I scheduled 2 weekly post op appointments at 8am so that I can get things done early because we're trying to keep our business afloat and schedule our business appointments in the afternoon. 

‚ÄòI arrived at my appointment today 3/24/20 at University Orthopaedics Altoona office to be scolded by the ‚Äúgold room‚Äù nurse for not handing her my paper directly and instead putting it in the thing on the wall as you usually do.  (If you‚Äôve been there you know what I'm talking about)..  She unbandaged me from my plaster cast.  I then saw the doctor and was delighted that my surgery was a success.  My orthopedic surgeon, Dr Singer said to the nurse in the hallway, ‚Äúso he doesn‚Äôt have an appointment downstairs to get a splint‚Äù?  They wanted me to come back at 2pm in this coronavirus BS to get a splint and physical therapy instructions.  I told the nurse ‚Äúummm no, I have a 73yo mother in law that lives with us and my young children and I would prefer to limit my exposure, is there any way you can call down stairs to get them to see me‚Äù.   Doctor Singer came in to try to talk me into it, I said ‚Äúsir, this is not my fault that I was misscheduled by your staff, but with all due respect I‚Äôm not coming back‚Äù  He said ‚Äúno they can‚Äôt‚Äù. ‚Äú I said please go get one and put it on me, it'll be 5 minutes max‚Äù.  He said ‚Äúit‚Äôll take longer than that‚Äù The nurse came back in and put the dirty plaster cast back on me and wrapped it up with new tape.  I then went to Rite Aid and bought my own splint and taped myself up because it was too complicated for anyone to get me squared away today.  I intend to keep my appointment in a week‚Äôs time to get my sutures removed but I dread being treated horribly again because of some ‚Äúsecret‚Äù in my file from years prior..  

I will be forwarding this letter to several attorneys because I am sick to death of avoiding going to the doctor because I am treated this way.  I have suffered immensely because of this and my symptoms are never treated.  Every time I see a doctor I am treated like I am seeking pain meds, when all I want is to know what's wrong when I'm sick/hurt.  So to avoid being treated this way I take my chances dealing with my own illnesses.  I‚Äôm getting older, all I can think is how they will treat me if I get cancer.  

Sincerely,

xxx

On the application online, if they are going to be brought back into their workplace when they re-open, what would be the reason they select for filing for unemployment? LAID OFF, LACK OF WORK, or STILL EMPLOYED?

Likewise, selecting 'yes' option as well that asks if you would be recalled back into the job. The problem is that it wants a date of return, and the shop currently has not indicated when it will re-open obviously due to COVID-19.

1265,1265,Twinkie_cop,1585082406,focpni,Nan,"Hey folks, just an update and sorry I am a little late on the matter. We have been busy. 

As you are more than likely aware, Municipal Police and State Police are now enforcing business closures of ALL non-life sustaining businesses. This is in full effect and we have been given guidelines on the matters as law enforcement. I cannot get into specifics of our enforcement efforts as that is law enforcement sensitive and I have to respect that. What I can share is all publicly available information.

First and foremost: This measure IS NOT some Government hoax or plot to control the people or whatever crazy illogical theories I have seen spreading the internet. The measure is an enforcement effort to shut down business and has been taken to control the spread of Covid-19 in our beautiful home. We are not mindless robots looking to make more work for ourselves right now and arrest a bunch of people or issue citations. This is a matter, as public servants, to ensure the safety of our Commonwealth and its wonderful people.

The closures are enforceable through criminal penalties, under the Disease Control and Prevention Law of 1955 and the Administrative Code of 1929. State Police have been activated as well as Municipal Police under order of Governor Tom Wolf and Dr. Rachel Levine, Secretary of the Department of Health to enforce these laws. I will not type out specific laws (all are publicly available) because they can be lengthy but ones that could possibly be cited are as follows:

Title 71 - 1409 - basically spells out the fine and penalty for violation of Orders. 

Title 35 - 521.1 / 521.5 - The Secretary of Health has the authority to issue orders for isolation, quarantine and other control measures, such as the orders given.

Title 35 521.20 - subsection (a) provides the nature of the violation and subsection (b) basically provides authority for State Police and municipal law enforcement agencies to issue citations for violations of the Orders issued by the Secretary of Health and the Governor. I know there was discussion yesterday that municipal police cannot enforce these titles. This is provided to show we have been granted the authority. 

Side note: The above comment does not apply to Title 18 (crime) and Title 75 (vehicle) code, municipal police have full authority to enforce every section of those titles.  Do not take that statement as if you are stopped by a municipal officer in the future that they do not have the authority because they do and will make you look like a silly willy in court. lol. 

Additional sections that may be applicable are as follows:

Title 18 - 5101 This is essentially Obstruction. 

Title 47 - 4-462 - Liquor Code (temporary closures)

Title 47 - 4-471- Liquor Code (violating any order or laws)

Title 47 - 4-494- Liquor Code (penalty)

I do know many of you are wondering ""How is my place of employment still open?

I cannot answer that question for many of you but the updated list can be found here:

I do now some places are abusing this current system and remaining open but we are working close with Government officials to ensure full compliance and penalties will be issued.

Personal Note: 

As a Police Officer, I would like to thank all of you in these difficult times. I know PA is strong and will get through this together. I wish you all the best and a healthy road ahead. Please remember it is still okay to go outside. Being in a house all day is tough. Get out and move around the yard or go for a walk just remember to distance yourselves from others. It will do you wonders.

Please..PLEASE..try to not hoard items either. I know times are tough on all but many officers in my department  and surrounding ones as well as EMS/Nurses/Doctors I am friends with are having a hard time finding the necessary supplies for us to clean our gear with let alone have proper protection (masks, gloves, glasses etc). Of course you all need to stay clean and protected too but a single family household does not need 10,000 rolls of TP and 50 cans of Lysol lol. 

Please keep all essential employees in your prayers. You are all doing amazing and making a difference.

Like many Pennsylvanians, I got laid off from my full-time job at the end of last week. Fortunately (?), I have some freelance opportunities available, but these earnings would almost certainly NOT amount to more than I'd get paid through weekly unemployment checks. I can't get ahold of anyone through the state hotline, so I'm turning to Reddit. 

What I'm trying to figure out is how freelancing would affect my unemployment benefits. I've read that ANY 1099 work makes a person ineligible to receive ANY benefits, while I've also heard that you can report how much you make freelancing each week, and that counts against your benefit amount. So, if I made $200 freelancing and was getting $500 a week in unemployment, the state would still send me $300 if I declare I made the $200. Is this actually how it works? Even if this is correct, it seems like working hours doing freelance doesn't actually net me any extra cash. 

It feels really strange to turn down work right now, but it seems like that might be the safest avenue. Perhaps I'm better off focusing full-time on getting a full-time job?

Couple days ago, my company was operating with mininmal staff while being a non- life sustaining business. The people that were working were working willingly, however the business should not have been running AT ALL. My friend told me hey sent in an exemption letter to Gov.Wolf and LIED About what the company makes. The CEO handed a waiver to the police (exemption letter) stating that we make medical supplies,masks and items for the military.. when that is infact all a lie, we don't make any of that. They just want to keep the business up and running so they can make money... They do not care about our health or anything for that matter.

So upon hearing this, me and my friend had called the police department in the jurisdiction of the company. I THEN heard the CEO at my job actually told the people wortking there that they had the police called on them and proceeded to LOCK ALL OF THE DOORS (which is a safety hazard.) There was only one police officer on call, and when my friend had called he basically gave him a hard time about it and he said that the company does not make such supplies and the officer said ""how should I know I don't work there."" In situations like this.. the whoie point is to investigate said businesses and shut them down otherwise, no? He didn't do any of that. When I called, in a nutshell, he said that the problem had already been dealt with, so i hung up. As of today, my company sent out a text saying they are now exempt from being shutdown and schedules will be made accordingly...

Not even sure what to do at this point.. isn't this highly illegal...

PS: The company donates to the police department as well.. so maybe that has something to do with it.

tl;dr - Company I work for was operating while being a non-life sustaining business, AND THEN sent in an exemption letter, and LIED to the police about what the company manufactures in order for the governor to grant exemption in order to continue operating.

This is not good at all.At this rate, it would only take 27.12 days for the virus to infect everyone in Pennsylvania.

Having a 5 day incubation period, this means that the real number is closer to 10948 already.

So that would mean there's 10948-2218=8730 people out spreading it.

Bear in mind, too, that assuming those people are probably indoors now is a fallacy.

Those that have caught it are the ones most likely outside and ignoring the warnings.

Every day we let the number balloon like this will likely take 10 days in real full-blown quarantine to reverse.",Pennsylvania,PA COVID-19 daily growth rate increased to 37.6%

1364,1364,phrunk87,1585348538,fq7i2u,Nan,"So my wife and I live in Pennsylvania, in a county that just was issued a ""Stay-At-Home"" order by our Governor, Tom Wolf. We have a 3 month old daughter who is now displaced from daycare, as the governor closed schools/daycares around March 13th.

I work as an insurance claims adjuster for a major national auto insurance company, and have been working from home since March 11th. The first few days were my normal work from home days I was always allowed to have as part of my role, and starting on March 16th my team as well as the majority of the company was told to work from home indefinitely until the pandemic is ""over"". This was a very easy transition for me, as I was already used to working from home 2 days a week, so now I'm just working from home 5 days a week. I'm also watching my 3 month old daughter full time while working from home as well (a challenge for sure, but better than risking her safety or not being able to work from home and watch her).

My wife, however, works for a local retirement community (very upscale, very rich residents) that houses both active retirees (""residential living"") and also has a ""enhanced living"" portion that cares for residents with additional needs (basically a nursing home). She has been forced to attend work as normal, with no work from home option.

Where I'm personally confused (or maybe ""appalled"" is a better word) is that while this business is certainly ""essential"" and (in a broad sense at the very least) ""life-sustaining"", my wife is not a ""life-sustaining"" employee in her normal role.

My wife's formal role is being a Volunteer Coordinator and a Resident Life Events Director. Basically her normal role is organizing events and fundraisers for the campus, and organizing teams of volunteers (residents mostly) to meet the needs of the on-campus events/businesses (gift stores, shops, etc). She also prepares grants and speaks with donors to secure funding for said events.

With the Coronavirus pandemic shaking things up to say the least, her normal role is currently more-or-less obsolete. She is obviously not arranging events or volunteer groups given the needs for social distancing making these things impossible. Due to this, my wife's work is making her take on different roles within the company, mostly covering for employees who aren't showing up to work.

A large number of CNAs (Certified Nursing Assistants) who work with the ""nursing home"" residents have decided not to show up for their jobs. This is mostly due to the fact that a lot of them have children at home and are choosing to stay home and watch them out of necessity, or just staying home to avoid possible exposure to the virus. Most of these workers are only making about $12-15/hr, so they likely decided it's not worth the risk of their health or trying to find child care.

Long story short, my wife is being forced now to take on CNA-esque roles (like feeding these residents, etc.) despite this not being her role in the company and not having training to do so. She's growing more and more concerned with having to be on-site at the company too, as there is very little being done to combat the possible spread of Covid-19 (vendors have unrestricted access, are not being screened, etc.) and although there are no official cases at her work, over 17 other nursing homes in our area have confirmed cases of Covid-19 and she is getting worried cases will show up at her work and that she may bring it home to our daughter if so.

While she is trying to grin and bear it for now, once cases show up at her work (it's absolutely just a matter of ""when"", not ""if"") we want to know what our best options would be. We absolutely don't want her to keep going in, but aren't sure what other options she may have.

Financially I have enough saved up to support us while we weather this storm and she's able to find employment again once this is over if it comes down to her losing her employment, but this is obviously not the ideal solution.

I suppose my questions are:

-Can my wife legally stop physically going to work if cases of the virus are confirmed at her location and demand a work from home option? Can she do this even without confirmed cases?

-If my wife is fired for refusing to show up physically for work, would she have a wrongful termination lawsuit potential against her employer?

-Any other ideas of how my wife can demand to work from home or otherwise mitigate the risk of her spreading this virus to our daughter or anyone else?

Any input is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",Pennsylvania,Advice? Wrongful Termination Suit Potential? [Pennsylvania] [Coronavirus/COVID-19]

I work at an essential business (veterinary clinic). Next week, all employee hours will be cut. We have not received much guidance from owners or management as to what to do, so some lower level managers and I researched, and advised the staff to file for partial unemployment tomorrow.

Tonight a higher level manager told one of the lower levels that things were going to change somehow on 4/1 - the business would be forced to close due to the stay at home order and the owners would be forced to pay us two weeks of leave that would not count against PTO, and that if we filed for unemployment compensation now, we would not get that two weeks of paid leave.

I think she could be referring to the FFCRA act that is due to be enacted 4/1, but that wouldn't close our business, and we're under 50 employees, so an exemption could be made.

I have a hearty stash of mushrooms and I'm looking for some hiking and biking recommendations for an upcoming solo trip, probably in the next 2 days.  For context, I'm an avid hiker, rock climber, and mountain biker.  Born and bred in SE PA, currently out by Ohiopyle.  Really not restricted by travel, I will gladly drive out of my way to a great hiking spot and stay for a couple days after to mountain bike.  I was thinking Allegheney Nat Forest, Trough Creek SP, Pine Grove Furnace SP, or Ricketts Glen SP.  Thoughts?  Specific trail suggestions?  If you were to eat some mushrooms, where would the most beautiful place in PA be? Thanks so much for your time!  I appreciate your input and suggestions",Pennsylvania,Where would you go to hike and eat psilocybin mushrooms in PA?

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

The Dept of Health website is a clean design and, in my opinion, has been pretty open and transparent regarding new cases.  [https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx)

But they way they are breaking down cases by age really bothers me. This graph from the site shows what I'm talking about: 

AGE RANGE PERCENT OF CASES (From PA Dept of Health site)

|AGE RANGE|PERCENT OF CASES|
|:-|:-|
|0-4|&lt;1%|
|5-12|&lt;1%|
|13-18|1%|
|19-24|10%|
|25-49|41%|
|50-64|27%|
|65+ |19%|

It looks like 25-49 year olds are toast, until you realize that the data for that age group is spread over 24 years, instead of being distributed into equal age ranges. Didn't we learn that in middle school math? 

Here's a chart with equal age groups (I divided the percentage from the state's chart by the new number of groups I created. I know it's not totally accurate, but I believe it is a better representation of the numbers in the state than the data they are providing. Also, I couldn't find raw data in the 45 seconds I felt like looking for it. Perhaps a mathematician, statistician, high school stats student, or any other low-level genius can suggest a better way to do it.)

AGE RANGE PERCENT OF CASES (Breaking larger groups into equally-sized groups and redistributing percentages.)

|AGE RANGE|PERCENT OF CASES|
|:-|:-|
|0-6|&lt;1%|

We Filmed The Shining At Our Movie Theater
A few months ago, me and my friends who are all employees at a movie theater here in Pennsylvania decided to make The Shining for our theater. We make a show for youtube and thought it would be fun to do this.

So changing it just a little bit, we tried recreating scenes from The Shining with all of us who work here. It was a blast to make and now with the theater closed until further notice due to the outbreak, I decided to finally release it.

Our version follows Derric, who is asked to watch after the theater for just an evening while the boss is out. During this time, Derric is isolated in a theater with no customers and two employees, one who is slowly driving him insane. Something evil is lurking the theater halls.

If you enjoy The Shining and are in the mood to check it out, that would be pretty awesome. We have a lot of fun making these and hopefully when the theater opens again we can do more movie spoofs/recreations.

Until then, I hope you enjoy The Cinema.

‚ÄúDear Fellow Pennsylvanian,
 
These are unprecedented times, and we hope you and your families are staying safe. We are writing with IMPORTANT news about recent changes to the Pennsylvania primary election related to COVID 19. In order to protect the health and safety of all voters, poll workers, and election officials while also ensuring access to voting, the legislature, Governor Wolf, and the Department of State worked together to pass legislation to reschedule the PA primary election to Tuesday, June 2.
 
Additionally, thanks to historic legislation passed last fall, ALL Pennsylvania voters now also have the ability to [vote by mail](https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Mail-and-Absentee-Ballot.aspx?utm_source=dos_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=primary_date_update01) without having to provide an excuse ‚Äì for any reason or no reason at all. You can [apply for mail-in ballots online](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/OnlineAbsenteeApplication/#/OnlineAbsenteeBegin), by mail, or in person, until one week before the election. For the 2020 primary, mail-in ballot applications must be received by your county election office by 5 p.m. Tuesday, May 26. Applying online is very easy and quick, and even better, if you enter your email address, you will receive notifications as to the status of your application and ballot along the way.  Once you receive your mail-in ballot, you now have until 8pm on June 2 to deliver your completed ballot to your county election office, but you should drop it off or mail it as early as you can to ensure it is delivered by that time.
 
Voters who have already requested a mail-in or absentee ballot will receive your ballot for the rescheduled primary. There is no need to apply again if you have already done so.
 
Other important election-related deadlines will change along with the new primary date. The new [deadline to update your voter registration ](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx)is Monday, May 18.

tl;dr If you are in an office or apartment building or a hotel, please meet your delivery driver at the building entrance to minimize the risk of your driver spreading corona virus in your building and to restaurants. 

With the spread of COVID-19, does it seem like it would be a good idea to spend several hours walking into several restaurants touching door handles at each one, getting into your car, touching your steering wheel, shifter, door handles, then entering numerous apartment buildings, touching door handles, keycode entry boxes, and elevator buttons? All without the ability to wash hands under hot running water after every point of contact. That sounds like a great way to spread a virus to a lot of people very quickly.

This is what delivery drivers are dealing with. With the stay at home orders, a lot of people are using grubhub, uber eats, doordash, instacart and so on for food delivery, or by calling local favorites. 

I've got two points to make here: First is the safety of yourself and others in your building. Do you really want somebody who has visited dozens of locations and touched many things possibly unaware that they are carrying the virus coming into your building and touching door handles, the key code entry box, or elevator buttons that you and others in your building will also be touching?

Second is if you need delivery services to get through this time, we need to be sure the drivers remain healthy enough to continue delivering. And we need to be sure the drivers aren't transmitting virus to the workers at the restaurants they visit.

If the people who work in food start getting sick, we will be in trouble. Most delivery places have an option for a no contact delivery. If you open your door and see the outdoors, please use it. If your service of choice does not, please request that the order gets left at your door.

If you are in an apartment building and aren't disabled or in quarantine, please just ask to meet the driver at the building entrance. You can wash your hands when you get back to your apartment.

Everyone needs to do their part to minimize risk. Please do yours.",Pennsylvania,Please keep delivery drivers out of your building at this time.

1. applied for UC on 3/16, the night I lost my job, and received email confirmation saying that there is a PIN I will need to use to open my claim online
2. received an email update on 3/28 saying that the PIN should arrive before 3/28, in time to file by 4/3. I received nothing.
3. I applied AGAIN on 4/4. It is now 4/7

I'm really, really worried because neither I nor my partner, who filed his initial claim later in the same week, has received any PIN in the mail. Our household has no income and we can't pay our bills. We're also both pretty young, and just moved to the city out of school and started working, so we don't have anything in the way of savings. Honestly we've already used it all up, and started going beyond.

Not only that, but **WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY FLAT MAIL AT ALL.** We usually receive mail every day, from the multitudes of bills to junk advertisements. But for the past 2+ weeks, we have received nothing but packages, and one subscription magazine. Our flat mail has disappeared. I don't know what to do, stuck in the house waiting for the mail every day, with no way to contact my neighbors either. I have also tried repeatedly to reach L&amp;I through the number I was provided for help, and through UC's live chat, but both of those seem to be shut down.

Please, if anyone has any information I would be so grateful. We live in Port Richmond, Philadelphia. And though I always miss her, the mail person seems to be coming around every day. My next door neighbor says she is coming every day, but there is no mail to deliver. Could there be something going on at the post office?

**Why are you writing about this here?**  I wrote our senators about this issue and why it's important to me.  I got this email from Casey in response. Nothing about the privacy

&gt; Thank you for taking the time to contact me about the EARN IT Act. I appreciate hearing from you about this issue.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; The Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (""EARN IT"") Act is a new bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Graham (R-SC) and Blumenthal (D-CT) on March 5, 2020. The EARN IT Act would establish a National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention to develop best practices that internet platforms may implement to prevent the online sexual exploitation of children and reduce the proliferation of online child sexual abuse material (""CSAM""). This Commission would include, among others, individuals representing survivors, consumer and privacy interests, technology companies and law enforcement. The bill would allow internet platforms to ""earn"" their immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which holds that platforms may not be held liable for the content that third parties post or distribute using its platform. By certifying that they are in compliance with the Commission's best practices or that they are taking reasonable measures to reduce the proliferation of CSAM, internet platforms would earn Section 230 immunity from legal liability if CSAM appeared on their sites.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard from many constituents who believe this legislation would take an important step to ensure the safety of America's children. I have also heard from constituents who agree that action is needed to address the sexual exploitation of children, but are concerned about the potential effects of the EARN IT Act on privacy and internet innovation.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; As technology advances at an unprecedented rate, it is essential that we thoughtfully consider the complex issues before us to ensure that we continue to promote the safety of our children and families. It is imperative that we work to ensure a better, safer and more prosperous future for the children of Pennsylvania and the Nation. The EARN IT Act has been endorsed by national organizations such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Organization for Women and World Without Exploitation. I am proud to stand with these organizations as an original cosponsor of the EARN IT Act.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; After decades of underinvestment in our Nation's children, I believe our country needs a new and bold vision to chart a way forward for our children. To that end, I recently released my proposal, Five Freedoms for America's Children. This is a comprehensive proposal to secure the blessings of freedom for the children of today and tomorrow. This proposal identifies five freedoms that we must guarantee for children throughout the United States, and includes key policy changes to secure each. Among them is the Freedom to Be Safe from Harm, which recommends significant new investments to strengthen families, prevent child abuse and to investigate and prosecute crimes against children.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Please be assured that I am gratified to hear your views, and that I will keep them in mind as we consider this legislation.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Again, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future about this or any other matter of importance to you.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; For more information on this or other issues, I encourage you to visit my website, http://casey.senate.gov. I hope you will find this online office a comprehensive resource to stay up-to-date on my work in Washington, request assistance from my office, or share with me your thoughts on the issues that matter most to you and to Pennsylvania.

The email I sent was asking a specific question, why I was left out of this stimulus bill, and if the senator was planning to propose anything to help those of us claimed as dependents. However, his response (obviously a canned automatic response) did not even address my point/question, and solely went on to talk about what he has ""done"" so far. **Senator Toomey, my question was not about what you are doing, it is about what you are not doing.** Here is the response I received.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;April 9, 2020  
&gt;  
&gt;Dear Mark,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for contacting me about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). I appreciate hearing from you.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The COVID-19 virus poses a significant threat to public health; I believe our paramount responsibility is to protect our own citizens from COVID-19. To help coordinate the federal response to keep Pennsylvanians safe, I am in near-daily contact with top officials at the White House, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), as well Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf and Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine.  
&gt;  
&gt;More specifically, I have been laser focused on expanding our capacity to test for COVID-19 on a large scale. By working closely with Dr. Anthony Fauci at the NIH and other senior administration officials, we successfully removed bottlenecks that were inhibiting hospitals from obtaining materials necessary to develop their own COVID-19 tests.¬† Unfortunately, the Commonwealth does not have the ability to test everyone in the community at this time. Instead, it is focusing resources on individuals with moderate to severe symptoms and certain at-risk populations such as seniors and health care workers. I am continuing to stay engaged with hospitals, commercial labs, and diagnostic manufacturers to increase the capacity to test for COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. The sooner we have broad-scale testing available, the sooner we can reopen our economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime, Pennsylvanians can do their part by staying home, abiding by social distancing guidelines, and wearing homemade cloth face coverings when venturing out - a suggestion I made in a video posted online on March 28, 2020. This safeguard can help to limit transmission of the virus, which can be spread through saliva emitted through coughing, sneezing, or even speaking.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since that video, I have been working with Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) to urge President Trump, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, and Dr. Fauci to direct the CDC to recommend all Americans wear masks when they must leave their homes. In Pennsylvania, I have urged the Wolf administration to update state guidelines and encourage all Pennsylvanians to wear cloth masks or facial barriers if they must leave their homes. I was pleased that on April 3, 2020, both the CDC and Governor Wolf took this action.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, face coverings are not a substitute for staying home and regular hand-washing. And Americans should not purchase and wear N95 or surgical masks, as those should be reserved for front line health care workers. However, to put it simply, my mask could help you, and your mask could help me.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime, Congress has acted aggressively to help with the response. In March, Congress passed, and President Trump signed into law, three bills designed to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, all of which I supported when they passed the Senate. The first law, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act (Public Law 116-123) provides $8.3 billion in funding for state and local health departments, emergency preparedness, and response activities such as the procurement of medical supplies, increased access to testing, and the development of a vaccine or treatment.  
&gt;  
&gt;The second bill Congress passed, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Public Law 116-127; FFCRA) made COVID-19 testing free for nearly all individuals. Additionally, the FFCRA temporarily expanded paid sick leave and paid family leave. The FFCRA mandated that most businesses with fewer than 500 employees give two weeks of sick leave to employees who are seeking medical treatment, are quarantined due to COVID-19, or are caring for a sick individual. This law also required certain employers to provide ten weeks of leave for eligible employees whose child's school has closed.  
&gt;  
&gt;More recently, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (Public Law 116-136). This $2 trillion package provides assistance to financially-stressed families and workers who are furloughed or laid off. The CARES Act delivers direct payments and expanded unemployment benefits. It aims to keep this economic contraction from becoming a full-blown depression through crucial tax relief and lending programs for businesses - small and large - so they can survive an extended period with little or no revenue. This law will also help America forcefully combat this unprecedented public health crisis, with billions of dollars in aid for hospitals treating the sick, researchers developing a vaccine, and healthcare workers and first responders on the front line of this fight.  
&gt;

&gt;As Pennsylvania continues to weather the COVID-19 epidemic, I will continue to work with Governor Wolf, Secretary Levine, Pennsylvania's health care providers, and anyone else necessary to help Pennsylvanians in this time of crisis. Thank you again for your correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I may be of assistance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,  
&gt;  
&gt;Pat Toomey  
U.S. Senator, Pennsylvania

As you can see, not once did he bring up the lack of support for dependent adults in the CARES Act, the response was solely a victory parade to the rubber stamp he has been. Not only does this make me feel like my voice is not being heard, it makes it seem like nobody is actually reading his correspondence.

**And, to add insult to injury,**

# My name is not Mark.

Mark is my fathers name, I know for a fact that I put my name in on the contact form, I am sure because **this is not the first time this has happened. This month.** Late last month, I wrote concerning the EARN IT Act, and guess how that response started?

&gt;April 3, 2020  
&gt;  
&gt;Dear Mark,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for contacting me about the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) Act. I appreciate hearing from you\[...\]

Now, I figured that I may have clicked an incorrect autofill choice, so while confused, I did not take offense by my fathers name being on the response. Now that this has happened a second time, I am taking offense. 

For a Senator to implement an auto-reply system, to have staffers choose responses without even actually reading a correspondence, and for this auto-reply system to mix up names of two people living at the same address, is crazy. For this to be implemented by a United States Senator from the 5th largest state in the country is nothing short of an utter disgrace. 

I am dissapointed that I was not able to vote in 2016 when Senator Toomey was up for reelection, yet I am glad that I will be able to vote come 2022 when his name is on the ballot again, hopefully for the last time.

Sorry for the rant, but I felt this story of a lack of care from one of our highest ranking elected officials was worth sharing.

\[TLDR: Pat Toomey is a disgrace (surprise, surprise), and should go back to [peddling candy on the floor of the senate](https://www.phillyvoice.com/pennsylvania-sen-pat-toomey-responsible-maintaining-candy-desk-during-president-trumps-impeachment-trial/), as that is one of the few jobs you might be able to make an argument he is capable of doing.\]",Pennsylvania,"Thanks, Senator Toomey"

I have decided to register on here to get to know the community and people of Pittsburgh before a planned move for myself, my wife and our two daughters. 

I'd like to give you all a bit of context first. My wife and I are both 35. Our daughters are 9 years old and 16 months old. I have been working as a Primary School teacher in the UK for 12 years now, but fancied a change and the chance of a move to the Pittsburgh area came up. 

My wife's family are from Ireland, but her grandfather moved over from Pennsylvania back in the early 1950s when he was around 15 year old. 

We've talked for years about coming over to the US and rediscovering her roots. So to have the chance of a teaching post there is something we were excited about. She's a physiotherapist and was looking at posts in that area, too. 

It's all still in its very early stages at this point and things are obviously on hold with the situation as it stands, but I'd really like to know what to expect from Pittsburgh and ask a few questions if that's okay?

We both love the outdoors and strolls out in the woods with our daughters and our dog. We also love the winter, it's our favourite time of year! The more snowfall, the better! 

I'm someone who enjoys craft ales and beers and my wife has always been a fan of cycling and wants to know if there are many clubs in the area. 

As for neighbourhoods, where is close enough to the city to reduce the commute, but safe and cosy enough to raise a family? We've got a relatively average budget in real terms. 

Thanks in advance for your help!",Pennsylvania,Coming to the Pittsburgh area and would love to ask some questions!

I asked about the extension on their expiration and he informed me that it's an online process regardless of any extensions and it should have been renewed already.

that being said, just going by the [statement](https://www.lcb.pa.gov/Consumers/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx) provided by the LCB, online sales of liquor are moving forward, with limitations (six bottles per order, one order to one address per day, etc.).  the website is *apparently* set to be randomized, allowing randomly selected consumers access to the shopping site, while everyone else gets a redirect to an [apology](https://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SpecialAccessLandingPageView?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10051) and a link to the site i hyperlinked above.  it's been suggested that there really aren't any online liquor sales, because nobody i talk to has been able to purchase or has known someone who is able to purchase liquor online and with these rules in place.

Based on the information submitted in your request, Governor Wolf and Secretary Levine‚Äôs recent orders calling for the closure of non-life-sustaining businesses do not appear to require your business to close at this time. Certain operations of your business¬†described in your request appear to be within a life-sustaining business sector that contributes to the health and safety of Pennsylvania. You do not require an exemption to remain open for business as to these operations. For further information regarding¬†what operations are or support a life-sustaining business sector, please see the Department of Community and Economic Development‚Äôs guidance at¬†https://dced.pa.gov/resources.

Your business must remain in compliance with the social distancing and other mitigation measures which have been established by the Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as currently in effect or as may be amended in the future.¬†Virtual and telework operations (e.g. work from home) must be the primary option when available. In-person work at a business site is only to be performed on the most limited basis possible to deliver the services or goods of your life-sustaining business.
We appreciate your efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19.
