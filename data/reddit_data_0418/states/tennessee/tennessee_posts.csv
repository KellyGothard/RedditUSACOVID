The above is my original post, seeking your suggestion for a week long trip in Tennessee.

It worked out great.

I visited 

* Nashville - Lane Motor Museum. Tullahoma - Aircraft museum was closed, so maybe next time.
* Chattanooga  - Ruby Falls, Rock City, Inclined Rail ( I believe it is closed now for renovations). The gardens were very nice. My kid enjoyed Fairy tale cavern in the garden.
* Gatlinburg - We spent time on the Sky bridge and few other local areas. But the wait for sky-bridge was long, that my family got tired, so we saved other areas of interest for next time. Also due to weather didn't visit Cling-mans Dome, New Found gap areas. I will save it for my next trip.

All in all, it was a great trip. We all enjoyed the trip. These places, I might not have found without your suggestions.

Thank you all for your suggestions.

Have a wonderful 2020",Tennessee,Thank you for your suggestions about places to visit in Tennessee. It worked out great

In Boyd's 20-page lawsuit, the former altar boy claimed he was repeatedly sexually abused for about two and a half years in the 1990s by longtime Knoxville priest Xavier Mankel The suit also alleged Bishop Anthony O'Connell, the diocese's first bishop, abused Boyd at least twice.

Both Mankel and O'Connell are dead. 

The abuse, the suit contended, left Boyd with ""severe psychological injuries, and emotional harm"" that included loss of his faith, ""mood swings, intimacy problems, emotional disconnection in relationships, anxiety, rage and the loss of enjoyment of life.""

In its announcement, the diocese characterized the settlement as ""an act of pastoral outreach."" 

""Despite my personal feelings regarding the claim which names two now-deceased priests, I hope that this action offers Mr. Boyd a path to peace and reconciliation,"" Bishop Richard F. Stika said. 

**The lawsuit filed by Memphis attorneys Gary Smith and Karen Campbell says the abuse began in 1991 when Boyd was a fourth grader at Sacred Heart Cathedral School.** The allegations included that Mankel groped Boyd and that the action ""escalated to fondling, grooming, and other sexual activity.""

Mankel,[ who died in 2017 at age 81,](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2017/06/22/founding-father-diocese-knoxville-monsignor-francis-mankel-dies-81/419923001/) was a Knoxville native and a priest for 56 years.

&gt;  
&gt;WASHINGTON COUNTY, Tenn (WCYB) — Following a News 5 report that developers interested in a Boones Creek retail district donated thousands to a political action committee benefiting state Rep. Matthew Hill, the Jonesborough Republican said any suggestion of quid pro quo was ‘stupid.’  
&gt;  
&gt;Five local businessmen interested in establishing a tax incentive retail district in the Boones Creek area of Washington County, Tenn. donated $45,000 to a political action committee that supported Hill’s failed run for Tennessee House Speaker in the month after Hill successfully pushed the legislation through the General Assembly.  
&gt;  
&gt;“That’s an absurd allegation and is just stupid,” Hill said last Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Members of the development group, Mark Larkey, Bucky Mabe, Clarence Mabe, Bryan Sangid and Joe Wilson, hosted a fundraiser for Hill and state Rep. Micah Van Huss at East Tennessee State University in November; attended by Gov. Bill Lee.  
&gt;  
&gt;Larkey also denied any suggestion that his development group persuaded Hill to pursue retail district legislation with campaign donations.  
&gt;  
&gt;“When the bill was passed, I had no idea there was going to be an opening for Speaker,” Larkey said in a statement. “My support was directly related to the opportunity for Representative Hill to support our region at a higher state level which is an opportunity that didn’t even exist when the bill was passed.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The Johnson City Commission is poised to designate a 940-acre retail district near Exit 17 and I-26 next week that will allow the city to use 75 percent of the state’s share of local sales tax generated within the district to lure businesses to the area.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the project has been described as a “game-changer” for the region, Johnson City and Washington County officials were, apparently, unaware of the legislation until days before it was approved by the state legislature.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hill said he was approached by the group of developers requesting a tax incentive district like the Pinnacle development in Bristol. He believes those questioning the merits of the district are attacking his “conservative values,” or are attempting to protect the business interests of the Pinnacle.

&gt;  
&gt;Washington County Chancery Court will review a complaint against Johnson City early next month that argues the City Commission did not follow the correct procedure when it approved the boundaries of an incentive district in Boones Creek.  
&gt;  
&gt;A court date is scheduled for 9 a.m. Feb. 3.  
&gt;  
&gt;The plaintiff, Johnson City attorney John Wood of Wood Patent Law, argues in court documents filed on Jan. 16 — the same day commissioners were scheduled to cast their final vote on the boundaries — that the city violated its ordinance adoption rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the filing, he claims the commission approved an incomplete first reading of the district boundaries and that the city altered the ordinance between second and third reading. He also writes that there has been “ongoing confusion” about the geographic parameters in the legislation that authorized the district, which Gov. Bill Lee signed into law in May.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wood’s filing was submitted as a complaint and request for injunctive relief, which asks that the court defer the City Commission’s vote on Jan. 16. But, now that the ordinance has been approved, Wood said Tuesday the question at hand is whether or not the ordinance is valid.  
&gt;  
&gt;“My general end goal is that this group of city officials and the ones that follow will think twice next time before violating our city charter,” Wood said...

&gt;  
&gt;by John Engel  Friday, January 24th 2020   
&gt;  
&gt;JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. --- The Internal Revenue Service filed a federal tax lien against state Rep. Matthew Hill (R-Jonesborough) after Hill failed to pay $19,042.48 in federal income taxes over two years.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;According to IRS documents that were filed on Jan. 2, Hill has an unpaid balance of $4,362.46 from 2016 and an unpaid balance of $14,680.02 from 2018.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a statement, Hill said: ""After recently receiving notice of the tax amount variance referenced for the years in question, I am taking corrective action to resolve this issue and will pay all taxes owed.”  
&gt;  
&gt;House Speaker Cameron Sexton has declined to comment. Gov. Bill Lee's office declined to comment for this story.  
&gt;  
&gt;A media spokesperson for the IRS would not comment on Hill's specific case but directed News 5 to Publication 594 of the IRS Collection Process.  
&gt;  
&gt;""A lien is a legal claim against all your current and future property. When you don't pay your first bill for taxes due, a lien is created by law and attaches to your property. It applies to property (such as your home and car) and to any current and future right you have to property.  
&gt;  
&gt;The IRS files a federal tax lien to establish priority over other creditors looking to collect a debt.  
&gt;  
&gt;On June 21, 2019, debt collection firm Wilson &amp; Associates, PLLC in Little Rock, Arkansas was appointed a ""successor trustee"" to the Jonesborough home owned by Hill.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two years earlier, on March 14, 2017, debt collection firm Shapiro and Ingle, LLP in Charlotte, North Carolina was appointed substitute trustee for Hill's Jonesborough home. The Tennessean newspaper reported that foreclosure proceedings began on the property before Hill ultimately caught up on his payments.

There were even large plastic bags stuck in trees and bushes.  

Along the interstate, and in particular 840, there was garbage everywhere.  It reminded me of driving in the New Jersey with trash all along the highways.  And no, I'm not from NJ.  I've just traveled there some for work.

&gt;  
&gt;State Rep. Micah Van Huss, R-Jonesborough, has filed a bill in the General Assembly that would allow local governments to take a voluntary census of “unborn children,” which would be factored into the proportion of funding they receive from the state.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Should we be successful with this legislation it would create more funds for our cities and recognize the humanity of our unborn,” Van Huss, who is up for reelection this year, said by email. “I look forward to presenting it in committee.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The description of House Bill 2296 on the General Assembly’s [website says](http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB2296): “As introduced, authorizes local governments to take special censuses that include unborn children; requires that any state funds distributed and allocated to local governments based on population use such special census figures.”  
&gt;  
&gt;[The bill](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/111/Bill/HB2296.pdf) defines “unborn children” as “individual living members of the species homo sapiens” from fertilization to full gestation and childbirth, including as an embryo and fetus.  
&gt;  
&gt;The proposed law says cities or counties can, at their own expense, conduct a special census **at any time** between regular federal census years. The special census must be conducted by the “federal bureau of the census” or in a way that’s directed by and satisfactory to the department of economic and community development...",Tennessee,"TNGA Rep.

We're looking for basically one thing.. 

We want up to 5 acres, but we want to be no more than 20 minutes from a bigger city for access to an airport (really only work requirement), activities, and good schools (elementary/junior high age currently).

Where might you suggest looking?

We want the land so we can do as we please, but don't want to be estranged from community for our family. Kids love sports and we want to make sure they access to that, too.

So, I've been a lurker for years but posting for the first time for my due diligence: please help me understand your corporate and work culture.

Specifically, I'd love some insights into the more subtle cultural elements found in Nashville's corporate and work culture (or Tennessee's work culture in general), particularly compared to your more popular East Coast or West Coast counterparts.

Background: I work for a Cultural Intelligence company and we provide HR support and training for large multinationals in my home country in South East Asia. Normally, this is a simple task for me as I spent a good amount of time working in the US and have a good grasp of the corporate culture there but I was mostly in SF or NYC.

However, I was recently assigned to handle a case where the local team is having some difficulties relating to, and working with, their American counterparts based in Nashville, TN. The company HQ is in Nashville and they're one of the bigger multinationals in the state. They employ hundreds of people in my country as well. I understand that in general, US work culture is almost the same whatever state you're on but what are some of the more subtle ones that you think are unique to Nashville (or TN)?

An example for me was raised by a female exec sent to the corporate HQ: every time she or another female colleague would enter a meeting (or a room), the males would all stand and wait for her to take a seat before sitting back down. They would even stop in the middle of a conversation to do so. I found this very unique and would love to read more like it. Thank you!",Tennessee,Tennessee Work Culture

Some places to avoid.

Paying someone ANY money on monies that you were going to get anyway doesn’t make sense in the slightest, but people make rash decisions when their lives have been thrown into upheaval. 

File your claim. Get all communication with your carrier in writing. Wait for their offer. Get their estimate reviewed (for free if possible). Then make the decision to hire help. Not before then. 

With that said I know everyone likes to think their adjuster, and their carrier, is their friend (nationwide is on your side, like a good neighbor State Farm is there, all state you’re in good hands, etc), but it’s not your adjusters job to maximize your claim. It’s their job to manage it. 

Make no mistake. This is going to be a large loss for all insurance carriers, and they will do what they can to minimize their losses. Even if it’s at the expense of those who have suffered. 

Below I will have included a step by step guide on what to do after a catastrophe. 

Stay safe everyone, 

Your local insurance specialist 



No one ever expects a fire or tornado destroy their home or building. Those kinds of things happen to other people. Being the victim of a catastrophic loss doesn’t mean you have to allow yourself to become a victim a second time by relinquishing the control of your claim to others and, as a result, having a less than favorable outcome. Following are some tips and suggestions that will help you ADAPT and stay in command of your claim so that you set yourself up to maximize your settlement. So when the unexpected does happen to you, and hundreds of thousands of dollars are hanging in the balance, just ADAPT.

**Adjuster**

Put any request for information or answers in writing to the adjuster. It will send them a very obvious message that you are taking this claim seriously and it will force them to respond in kind. What is in writing carries infinitely more weight than what is spoken.
Your first request ought to be to ask your adjuster in writing to provide you a complete copy of your policy with all forms and endorsements. The policy is the instruction manual for the claim. You will need an up-to-date copy. It is free. Again – ask for it in writing.
Your adjuster is going to keep a written log of all activity associated with your claim (including conversations with you). It would be prudent for you to do likewise. Don’t let the insurance company be the only one documenting the claim.

While you wait for the certified policy, ask your insurance adjuster or agent to print out a current declarations page for you. This document will show you the policy limits for your structure, contents and additional living expenses.

**Duties under the policy**

There are certain “duties” within the policy that you have to perform after a loss in order keep your policy in force and receive the benefits to which you are entitled. One of those duties is to prevent additional damage. This means getting broken windows and doors boarded up to prevent theft and additional damage from the elements.

Have any roof damage tarped or temporarily covered. This cost will be reimbursed or paid by the insurance company. It is your responsibility to protect your property from further damage, not the adjuster. Most adjusters will know of company’s who can do this for you.

It is common to be asked to give a recorded statement. Take it seriously and be absolutely honest with every answer. Make sure you have them agree, while the tape is running, to give you a copy of the tape as well as the transcript if the recording is transcribed.

Do not allow anyone to demolish or tear out any of the damaged components. Until the structural portion of the claim is completely and finally settled the structure should remain as is. According to your policy, you have a duty to allow for the inspection of all damaged property. Destroying the “evidence” will only hurt your chances of getting fairly and completely indemnified.


**Additional Living Expenses (ALE)**

Don’t allow the insurance company to put you into temporary housing that is half the size of your damaged home. You are entitled to maintain your normal standard of living. So for the sake of your marriage and your kids, insist on accommodations and furnishings that are similar to what you enjoyed prior to the loss. The claim process is going to take longer than you are imagining right now. You will regret it if you disregard this little piece of advice, I promise.

Keep all receipts for everything purchased during this process: new clothes, laundry, eating out, etc. Just put all of them in one big envelope or file folder. You can sort them out later as you need them. This is particularly true for dining expenses. Your insurance company only owes you for any money that you spend over and above what you normally spend to eat so don’t go eating “high on the hog” thinking that the adjuster will pay for everything.
Your ALE benefits also include any furniture you might need to rent in order to have appropriate living conditions (beds to sleep in, TVs to watch etc…). Don’t’ go buying new furniture to put into your rental house/apartment because you just risk getting it banged up and scratched when you move it back to your repaired home.
If you have to drive further to work, or to your kid’s school then you will need to keep a detailed log (date, miles, and purpose) of the additional miles you incur. You are entitled to be reimbursed for this additional expense. This also holds true for the trips you might make to your damaged home to meet with adjusters, pick up the mail or feed your animals.

**Personal Property Inventory**

As soon as possible take lots of pictures of the damage, inside and out. The more the merrier. Good wide-angle shots of everything and close-ups of specifics in the most damaged areas. Things are going to disappear from the home during this process and you will be glad to have these photos.
Ask friends and family members if they have any photos of the interior of your house that may have been taken at a birthday party or some celebration around the holidays. These pictures could be extremely helpful in re-creating what was lost in the fire or tornado.

If you are too tired or too busy to put together a complete and comprehensive list of all damaged items (including spatulas, half bottles of shampoo, picture frames etc…) then please get some help from an inventory specialist. They will more than “pay their way” and take a real headache off of your plate.
Do not throw away any clothes or furniture until your adjuster has given you written authorization allowing you to do so.


**Time**

Resist the natural inclination to be in a hurry to settle your claim and see quick progress. In the long run, it will be well worth the extra time to work out a proper settlement. Speed is the enemy of a good claim and any impatience you show will be used against you.
Don’t hire any Public Adjuster until you have received a copy of the insurance company’s estimate of repair. It makes no sense to pay someone a percentage of what the insurance company is going to offer you anyway and you won’t know whether you are going to be treated fairly, or unfairly until you get your estimate. Anybody you might consider hiring to help you with your claim ought to be compensated only for the new money that they can add to the structural part of your claim.

Be very careful and go slow before you consider hiring the adjuster’s “preferred” contractor. They tend to have a very close relationship with the adjusters and, as a result, are often more interested in keeping them happy than you, the policyholder. You are a source for one job for them, but your adjuster is a potential source for many jobs both now and in the future.

Absolutely do NOT hire any contractor without first seeing a complete detailed estimate of what he intends to do and how much it will cost. This is your home, and probably your largest investment. Make sure anything you sign prior to getting a complete estimate is only allowing for temporary repair or mitigation type work – very limited authorization.",Tennessee,For those filing insurance claims please read this post

In doing this FEMA will cover ANY expenses above and beyond what your carrier will not pay you for. Including: money above your policy limits, trees and shrubs, the difference between ACV and RCV, your deductible, and they may even pay to improve stuff.

You will need to document everything on a legal pad. Who did what on what day, how many people were doing it, etc. Whether it was volunteer help or otherwise. Document it.

   It was suggested that i come here after my previous posts on r/parrots and r/rabbits, and so I am here. There will be a tl/dr at the bottom. I am very sorry about formatting, i am on mobile and have never used the reddit app before, only the desktop version.

    I desperately need someone in the middle tennessee area, preferrably closest to hohenwald, nashville, or murfreesboro, to come and take my rabbit and cockatiel for temporary shelter. The earliest we can take them back is may, latest is june. I dont have any family or friends who are able to care for them before then, and i dont have anyone who can deliver them, youd have to come to hohenwald to get them.

    I am a college student who went back for the spring semester mid january, and left my pets in the care of my nother who i very much trusted in this. However, early february she suffered a bad stroke. My grandparents have moved in to care for her, who are also wheelchair bound. It seems that no one in the house is familiar with how to care for them, and as such their condition has rapidly deteriorated.

    Lets start with the bird, Chai. She is a 1 and a half year old female cockatiel. I got her untame and before i left we were making wonderful strides. I have returned to her being in her cage 24/7 which she was hardly in at all before due to its shape (tall, not wide - she free roamed my room to fly), one of her water bowls is gone, all of her toys are gone, they had her cage next to the fucking wood stove which changes temperature frequently, and she was in the hallway where there are constantly 3 loud elders and 6 loud dogs (unable to reach her cage thank god) where constantly making noise and scaring her. They were unable to get more food for her after the first batch ran out, so now theyre feeding her a seed mix whereas before i had her on pellets and was working in some fruits and veggies, hoping to wean her off of premade foods entirely.

    The rabbit, Mocha, is worse off. She is a 4 year old unfixed female lop/lionhead mix, and they have absolutely done her a disservice. Theyve gotten rid of her cage entirely, which was big enough to feel comfortable in but she still needed to roam outside of it (she was also free roam in my room), and instead opted to put her in the bottom of the bird cage. The bird cage. Its tall rather than large, as i stated. She can hardly take a single step. They also ran out of timothy hay. They had been giving her alfalfa blocks without realizing and filled the cage with straw. She was directly next to the heater, and the dogs and noise. I cant imagine how horrible its been.

    These animals are the closest things i have to biological children. I watched Mocha take some of her first breaths. These are my babies. I know that they cant really get out of the house but that is no excuse for abusing them, let alone not even telling me about any of this before they did it.

   If anyone here is able to care for them for the next few months while we finish out the semester, me and my sister, then we will be able to give you money and send you food. You can contact me by pming me here on reddit or sending me a message on discord, Beanondastove #2263. Here are some pictures.

[This is Mocha after she tried on a shirt i got her. She didnt fancy it much. It stays in the desk now.](https://imgur.com/a/fkkOhUa)

Tl/dr I have an unfixed female rabbit and an untame female cockatiel who are my life and the person who i left them in the care of is horribly mistreating them. I need someone who can drive to Hohenwald outside of Columbia to come pick them up and care for them for a few months, we can pay.",Tennessee,I am in desperate need of someone to foster a rabbit and a cockatiel for a few months.

BY  TRAVIS LOLLER

Chattanooga Times Free Press
Mar 10, 2020

NASHVILLE — Nashville nonprofits were so overwhelmed with volunteers and donations for tornado relief over the weekend that they had to ask the helpers to take a day off.

Hands on Nashville, which operates as a clearinghouse for volunteers, posted on its blog Saturday, “Thousands of volunteers continued to knock out projects at an insane speed today! Volunteers were so effective that multiple agencies and locations have reached out to us tonight” asking to cancel various projects that had been slated for Sunday.

In addition, the Community Resource Center,

which is acting as Nashville’s main clearing house for tangible donations such as water, blankets and diapers, closed Sunday to allow staff and volunteers time to process and distribute what they had already received.

Putnam County officials also have turned away people wanting to help.

“So many people have wanted to volunteer, we had to put them on a standby list. It’s been incredible,” said Molly Brown, herself a volunteer working as the temporary spokeswoman for the Putnam County Emergency Operations Center. In her normal life, Brown is the executive director of the CookevillePutnam County Visitors’ Bureau.",Tennessee,The Volunteer State !

The university plans to transition from face-to-face instruction to online classes and alternate delivery on Monday, March 30. Students should take all technology and materials with them needed for their coursework when they leave campus for spring break. Students must regularly check their tntech.edu email for more information and updates.

534,534,TheHappyHawaiian,1584203416,fil1ej,Nan,"Can we crowdsource a list of Democrats (and Republicans if they support it) who support a large expansion of unemployment insurance in TN?  

From what I can tell via this site  [https://www.savingtoinvest.com/maximum-weekly-unemployment-benefits-by-state/](https://www.savingtoinvest.com/maximum-weekly-unemployment-benefits-by-state/)  we are tied for the worst coverage of any state, offering a max of $275 per week for 26 weeks.  WA appears the best at $790.  

I would be very happy if we massively expanded this program to be best in the nation.  I'm talking max benefits of $1000+ per week for a maximum of 52 weeks even.  As in your pay up to $1000 a week would be covered for up to 1 year.  I think we could apply something like 100% of your pay up to a $500 benefit and 50% of your pay until you max out at $1000 (this structure keeps it more progressive in nature as well).  Note that in every unemployment program you have to show proof you are looking for a job.   

Unemployment benefits act as a natural stabilizer to the economy when bad times hit, and they discourage layoffs as companies will have their insurance premiums increased following layoffs. 

This would increase taxes on businesses, but I would also be ok funding this via increased sales taxes. 

Democrats - ""sales taxes are regressive you cant increase those!""

Republicans - ""increasing taxes on businesses will destroy jobs and hurt job growth!""

Both takes are correct, but to democrats I would say a 0.5-1% increase in sales tax would be worth it as lower income, service jobs are often some of the jobs that get cut the fastest in bad times, and a longer duration of benefits massively helps the poor more than 0.5-1% increase in sales tax would hurt them.

To republicans I would argue that we are already one of the most business friendly states and that we will still draw tons of interest even if we have to increase unemployment tax rates to fund this.  WA is one of the most successful states economically (also a no income tax state btw) and they offer unemployment benefits 3x higher than ours.    


I know this is isnt supposed to be a politics subreddit, but I'm hoping we can find candidates on both sides dedicated to solving this issue.   


  
Side note: If you are going to dig into my post history you'll see I did support Andrew Yang recently because I liked his UBI idea.  I'm not lying when I say I have mostly voted Republican in my life (and will likely mostly vote republican in the future), I'm just also in favor of getting some policies in place to help normal people in this increasingly worrisome and unsteady economy.  Please don't make this a debate about national politics or Andrew Yang or UBI.

Good day! Canadian here, paying way too much attention to US politics. After Trump's acquittal, Senator Alexander got my attention. I believe I asked something along the lines of, ""With no witnesses, was this really a trial?""

To the occupant on Gnat Hill Road, my apologies for borrowing your address.

To the good people of Tennessee, I remain unapologetic about wasting this senator's time, as I feel he is wasting democracy's time (at least based on his response, that while thoughtful, was resolutely abhorrent.) In any event, I feel the least I could do is pass the response on to his constituents. ""Let the people decide.""

Good day.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;February 1, 2020  
&gt;  
&gt;Chaplain Marty Black  
&gt;  
&gt;XXXX Gnat Hill Road  
&gt;  
&gt;Manchester, TN 37355-7557  
&gt;  
&gt;Dear Marty,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for getting in touch with me and sharing your thoughts regarding the impeachment of President Donald Trump.  
&gt;  
&gt;I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution’s high bar for an impeachable offense.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no need for more evidence to prove that the president asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter; he said this on television on October 3, 2019, and during his July 25, 2019, telephone call with the president of Ukraine. There is no need for more evidence to conclude that the president withheld United States aid, at least in part, to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens; the House managers have proved this with what they call a ‘mountain of overwhelming evidence.’ There is no need to consider further the frivolous second article of impeachment that would remove the president for asserting his constitutional prerogative to protect confidential conversations with his close advisers.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation. When elected officials inappropriately interfere with such investigations, it undermines the principle of equal justice under the law. But the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year’s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate. The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Senate has spent nine long days considering this ‘mountain’ of evidence, the arguments of the House managers and the president’s lawyers, their answers to senators’ questions and the House record. Even if the House charges were true, they do not meet the Constitution’s ‘treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors’ standard for an impeachable offense.  
&gt;  
&gt;The framers believed that there should never, ever be a partisan impeachment. That is why the Constitution requires a 2/3 vote of the Senate for conviction. Yet not one House Republican voted for these articles. If this shallow, hurried and wholly partisan impeachment were to succeed, it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already exist. It would create the weapon of perpetual impeachment to be used against future presidents whenever the House of Representatives is of a different political party.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our founding documents provide for duly elected presidents who serve with ‘the consent of the governed,’ not at the pleasure of the United States Congress. Let the people decide.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,  
&gt;  
&gt;Lamar

646,646,TeamDJ,1584974803,fnl4mi,Nan,"Who here thinks Governor Lee should mandate closing all non-essential business in TN (some form of “shelter-in-place”) to help flatten the curve &amp; reduce the initial wave of transmission to ease the impending strain on hospitals? 

If you think it's a good idea to go ahead and close all non-essential businesses in Tennessee, here is a link to contact Gov Bill Lee and express this.  If enough folks contact him, it may help make a difference:

https://www.tn.gov/governor/contact-us.html

Shelter in place does not necessarily mean you'd be stuck at home indefinitely - If we modeled Kentucky, for example, all we need to do is close all non-essential businesses... you can still leave your home to exercise and perform essential tasks - groceries, bank, etc.  By closing all non-essential businesses (and limiting or banning group gatherings) we would remove the ""reason"" to go out in the first place – there’d be no reason to “go out”.  Subsequently less people would come into contact with each other.

Here is an overview of what some cities and states have enacted so far (shelter-in-place and business closure orders):

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/21/coronavirus-lockdown-orders-shelter-place-stay-home-state-list/2891193001/

I think it's only a matter of time before we will HAVE to close businesses - but it's smarter to do it sooner than later, in order to ease the impending strain on our hospitals and health care system - they simply do not have the tools and resources ready to fight this right now (ex. masks, protective equipment, ventilators, etc.).  If we can give them a bit more time that would allow them to get the tools and resources they need - 3M, Honeywell, and Tesla are in the process of manufacturing masks... and  the FDA is working on possibly approving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, but the manufacture and shipment of these drugs takes time.  

Even with “shelter-in-place” (business closure) we will assuredly still have an exponential amount of new cases, community-spread, and folks going to the hospital – however, this will help us “ease into” the impending crisis, and help reduce the strain on our hospitals.  By reducing the strain we can buy time – to learn more about how to treat the sick, gather resources (masks, medicine), keep our nurses and doctors healthy &amp; less over-worked, and prevent an overflow in hospitals and a shortage on hospital beds and ventilators.  By closing non-essential businesses, we can flatten the curve, save lives, and prevent us from having to make tough choices on who lives or dies.  

Reply to this post and let us know what you think about closing non-essential businesses.  We’d love to hear your thoughts below – and, if you’re in agreement, please contact Governor Lee.

Section 2112 states the “Waiver of the 7-Day waiting period for benefits” And accord to news articles I’ve read the funding for that money would ultimately come from the federal government. My question’s are: 

1 Due to the timing of the enactment of the CARES Act against when I initially filled for unemployment, am I eligible to receive unemployment for my waiting week? 

2 Unemployed will also receive an extra $600 from the federal government, should I be able to receive it for both weeks, for only 1 week, or none at all?",Tennessee,CARES Act Questions

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

Long time lurker - vert infrequent poster. Apologies in advance for any formatting issues. 

I was laid off on Wednesday, March 18. I attempted to file for unemployment on Friday, March 20 on the TN Department of Labor website. I discovered my SSN was attached to an old account I created long ago for a job search and had to open a help ticket on the site. I also called and left my phone number for a callback. I did receive an auto email about my ticket and it’s still open. 

However, I’ve yet to hear anything back and now; the phone number simply goes to an “ all agents are busy, please try again” message and disconnects. I’ve gotten no callbacks, emails or any communication at all except the auto reply about my ticket. 

I fully understand how busy and insane the department must be. I wanted to reach out to see if anyone else is in this kind of limbo or has been in this and if it’s been resolved. Also to see if there is any advice from the wise minds of Reddit. 

Again, I understand how unprecedented all this is and I’m doing my best to be patient.

So me and my girlfriend are living with my parents. My stepmom has become sick with a fever, and some other covid like symptoms. They are going to test her for the Covid-19 virus, but her doctor ordered that she and all people who have been staying in the house should quarantine until the results come back.

They have been monitoring temperatures for a few days on all employees, and said as long as she doesn't get a fever she doesn't need to leave.

I've never spent significant time in Knoxville. I'm 29, have a good paying steady career where I work from home, and am recently single (for about a year). I'd like to buy a small house (&lt;$200k) on a few acres within about 45 minutes of one of these cities.

So, pros and cons for both. 

1) I work from home, so job prospects aren't my main concern, but it'd be nice to have prospects just in case. Which has a better outlook economically? 

2) Which has a better social pool for young professionals, both in terms of dating and making friends? 

3) I spend a ton of time outside - hiking, kayaking, fishing, and I do a lot of volunteer trail work. This is probably the most important factor in a potential home for me.

You might find an outlet selling pizza,
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Nashville is already talking about having to significantly increase property taxes and now looking into decreasing their education budget by $100 million. 

Governor Lee is also looking a the budget and projecting changes from a drastic decrease in expected tax revenue. In the last several weeks he has already cut over $400 million from the proposed education budget. 

When you consider how much revenue that states/cities make from sales tax, income tax and capital gains taxes it makes sense that revenues will take a huge hit. Sales are way down. A significant chunk of Americans currently have no income. And the stock market is struggling as well. 

The state of Oregon is projecting that due to lost revenue they may be unable to operate basic services in 6 months. 

The state of Virginia is already counting a $2 billion loss in revenue and are looking at layoffs and eliminating raises to state employees. 

The state of Ohio is planning on needing to cut 20% of its budget.

As you may know moscow has over 400 bills sitting on his desk that have been passed by the house which is controlled by the dems while saying he will not bring them to the floor of the senate for a vote a senate I might add that is controlled by the ''republicans''.

He has called the dems the do nothing dems but these articles show that they have done alot. All bills start in the house and move to the senate and you rep is counting on you not knowing that and eating up their lies of the do nothing dems.

The only time any bills are allowed on the floor is when it is for election security so that they can block them.

Many require telescreening an additional screening to check vitals, some limited to 50 or so tests a day so you get put on a list, and some only allow elderly even though its killing young people as well.  After 3 weeks of my girlfriend and I trying to get tested, showing severe symptoms(bad asthma for me), talking to 4 different doctors, we just drove to Baptist East. The Baptist East location had run out of tests by 6pm that night when we showed up, so the next morning at 10am we went.  Within less than 45 minutes we were in and out and done.

BOTTOM LINE:

If you need a test, and are confused on how to get one, or show any minor symptoms go to Baptist East.

DOWNSIDES:
They were not very sanitary.  BE SURE TO BRING GLOVES, A MASK, AND HAND SANITIZER. They were polite but they hand you clip boards which you fill out in your car, these clip boards have 15 extra sheets still attached to them for the next person to drive up. Which proves to me that none of these clipboards are sanitized so if you get tested and dont have it, you are probably leaving with it from the pen clipboard and chair you sit in.  Also the will provide masks but not N95, and I saw one nurse brush a 50 stack of them up against a dumpster while I was there...

Wondering if anyone in TN could help me out/point in the right direction. I'm trying to get some info on the process for getting your driver's license for the first time when you're over 18 years old. It's not for me as I have mine but for a friend of mine (20'sM) who needs it. I've tried looking online but can't really find anything that helpful. Everything is geared towards teens.  

Is there anything different/needed such as having to have the permit for 180days first or can both the written and driver's test be done in one go? Has anyone had any issues in general with doing it? He's not going to be getting it any time soon since everything's locked down but wanted to get a jump on things early. We're over here in East TN if that makes a difference.

Nearly a year ago, I moved out to Erin from Connecticut to an admittedly rocky start. Honestly, I'm not yet on my own two feet entirely, and I'm working on that and myself. 

Even with that fact of my current state of affairs acknowledged, I'm rising to one hell of an occasion. I'm currently planning on starting a video game studio right here in Tennessee. 

I have a loose idea for an original IP suited for Unreal Engine 4 and I really would like to get in touch with and communicate with individuals who are straight out of college or currently in college to get this ball rolling. Hell, anyone else interested is welcome too, as long as you're dedicated and serious about this prospect as I am and have the tools and experience/know how involved with game design. 

To begin, we'll require programmers, one or two graphics artists and at least one person with marketing and finance expertise. We will have to go through an investor together and get funding- ideally, we could rent our own office space and set up our equipment and space to work there. 

I intend on being Co-founder and creative director, as I have no personal experience as of currently with the computer aspects of video game design. Admittedly, this is as new and unexplored of a prospect as it could be. 

But I'm going to do it. I truly believe in this, and I hope some good people in this subreddit who are qualified and interested do as well. 

This plan, if it goes through, can change our lives forever. I've dreamed of this since I was a little boy.
