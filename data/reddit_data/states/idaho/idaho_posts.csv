All it did was create a revolving catch and release program in which the cops took forever to responde to calls or stopped showing up all together. No additional treatment facilities have been opened and no additional job placement programs have been created. 

Get caught in a stolen car? Get a summons to court and released. Get caught driving intoxicated? Summons and release. Caught stealing less than $1000 in goods? Summons and release.

You get the idea. A lot of mandatory felony charges were reduced to misdemeanors. So please, review the information, use your voice, and dont become another Alaska where crime has continued to increase.",Idaho,Review the criminal justice legislation...

131,thisanonhasaquestion,1579923487,etlkv8,Nan,"I’m an honest, hard working individual. I came to st. Luke’s all on my own, my experience and resume earned me my interview and job offer. I had heard of other people “putting in a word” so-to-speak for friends to help them get employed, but I didn’t know to what extent this actually happened until after I was hired. 

I was in another healthcare job that was a dead end for me, so I thought working for st. Luke’s could help me find some other career path. So far, I’ve been wrong. 

Things started to get weird in my department when my supervisors only seem to hire friends of people who already worked with them, despite their professional background. They even went so far as to hire an upper level employee’s wife, in the same department. I feel like that’s very sketchy. I hear rumors of all of them spending time together outside of work. More than just casual “happy hour after work Friday” 

I take pride in whatever I do, and seek to constantly improve and find ways of making things more efficient. I like good time management, but I’m very detailed and articulate and appreciate clear and open communication. I don’t remember the last time I was late to work. I have shown up on time or early for the past year. I have complied with everything they have asked me to do, met every expectation, and strived to exceed it. 

There was a recent reorganization of management in my department, which provided me a new supervisor who instantly noticed that I’ve been going the extra mile, for years now. She submitted a glowing review of my work to her manager for a promotion that I probably deserved a while ago. When this was brought to my managers director, my two previous supervisors felt the need to step in and give their opinion on my character. Referring to me as “unapproachable”. I try to hard to be kind to everyone I work with. I am always holding the door open for people, holding the elevator, building a good relationship to the members on my own team. They want to see improvement in my openness to others?? 

I just... What? What more do they want from me? And what did I ever do to deserve this personal vendetta against me?

Anyways, unless you’re a physician of sorts, don’t work for St. Luke’s because you’ll just be exploited for your kindness, dedication, and hard work. Unless of course, your best friend is the supervisor.",Idaho,"My supervisors at St. Luke’s are stunting my career growth, but giving promotional favors to individuals close to them outside of work."

One of my top reasons to move is the proximity too outdoor activities. I enjoy hiking, backpacking, trail running, kayaking, and skiing. Other things that appeal to me include individual liberty, clean air, no traffic and a slower paced life. I'm originally born and raised in southern Ohio so I have seen/heard my fair share of ignorance but nothing has ever happened to me. The thing is I think that Idaho is on a whole other level. It seems like the true wild wild west were people can do whatever they want and don't want anyone new to come in. If I move to Idaho I plan to explore the state. I don't want to move too Boise and have to stay in a safe bubble. For example, I want to be able to enjoy the beauty of Coeur d'Alene without feeling out of place or unwanted.

Sorry if this is a silly question, but I'm driving home from Portland to Albuquerque in early to mid April, and I'm wondering if the route is safe that time of year?  I'll be taking I-84 through Twin Falls and dropping down to SLC.  

I'm debating leaving somewhere between April 1-15, and want to avoid any lingering snow if possible.  I've never driven this route, so I'm not entirely sure what to expect.

Boise is definitely rapidly growing and the suburbs around it as well. 

Are the projections for growth in Coeur d'Alene a bit off? Also, how much snow does Boise get compared to Coeur d'Alene. I wonder if Coeur d'Alene gets less being closer to the ocean or does being more north and mountainous means it gets more? (Seems like 4.5 hours to Ocean in Seattle, WA compared to Boise being 8 hrs 45 minutes to Newport, OR)

Boise seems like a valley and not as tall mountains and also more south, so maybe less snow or shorter snow season? Seems like both places get alot of gloom like Oregon and Washington.",Idaho,"Coeur d'Alene, Idaho vs Boise Idaho growth"

My friend has been living there for about 2 months and takes his friends car to work while his car has been in Sacramento. He recently asked me to drive it over to Coeur d’Alene so he can have his own car again. He says the drive isn’t bad and it will be fine. So I agreed. Now my parents think the drive is super scary and unsafe because of the “SNOW”. Is there anything I should be aware of or know before I make the 2 day trip? Snow tires? Slippery roads? Drive slower in wet weather? My parents insist that the snow will make the roads impossible to drive on but I looked at the weather and it says it’s just going to rain. I have driven further to Arkansas and Texas, which is obviously different weather. Just let me know if I need to be prepared for anything. Apologies for the run on sentences I’m out at a dinner thing.

Every show I do this year raises money for dog rescue. We're at over $17,000 and climbing!

I am doing this because of how important my dog was to me. Walter traveled with me to 48 states (and 6 provinces), and was my constant companion on the road. So I decided to help save a few more Walters.

We donate 25% of every show and the charities I choose in each city don't know I'm doing this til after I announce it - makes it more fun that way.

You may also read this if you don't have tickets, but it may be a waste of your time. You have tons of COVID-19 emails to read from companies you bought one thing from 7 years ago. 

We are cancelling the Yakima show as it's at a venue above the state-recommended 250 capacity. Those who bought tickets will automatically receive a full refund. All the other venues are at 250 or fewer, and we are not currently planning on cancelling those shows. 

We are, however, offering refunds to anyone who has purchased tickets that does not feel comfortable attending. If you are 60 years or older, we recommend you take us up on this offer. This goes for Eugene, Everett, Vancouver, Kelowna, Richland, Spokane, Moscow, Couer d'Alene, and Seattle. (That is for the city of Eugene Oregon, not just a guy named Eugene). If you'd like a refund, please email refunds@stevehofstetter.com before Monday March 16th so he has time to process all of them. Please include the name you purchased tickets under and the date/time &amp; city of the show. 

As the situation develops, we will be making decisions on future tours as well. 

In the interests of public health, there will be a few changes at the meet and greet after the shows. As much as I want to shake hands with everyone, there will be absolutely no physical contact post-show, even for pictures. Also, sales will be credit card only to avoid the transfer of cash between parties. The good news is we will still be selling shirts. Even if you don't like the shirts, they can be useful in a post-toilet paper society. (If you're one of those selfish toilet-paper hoarding monsters, I hope you get crushed by a giant pile of it).

If you do attend, of course, I'd love to see you. After the show, we will wave at each other longingly, like one of us is on a train slowly pulling away from the station. 

I do ask that you be mindful of your fellow patrons. Please, please, please wash your hand thoroughly before and after the show. (And just in general, you dirty dirty boy).

One last thing: the name of this virus is Covid-19, commonly referred to as Coronavirus. It is not called the ""China Virus"" unless you are an asshole trying to scare racist people.

Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour today so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to Eugene, Everett, Vancouver, Kelowna, Yakima, Richland, Spokane, Moscow, Couer d'Alene, and Seattle will be getting a refund. I am also offering to send $20 to Eugene Levy, Eugene Merman, and Gene Wilder. I just hate cancelling on Eugene. 

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Seattle already has two more shows scheduled for July 10th). Meanwhile, I will be hosting a few free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.) Mainly Q&amp;As, but maybe I'll invite some friends over and we'll live stream some stand-up. I know we could all use a distraction. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the live stream, and the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see. 

Meanwhile, stay healthy and keep your head up. I mean, it's kind of cool we all get to be in a disaster movie. 

Hugs,

A couple of years back they got into a tragic car accident that left them half deaf and with serious back problems.   After that they found themselves homeless living in their car while having those terrible disabilities.

They are now in a place with their own room and their cats. However they suffer from plenty of disabilities, fear, and anxiety. Everyday, they spend most of the time inside their room. Helping around the house as much as possible whole sometimes making their back worse. It's a chronic pain for them day and night.

They want to work, they have experience with customers, they use to work at call center before the accident. Very friendly person and with the desire to work. Mid 20s.  Unfortunately, even though they have applied to jobs opportunities, because of the disabilities they are not considered.

Quark : ""Let me tell you something about hewmons, nephew. They're a wonderful, friendly people, as long as their bellies are full and their holosuites are working. But take away their creature comforts, deprive them of food, sleep, sonic showers, put their lives in jeopardy over an extended period of time, and those same friendly, intelligent, wonderful people will become as nasty and violent as the most bloodthirsty Klingon. You don't believe me? Look at those faces. Look in their eyes. You know I'm right, don't you? Well? Aren't you going to say something? "" Nog : ""I feel sorry for the Jem'Hadar.""

So i just wanted to gauge what the sentiment towards Hispanics is in Idaho, preferably from Hispanics themselves because they might have personal experiences of racism against them. The reason I ask is because my parents are getting old and it is simply too expensive for them to live in California so they are looking for other states to move to so they can purchase a house and just live out the rest of their golden years without financial worries. We’re from Ecuador and my dad is a bit darker skinned, my mom lighter skin. I’ve seen videos of Idaho and I think it’s beautiful but I’m just worried that they might encounter racism up there like name-calling, poor treatment or worse get attacked by anyone just because they are “Mexicans.”

482,bobsburgs1,1584638959,fldyb3,Nan,"Just in case people are not aware, you can collect unemployment if you are temporarily out of work or if your hours have been cut to less than full time. You can still receive partial unemployment if you do not make more than 1.5 times your maximum unemployment benefit. Your maximum benefits changes based off your income, but in Idaho the maximum anyone can receive is $405 a week. 

This means that if you are working reduced hours, less than full time, because of COVID-19, you are (most likely) eligible for partial unemployment as long as you make less than $600 a week. Your actual unemployment benefit will vary based off your weekly pre-tax income. If you make less than 1/2 of you maximum benefit, you are eligible for your entire weekly benefit. If you make between 1/2 to 1.5 times your maximum benefit, you are eligible for your maximum weekly benefit minus your income above 1/2 your maximum weekly benefit. If you make over 1.5 times your maximum weekly benefit, you are not eligible for partial unemployment. 

Let’s say you are eligible for $400 a week. If you make below $200 a week, you will receive your entire $400 unemployment. 

If you make $350 a week, your weekly benefit would be $250 a week. Math: $350 minus half of your maximum weekly benefit ($200) is $150. Your maximum weekly benefit ($400) minus $150 is $250. 

If you make $500 a week, your weekly benefit would be $100 a week. Math: $500 minus half of your maximum weekly benefit ($200) is $300. Your maximum weekly benefit ($400) minus $300 is $100. 

If you are self-employed, you likely do not qualify for unemployment unless you are incorporated and have paid into unemployment insurance. However, there is the [Disaster Unemployment Assistance](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/597) that *may* become available at some point. People who do not qualify for normal unemployment assistance, such as the self-employed and those in the gig economy, qualify for that. 

If you are temporarily not working because your employer has closed for the time being, I would recommend you apply for unemployment ASAP. It usually take about a week for unemployment assistance to start. You can apply online at https://www2.labor.idaho.gov/ClaimantPortal/Login

Here are some sources with FAQ about unemployment assistance:

Since someone asked me to ask about the situation here and I want you to update.

Let me talk about the city where we are in. Hang Zhou city lockdown policy has been cancelled for about 2 weeks. Yesterday evening, hang zhou government ordered to cancel health code and inspection. Before going in and out of the mall? Places today, there is no measurement. There is no officer sitting in front of the mall. No health code check. It can go in and out of places as usual, but in detail of entertainment places including the total bath or soak places. Hot Springs. I think it can't be open yet.

Most people are still wearing masks. There are very few people who don't wear masks. It's about 100:1 people remove the mask at the park at little people. But if they enter the mall or supermarket, we still wear it as usual. Personally, we still keep health as usual. Personally. I still don't trust to go back to a hundred percent normal life. Even though there is no law to control, but people here are cooperating with health and social distancing very well.

If everyone is together, start with ourselves. Stay healthy, avoid seeing people. If there is no need, Thailand will pass too. I'm rooting for you.",Idaho,Notes from my adopted Thai daughter that lives in China and made it through the epidemic and lock down

“SHARED POST:
HERE'S THE TRUTH BEHIND THE WUHAN VIRUS:

Bill Gates &amp; Barack Obama released a docuseries on Netflix called PANDEMIC in January right before the Wuhan virus was ""discovered.""

The docuseries pushed the need for the Gates Foundation to receive funding to carry on virus research to prevent the next PANDEMIC!

Bill Gates-funded the Wuhan lab in China that released the Wuhan virus. Bill Gates' was a member of China's Academy of Sciences who built the lab and he was awarded their highest honor.

The Wuhan virus was originally developed at the University of North Carolina by NIH grants approved by the Obama administration in 2012.

The NIH defunded the UNC research in 2016 so the Communist Chinese scientists left UNC and took their work to the NEWLY BUILT Wuhan lab in 2017 - funded by Gates &amp; pals.

The head of the Harvard Chemistry department, with ties to Gates &amp; Epstein, was arrested for accepting bribes from the Communists. Did Epstein know what was coming?

The Pirbright Institute, funded by Bill Gates, owns the ""patent"" on the Coronavirus genetic sequencing. They did simulation testing on a global PANDEMIC in 2018.

Bill Gates &amp; Barack Obama docuseries marketed the need for a global ""universal"" vaccine to replace all other flu vaccines. I believe it will be designed to deliver a human chip via nanotechnology.

12,469 people in the US died of H1N1 flu (from Mexico) under Obama in 2009, many of them children, because he waited 6 months to do anything &amp; never closed the border.

The media said nothing about fatalities from H1N1 but is creating a huge panic around the 20 US deaths from the Wuhan virus to destroy the US economy before the election.

Over 36,000 people in the US have died from the common flu this year and the media says NOTHING about that - but is creating a huge panic around the 20 US deaths from the Wuhan virus.

18 out of the 20 total US deaths from the Wuhan virus have come from a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington - the home area of Bill Gates.

Half the staff at that nursing home have been infected with Wuhan virus. They appear to be the carriers. The nursing home draws employees from a large Chinese population across the border in Canada. I believe Gates is placing carriers in vulnerable locations for the narrative and funding.

Right after the first deaths were reported in Bill Gates home area, the Governor declared a national emergency &amp; Congress approved over $8 billion - even though Trump asked for only a quarter of that. Much of the funding will flow to Gates' global partners.

Suddenly Bill Gates says his ""foundation"" will offer in-home testing kits where you swab your nose with a Q-Tip and send it to his labs. How convenient!

19 out of the 21 who tested positive on the Princess Cruise ship were CREW MEMBERS. Meaning the crews are carriers and are infecting passengers. Who put them there?

The virus started in South Korea because the leaders of a ""doomsday"" cult went to Wuhan, China and went back and infected 8,000 of their members. Who paid them to do that?

Iran's leaders suddenly became infected after Iran's foreign leader met with John Kerry in Munich and laughed about the virus on camera. Almost like he was told to go home and create panic.

All those videos out of Communist China of them disinfecting the streets, people dying on the streets and thrashing bodies - were all fake and sent out by Communist propagandists.

Real videos show Hong Kong freedom fighters being rounded up in handcuffs and sent off to the ""hospital"" where it's likely their organs are harvested and they are cremated.

Real videos show elderly people in Communist China trapped in buildings and left to die with no food.

Real videos show that Communist China installed major NEW surveillance cameras and technology to monitor people on the street &amp; in their offices since the virus was released.

Real videos show the Chinese people yelling ""IT'S ALL FAKE"" from high rises as the Communists pretend to care for them on the streets below.

They are now forced to use an app which tells them when they can come and go and tracks their every move. How did the Communists suddenly develop this technology in a month? This was part of the plan.

After Trump closed travel from Communist China in January, the Chinese blamed the US and threatened to hold back our pharmaceuticals unless we opened travel back up again. They didn't expect him to do that - that thwarted their plans to seed the US with more cases.

I believe the virus is no more dangerous than the common cold - but has been engineered to be highly infectious and impact the elderly &amp; sick. Thankfully, it is NOT affecting children &amp; young adults like pandemic flu does.

I believe the virus was unleashed by the Communist Party to scare people back into their homes and stop the Hong Kong &amp; Taiwanese pro-freedom protests.

I believe the virus was unleashed by the Communists to crash the US economy &amp; drive people away from Trump rallies.

I believe the virus was unleashed to help the Communists assert global control and to cull the elderly and weak.

ALL respiratory viral outbreaks peak in March and end in April. I believe this one too.

The SARS Coronavirus panic dropped the market 20% in March 2003, under Bush, and it came roaring back even higher by July. In other words, they've done this before to a Republican administration before an election.

Now the fake news is trying to distance Wuhan from the virus -- and so is Communist China. That means we're right over the target.

I am looking into employment in the area and have been in contact with a few businesses, my wife works full time from home. I also have a degree in Criminal Justice and would enjoy law enforcement, which I am looking into.  We are from northern Wisconsin. We just moved to Western Washington and realized this is not the place for us and we may have over shot our target coming out here. 

The biggest road block we are running into is finding a place to live. We originally never planned on moving and therefore we have 2 Siberian Huskies. They are very trained and are extremely well behaved. We also have a house cat (she's fat, lazy and we'll behaved). Trying to find a find a rental and then making them believe you that your dogs are well behaved is near impossible, especially when you can't talk face to face or have them meet the animals. 

We also currently live in a 5th wheel (we wanted to try out the ""tiny living"" thing) but, with the dogs it's almost impossible to live in a campground. 

My question is, does anyone in the area know of someone who has a rental house or property that would be willing to rent to us? Or know of a way to get more leads on places? (We've all buy exhausted Zillow, Facebook marketplace and Trulia). 

I hope this isn't to far out there and that this is an okay way to ask, we're just running out of time in the place we are now and would like to get back on track with living our lives.

639,robsantos,1585896661,fu3if4,Nan,"I'm not a Californian by any stretch but I spend most of the winter in Southern California. A couple days before CA locked down I got in my car, drove straight to the panhandle where I live. I showed no symptoms and felt fine, but I used gloves at every gas station to make sure I wasn't spreading anything I might have. I didn't eat any drive through food to avoid potentially exposing someone. Slept in my f'in car so I didn't spread it to a hotel. I then hunkered down for 2 weeks at home, didn't goto the grocery store, didn't goto to a single business. Ate what boring dry food I had. Finally on day 14, I went to the grocery store, covered my hands, wore a mask. I was the only one like that in a fairly busy store, no remote attempt at social distancing, no precautions and constant gawks. My conservative older friends all seem to think this is a joke or a conspiracy and take offense I won't see anyone.

What the hell is going on? Have I lost my mind? Does no one care? I desperately want life to go back to how it was just a few weeks ago, but at this pace, I feel like this Covid-19 nightmare that we're enduring is going to last all summer.",Idaho,What's the deal? (COVID-19)
