I've been teaching for the last eight years in NYC. I have my professional license in childhood education (1-6), special education (1-6), and a master's degree in educational leadership. What are the job prospects like for educators Baltimore? I am mostly interested in working for public schools.

Another concern I have is whether or not one can live comfortably on a teacher's salary in Baltimore. Teachers are paid well in NYC, but NYC is no longer conducive to the lifestyle for my family and I. I've heard all the horror stories about Baltimore. I made it in NYC, I'll make it anywhere. My question is two fold: Can one live comfortably on a teacher's salary in Baltimore? Lastly, how expensive are family health benefits? I looked into it and it seems like medical coverage as offered by BCPS for a family would cost close to $150 per month. My husband and I are planning to visit Baltimore to check out a few neighborhoods, as we are looking to purchase a home if we relocate.

There is zero reason we can't do that again, and so much more.

Baltimoreans can't handle five bad years without acting like nothing can ever be good again?

Think back to how things WERE looking before everything went sideways. When some people still thought we could do big things.

AND THERE'S NO REASON WE STILL CAN'T!

Why doesn’t Baltimore get this. One of the biggest ways to reduce crime is to raise property value and draw investment. 

That’s about: 

cleaning streets
increasing walkability 
more public trash bins 
more benches 
better bus shelters 
more tree lined streets 
wider greener street medians 
better litter pickup 
reducing natural overgrowth on bridges and roadways around Leakin Park 
Maintains park trails
better housing code enforcement 
clean it or lien it programs 
working streetlights 
maintains water bodies (opposite of Druid park reservoir) 
Mandating more desirable and well maintained signage for small businesses 
Better signage indicating destinations 
Renovating city parks and playgrounds(like Ellwood Park) 

This stuff gets ignored in Baltimore (and Philly) but are top priorities in Boston NYC and DC and have been since the beginning of their Renaissance’s. 

Better aesthetics can Increase property values, and thus tax revenue, thus increasing the quality of services allowing larger budgets for beautification thus pricing out some criminal element.

This makes it particularly challenging to get in touch with a someone who actually does help with the certification. However, I found one nurse practitioner (who is on the list) who returns phone calls and who does help with the certification.  Her name is Angela Awuah and she is based out of the St. Agnes medical center. She is kind and understanding. All she needed from me was my paperwork showing my current and qualifying diagnoses and my MMCC ID# (print your approval email if you can).

I've always thought that one of the easiest ways to curb a lot of city issues (gangs, drugs, squeegee kids, etc.) would be offer free long term effective bc to teens (iuds, implants). BC is hella easier and cheaper than some of the gnarly solutions we've tried with fixing the schools, the police dept, etc. A lot of those problems start with kids who get no parenting- partially because their mom was 15, dad was mia, and its been like that for generations in some families.  If these kids had even one good parent at home there is no way they'd be panhandling at street corners or dealing drugs so young.

But maybe the city has tried this and it's failed to make a real difference? Of course the effects wouldn't be immediate. We'd have to figure out how to change a culture of having kids really young, which is probably harder to do than just handing out condoms.

217,217,webhead311,1578601843,emffx1,Nan,"So on November my old landlord made me move out of my apt because there was a leak and he said it may be coming from my bathroom. He is now blaming me for the leak by accusing me of replacing the shower head which is now loose in most likely causing the leak. 

The problem is I didn’t replace any shower head. It was done by the old tenant. In fact I am certain he knows it but still is attempting to charge me. Also, the bathroom  had a prior leak from the shower tap a few months after I moved in. I told him about it and he had someone come in there to “fix” it. I have a feeling that this is tied with that prior leak.

Unfortunately I don’t have any pictures of when I moved in with the shower head in it and I lost the last tenants number(I do know her name tho). 

I’d like to know 

1) does Baltimore provide any service that protect tenants from this sort of situation?

2) is there any way I could get the old tenants number so she can potentially testify that she installed the shower head? (I’m sure the landlord has it but I highly doubt he’d give me it)

3) will I have to take this to court? The security deposit was $750 but he wants to take all of that plus charge me $449.99",baltimore,"[HELP] My ex-landlord is trying to not only take my security deposit, but charge me for something I didn’t do!"

Notably, these statements are rarely accompanied by either examples of Republican policy that would benefit Baltimore OR any introspection as to why the GOP has failed to capture much favor in the city.   


I was once a registered Republican and I have some thoughts on what conservatives need to address if they want to win Baltimore.   


1)If you think the people of Baltimore are voting for Democrats because they are stupid or they are progressive commies, then you fundamentally misunderstand the zeitgeist of Baltimore. You need to try to understand why they vote how they vote instead of dismissing 600,000 people. 

\*\*Don't tell people what you think they need, instead listen.\*\* The Republican party is an outsider in Baltimore. Yet all I see is a lot of people telling Baltimore what it needs to do or who it needs to vote for. I don't see a lot of attempt to reach any understanding. 

2)People aren't particularly open to Republicans because Republicans have proved to be outright hostile to urban communities.  If you tell someone to their face that you aren't going to help them and you aren't really interested in helping them then, no, they aren't voting for you. Maybe Democrats fail on their promises, but at least they make them.

3)The reality is that there are many conservative minded people in cities. But at the end of the day a lot of these conservatives vote overwhelmingly Democrat because the Republican party has actively pushed urban voters away.  


4) Show me the Republican party can get results for cities. The GOP has won 3 of the last 5 Gubernatorial elections in Maryland and...what exactly has been done to prove that we should extend that leadership to Baltimore? 

\*\*If you're a conservative in the Baltimore area and you want a Republican mayor, you should be demanding Larry Hogan change his tone\*\* 

5) Give us a real platform. What EXACTLY are you going to do differently? Sometimes I hear ""We'll audit everything!"" OK then what? 

6) \*\*Advocate, don't hate.\*\* Tell us what you want to do, not why we're all stupid cucks.",baltimore,How Republicans can win Baltimore. Hint: Telling Baltimoreans that they are stupid isn't the way

There have been multiple FBI raids, and I have been told by a reputable source,  Kirby Fowler prior president of the downtown partnership, that the owners have political connections and gang leaders use the clubs as meeting places, which I know sounds like dramatic BS but you can take it or leave it.

I also believe they are used for sex trafficing and other crimes .  And even if you don't care about all of that, many areas have been rejuvenated after strip clubs are removed, being about economic development in that area.

I found out about [Thread](https://www.thread.org/).org from a Reddit post a little over 2 years ago, and I consider this post as a way of paying it forward. :). Going to try to making the post short and clear:

**What is Thread:** It's a nonprofit in Baltimore which creates a community/network for at-risk young people in Baltimore. Young people are ""enrolled"" in Thread at the age of 15, and Thread makes a commitment to them for 10 years. Volunteers at Thread make a commitment for 1 year (but realistically many volunteers continue supporting the young people for many years). Each young person has 2-4 volunteers assigned to him/her who support/mentor/bug and in general form a real relationship with the young person.

**Why should you join Thread:** You'll form meaningful relationships with your student and fellow volunteers. You'll connect to your city in a completely different way. You'll be challenged and transformed. You'll make real impact (data time: expected graduation rate of the students that are selected for Thread is 6%, historically  about 80% of Thread students graduated).

**Where will I volunteer:** Thread is ""based"" in Dunbar, ACCE, Frederick Douglass and Digital Harbor. Likely you'll spend time with students in those locations.

**Will you be asked for money:** No. In fact Thread provides resources to help volunteers form meaningful relationships (meals with students and lyft/taxi are are compensated by Thread).

**How much commitment do I have to make:** Complicated question as it will be different based on both the volunteers and the student, but in my opinion you should make an effort to see your young person at least once a week. So a few hours per week is a realistic expectation for a fully year. You'll need to attend a few training sessions and go threw background check before becoming part of Thread. Volunteers comes from all walks of life, some are college students that leave for the summer, some travel for work, so Thread does make it work for different circumstances.

**I can't make a commitment of volunteering with a young person, are there any other ways to volunteer:** Yes. Thread does look for [resources/collaborators](https://www.thread.org/get-involved/collaborate/) who will provide some pro-bono work.

# To Join Thread fill out this [form](https://www.thread.org/get-involved/volunteer/).

**tldr:** Make a difference in the life of a young person by volunteering and creating a meaningful relationship, join Thread.

========

**Personal PS:** I am not a Thread employee. I just volunteer. Thread has over 1000 (maybe 2000+?) volunteers. Everyone has a different experiences. Thread has real challenges and growing pains, but they have their hearts in the right place and are making immense contribution to Baltimore in small steps. ***Please feel free to reply or DM if you have any questions about Thread.***",baltimore,Looking to make a difference in Baltimore.

I am in town to be a medical buddy for a family member that is at John Hopkins. All went great with the surgery, have the night off and get to stay in the hotel instead of the hospital. So walking back I stop at the 7 Eleven across from the hotel and get a coke and ask the cashier where can get a pint of bourbon. I want to celebrate a little and relax. He asked walking or driving and I say walking. He responds by saying yeah I would not do that it is not safe. The other cashier say ""umm hmmm its after 6, you need to do anything like that before 6."" To the left in the corner of my eye see a cop and look his way and he looks at me and says ""yeah they probably kill you"". And they all laughed.

For context it might help to say I am a southern white boy visiting your town. 

So am in my room now with 2 shots of bourbon I got from the hotel bar for $20, still happy as a lark with the result of the surgery safely enjoying my over priced bourbon.

My name is Jennifer Hijazi and I'm a climate change law reporter with E&amp;E News (Environment and Energy News) in DC (you can find us here: [https://www.eenews.net/eep](https://www.eenews.net/eep) )

The City of Baltimore has a big lawsuit running against oil companies to pay for the internal costs of climate change as things like health problems, sea level rise, flooding, extreme weather, etc get worse for the city. 

I'm working on a story on these climate effects and am looking for residents who are experiencing damages firsthand: specifically extreme flooding and heat effects. I'm looking now, for instance, at the Frederick Ave flooding from 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll put a couple of observations below and you guys can respond to them and or add your own:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Major city status-Baltimore is a major city. Obviously, not as big as say, NYC, LA,  or Chicago, but bigger than Pittsburgh, Miami, Atlanta, and a few others, and comparable to many in size such as Portland, Seattle, etc (I'm including here only the population of the cities themselves, not the metropolitan area, although in that respect, Baltimore is comparable to many metro areas, and even bigger if included with DC). It's a major East Coast and national economic engine,yet many do not treat it or talk about it as a major city. Why is that? what is needed to change this perception?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Related to the above is how Marylanders in general, and people in the counties treat the city. There seems to be this anger towards the city. Did Baltimore do something to these people personally? It seems as if they would rather see the city go down in flames than help it change, they shoot down or road block proposals that could help the city, and help them too by potentially bringing more prosperity and safety to their communities. But it seems like they would rather sit justified in their anger, and heap loads of negativity on anything and everything associated with the city. What is needed to change this?

&amp;#x200B;

let me know what you think, because I think the mayoral candidates need to be thinking about this as well. i think this question is an important one for the upcoming election.

1) I arrived promptly at 8am along with 500 or so of my fellow sisters and brethren. Together, we eagerly awaited our calling in nature's heart warming embrace, a staggering 18 degrees. The shepherds eventually let us pass, after emptying our pockets and parsing our souls for any inequities. 

2) Unperturbed, we were led into the anteroom. It was here where we remained motionless for 3 hours as we cast our eyes upon modern cinema, Hidden Figures followed by Annie. 

3) A voice from God warned us at inception that our joyous commitment would require no less than the entirety of earth's rotation around its axis. Prescient, it was.

4) Shortly after a hard knock life treated our lobes, the voice of God returned, this time with instruction. We were ushered into the court room.

5) Hammerman, complete with gavel and cape, asked me, along with 90 of my closest disciples, a series of questions that could only be addressed after the hours-long spiritual journey we had endured. The crowd, yearning for purpose, answered Hammerman's questions by raising their (dis)qualifying hands at every possible opportunity. 

6) At last, judgement beckoned. Herds were called upon in groups of six to stand before our tribe. With a swift unprejudiced glance, Hammerman and his angelic associates deemed us worthy or unworthy based on our dashing phenotypes and visually unobservable qualifications. 

6) Those with a higher calling shared their delight with followers. Not a spoken word, for their faces and eyes beared deep rejoicing.",baltimore,A chirp on jury duty

I am constantly bombarded by people both at my college and from home (from a rural area) who are in disbelief that I would want to stay in Baltimore, but I do. In fact, I've already pretty much decided I am staying--helped by the fact I have a job offer from the Baltimore City Police Department.

As someone who has spent a good part of their university studying health disparities in the city, I know damn well the terrible history this city has with its police and I don't think it's a stretch to say it might be the worst such relationship in America. I also understand it has historically been one of the most corrupt police departments in America.

All of that being said, this city needs good cops. Not a surprise to anyone here, gun violence in this city is not getting better. The weekend I took my physical fitness test for the department, [a two-year old was shot in the chest over a traffic dispute](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-javon-johnson-20191014-20191014-yzk6lpxzbjgvlnlscrszbn4h3y-story.html). This is just one example of some of the egregious crimes that we've seen in this city, and they don't appear to be getting better.

Almost everyone I've told about me being a cop has been negative. People are worried for my safety due to the city's reputation. Some people have general anti-police sentiments, which I try to understand. Some people are critical of the department's lack of diversity, and I don't make that any better as a white male.

But aside from all of this, I want to do it. People call 911 on the worst days of their lives, and they (should) expect competent people to be on the other end of that line that can take care of them and take care of the issue, and I believe I am capable of being that person.

So my request is your thoughts. I have a few questions and would like your answers/opinions/questions/anything. Feel free to answer any or none of them or to say something I hadn't thought of. 1) What are some things you wished the BPD would do that they don't? 2) What are some things you wished the BPD wouldn't do that they do? 3) Whats a good/bad experience you've had with a BPD officer? 4) What are some policies you wish the department would get rid of or add?

That's all I can think of right now, but feel free to bring something up that I didn't think of.

There are a few well composed points in this letter to The Sun, but some of the specific points about local media are very much in line with my own thoughts on the matter. From the piece: 

&gt;An evening rarely passes in Baltimore without the nightly TV newscasts offering brief, lurid accounts of violent crime. These “breaking news” stories typically run less than 30 seconds. Never mind the urgency of these broadcasts. **A viewer expecting a more contextualized follow-up later — one in which those affected by the violence would be illuminated and brought into sharper focus — would be disappointed.**    
&gt;  
&gt;And, in Baltimore, whether these crime stories appear on television, online or in print media, there is a recurrent, almost obsessive, emphasis on counting murders and sometimes comparing this year’s count to previous years’ counts, or, during especially violent years like 2019, speculating on whether that year’s count will surpass Baltimore’s highest count ever: 1993’s 353.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Frequently, these quick-hitting news items are so thin and dismissive — little more than basic facts such as date, time, gender of victim, location of shooting — that it feels like the counting is the sole point.**  
&gt;  
&gt;All of the tallying can feel like news reporters are keeping score, and the unthinkable gets thought: Do news outlets reporting crime want the number of homicides to be bigger or smaller?",baltimore,Baltimore crime and how the media contributes to negative perceptions

A self-described boutique developer, real estate investor and urban planner, Kahan S. Dhillon Jr. will get a chance to pitch his idea, dubbed The Baltimore Renaissance, next week before a City Council committee, but the number is so eye-popping and Dhillon is such an unknown quantity that the proposal has drawn skepticism from some local officials and real estate professionals who have made a living building in Baltimore.

* And Jan 19, 2019 /u/gabethegeek posted [a podcast from WYPR](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/aigsn2/nothing_sums_up_baltimore_more_then_this_podcast/) that is absolutely worth listening to. It's long but you have to hear this guy talk and hear the people who believed in him talk.   

&amp;nbsp;

TL:DL - this guy Dhillon rolls into town saying he has BILLIONS to spend in Baltimore to revitalize the city, and doesn't want anything in return. City Hall gives him a hearing and the guy just talks in circles and pulls every shady used car salesman tactic and trick you can imagine.  Some speculate he's an undercover FBI agent trying to offer things to people to get them arrested, but nobody really knows who he is. He's filed a ""declaration of intent"" rather than him just being listed as an active entrant for the mayoral race, and he's filed as ""Unaffiliated"".

My dad (58) has been in the food service industry all his life. He never got the chance to go to college and it KILLS him. He makes $20/hour now at a grocery store, which is good, but the labor is killing him. He works 50 hours a week typically, on his feet all day, manual labor. 

My siblings and I have tried for literally years helping him apply to other jobs, but we can't get anything to stick! He's an extremely hard worker, dedicated, friendly. He's an introvert which I think hurts him when interviewing, also the fact that age discrimination is VERY real. :( His employer now won't promote him because they know they'll never find anyone like him for customer service roles.

Does anyone know, or is willing to hire, a good, honest man for any type of administrative/accounting/remote job, basically anything?? He has experience with QuickBooks, customer service, food industry (trying to get away from that), etc. He has an accounting certificate from an online school.

Most commercial rodenticide (rat/mouse) poison is designed to take a day or so to work. This means there is usually a window where the dog/pet can be treated if they got into rat poison. Rat poison works by making the rodent bleed out. As such, many poisons can be countered by massive doses of vitamin K. 

**bold** If your pet consumes rat poison they will likely have bright green or blue poop in the next day or so. It will look odd, almost like they've chewed up and eaten a NERF ball.

667,667,SpacePueblo,1580223002,ev6iyw,Nan,"I'll start out by saying I am not an expert on public transportation. I'm just a Baltimore City resident interested in conversations about the improvement on public transportation in this city. That said I wanted to share an idea (not a new one) and wanted to see what others thought of it. 

Back in 2005, Mexico city, in the midst of a congestion crisis implemented the Metrobus system. The Metrobus is not a train or a trolley, nor is it really a bus. It's a hybrid of the two. It's been about 15 years since the metrobus was implemented and it's been a hit over there. I wonder if it could work here in Baltimore

What it is: It's an extended bus, usually three bus lengths long, that runs on dedicated (blocked off) lanes and  has elevated stations along the route. 

It's basically what we already have downtown with the dedicated bus lanes except with bigger buses, better stations, and lanes that cars can't get into. 

Pros

* It's cheaper to implement than a trolley since there are no tracks required 
* The use of blocked off dedicated lanes prevents cars from driving in it 
* It's fast 
* Could provide the much needed east-west traffic 

Cons

* Taking away lanes from drivers in Maryland is a hard sell 
* The city itself might be too small for this to be efficient. 

Again, not an expert. Just wanted to introduce another option to the conversation. You can check out the Metrobus website (it's in spanish) [here](https://www.metrobus.cdmx.gob.mx/) and check out some [footage](https://youtu.be/woa0LxfY2JQ?t=57) of it in action",baltimore,An Idea for Baltimore Transportation

They are going to be publicly posting the recording of it sometime soon, so we'll be able to share it here. I'll try to give my thoughts on some of the notable stuff:

-Jack Young did not attend. All of the other major candidates, and most of the other less-well-known candidates did as well. From what I can gather, Jack Young has skipped many of these forums.

-The format allowed each candidate, in alphabetical order, to talk for three minutes, then the audience could line up to ask questions of any or all candidates. Basically whichever candidate could get to the podium first got to answer the questions. Unfortunately, this meant that several candidates dominated the speaking time.

-Believe it or not, some of the lesser candidates gave the best speeches. Rikki Vaughn almost got a standing ovation from the 100-200 people in attendance for saying he was going to basically fire the entire cabinet in city hall.

-Of the major candidates, those that did the best were Thiru Vignarajah, Brandon Scott, and Sheila Dixon. Thiru and Brandon were the only ones with polished, prepared presentations. Sheila Dixon did a good job of rushing to the podium during the Q/A period to answer as many questions as possible. She also presented herself as a ""no-nonsense"" candidate who has solutions.

-Brandon Scott probably ""won"" the room. While Vignarajah and Dixon had decent presentations, the audience was clearly hesitant. Scott presented himself as an agent of change, and a big-ticket item with people in the room was getting rid of the Board of Estimates, which he supports. He also spoke in specifics on other major issues, and just seemed to be the crowd favorite in general.

-Mary Miller was a big disappointment. She did not know the name of the neighborhood she was in (Charles Village) right after she claimed to go to church in the building that was hosting the event, she only cited a couple of accomplishments in Baltimore (helping to open a playground, ""remembered"" when a community center opened, etc.), and she did not present any policy or initiative that she wanted to implement as mayor. She was careful to mention that she was appointed to a Treasury position by President Obama without mentioning that she later worked for a major financial services company. She did not answer any of the questions during Q/A. Overall, the gist of her presentation was that she should be mayor because she is the smartest person in the room.

-I felt bad for Mary Washington because she, self-admittedly, got very nervous at the podium and had to sit down, which cut into her time. She made some excellent points, and clearly has a contingent of supporters in Charles Village for a reason.

Candidates for City Council President, Comptroller, and the 12th and 14th District were also there, so let me know if you want my thoughts on any of those candidates.",baltimore,Went to Today's Mayoral Candidate's Forum.

Looks like I have a pretty sweet offer from UMBC that I can take.  Yea, I've seen The Wire, but I also lived in Detroit and New Orleans so I know how those shows tend to exaggerate portrayals. I'd honestly love some input about moving there. I am LGBT, want to walk to my grocery store, and prefer to take the bus to work. An hour commute on the bus is FINE for me. I've done it before. My question is, Canton and Fells Point look good and walkable with access to grocery stores. The crime rate looks fine too. Is there anything I am missing? Do you guys have any input or insight I might be missing? I'll be visiting the city in a few weeks to scout some locations before I give them a yes, so if there is a place I should check out let me know.

Event:

Last week during a [3 hour session](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/exe3ld/video_joint_briefing_on_crime_and_public_safety/), a lot of information was presented to the Maryland General Assembly about how youth crime is responded to.  One notable thing that got a fair amount of discussion:  

&gt;Although 78.1% of Baltimore City Complaints are referred to Juvenile Court, Most receive no services. Of the Juveniles that get referred:  

&gt;19.1 % get probation.  

&gt;17.7 are committed to djs.  

&gt;Of the ""other"" (63.1%) that get no services, some could be not guilty, some nolle prosse'd, some might be dismissals, mutual postponements, states attorney's office declined to prosecute, and other things (I couldn't make out another reason she explicitly mentioned). For the ""whys"" the speaker referred the questioner to the SA office.  

&amp;nbsp;

So how can you get involved? Go to the listening session next week where the Juvenile Justice Reform Council [will listen to you](https://www.familyleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JJRC-Listening-Session-Flyers-Baltimore.pdf):

More details:  

&gt;**Who is listening?**

The members of the Juvenile Justice Reform Council. Listening sessions are an opportunity for the Juvenile Justice Reform Council to receive input from individuals and organizations to help the Council identify areas that the Council should focus on when creating their recommendations.

&gt;**Who is speaking?**

Any community member is welcome to attend and provide testimony. While anyone may speak, the Council would especially like to hear from youth and parents. Public testimony could include such topics as education, family and youth engagement, community safety, community programs, behavioral health, and substance abuse. Everyone who signs up will have three minutes to share their thoughts with the Council.

&gt;**Event Overview:**

The Juvenile Justice Reform Council, in partnership with the Maryland State Department of Juvenile Services, wants to hear from you about existing community assets, needs, and opportunities for enhancements in the area of juvenile justice. Your testimony and feedback will inform the priorities of the Juvenile Justice Reform Council.

During the 2019 session of the Maryland General Assembly, the legislature passed and Governor Hogan signed Senate Bill 856/House Bill 6062 establishing the Juvenile Justice Reform Council (JJRC), which is to be staffed by the Department of Legislative Services. The JJRC is charged with:

1. using a data-driven approach to develop a statewide framework of policies to invest in strategies to increase public safety and reduce recidivism of youth offenders;

2. researching best practices for the treatment of juveniles who are subject to the criminal and juvenile justice systems; and

3. identifying and making recommendations to limit or otherwise mitigate risk factors that contribute to juvenile contact with the criminal and juvenile justice systems.",baltimore,"Hey!

Moving to Baltimore within the next month and will be working at JH Bayview. I'm a 28 year old single guy that doesn't know a single soul in Baltimore (pretty nervous!). From what I've gathered is that Canton or Fells Point are pretty great places to live. 

My budget is &lt; $2K a month (utilities, internet, etc included) but obviously less would be nicer. I would prefer to have a garage or some type of parking of some sorts. It seems that some of the nicer apartments are in the $1.5 - 1.8K/month (1BD/BR) and are on similar price points with an entire rowhome to myself. 

I would like to be in an area and living situation where I can meet new people. Would I have a better chance for that by living in an apartment building where I can meet people? Or is it pretty much the same when it comes to a rowhome?

My boyfriend and I are moving in together this summer and are trying to nail down some neighborhoods/areas to focus on.

I had an opportunity to talk with him. The first thing I brought up to him was that property taxes have got to go down. He agreed, and told me that he wants to do a top to bottom evaluation of how things are being run and what money is being spent and on what, and after that review to eliminate anything that we are wasting money on. I also brought up to him that the region on a whole (the counties) and the city (and state) have got to collaborate and see all of us as one metro region. I also brought up that the BPD needs to be brought under the control of the city, he agreed. He also mentioned that the city needs a separate position of city administrator.

The public health school has [exposed](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2000/alcohol-off-premises.html) for over a decade how black, low-income neighborhoods have a disproportionate number of off-premise liquor stores relative to white or racially integrated neighborhoods.

[Recently](https://www.jhsph.edu/admissions/admissions-blog/research-spotlight-violent-crimes-and-liquor-outlets-in-baltimore), there is evidence that off-premise liquor stores are more strongly associated with violence than on-premise outlets.

It begs the question of our city leadership: does the tax revenue and private revenue generated from these off-premise outlets offset the cost the community bears, i.e. increased patrolling in certain areas/times, and responding to assaults, robberies, murders, etc.?

I’m not trying to say that alcohol alone is the problem or that off-premise outlets don’t belong, but I do think they need to be more critically scrutinized.

TL;DR: Renders Warehouse dropped the ball and wasted not only my and my roommate's time, but the time of their contractors.

Without further ado, let's dive into it. 

Here's the setup. I've lived in a rowhouse in the city for several years now. The house is owned by a lovely homeowner and managed through Renters Warehouse, who I will hitherto refer to as The Slumlords. Here is a tale about how something as simple as installing a water heater can turn into a clown party in no time at all because The Slumlords (reminder, *NOT* the owners of the home, but the third party managers) don't know how to manage their own business.

Allow me to set the scene. For the past few winters, the water heater has sucked. The current set-up we have been trying to replace is an ""instant"" water heater; it's a coil that sits in the boiler and travels to the rest of the house. Basically, the hot water is linked to the boiler's operation, and it sucks. It wastes gas, showers are only hot for about 3 minutes before they become frigid, and in the dead of the last few particularly cold winters these past few years... ever participated in the Polar Plunge? Hot water flat out doesn't happen. Oh, and this coil was installed some time in the early 90's I think, so it's old.

This winter, I decided to nip this problem in the bud. Around September-October is when I contacted the homeowner about the possibility of replacing the crappy heater with the new hotness that is a 30-40 gallon tank. The owner of the house is, at this point, basically a friend and a pen pal; we have a good working relationship as far as me living there is concerned and I personally don't fault them for anything that's happening. They were all for the idea of installing a new heater because they had originally bought the home as a ""fixer upper"". On my end, the rent is reasonable and the house isn't falling down on top of my head, so I'm pretty content. All in all, it's a place for me to eat, sleep, shower, and shit. Is good.... enough...

Except for that got-damn water heater.

First we tried to get this done on our own. We decided to work together with ""Big Box's"" contractors thinking they'd be more reliable. For the reason why... well, here's the thing we've noticed about The Slumlords. Whenever you put in a request for them to fix something, they will do their absolute damnedest to do it as cheaply as they possibly can. When I had the dryer replaced, they eventually (after the second try) found a dryer that was not only used, but had melted gum inside the drum. I still use this dryer, though god only knows why I haven't just bought a brand new one and replaced it on my own at this point.

I trust a contractor in Baltimore to do the best job they can with the supplies and funding they are given. A lot of them are honest, hard working tradesmen that are simply trying to make a living. All of the contractors that they have sent to fulfill service tickets so far (that is, when The Slumlords *finally* can be assed to even *respond* to the tickets in the first place) have been wonderful individuals who I would have no problem working with again independently. At the same time, if you're given a $500 budget for a $1000 job, you're going to have problems. I'm pulling numbers out of my bum, but you get the idea.

(Oh yeah, and that was the *second* try. Dryer number one fucked out about a day after they installed it. [I can't wait to see what happens when round 3 inevitably comes along.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/435/941/317.gif))

[You can imagine why neither me nor the homeowner wanted The Slumlords anywhere near this project.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bU-I2ZiML0) Given how they've handled appliance replacement in the past, I have no doubt that they will only budget enough for the plumber to get some malfunctioning piece of junk that will go off like a rocket. However on the flip-side, Big Box's contractors, as we found, were unreliable. They came in, took a look, gave us an idea of how to move forward and then... nothing. They never called back. Never bothered to follow-up. Nothing. After trying to contact them again to no avail, we gave up the ghost and decided to go through the ""official channel.""

[So they're back at the helm again](https://i.imgflip.com/18ikfb.jpg?a438984), and oh boy, I'm about to make every electrician cringe so damn hard with this wonderful tale of mismanagement and indolence.

First we had to have a ""handyman"" come in and remove an inset cabinet to make room for the tank. So far so simple. But that was a one person job in one profession. However, the next steps are even more complicated. In order to install an electric water heater, you need... wait for it... [*two* people from *two different professions.*](https://imgflip.com/i/3p7wmz)

And it's all downhill from here. 

They *finally* have someone come in. Everything was set up and scheduled through my roommate who, mind you, is as faultless in this saga as the homeowner is. In fact, it was a nice change of pace for me this time around since between the two of us, I was the one with a much more flexible schedule and was usually the one who stayed behind while contractors worked on other service calls in the past. She already had a day off where she could stay behind so I was looking forward to getting to work, not worrying about the details, and having a nice long hot shower courtesy of the brand new water heater. I get the call this morning that the electrician was coming in and he arrives about an hour later. After showing him where the breaker box is and where the heater is going to be put in, he asks where the plumber is...

""Where is he?""

*Well that's a good got-damn question, now isn't it?*

Turns out that the plumber had, several weeks ago, emailed The Slumlords that they were not going to be able to be there on the specified date. Fair enough. Things happen. One of the most common of such ""things"" is ""my truck broke down,"" which seems to happen quite a lot for some bizarre reason. Oh well, who am I or any mortal to question the winds of fate? It's probably an easier explanation than ""I'm overbooked because my bosses are fucking idiots"" or whatever real reason they have for not being able to show up. Like I said, at this point, I blame The Slumlords for not having their shit together for any problems that the contractors they send out have.

As it turns out, the person in charge of mis-managing this little project up and left for vacation and never mentioned to anyone that the plumber had to reschedule. So the electrician is left twiddling his thumbs over a half-done job because The Slumlords couldn't be assed to properly manage and schedule their services.

Mission accomplished!

Still no water heater.

\-----

I truly feel for these poor contractors who have to put up with this crap. I really, truly do. These are hard working tradesmen suffering from some of the poorest management I have ever witnessed, *and I'm a fucking software engineer!* ***I. Have. Seen. Shit.***

Renters Warehouse needs to get its fucking act together before the half of the city sues their asses. I am sure there are wonderful tales of poor management just like this. If me and the homeowner were allowed to simply work together independently in managing the house, that would be all fine and dandy. But since the city forces third party management on properties like these, we literally have no choice but to suffer their indolence and mis-management. There are several reasons why Baltimore's housing has gone to shit and one of those reasons is because of shitty business practices and poor management.

Allow me to set the scene. For the past few winters, the water heater in the house I rent has sucked. The current set-up we have been trying to replace is an ""instant"" water heater; it's essentially a coil that sits in the boiler and uses the residual heat from heating the house to feed hot water to the faucets and showers. Basically, the hot water is linked to the boiler's operation. In theory, it sounds awesome. In practice, it sucks. It wastes gas, showers are only hot for about 3 minutes before they become frigid, and in the dead of the last few particularly cold winters these past few years... ever participated in the Polar Plunge? Hot water flat out doesn't happen. Oh, and this coil was installed some time in the early 90's I think. Might have been the 80's, if my neighbor who's lived next door for 40+ years is to be believed. Bottom line is that it's old, it's ineffective, and it's chipped away at the very last of my patience.

For this winter, I decided to nip the inevitable problem in the bud. Around September-October is when I contacted the homeowner about the possibility of replacing the crappy heater with the new hotness that is a 30-40 gallon tank. The owner of the house is, at this point, basically a friend and a pen pal; we have a good working relationship as far as me living there is concerned and I personally don't fault them for anything that's happening.

First we had to have a ""handyman"" come in and remove an inset cabinet to make room for the tank (the electrician literally crossed himself like a Catholic when I told him this bit and I swear I saw a small part of him die on the inside). So far so simple. That was a one person job in one profession. However, the next steps are even more complicated. In order to install an electric water heater, you need... wait for it... [*two* people from *two different professions.*](https://imgflip.com/i/3p7wmz)

It was all supposed to be so damn simple. Plumber arrives, installs the heater, then leaves.

Electrician arrives, wires it up to the house, then leaves.

It's all downhill from here.

I'm asleep when I get the call this morning that the electrician was coming in. He arrives about an hour later. Friendly guy. Honestly reminds me of my neighbor. The kind of gruff old bastard you'd expect of a certified tradesman. The kind of guy who you'd throw back a couple beers with while bullshitting in a bar. He's even got who I assume is either his apprentice or a temp with him. I show him where the breaker box is and where the heater is going to be put in. In theory it's a simple setup. The breaker box is right there, but the tank, of course, isn't installed just yet. That's the plumber's job.

He asks where the plumber is... ""Where is he?"" ... where is he ...

*Well that's a good question, now isn't it?*

We talked, set up what was expected of him, and I left for work thinking he'd call later in the day.

He never called or showed up.

Now mind you, at that point I was at work. I thought things were going to be handled as they said it would be handled. They *finally* have someone come in, everything was set up and scheduled through my roommate who, mind you, is as faultless in this saga as the homeowner is. In fact, through all of this I was enjoying a nice change of pace this time around since between the two of us, I was the one with a much more flexible schedule and was usually the one who stayed behind while contractors worked on other service calls in the past.

Turns out that the plumber had, several weeks ago, emailed The Slumlords that they were not going to be able to be there on the specified date, which in any functioning management company would be cause to set in motion the machinations of the ancient and well used device known as ***""rescheduling.""*** Reasons? Known only to the manager, though I can take a guess as to what the problem was. One of the most common of such ""things"" is ""my truck broke down,"" which seems to happen quite a lot for some bizarre reason (more on that in a bit). As it turns out, the person in charge of mis-managing this little project up and left for vacation before that email was sent and never mentioned to anyone that the plumber had to reschedule when they got back... or at all. So as a result, the electrician is left twiddling his thumbs over a half-done job because his boss couldn't be bothered to properly manage and schedule their work. I'm an engineer as well. I hate leaving things half finished because of factors out of my control as much as the next engineer, but that is basically what they're forcing this poor guy to do while we spend what will probably be another week trying to get a plumber out to install this thing.

And winter is basically over at this point.

\-----

I feel sorry for these poor contractors who have to put up with this crap. I really, truly do. These are hard working tradesmen suffering from some of the poorest management I have ever witnessed, *and I'm a software engineer!* ***I. Have. Seen. Some. Nonsense.*** For every relatively minor water heater saga like mine, I am sure there are far worse tales of mismanagement and possibly even fraud on the part of these management companies. I'd honestly love to see these contractors come forward and tell their own stories in their own words and maybe we'll start to see some change. The contractor who had to deal with this crap today will be getting a link to this little editorial of mine and he could maybe fill in some gaps and expose even more mis-management if he chooses to post under a pseudonym. In fact, I encourage him to do it.

At this point, I blame The Slumlords for not having their act together for any problems that the contractors they send out have. In fact, nine times out of ten they show up with what seems to not be their usual work trucks just so they can get to the appointment, usually after having to reschedule because their ""truck broke down."" Given how poorly everything else for Renters Warehouse is managed and how often I am told this exact reason for rescheduling, I am inclined to believe them. It's enough to make me wonder if they're even paid enough to provide basic upkeep on their equipment.

Renters Warehouse needs to get its act together before the half of the city sues them for much worse transgressions than a simple water heater. I mentioned before, I literally don't trust them at this point. I am sure there are more absolutely wonderful tales of poor management just like this, but if something as simple as installing a water heater is this difficult for them, then what does that say about bigger issues? If me and the homeowner were allowed to simply work together independently in managing the house, that all would be fine and dandy. Unfortunately, the city forces third party management on properties like these. We literally have no choice but to suffer their indolence, mis-management, and outright stupidity. Thank goodness this winter was mild at least. I'll probably be back with an update on the heater itself if Renters Warehouse somehow manages to screw that one up. If history is to be believed, they will.

What's even more stupid is that my neighbor (the guy who's lived there for 40+ years that I mentioned at the start of this little rant) is a master plumber who could install this thing in an afternoon, wiring and all. Trying to get anyone to install this damn thing has been like fighting against a curse, and Renters Warehouse hasn't made things any easier.",baltimore,[Rental Mis-Management Story] Water you waiting for?!

Part of the rehab included a new concrete patio/parking pad in the rear of the house. The pad can't be accessed from the alley because it's blocked by anchoring wires for a telephone pole, but there is an old pre-existing curb cut on the street which gives enough room for them to mostly wedge into the spot diagonally, leaving a foot or so of the car to slightly jut-out into the sidewalk (the pad is parallel to the street/sidewalk). If anyone parks along the curb cut they immediately leave a passive aggressive note about their ""driveway"" being blocked. I've looked up any permits associated with the house and nothing parking related is registered.

I think most of us agree that Maryland needs to focus more on education.

Simply put, education reduces crime. As Marylanders, we value good education.

The problem? The Maryland State Department of Education is a fat and fiscally corrupt state agency-- no one wants to throw money at that and hope it works. We need a simultaneous cash influx combined with a hearty pruning and housecleaning at MSDE to improve education in Maryland.

I recently moved to Hampden and have been taking my time looking for work; I have a background in university fundraising (development) but have been using this move as an opportunity to try and find a more socially conscious organization or program to work with (ie: Associated Black Charities, the ACLU, the YMCA, etc.)

Anyway, I saw a posting to apply to work for the Census Bureau for 2020 - part-time, flexible, great pay, and something I'm super passionate about.  Shameless plug: fill out the census!  No one is stalking you!  The government just wants to give your community money!

Within 10 hours of my application they had called to offer me an 8 week position as an enumerator, aka, someone who goes door-to-door trying to convince people who haven't filled out their Census to get on it.  

I'm looking for guidance particularly from anyone who has done this before, but also happy to take the thoughts of people familiar with the city who have opinions on this.  Long story short, I'm worried about my safety.  

Obviously, we all know the deal - just like any other city, Baltimore has it's troubles and many advise that you must be careful in certain places.  But my experience, and I believe the experience of so many others who love it here, is that this place is incredible, it's population is generally kind, and the troubles are generally are systematic.  Not sure if that means that going door-to-door is necessarily safe for a small woman though...

What do you think?  Have you had any experiences?  I was told that enumerators are generally placed in their own neighborhoods for authenticity purposes, and Hampden is pretty safe, but I find it hard to believe there will be 8 weeks worth of work here.  I'm sure I'll be in many neighborhoods.  I will be canvassing alone, with a supervisor hanging around in my general location.  We receive training on emergency protocol and are visibly marked with government IDs, etc.

I appreciate any and all input, and I appreciate you all for being you.  Moving here has been one of the best choices I ever made, and I love your city.  I'd love to pitch in to make it an even better place.  Peace!",baltimore,Have you worked for the Census Bureau?

When you really look at the numbers, there's no denying it. Each year in Baltimore you have about a 2 percent chance of being a victim of a violent crime. In Ellicott City, where I'm moving, it's about a .125 percent chance, when you take it on a per capita basis 

And trust me, I get that alot of the murders are with drug or gang violence. But being blocks away from that culture, it's just sick. People have been murdered a block or two away from where I live. Do you know how many murders Howard county had last year ? 2 . With a population about half of Baltimores. So double that to 4 to be fair. Vs Baltimores 348. It is simply unreal .

Thinking about a future with great public schools. Where my kids could walk around freely.

Are any of you in this situation? What's to keep me here? Yes there's private schools, but the crime? The constant corruption? 
It seems so illogical not to move 30 minutes away, where I can still drive into the city to do fun events every once in a while, and have a safe caring community when I get home. 

Here I always feel like I'm waiting for the next development. The next restraunt or store. Waiting for something so great I guess to justify living in a place with so much violence. But I can't think of anything anymore. Sorry if it's dramatic. It is. But I really wish I wanted to stay. Made so many friends and memories here. But I want a place of like minded individuals around me that want to improve themselves, respect each other, and don't resort to killing anyone.",baltimore,I've lived in the city for 3 years...

I am a little worried though to make the move because people tell me Baltimore doesnt have as miuch going on, and that DC has way more, and sometimes people refer to it as Smalltimore or something like that since they say it seems like everyone knows everyone else.I am not trying to diss though, I just want honest perspective, because I need to choose between Baltimore or another city, and my fam is in the DC-Baltimore area.

I’ve got some Bose over the ear headphones that are outstanding. But I’m nervous over someone ripping them off my head. Cheaper noise cancelling just isn’t nearly as good, and I’m not sure I want to cough up $250 for the Bose in-ear noise cancelling (which would be way harder to grab and run).

CC: Bernard C. “Jack” Young - Baltimore Mayor

CC: Michael Harrison - Baltimore Police Commissioner

CC: Laura Arnold - Project Funding Philanthropist

This is written advance notice from Anonymous OSOSS of our intention to perform non-violent sabotage via drone flights over Martin State Airport controlled airspace and the surrounding area on any days where unconstitutional spy planes are operating from the airport beginning in May. Flights will be identified via ADS-B data and visual confirmation.


Because safety procedures would require the closing of KMTN and the nearby 4MD heliport in the above circumstance, you would not be in a position to provide services to Persistent Surveillance planes or any other aircraft. London Heathrow, an airport with vastly greater resources and security has recently cancelled a new runway after successful drone flight disruptions by environmental protesters. Unlike Heathrow, our mission eliminates jamming as an option to stop drones by utilizing pre-programmed waypoint based flight paths. Multiple covert launch sites are already identified, several miles away from Martin State Airport and in multiple jurisdictions. Hopefully Martin State Airport will carefully consider the great inconvenience to other airport and helipad users and the current justified anger from the Baltimore community and quickly and publicly cancel material support of this privately funded project of a private corporation prior to the commencement of flight operations in May.


For clarity, XBWI, XDCA and XIAD are not impacted by our plans.


While our mission has been in development since the news of the project's funding, You are receiving this communication now due to new publicly available information.


https://therealnews.com/stories/did-private-spy-plane-catch-cops-lying


The above new reporting shows that CEO Ross McNutt has now publicly acknowledged that the Baltimore Police Department lacks any interest in, or a willingness to use his service to identify police misconduct despite being under a federal consent decree.The appropriate decree mandate de-escalation in this situation given this new information is for the program to be quickly and publicly cancelled.


For Ross McNutt to do anything else would be to explicitly condone police misconduct at best, and commit to future support of evidence suppression from defense attorneys at worst. Providing material support to an unreformed police department he knows in his heart to be corrupt would bring lasting damage to his reputation in the eyes of his funders, the defense industry and beyond.


Hopefully Laura and John Arnold will see this project for the huge distraction it will become for LJAC's other important philanthropy work and cancel the Persistent Surveillance Project that, while well meaning, shatters the 4th Amendment rights of all Baltimore residents. Our City is still in urgent need of the Arnold's help though. One year of Persistent Surveillance budget donated to Baltimore's Healthcare for the Homeless instead would be deeply appreciated by residents. USD$2.2m would have a transformative impact on Baltimore's homelessness situation.


The Mayor should also see the potential damage a growing national story on this police behavior will bring to the City and cancel this unconstitutional project quickly and publicly.


While a drone has already been deployed to Ross McNutt's residence in Severna Park for an initial wireless networks penetration testing survey and SDR based cellphone monitoring via a Kali Pi server payload, we are now pausing all project work. Our working assumption is that the new public information, combined with the disclosure of our plans will lead to the inevitable cancellation of the Baltimore Persistent Surveillance project.


If at the end of Q1, March 31st, no such announcement has been made, OSOSS will reactivate this project. Drone surveillance of other parties with a focus on Arnold residences will occur prior to May in a final effort to get stakeholders to understand the psychological effects of an ever present threat of non-consensual surveillance at home. On May 1st we will begin tracking spy plane activity and launching protests.


Mr McNutt should understand that now is the time to cancel the Baltimore project. Any attempt to deploy his current service anywhere else in the World will be met by OSOSS with similar tactics and will therefore be futile. He may however now wish to focus his efforts on the only socially acceptable proven application for his technology, namely police misconduct monitoring for the Department of Justice in Police Consent Decree Cities. The police have nothing to fear from such a system if they have nothing to hide. With appropriate protections for residents, such planes could still fly again ethically.


In summary, Baltimore residents deserve a timely closure on this issue. In the event that this is delivered within a month, you can assume this mission permanently closed by us.


Sincerely,


Anonymous

To me, depriving people of their vote is far more serious crime than theft. Which is what she did. 

* If she didn’t use the money she stole from Baltimore residents to booster her campaign, does Dixon win the race for mayor? Not saying this is superior, but it could have been the will of the electorate. 

* If Pugh didn’t have her war chest surge towards the end of the election, does Stokes have a more prominent role? Was she creating false momentum using stolen funds? Does the vote split in ways that aren’t obvious?  

* Do people panic when Dixon surges to the lead and perhaps 3rd place finisher Elizabeth Embry get a harder look by residents? Do people come off the sidelines to support Embry, Warnock or a different candidate?

* Finally, what condition would the city potentially be in were the election results not (possibly) stolen by Pugh? 

Catherine Pugh stole from the citizenry and then used their money to foist her own incompetence on the city, and ultimately, damaged the fuck out of the reputation of the city. 

Would a Dixon, or Embry, or Warnock or Stokes administration have moved us forward? It’s 100% possible we could be in roughly the same place, or worse. But also, better. 

We will never know because Pugh potentially disenfranchised 600,000+ people by stealing taxpayer funds and distorting the results of a major election in a major metropolitan area.  

So here’s the (probably stupid) question: could we as a city file a class action suit for compensatory and or punitive damages the way victims of crime can? Ask for say $1.5 billion in lost (income/growth) potential and damages for the city as whole. No, she would never be able to pay; but I could see it being a both a grass roots message and possible humiliating deterrent in the future.

It might be a serious reason for our current state of emergency. Maryland and Hogan may have a very similar situation to California, in which it may not allow cruise ship to port until testing is possible.

The Sun reported a week ago about a cruise ship that disembarked in Baltimore on the 20th February: [Flu outbreak sickens 82 on Royal Caribbean cruise from Baltimore; none met coronavirus criteria, cruise line says.](https://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-royal-carribean-flu-20200228-ljm5pew5yfbepowttxgmlnej7i-story.html?outputType=amp#aoh=15835051544666&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s). The reason that passengers *and crew* of the Grandeur of the Seas were not tested is because ~~we had no tests~~ ""None of the passengers had transited the COVID-19′s regions of impact or interacted with anyone in those regions within 14 days of the onset of their symptoms."" This has proven to be a terrible standard for testing. It is also presumable that the crew remained mostly the same between voyages, and the crew of this cruise ship would have had 2 voyages in the preceding few weeks.

According to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-confirms-three-cases-of-coronavirus/2020/03/05/687def10-5f3d-11ea-b014-4fafa866bb81_story.html), ""Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) said he was told by an aide to Hogan that the individuals were on a cruise."" In the same article, ""Fran Phillips, Maryland’s deputy secretary for public health, said the three people returned to Maryland from the same overseas trip on Feb. 20. Officials declined to specify where they had traveled."" 

Again, presumably, much of the same crew stayed with the Grandeur of the Seas, which left for another cruise on the [21st February](http://crew-center.com/rccl-grandeur-seas-itinerary), the day after the passengers with ""flulike symptoms"" arrived. That cruise returned on the 28th, disembarked, and set sail *yet again.*  It is [currently](https://www.seascanner.com/ships-position-grandeur-of-the-seas) on it's way back to port at Baltimore, with passengers and crew.

I hate to malign one cruise ship or its passengers, and truly hope that there has been no further spread, but I sincerely hope the governor/country is prepared for the possibility that this ship might have crew members and passengers (past and present) who are infected and contagious (if the Grandeur of the Seas is, in fact, the same vessel in question).

Rather, let's use this event as the springboard for the first-ever night drinking event! (Event is a vast overhyping)

If anyone is interested in:

Super fun times!

Beers and stuff!

Snacks and stuff!

Maybe scooters!

Probably some medical-grade cannabis!

More snacks!

Everlasting friendship!

Deep conversations about deep space!

Also aliens!

And much more unpredictable awesome stuff!

Anyway, get at me Baltimore. I think Lee's Pint and Shell is showing the fight, but I'm down for any place that has it on. :)

1681,1681,Handheld_Joker,1583606242,fezb56,SAFETY ALERT,"As some of you may know, the Coronavirus has officially made its way into MD as of a few nights ago. I have been following this disease since the beginning  and have training in biology, so I know what I’m talking about beyond regurgitating articles. Be very aware that it is only a matter of time before it arrives in Baltimore if it’s not already here. 
Best things to do: 
1. Stock up on some food in case you need to stay at home for a month, which may very well happen.
2. If you are sick or are starting to feel sick, STAY HOME. I know some people still have to work. If you do, make sure you tell all of your coworkers, and stay as far away from them as possible while following strict hygiene practices. Do not cough or sneeze into your hands or without covering your mouth/nose with a tissue or your sleeve. 
3. Keep a clean house and wash your clothes/hands as often as possible. 
4. Encourage that others follow good hygiene etc. 

This can get very bad. Help your community by following as many precautions as you can.

This is egregious because these employees are some of the most vulnerable in this Country.  They have shitty healthcare, low wages, and they have to work in an area that will likely get them sick.  And this fucking company has the audacity not to give sick leave to these poor people who are already beaten down enough as it is.  And, it's threatening the lives of their family and friends and the people they associate with because they're creating a condition that will ultimately pressure them to not call out since many of them don't have enough vacation hours and can't afford to be off and not get paid.  

This is so fucked how they're handling this crisis that will literally kill people!  

If you care about human life, please call Hilton in Baltimore (443) 573-8700 and express your concerns about this.

 I suspect there are tons of other service companies doing this and if we don't put pressure on them, they'll have their way and jeopardize millions of Americans.  Capitalism is great, but when there is nothing to stop it from hurting others, then it fails to deliver what it promised. 

I've had my fair share of grievances against a lot of major companies like this, from the BP oil spill to the Net Neutrality Bills that are still being battled out.

I am looking for suggestions on the value of the parking pad, so we can deduct that from our rent. In our current house, two of us were splitting the pad and we deducted $50 from the total cost of the rent, so we paid an additional $25 each a month for it. Based on the houses we have looked at/what we each care about in a house I don’t feel as if $50 is a high enough value to place on the parking pad. 

Looking for suggestions! 

Thanks!",baltimore,Federal Hill - Parking Pad Value

The first night this happened (Friday), was three 'pops' that could have been 20 feet from my house, behind in the alley.  I felt the sound as much as heard it... VERY different from anything other than gunshots.  Cops were there in 30 seconds, and wandered around the alley and between the streets looking around.  10 minutes later, another couple of 'pops'.  Same feeling, same closeness.  Poked my head out the front door to see how the police and neighbors were reacting, and pretty calm.  Saw the one cop who was walking come around the corner calmly from the direction of the noise.  15 minutes later, one or two more.  Look outside, people still there (who confirmed they heard them also) but no action and nothing weird.  At the time people chalked it up to fireworks (that no one saw).

Each of the next 3 nights, we heard them again from 130-400 am.  My partner and I heard them the last two nights specifically (and some neighbors heard them Saturday night as well).  Myself and some neighbors jumped up and looked out but nothing.

I don't know what to think other than it's someone shooting a gun (or I guess playing with fireworks) inside their house.  Totally at a loss, because it's scary/unnerving, but also it doesn't seem to be someone walking on the street or in the alley who committing crimes or mugging anyone etc.

1762,1762,sgtcarrot,1583880185,fgmno8,Nan,"Last night I had dinner with my family at Maggie's Farms (OMG the fried chicken and waffles was amazing, just go) and we eventually got around to the discussion of the mayoral race, and the fact that Sheila Dixon (SD) is the favorite. In these family gathering conversations my role is usually to take the unpopular side and see if I can get anybody to change their minds (the devils advocate). Seeing as how similar my families opinions on SD are to those I have seen on this sub reddit, I thought I would share; and  I did manage to get people to ponder/reconsider their positions... 

Note: I am not a fan of SD, in fact I once had a personal run-in with her, and it was not positive at all, (we ended up screaming at each other within 2 minutes, it was actually hilarious in hindsight).

&amp;#x200B;

I have heard multiple times that 'the women of baltimore' will elect SD; so my argument is what if electing her is a unifying event that ammasses a lot of power to make household by household changes that could really impact safety, quality of life and other improvements; something no other candidate could claim. 

For example: If SD made the squeegie kids thing a thing officially, and asked/tells/empowers the mothers of baltimore to step in, talk with the kids, provide an alternative, then you have the change happening house by house, and enforced by mom. I see that as more effective, and you could allocate resources to providing alternates activities/opportunities; instead of paying for enforcement. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know, I was just thinking that as much as I dislike her, if she can unify this town and start to get the people working together in a more unified fashion, we might accomplish more than with a lily pure professional leader who is ignored by what is effectively the boots on the ground. 

Curious what other people think. FWIW:  'Women of baltimore' is not my term, just something I have heard now multiple times when talking about the election, from locals (I'm a transplant). 

Again, I have nothing to do with anybodies campaign, just live here 20+ years, own a small business and keep my head down. Thanks!

 TLDR: Maybe Sheila Dixon's viability is more about her ability to unify 'the women of baltimore' than her criminal record and tons of other things that this post isnt focusing on just now.",baltimore,An argument for why Sheila Dixon might be a good mayoral candidate. (ducks)

Made an offer late February, supposed to close next week. 
With all this craziness I want out. 
Already through inspections and all of that, so I don't think I have any contingencies left(even though I feel like a global pandemic should be one)

Realtor keeps telling me that I would lose my deposit( which is fine, $1000 is not that bad) , but more importantly, that they could sue to either force me to buy or to pay for repairs they made

Does anyone have experience with this? Is this something they could/would actually do?
I believe the economy is on the verge of a huge meltdown, and this place was already on the edge of what I felt I should be paying (with mortgage and fees ECT about 40 percent of my after tax pay) . Also I have to rent out my other place as I didn't make it contingent to sell, and thought it would be easy to find tenants .

 Now, I may buy the place and not be allowed to leave my current home to move into it!

I'm getting an attorney to look over the contract I signed, but again, any advice ? Do you think they really would/could sue for repairs made to their own home or force me to buy it, even though we have a national emergency right now?

My boyfriend and I are looking to move to a fed hill/fells/canton townhouse this summer and I have a few questions about the process. If you have any answers or advice it’d be much appreciated! 

- When should we start contacting landlords about renting? His current lease is up at the end of June so we’re looking to move sometime around then. 

- Are there any other good websites besides Zillow, Craigslist, apartments.com to look for places?

- On average how much do utilities run for a townhouse?

- Are there any unexpected costs, problems, or hiccups that you had along the way that you wish you’d known about?",baltimore,Moving to Baltimore questions

BALTIMORE SUN |
MAR 19, 2020
 
When the Royal Caribbean Grandeur of the Seas left the Cruise Maryland port terminal nearly two weeks ago, only three people in the state were confirmed to have tested positively for the new coronavirus, and it still seemed like a far-away problem to passengers Lisa and Dave Thoma.
 
""Things were kind of 'wash your hands,' and that was about it,"" Lisa Thoma said Thursday.
 
As the ship sailed south, however, the roughly 2,000 passengers learned they would not be allowed to get off as planned in most of their sandy
destinations - Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, St. Lucia, and St. Kitts and Nevis - due to new restrictions. Instead, the Grandeur made port calls in Barbados
and Dominica, passengers said.
 
They watched the news from aboard the ship as the pandemic began to spread more widely in the U.S., prompting Maryland public schools to close for at least two weeks and Gov. Larry Hogan to announce a host of other emergency
measures to contain the outbreak - including the closure of the state-owned
cruise terminal they had departed.
 
The governor's order still allowed the Grandeur to return to Baltimore. But, passengers wondered, what they would find when they arrived?
 
""When you're sitting out in the ocean and watching and hearing about the hoarding and the situation, it is the most hopeless feeling you've ever had
in your whole entire life,"" said Lisa Thoma, 55, of Blacksburg, Virginia.
 
Thoma said she and her husband hesitated a little before boarding the ship, especially because she has type-1 diabetes and would be considered a high risk if she is exposed to COVID-19. But they had looked forward to the cruise for more than a year, and ultimately, they decided they didn't want
fear ""to stop us from living,"" she said.
 
Passengers were on high-alert, though, and the sound of a routine sneeze or cough aboard the ship was enough to turn heads, she said.
 
The retired couple and others disembarking in Baltimore Thursday heaped praise on the Royal Caribbean crew. Crew members are facing their own significant uncertainty about how the global pandemic - which has included at least one cruise-ship outbreak and has caused officials to halt cruises in many areas - will affect their jobs and their families.
 
A Royal Caribbean spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 
""It was probably one of the scariest times, but we will also tell you Royal Caribbean and Captain Patrick and his crew members were phenomenal,"" Lisa said. ""They went way [above and] beyond. They had smiles on their faces. They were trying to do everything in their power to make sure this is the best cruise they could.""
 
Despite the circumstances, Dave Thoma added: ""They were still doing a fabulous job.""
 
While passengers were not required to remain six feet apart, as recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lisa said, crew
members were constantly cleaning, and when passengers were prohibited from serving themselves at the buffets as a health precaution, the crew members stood at the ready to serve them instead.
 
""This has been a cruise we will never forget, but they really did the best they could in times like this,"" she said.
 
Nancy Beswick, who lives in Massachusetts, said the crew took such good care of her and her husband, Jeffrey, ""that we had a fantastic cruise.""
 
The couple, who are in their 50s, felt safer on the Grandeur than anywhere else they could have been, she said.
 
""I felt like we were in really good hands,"" Beswick said. ""The cruise ship had a protocol in place for emergencies. They went into high gear and took
care of us, and they were putting our health as a priority.""
 
Passengers were not subjected to a health screening when they arrived in Baltimore, she said, adding the crew made getting off the ship quick and easy.
 
""Even debarking today went completely smoothly, as if they were trained for any kind of emergency,"" Beswick said.
 
All passengers had their temperatures taken before boarding, and the cleaning procedures aboard the Grandeur were the most pronounced that Jeff
Davidson said he had seen on any of the three dozen cruises he's taken.
 
The crew kept passengers updated on their sanitization efforts, which included cleaning all handrails every 30 minutes, said Davidson, 69, an
on-board speaker who goes by ""The Work-Life Balance Expert"" and gives speeches on ways to reduce stress, get better sleep and increase longevity, among other topics.
 
""They were cleaning doorknobs, sills, baseboards, anything anybody might touch,"" he said. ""They took so many steps that after a couple days ...people's concerns really just dissipated. They became more concerned about what's going on back home.""
 
The Carnival Pride, the other cruise ship that calls the port of Baltimore home, dropped off its last passengers and left Baltimore Wednesday for
Miami. The cruise line is offering its ships to the government as temporary, floating, 1,000-room hospitals to treat non-COVID-19 cases and free up
capacity for hospitals expected to be overwhelmed by the outbreak, Carnival announced Thursday.
 
Twelve days at sea taught the Grandeur's passengers a lesson in how quickly the coronavirus is moving - and just how much can change in two weeks.
 
Maryland had 107 total confirmed COVID-19 cases, including the first known infection of a child, as of Thursday, up from 85 on Wednesday, the same day
the state had its first coronavirus death. The Prince George's County man who died was in his 60s and had underlying health problems, state officials
said. 
 
With most roads and highways clear due to many people working from home, the taxi ride from the cruise terminal to BWI Marshall Airport was the quickest Davidson had ever experienced, he said.
 
When he arrived at Baltimore/Washington International, he was one of the only passengers in the airport, which Hogan closed Thursday to all
non-passengers and staff, and made it through a security checkpoint in about 90 seconds, he said. He was one of two passengers on a Delta regional flight to Raleigh, North Carolina.
 
The plane had arrived in Baltimore from Philadelphia empty, he added.
 
""There's nobody in the airport,"" Davidson said.
 
Grocery stores that were mostly stocked when the cruise left have been struggling to keep food, cleaning products, toiletries and hand sanitizer on shelves as people rush to buy rations.
 
As the cruise passengers head home, they're not sure what they'll find.
 
""Now we're heading back to Blacksburg, and we're gonna see if we can't get some toilet paper,"" Lisa Thoma said.",baltimore,"'The most hopeless feeling': After 12 days on a cruise ship, passengers return to Baltimore facing uncertainty amid coronavirus pandemic"

Summary:

Rundown of cases. 3rd person died (woman in her 40s in Moco). 21/24 jurisdictions infected. Thanks those who are taking it seriously. Frustrated by those not taking it seriously like cherry blossoms festival, ocean city, and some others. People engaged in that kind of activity are breaking the law and endangering lives of family, friends, and fellow citizens.

Beginning today, more aggressive enforcement actions will kick in to disperse people. Also taking immediate additional mitigation and social distancing actions.

Executive order closing all non-essential businesses, organizations, and establishments in MD at 5PM today. New executive order closes everything not covered by federal guidelines issued thursday.

**Not issuing/ordering shelter in place directive. But people should stay in their homes unless they have a reason.**

First priority is saving lives. Facing battle with disease first and economic harm secondly. Must tackle both simultaneously. Will take everyone at all levels rising to the challenge.

Governors have come together and pushed for a more aggressive federal response. Recommendations/requests submitted last Thursday. Title 32 invoked to cover cost of natjonal guards with FEMA. Efforts ramping up production of PPEs and extending deadline for census.

Waiting on title 32 for all states, extension of real ID requirements, pushing hard for major economic stimulus and money to go directly to states for individuals and businesses. They'll raise these issues again this afternoon during call with president and vp.

Talked to labor secretary last couple days about helping unemployed. Discussed some measures there.

Urged whitehouse and congress direct stimulus

Over weekend spoke with vp pence and some others about much needed assistance

 

300 billion economic relief plan is currently the main legislation. Federally guaranteed loans to ensure paychecks keep coming.

 

Governors are leading on the front lines. Need congress to work together on this. Will take all of us together. No partisanship.

 

Will continue to press for further coordination and resources from federal government. All federal assistance is critically needed and efforts so far are appreciated but states continue to need more assistance and more action.

 

MD will not rely on waiting though. Will continue to lead and take action.

 

3 weeks ago, submitted suplemental budget for an additional x million. Tapped into state funds to respond. Thursday signed emergency legislation into law to allow people to collect unemployment insurance if closed due to covid. Statewide disaster declaration kicked in for small business which will allow for federal loans. Now taking additional steps

·         175 million dollar comprehensive business relief program

o    Dept of congress and dept of labor

·         Unemployment insurance program is ramped up to help employees and employers

o    Can immediately file claim by phone, email, or online application

o    No waiting period. File right away

·         Cvid-19 layoff aversion fund. Additional 7 million available to help md small businesses

o    Up to $50k flexible funding to help keep people on payroll

·         [Businessexpress.maryland.gov/coronavirus](http://businessexpress.maryland.gov/coronavirus)

·         Md small business covid-19 relief fund for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Can be used for employees, suppliers, rent etc

·         Grant fund too.- up to 10K grants, not loans; for small businesses

·         5 million dollar fund to provide incentives to small businesses for manufacture of masks and other protective equipment

·         40 million emergency money for all existing commerce finance programs to help preserve jobs

 

Executive order to protect people from price gouging.

Marshalling all resources. Plan to increase hospital capacity by 6000 beds. Phase 1 of the plan has made 900 beds available. Additional 1400 by early april. Plans underway to establish field hospital at baltimore convention center. Md national guard will be setting up with army corps of engineers in joint partnership with UMMS and Hopkins. FEMA will be delivering 250 hospital bed packages. Worked with umms to reopen laurel hospital, additional 135 beds

 

Drive through screening location at fedex field in landover. Others coming as available

More testing availability on the way. Healthcare providers prioritizing tests for hospital patients and ceasing elective procedures.

 

Taking a moment to thank people. Says we have everyone's backs. Especially thanking everyone staying home and volunteering.

There's a site you can visit to volunteer. Also says to keep donating to churches and volunteer organizations. All need donations to continue to function.

Have you or someone you know been kicked out of student housing? Afraid or unable to return to a home country within the next several months through the summer? I can help.

My name is Sarah and I work for both an international student service company AND a real estate management company (private, not corporate,) based out of Baltimore, MD. Not only do I help place international high school students with homestays all around the DMV, but I also help manage our own apartments within Baltimore. Right now, we are helping to place college and high school students into these housing arrangements for the spring and summer!

For homestay options, we already have a list of vetted and experienced families. For our apartment options, we are offering flexible leases on a 3 month, 6 month, or month-by-month basis. We have already provided this for some of our international students, who cannot return home this summer for fear of not being let back into the states next year.

If you're a student in the DMV area and need some place to stay, please reach out! Once we speak here, I can call or email you. Website is www.glcproperties.com so you know it's legit.

I'm sure there's someone on here in the same boat as me. I'm supposed to be moving out of my current house into an apartment complex on April 24th (my lease itself ends 5/1, but my landlady is v chill and would probably be okay with me extending if need be). I listed a bunch of furniture to sell on Craigslist/FB marketplace, but then coronavirus hit hard and I don't really want strangers coming into my home/touching my things. I also realized that I can't move alone--I would have to hire movers too. 

It feels like a long way off, but I already paid my security deposit and pet deposit at the new place. At this point, should I contact the leasing agent and see if they would cancel my move-in and stay in my current location? Am I crazy for not wanting movers or people from the internet coming in and carrying out furniture? Are movers even considered ""essential""? 

Is anyone else moving/planning to move that has advice? I feel like we should all just stay put until May or June, but I feel like I am in a conundrum.",baltimore,Moving soon?

I am finding a lot of places are cleared out of entire aisles even two weeks or so into this thing, I can’t get grocery delivery since there never seems to be available time slots, and so I imagine some people might be frustrated or even afraid. I would personally appreciate folks’ favorite places to shop the last few weeks. 

I am a competent cook and can do without a lot of things. So my personal tips are:
1. If you can avoid stockpiling, do not hoard! Look out for your neighbors who can’t afford to buy more than a week or two (or less!) at a time. 
2. Learn to cook entire birds/sections of an animal you are not comfortable with. It’s a good way to seek out opportunities to buy food which will last a long time (and thus minimize grocery store trips) without hoarding large amounts of food. 
3. Learn to love vegetarian. Produce seems to be far less in demand. 
4. Seek out local, smaller stores. Avoid target/harris teeter/BJs if possible. This helps with social distancing and they seem to be better stocked. I personally love markets of highlandtown. 
5. If you are able, seek out opportunities to shop for your older, immunocompromised, or public-facing working neighbors. Lessens the number of folks in the stores and of course directly assists someone who is in greater danger than yourself. 
6. Accept that you don’t need everything you want right now. If you are out of chicken or coffee or your favorite yogurt, you ain’t gonna starve. 


Obviously we are all trying to balance not hoarding/eating healthy/minimizing grocery store trips/whatever else. Let’s be kind to and patient with each other and wash dem hands.",baltimore,pandemic grocery shopping experiences?

Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

Without further ado: 

((Step 0.5: Acquire your plants))

In theory, you've already done this while scouring the local market for any form of meat or bread, whatsoever.  If you haven't, and want to, some seed companies are still shipping from their online sites.  If you would like to buy local, the [Meyer Seed Company](https://www.meyerseedco.com/) operates out of downtown Baltimore and have a very good selection of seeds, leaning on the vegetable side.

Step 1: CONSIDER THE [WEATHER](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?textField1=39.29&amp;textField2=-76.61#.XoN4z0BFyUk)

We had a very mild winter, and have been having reasonably mild weather the last month, so it looks unlikely that there will be a frost from here on out, however, there is still a rule of thumb that there is a chance of frost up until April 15th.  Plants that are cold tolerant and/or frost tolerant can be started or planted outside now.  These include lettuces, peas, spinach, kale, cabbage, broccoli, onions, most Asian greens, and radishes.  Plants that are NOT cold tolerant can be started inside.  These include tomatoes, peppers, melons, squash, beans, and beet relatives.   For anything else, check out this handy [chart.](http://www.meyerseedco.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20190222085711285.pdf) 

Step 2:  FIND SOME SUNNY DIRT

Vegetables are lovely, but pretty much all of them like a maximum amount of sunlight (with rare exceptions for things in the heat of summer, but don't worry about that now!) in very rich soil.  So, assuming the time is right to plant, then it's time to dig a hole or twenty in the ground.  Maryland soil tends to be heavy, with a lot of clay, and not always nutrient rich.  Do not let that deter you -- just keep in mind that the more clay in your soil, the harder it is for baby plants to root, and more compacted it will be in the long run, so it may take a little longer than the seed packet says before you see significant growth.  If possible, plan to keep your plants in the sunniest part of the yard.

Turning over your soil to make a bed is relatively uncomplicated.  Break up the land you wish to plant on with a shovel to loosen it (Lacking a shovel, you can use a large knife you don't care for to cut or break up roots, or a large kitchen spoon if the soil is already loose, as in the case of an old planter).  Remove any surface plants or weeds, turn the soil clods upside down, and break up anything that is clumping together, and remove anything that is a rock/trash/tree roots/broken glass/just not supposed to be there.  You will likely kill a few worms in the process.  Relax.  There will be more worms later.  Continue to turn and break clumps until you have a uniform-looking patch about four to eight inches deep clean of debris.

To make *better* soil than your average compacted clay-that-used-to-be-lawn, you have a few options.  One is to re-use potting soil you may already have from old planters from last year.  (However, this also begs the question of why not just use that soil and move on?)  You can also try to gather topsoil from nearby locations, such as a nearby easement or other spots in your yard.  Topsoil is the dark stuff that is nutrient rich, lying on top of the subsoil, which is usually red or gray clay.  Topsoil in the wild has weed seeds in in, so don't be surprised when something unusual comes up.  Old leaves you may have hanging around are also great for breaking up heavy soil, and as a bonus they attract earthworms.  If your leaves are large, run over them with a lawnmower to break them up first, then mix in the freshly chopped debris.  Bear in mind pine needles will mess with the pH of the soil and are probably better avoided unless you are planting an acid-loving plant (blueberries, or azaleas, are good examples).

If you live on or near a swamp, or just have a typical Maryland quagmire for a backyard you can make a bed drier by raising it above ground level.  Excavate additional dirt from around where you're planting to get the bed a couple inches above grade, or make a simple raised bed out of old wood, a tire, concrete block, brick, or whatever can conveniently hold soil back when watered and allow excess moisture to drain out of the bottom.  If you live on a heavy slope, use a similar idea to make a step in the slope and hold the loosened soil back with a raised wall.  Basically, it's half a raised bed.  Don't overthink it.

If you are improvising a container because you are in an apartment, you will still need dirt.  Now is not a time we are encouraged to make *close* friends, so yelling at an appropriate social distance may be called for.  As stated earlier, you can scavenge soil from local easements, break up old potting soil, add leaves, and so on.  Additional matter can be saved to add mass to your potted planting:  Save old kitchen scraps, a little bit of coffee grounds, and/or scrap paper, tear them up, and plant them at the bottom of the bin (do not leave scraps or coffee stuff up top: one attracts bugs and mice, the other is highly acidic and may harm younger plants).  You can improvise a container from almost anything that won't decompose when wet: old storage bins, unused large cups bowls from the kitchen, reusable plastic grocery bags, and so on.  When picking a container, ideally, water can exit the bottom, either because the sides are already a little porous or because you've got a hammer and the solution for once in your life looks like a nail.  If not, just be careful not to overwater your plants -- whatever the soil is like on top, it's wetter on the bottom.  Apartment gardens also need to factor in light.  The more you get, the better.  If you do not, multi-spectrum ""daylight"" bulbs are a good option to supplement natural light, or, if you don't have those, set up two lights that have a ""warm"" and ""cool"" bulb in each.  Different light bulbs have different spectrums, and combining two of different colors means you're likely to get closer to sunlight.  

Step 3:  PLANTING

You have dirt, the time is right, now put two and two together!  Seed packets will have a recommended planting depth on them for how deep and how well spaced the seeds should be.  This is generally pretty easy, just follow the directions and don't overthink it.  Water well once you've got the seeds in.  Seeds need to be kept moist but not muddy until they are seedlings, or plants with their first true leaves, about an inch or two tall.  Try to pay attention to your seeds once or twice a day.  More often is very unnecessary, less than every day means you might let them dry out, and then your seeds will be dead and you'll have nothing but a nice pile of carefully prepared dirt to show for it.

If you have problems with squirrels or other pests (like a dog that likes to dig), you may need to put a barrier around where you put your seeds to keep them from being dug up or flung.  Chicken wire is great, but any decent post and barrier can make an impromptu fence - dowel rods, sticks from a nearby tree, and old fabric, plastic sheeting, that painting drop cloth you forgot about, the heavy brown paper you put down when you eat crabs.  You will likely only have it up for a couple weeks, until your seedlings are big enough that clandestine diggers won't bother them, so don't worry about the longevity of the thing. 

Then, be patient.  Some plants take three weeks to come up.  Some only take days.  And as it's cool, if you started them outside, expect it to take longer.  If you're speeding things up, start your seeds inside where it's warm -- heat usually makes the process go faster.  However, be kind putting your indoor seedlings out -- they aren't used to bright light, brisk winds, or the cold, so you may have to spoil them a little by putting them outside an hour or two a day for a week before putting them outside permanently.  Plants, like people, can shock in a new environment.  Sometimes they recover, sometimes not.

Step 4:  GROW, BABY, GROW

If you have developed some kind of star wars Force powers that let you grow things faster, by all means, teach me.  If you haven't, then now is the time to look at the little guys longingly while wishing them to be larger.  Wish really, really hard.

You are probably going to need to thin your plants out at a certain point, before they get too crowded to grow well.  Lettuce, pea, and spinach thinings can be taken in and devoured as baby greens.  Others can be disposed of, or re-planted in more pots or land if its available.  Now is when you get your neighbor into gardening, using free plants like casinos have free giveaways. 

Also, you may find your first pests coming out to say hello.  I have a particular loathing for slugs, but there's a wide variety of other things that may visit your garden to partake of your harvest, including deer, rabbits, groundhogs, squirrels, beetles, worms, mosquitoes, caterpillars, and two-legged thieves.  There are things to be done about these, but they're best dealt with once you know it's a problem.  Other things to look forward to might include butterflies, moths, ladybugs, fireflies, bees, and wasps (although thankfully, typically not yellow jackets, which prefer literal garbage to a garden).  Again, deal with them as they come.  You will never have to deal with ALL the pests at one time (statistically speaking).

Step 5: ENJOY!

The ""time to harvest"" is a good piece of information that should be on your seed packet.  Some crops will take until fall to mature, some, only a few weeks.  These estimated times are from germination to harvest, not from planting to harvest, so again, be patient.  Things that you could be eating within a month or two are spinach, radishes, lettuce, spring onions, and other greens.  Things you could be eating in two-ish months are beans, peas, beets, even more greens, and maybe a couple baby carrots if you're really, really lucky.  MOST other crops will take longer than that, which means in an ideal situation you will be out in the real world again, your gardening adventure forgotten, and covid-19 a distant unpleasant memory.

However, if you're thinking of giving up on those crops, give it another think.  Lots of our vegetable picking help is dependent on labor that is imported, illegal, or temporary.  I don't expect fresh vegetable prices to go down this year -- if anything, it's going to skyrocket due to a labor shortage.  I remember zucchini being 89 cents a pound in season.  Now we have them all the time, but they're $2.49 a pound year round and $1.89 if you're lucky.  I know how much zucchini produce if you're having a good year, and $1.89 in season is ridiculous.  

Also, as a P.S.A., home grown food doesn't necessarily taste better, but it will taste *more* and be better for you.  My lettuce is more bitter, but it actually *has* a flavor instead of being crunchy water, and home harvested plants are known to be higher in nutrition, possibly because the plants aren't overfertilized to grow fast like in a commercial setting.  That being said, the luxury plants of gardening are mind-blowingly good versus the store bought things.  Strawberries ripened on your porch, in the sun?  Perfection.  A good home-grown one will perfume a room.

Step 6:  NETWORKING

So after all that, if you still have questions, I'll be paying attention to my inbox in the next few days to weeks to help however I can.  If you are also a local gardener and want to chime in with your two cents, now would be the time.  What are you looking forward to in the near future?  Were there any blooms that stopped you in your tracks lately?  Have you eaten something fresh yet?  

TL;DR Put plants in good dirt in a sunny spot, follow packet directions, keep 'em damp, and be patient.  You'll be fine.",baltimore,Panic bought seeds? Not sure what to do with them? Here's some local help!

78% percent of [workers in the U.S. live paycheck](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html) to paycheck.

This is not a small issue or a problem affecting only the impoverished. A record 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment [just two weeks ago](https://twitter.com/business/status/1243157085208162304?s=20). This is still happening everywhere, all the time right now because many millions of people are not able to work.

**TLDR:** Nationwide, [citizens are applying for](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-unemployment-claims-crash-websites/) unemployment insurance at such a high rate that it's been regularly crashing government website all month. Phone lines in Maryland have [long been producing nothing but dial tones]([https://twitter.com/MD\_Labor/status/1245147532092682240](https://twitter.com/MD_Labor/status/1245147532092682240)). People can't find work and can't pay their bills.

What is important to note is that there are **many** caveats to prevent workers from being able to simply apply online. For example: working out of state, having more than 3 jobs in 18 months, or being self-employed, among other circumstances.

The system is broken and there is no indication from our leaders that changes are coming. Per my link to the MD Labor department above, look at the replies; even extending call time accessibility is NOT working.

**Possible solutions from the government:**

\- Federal or state level rent and mortgage freezes until the pandemic is resolved, or a working system is presented.

\- Allow all applicants to submit for insurance online

\- **Weekly or monthly** emergency Universal Basic Income, at least until this is all resolved. Canada has already [implemented this](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/government-wins-unanimous-consent-to-quickly-pass-legislation-for-covid-19-help).

**List of possible actions for Marylanders:**

\- A coordinated rent strike, as seen in [California](https://www.newsweek.com/tenants-plan-rent-strikes-california-coronavirus-pandemic-1495460), St,. Louis and [many other cities across the U.S.](https://www.ibtimes.com/coronavirus-lockdown-out-work-tenants-drawn-rent-strike-2950165)

I’m looking to buy a house, so id like to hear thoughts on long term living. I’m from Philly and lived right outside of nyc in NJ for a short stint. I lived out in dc suburbs for a little while, but I prefer to live in the city.  I can handle myself well so I’ll be fine in areas that aren’t the safest, but I’d rather not be in the terrible areas. Y’all know what I mean. 
I’m looking for up and coming areas. 

I do have a car, so I’m hoping to buy In an area where houses may have private parking or a decent amount of street parking. 

My budget is around 300k, but spending less if possible would be cool. I’d also like an area that is easy to rent out if need be, this is less important Though. 

I like to walk/run so hoping for an area with decent walkabilty/surroundings and room to run. 

My girlfriend would be living with me, we need an area where she’d feel safe walking alone at times (important!) as she doesn’t have a car. 

Any thoughts would be helpful :)

tl;dr - looking for the best area to buy a house and start a life in. Future potential is very important.",baltimore,Thinking of moving to Baltimore - best areas?

2611,2611,Biomirth,1585966052,fulfwq,Nan,"For a month the CDC and WHO have been slowly and methodically getting their collective messaging in order to really unify on the message ""If you're not sick don't wear a mask"". Having laboratory and food contamination expertise and a science background I initially followed my own conclusion: Wearing a mask will provide me some prophylactic and most importantly will prevent me from touching my face in areas that will contaminate me. But eventually, when these and other organizations and science reporters all conclusively landed on their position, I listened. Though \*\*they do not mention this\*\* the problem with having untrained people wear masks is that they will: 1. Become overconfident and expose themselves more than without the mask, and 2. Will not be willing or able or knowledgeable enough to follow sanitation procedures when putting on and taking off protective gear. It's true that if you're not very careful the protective gear itself can and will cause you to infect yourself if you've encountered significant material. It's not true that either of these things actually outweigh the general prophylactic effects of wearing the gear.

Then yesterday they change their tune when they realize that breathing and talking may promote enough virus into the air to be contagious. We've known this was a possibility since the virus was discovered. Even if this were not the case, the overall preventative benefit of wearing a mask far outweighs the imagined and largely marginal drawbacks.

So why did they do it? Why did they collaborate to mislead the general public into thinking that masks 'Only help sick people stop spreading'? The answer will be complex and won't fully be understood until long after this is over. Some of it is just ignorance of behavior. Some is a poor conflation of 'use a homemade mask' with 'Oh no, we are depriving industrial masks from the hospitals'. There are many factors at play in this response, but the main takeaway that makes me really angry is: They refused to establish or make claims about \*\*why\*\* masks wouldn't help the healthy because they knew their reasoning was flimsy and thus they've lied about it by omitting the uncertainty.

The public deserved the truth from the beginning, that unless you're very disciplined about how you wash yourself before and after using prophylactic equipment that you may be at some risk of increasing your infection risk. This would have put the public on the front foot in terms of videos and conversations about best practices. About how to make homemade masks and sterilize them effectively. Instead we've gotten another about-face that is largely/mostly unrelated to changes in the factual understanding of the virus and mostly due to a public health service at the federal level that was unwilling to empower it's own citizens (It's bosses) to make their own decisions based upon the facts.

These kinds of failures in government turn whole generations into cynics and nihilists more than we ever needed to have occur. Standing up against your government is every bit as important as coming together when we need to change the social contract. When you betray the people with misguided misinformation so blatantly you engender the former and erode the latter.",baltimore,"Wear a Mask when going into confined spaces, such as stores, post office, a drop off for someone.

I miss hosting, and thought I would start doing virtual trivia games for my friends and family...and want to invite others in Baltimore! It's free to play, and we will be using WebEx (free to download online). I will accept tips via Venmo, and half of the tips I earn will go to a different Baltimore charity each week. This week I will be donating to Baltimore Community Foundation's Evolving Community Need's Fund for Corona. Please note that tipping is completely optional...I'm really just doing this because I'm bored and want to interact virtually with others :) Plus donating to awesome organizations makes it worthwhile! 

If you would like to play, the first game will be this Tuesday, April 7th at 8:00pm.

At least the playground and tennis courts were empty and the majority of people were on their own or in pairs but the whole experience didn't feel very socially distant.

Going on past the southern end of the park I saw a big crowd congregating outside of Bmore Licks. I've been a big supporter of theirs in the past but the situation outside of the business right now is not good. When I got home I saw that story about Lee's Pint and Shell. I also heard about a group of jackasses on crotchrockets congregating on Broadway Square. Yesterday in the Inner Harbor there was a group of black hebrew israelite whatever they're called crackpots spewing their hate outside of Ripley's Believe it or Not. I've been fortunate enough not to have to drive for the past couple of weeks but apparently even the damned squeegee kids are still out.

Filed 6 days ago, today I got two letters from MD; one is letting me know my basic weekly benefit amount and total weekly amount are $430, and lets me know to contact them if I need to file a dispute. The other was asking me if I want to withhold taxes.

Neither of these letters seemed to actually confirm if I was receiving that amount (which seems high?), what next steps were, or if I needed to file a job contacts report. I'm thinking this number isn't anything to set store by and it's just what I might ""qualify"" for.  Is that correct, or am I at some tbd date going to get $430 weekly?

I'm luckier than some in that my wife is a teacher so her job was safe, but the idea of bringing in nothing until we get through this pandemic wasn't exactly appealing...

I run a few small but popular independent Trivia nights around Baltimore (Wicked Sisters, Peabody Heights, Mick O'Shea's etc.) and decided I'd try to figure out how to possibly do them online. After a few spectacular failures with Facebook live and some other platforms I found a good system involving Zoom, and much to my surprise it has become a pretty big hit!! I've had 2-3 games per night for 23 nights in a row now, as well as some company and private games, and yesterday I did a fundraiser for BARCS that raised over $2,000. The success of the game has enabled me to hire 2 friends who both lost their jobs too, and I'm obviously looking to continue improving and growing.

The game is Walsh Trivia Online and it is a genuine bar trivia sans the bar. You can play on your own, with the people in your house, or get the whole gang together and play online. I write a new game every day, have 2 to 3 games per night, and charge $2.00 per player for just over an hour of entertainment. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. I really have been so lucky with this to date, but some of my favorite regulars (now friends) from my local Trivia games found me through Reddit, and I wanted to post here in case anyone wanted to check it out. If the game keeps growing, then I''ll continue to hire people who lost their income as I did, and obviously helping charities and organizations who can't run standard fundraisers will be part of the plan too.

Anyway if you're interested in checking it out then click on any of the links below. I have games at 7:30pm and 9:00pm tonight if you'd like to play, or if you just want more information then e-mail me: stephen @ walshtrivia.com

 The 145th edition of the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore will be postponed due to coronavirus concerns, while the highly-anticipated Infield Fest has been called-off.

In a statement this week, the Stronach Group and Maryland Jockey Club said that they are working with “key stakeholders to explore all options to set a new date for the running of Preakness 145, [***Fox Baltimore***](https://foxbaltimore.com/sports/sports-unlimited/preakness-update-date-still-unknown-but-no-infieldfest-for-2020) reports.

“Our first priority in these difficult times is the health and well-being of our customers, our vendors, our employees and horses we all love,” a joint statement read. “A decision will be made on a new date for Preakness 145 and will take into consideration all of the recommended best practices from local and governmental health authorities to protect our community.”

The decision was made to cancel this year’s InfieldFest, which both groups described as a “vibrant and cherished event for Baltimore City that brings together thousands of fans for legendary performances, unique hospitality and curated activations during the Preakness Stakes.”

“This was a difficult decision but we are confident that it was the right one,” both groups continued. “We look forward[(read more....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/04/preakness-cancels-infield-fest-2020/)",baltimore,"Preakness Cancels Infield Fest for 2020, Reschedule Date Still Unknown"

I was temporarily laid off until we are able to return to work when things settle down. I filed on the 23rd and then last week got  a letter asking about withholding taxes which was a question I answered on the application online. I mailed that back the day I received it. 

Today I got an email telling me that I will be receiving a letter in the mail outlining ""obligations upon filing a claim"". The FAQ about COVID unemployment claims the unemployment office has posted states that if you are temporarily laid off you don't have to look for employment elsewhere. The email I received says you have to look for employment if you are to be receiving unemployment benefits. Does anyone know what the correct answer is to this? I'd rather not end up working elsewhere as I quite like my job and would like to return to it when covid passes. Am I supposed to seek employment elsewhere and then quit there when I can go back to my job? 

It's now been two weeks since I applied and I assume they are overwhelmed with applicants but I've called dozens of times each of the last 2 days and I had sent several emails last week that have gone unanswered.

For the first time ever a private ambulance company will be supplementing the fire departments ambulance and medic units. The company is Hart to Heart which [previously fined 1.2 million dollars for fraud](https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/hart-heart-ambulance-services-pay-125-million-settle-federal-false-claims-act-allegations) will be taking low priority 911 calls in a Basic Life Support capacity. Baltimore city has given Hart to Heart MDT's and fire department radios. I think it's kinda shady they did a no bid contract with a company that has previously had some issues with the law. There are over 30 other private ambulance companies licensed in Maryland.

Here is the contract for the emergency supplemental ambulances on CitiBuy website which is the Cities contract solicitation website.

204,204,neotheb,1586651779,fzmlvq,COVID-19,"So this evening I got pinged by our home security system that in essence captured our immediate neighbour trespassing through our alley gate, on to our property, touching stuff in our backyard (presumably to fix their crudley constructed fence). Sans gloves. Sans mask.  


Now in most scenarios I'd be upset that a.) they didn't feel particularly bothered to just ask , considering the fix b.) they sent a child to do their work putting them at risk. But I'm probably most upset that he doesn't feel particularly bothered by the risk of infection (spreading or acquiring) given the context of A FUCKING PANDEMIC.  


Additional content: this is a man that verbally abuses his live in partner (thin walls) and said kid likely has some developmental issues and plays video games at full blast, screaming obscenities, for hours on end daily (since city schools were in effect closed but this has continued as they've reopened virtually, again thin walls.) He owns several giant pickups and routinely boxes out residents on the street by claiming as much of it as possible (literally moving his car once anyone else leaves). Its part and parcel of a pattern of latent narcissistic behavior.   


I'm aware he needed our permission to enter our property but I'm hesitant to get the cops involved (and bringing up the latter point of frequent screaming matches and domestic abuse we were told any intervention could make things worse) but sending your kid to go spelunking in the neighbours , without their consent, in the middle of a fucking pandemic seems like my line. We're on the verge of calling 311 and filing a trespassing police report but would love some input from other folks who have had to deal with asshole neighbours.

1) Is there a way to send donations for books, magazines, comics, masks to the kids in the Juvenile Detention center? Either through the public defenders or through the Department of Juvenile Services? Additionally, Is there anyone familiar with these offices, or the process of getting materials into the detention center, that knows?

368,368,Shento,1587169337,g3dy4f,COVID-19,"Don't use citizen that much but saw a video by user yahwehtzedenku under ""Celebrate Baltimore's Essential Workers""  that claims the virus isn't real and it's just a way to get Donald Trump out of office.

These types of videos are dangerous, especially considering apparently there have already been false rumors spread that African Americans can't get COVID-19 (Which may be why African Americans in the city some of the most affected by it, I realize Baltimore is more African American, but even considering that it is way out of proportion)

I can't find any way to report the video or anything. Does Citizen have such a feature?

I really really hope this is not a commonly held belief but...with what i've seen with society, such as the protests in Michigan, it sadly wouldnt be that suprising",baltimore,Does anyone use citizen and see the crazy video under Celebrate Baltimore's Essential Workers

Can anyone else who had this and moved attest to what they did with the thermostat? If I could I would just keep it, and replace it with a cheapo model myself before moving.

Although you would need to narrow the time down the BPD could ask the MTA for bus footage for a specific time and location. Those buses have a lot of HD cameras but the video is only stored for a number of days.
