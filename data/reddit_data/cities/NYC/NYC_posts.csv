If you do not have plans now, there are no plans to be made with advice from Reddit.

There are no hidden gems or secret hacks that will be revealed to you through Reddit.

Stop making your meager pointless existence known to me. Be silent. Stop posting your pointless post and dribble. 

Realize that you are a waste of space.

You clutter up this forum, Reddit, the web, the city, the state, the nation and the world.

I will no longer suffer your presence in silence. 

I will dedicate 2020 to ascending myself and removing your presence. I will report you. You will be caught. You will be found out. You will be ruined. everything you own and every relationship will be destroyed. 

You will all face general bad luck. 

I will use the power of legal reporting to authorities both public and private and prayer to achieve your removal. 

There are too many of you. I will get you all one by one.

You will be fired, disowned, arrested, deported, whatever applies to you personally. Or suffer great circumstantial tragedy. 

I will get all of you. Jointly and severally and individually. 

There are too many of you lemmings. The herd needs to be thinned out. 

Realize you do not matter at all. You are interfering with my ability to take part in anything. So your presence will be gone. 

Life is musical chairs and you have no seat. No place at the table.

There is no party for you to attend. No job. No apartment. No room. No volunteer position. And nobody wants you petting their dog. 

You should never have existed in the first place.

I pray for you to befall a tragedy. Be it disease, trauma (mental or physical), loss. Know that you belong nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who works in community solar in New York, this is great news to hear. I really liked a few things the author mentioned in the article above:

&amp;#x200B;

1. He shared how New York accomplished this goal through much different means than other states. Rather than massive utility-scale solar projects, NY has become a national leader through distributed generation, such as community solar, which you can also learn more about [here](https://powermarket.io/faq.html), which is where I work btw.
2. It talks about how this is an exciting accomplishment, yet it makes clear that there‚Äôs still a lot of work to be done. For example, there‚Äôs a statewide target to hit 6 GW by 2025, yet SEIA estimates we‚Äôre only going to install 3.6 GW. However, a 2011 [study](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/science/earth/16solar.html?mtrref=pv-magazine-usa.com&amp;gwh=AB484AD275F239E4A811DB7CA23D6899&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=REGIWALL) by CUNY estimates that 2/3 of all NYC rooftops are eligible for solar. As the price continues to come down, this is an exciting prospect as well.

&amp;#x200B;

142,michaellaw_,1577913019,einue0,Nan,"So around last summer, a number of issues were raised about Grubhub/Seamless treatment of its partners. I actually used to joke about this to my class, but I didn't realize just how much of a problem it was until it got a ton of media coverage in the later half of 2019. As a frequent Seamless user, this made me think.

So I took it upon myself to build a service that provides everything I am aware that  Grubhub/Seamless does, save for the provision of a fleet. That is: if a restaurant can deliver it's own food, they can save a ton of money. That's my intention, anyway. The dream is that a restaurant could save enough money to do things like hire another chef, renovate their space, or something like that.

I actually saw a thread not too long ago where someone seemed to be trying to rally others to assist in the building of such a platform, but it looked like the consensus was that no one was willing to put in the time without it being their full-time job. But I knew that for me, it wouldn't take long at all.

Just kidding. It took an inordinate amount of time. But I wanted to be sure the entire thing worked and on every current device.

So my reason for posting here is this:

1) I'm wondering do people actually care if their restaurant can save 15%-25% per order?  
2) How many people really care about saving a few bucks on the delivery fee?  
3) Are people aware of the issues between Seamless and their partners?  
4) Was me building this completely unnecessary?

I want to make it clear that I'm aware that Grubhub/Seamless value proposition is more than merely having a fleet. You don't build something like this without studying the ""competition"". 

This isn't an attempt to ""put a dent in the universe"" or ""elevate the world's consciousness"". This is a NYC-specific app.

My main goal is to ascertain whether or not a damn is given about the issue, not promotion, so I'm not sharing links to the app here. Out of principle, I wouldn't ask you to sign up for something I created without showing you my face.

I'd love to discuss it or answer any questions you might have.

**TL;DR**

Made an online ordering app. Wondering if I went too far left and no one cares.",nyc,I'm not sure if people actually wanted a Grubhub/Seamless alternative. But I did it anyway.

There was literally no where to sit unless you bought a table. I have been to clubs where there is the normal area to sit and then you can pay for VIP. But there were really no ""normal"" seats. That means if you don't want to spring for a table and bottle service, you have to stand for 5- 6 hours. After paying $130+ $15 service fee, I could not believe there was absolutely no where for customers to sit. I get Manhattan is expensive, but I paid $145 to be there, and I don't get a place to rest?

Part of my 2020 resolutions is to get back into editing &amp; writing. I studied Journalism &amp; Creative Writing at CUNY Baruch College, where I co-founded an online literary non-fiction magazine, acting as a copy editor. In addition, I was an editor at another literary fiction magazine at school. Since graduating in 2018, I, sadly, have not really been writing or editing at all due to life, work, etc., but I want to stop creating excuses starting this year.

&amp;#x200B;

FYI, I currently work full-time in public relations and marketing, but I'm willing to offer my services as a freelance editor or English tutor after my job or over the weekends. This would be perfect for high school and college students. Full disclosure: I am not offering to write your essays, but I will help you become a stronger writer who's capable of writing clear, succinct sentences. I don't believe in ""good writing."" Only good editors exist in this world. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additional information: I live in Kew Gardens / Forest Hills &amp; work in Midtown East, but can travel anywhere in New York City to help out. Depending on the circumstances &amp; the ask, meeting in-person may not even be required at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Rates are totally negotiable. Please, inquire within! Can't wait to start getting back into this.",nyc,Freelance Editor / English Tutor Available

[*City lawmakers want to impose gentrification tax*](https://nypost.com/2019/12/25/city-lawmakers-want-to-impose-gentrification-tax/)*, New York Post,* December 26, 2019

Here‚Äôs one thing that unites local pols across the political divide ‚Äî a gentrification tax.

A bipartisan group of city lawmakers is pushing Albany to approve tweaks to the state tax laws that would allow them to hit new homebuyers with tax bills based on the actual market prices of their properties.

The coalition of 13 Republican and Democratic city council members says that taxes would not go up for existing owners.

New York‚Äôs famously opaque property tax system offers big breaks to new homebuyers by taxing them at assessed values that are often millions of dollars less than the market price.

For instance, a buyer who snapped up a Clinton Hill brownstone for $3 million in 2017 only has to pay taxes on a sliver of that amount ‚Äî $24,000, leaving the lucky owner with a tax bill of just $4,297 a year.

Meanwhile, the owner of a relatively modest half-million-dollar Bergen Beach bungalow pays nearly an identical amount, despite being worth just one-sixth the price on the market.

The current system amounts to a giant giveaway for gentrifiers, Staten Island Councilman Joe Borelli told The Post.

‚ÄúPeople are just getting fed up with the loophole, and they‚Äôre demanding action,‚Äù the GOP politician added.

The bipartisan coalition also includes Park Slope Democrat Brad Lander and Bay Ridge Democrat Justin Brannan.

They‚Äôre backing a resolution that calls on state lawmakers to change the tax law to require new homebuyers to pay property taxes on the market rate instead of the heavily discounted assessed value.

The change would boost the Clinton Hill gentrifiers bill by $1,600 a year while keeping the Bergen Beach old timer‚Äôs costs the same.

435,__prison__mike__,1578276095,ekmznr,Nan,"While I couldn't attend today's rallies, it's good to see that many people are already getting geared up to protest expanded foreign intervention.  That being said, I wanted to talk about a few things I've learned from living through the post 9/11 years, the anti-war movement subsequent to that, working in politics and having a Persian wife.

~The government doesn't give a shit about protests.  The largest anti-war protests in US history failed to stop the Iraq intervention when it occurred.  Protests in Times Square aren't going to show up on decision makers radars, let alone influence them in any meaningful way.

~Politicians do care about correspondence.  E-mails do not go unnoticed.  Written letters to offices of senators and reps are taken surprisingly seriously.  Angry (but respectful) phone calls are very much listened to and considered.  Opinion pieces in news papers that cover a politicians district do get their attention.  One hour of engaging in direct contact with your rep or senator is much more impactful than three hours of protesting.

~If a rep or senator ever holds an open forum, GO.  Open forums really help to shape the way a politician votes.  If you show up to an open forum, you're a 100% guaranteed voter in their mind.  You're also probably motivated enough to be an activist for your cause.

~I worked on a rather long winded and publicized campaign in Massachusetts to legalize casino gambling.  For a good five or so years, despite having majority support in polling and tremendous moneyed interests at play, gaming bills failed to materialize.  I chalk this up entirely due to the unrelenting and passionate opposition movement.  Then, around 2010, for reasons still unknown to those in my camp or people I became close to in the anti-gaming camp, the opposition almost instantaneously evaporated.  The drive and determination just disappeared and within a year, enough reps and senators in the state felt comfortable voting ""yes"".  The point is, a meaningful and successful opposition doesn't rest and doesn't give up.  It takes a lot of time and effort and energy past going to a few demonstrations.  This is a *long term* endeavor.

~When discussing the matter with people (or politics in general), don't name call, be rude, condescending or mean.  Don't treat your political views like you do sports teams.  Try and take emotion out of the equation and discuss facts calmly and respectfully.  Present *solutions* rather than complaints.  For example, rather than say ""Trump fucked up in Iran AGAIN how are we going to get out of this?!‚Äù Say, ‚ÄúAmerica should consider withdrawing its military forces from the region, and remove sanctions in exchange for denuclearization‚Äù.  Having a solution in place takes away uncertainty and therefore, hostility.  Try it out sometime.  

~The killing of Soleimani is extremely polarizing.  Iran has lionized him to bolster support at home.  His death may calm factions tired of the government, or it may bolster them.  Soleimani was responsible for terror campaigns directed at Iranian dissenters and is seen as one of the ‚Äúenforcers‚Äù of the Iranian government.  Lots of Persians hate their objectively repressive, psychotically religious government.  Lots of Iraqis too hate the man; they see Soleimani as a snake trying to influence their government and as a person responsible for much of the political and economic turmoil faced in the country ATM.  This is NOT a justification for killing him - just a reminder that Soleimani was a terrible person who was hated by many, domestic and foreign.

~Military intervention in Iran is polling in the mid teens.  There is a lot of conservative opposition to war too.  Tucker Carlson for example (whom many on the left hate, sometimes for good reason) has already emerged as a staunchly anti-war voice.  He is quite respected in conservative circles, and many will follow his lead.  Again, when pushing your anti-war message, don‚Äôt seek to alienate conservative support by attacking conservatives, trump voters, etc themselves.  Put aside petty politics and personal differences and build bridges with your fellow Americans, even if (ESPECIALLY IF) they voted Trump.

~America has unquestionably destabilized the ME, and has done so at the cost of thousands of American lives and hundreds of thousands of foreign lives.  America has done incalculable damage.  That being said, don‚Äôt loose sight of Iran and the desires of it‚Äôs extremely regressive, fanatical government.  The Iranian government maintains their power through force, violence, torture and intimidation.  They are equally as interested in exporting their brand of zealous, Stone Age religion to neighboring states.  A nuclear Iran is an Iran that can blackmail neighbors into capitulation, as well as sell nuclear materials and weapons to its extensive network of terror cells.  The west needs to denuclearize Iran - it is a question of civilization, not of foreign policy.  America withdrawing its military forces in the region would be a good way to start that discussion.  A ratified treaty with congress and lifted sanctions are another.  It gives people something to think about and focus on‚Ä¶an actual concept rather than a broad general idea.

Anyways‚Ä¶I hope this finds you all well.",nyc,To my fellow anti-war NYCers...

If you‚Äôre going to be taking a shared ride in NYC, always choose Via over Lyft. I‚Äôve taken a ton of Via shared rides over the past couple years and maybe four or five Lyft ones (I‚Äôve never taken an Uber shared ride).

On my Via trips the route always makes sense; obviously if there are a bunch of pickups/stops it‚Äôll take longer, but when I‚Äôm going northeast the car is always going north or east, when I‚Äôm going southwest the car is always going south or west, etc.

With Lyft however, in every shared ride I‚Äôve been in the car at at least one point is going in the opposite direction from my destination. If there‚Äôs minimal traffic this might only add a few minutes to the trip, but if there‚Äôs a lot of traffic this can make what should be a 30 minute trip 50 minutes.

Just as an example, this morning I got in the Lyft in the east village with my destination at 52nd and Park. One person was already in the car and we picked up another. The route turned west to drop off the first person at 45th between 2nd and 3rd, and then *turned south* to drop off the next person at 42nd/Lex.

I understand why this was done, but it‚Äôs crazy. Dropping off the first person at 43rd/2nd would‚Äôve been a little more than two blocks to walk, and dropping off the second at 45th/Lex would‚Äôve been three blocks to walk. But our three routes simply should not have been combined. I had to wait another 15 minutes going south on Lexington to 40th Street to turn east then go back up Park to get to my destination. I would‚Äôve gotten there faster just walking from 45th/Lex.",nyc,Lyft‚Äôs shared ride route algorithm is horrible compared to Via‚Äôs

So some background: my girlfriend lived in Manhattan for a year while going to school and in the summer of 2019 moved to another state.

A few months ago she responded to the summons with a notice that she no longer lived in NYC. We thought it was a done deal until the second letter came. Guess her response got lost in the postal service?

Anyway, she sent certified mail with another notice of her residence in another state. She also sent an email with this same information, including her lease agreement, driver's license, voter registration, and pay stub, all from her new state of residence.

She also called today and no one picked up for 4 hours. What is going on over there?

523,sticknpoke419,1578360822,el419m,Nan,"TLDR; After moving out of our apartment in Brooklyn, NY on September 1, 2019, we expected to have our security deposit returned within the legal time frame. After 122 days, we received the first written explanation for why we were never sent a deposit.

After many attempts to contact the landlord, including through the attorney general‚Äôs office, they still refuse to return our deposit and are now threatening legal action for two months rent because we gave them 30 days notice of intent to vacate instead of 90 days. (We completed the lease‚Äôs full term.) On January 4, 2020, they sent us a list of damages that we can prove aren‚Äôt valid.

At this point, we are seeking legal assistance to determine our next steps. The Attorney General encouraged us to go to Small Claims Court, but now that they‚Äôre threatening to sue us for considerably more, we‚Äôd like to see if we have a valid case. 

;

We moved into a 3-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY in September 2018. We gave the landlords 30 days notice to vacate moved out at the end of our lease, a year later on August 31, 2019. We thoroughly cleaned the apartment as per the lease, left nothing in it, and vacated in a timely manner. We also took pictures and videos proving the apartment was in an orderly state. 

After 14 days, the legal amount of time allotted for landlords to return the security deposit or provide an itemized list of reasonable deductions, we contacted the landlords repeatedly with no success. The landlord said they refused to send our deposit by mail, requiring that we instead come in person to their office. We went into the office, where they claimed that we left the apartment dirty, with a damaged floor, and left items in the apartment, all of which are untrue. The lease also stated we must give them 90 days notice of vacating, and that they can charge us a full months rent for every month we fail to give notice. We only gave them 30, so they said that they could sue in us in civil court for up to 2 months rent. However, we know that the apartment was leased and there was no gap between us and the next renters.

We sent a letter demanding our security deposit on 10/10/19 to the landlord (certified mail), management company, and associated PO box and called multiple times but heard nothing, so we filed a complaint with the NY State Attorney General‚Äôs Office on 11/13/19. The Attorney General wrote us a letter on 1/2/20 telling us they were taking our case on. They sent us a letter on December 30 saying that despite their repeated efforts, the landlord failed to respond and that they could not help us further. 

We know the next step is small claims court. However, we are worried that they can sue us for 2 months rent in civil court ($5,800) because we technically agreed to the clause in the lease that says they can charge us a months rent for every month we failed to return the deposit. As for their other claims, we can prove they're false. The landords sent us on January 2, 2020 (the same day we got the final letter from the attorney general) outlining the reason they are withholding the deposit (damages, late notice to vacate) and saying they are considering legal action (we assume this is posturing). We also would like to know if New York General Obligations Law 7- 108 (1-e) applies to us, as it went into effect after we signed our lease, but before our lease ends. This law states that if our deposit, or an itemized statement saying why it is not being returned, is not returned within 14 days of vacating, the landlord forfeits any claim to it. Obviously, if this applied to us it would make our lives a lot easier. We would appreciate any advice. Thank you!",nyc,Crooked landlord refusing to return security deposit

I arrogantly thought this ONLY happened to the undocumented and to men; rarely to women and especially not to a US citizen like myself. 

I need encouragement, advice and maybe some anecdotes to feel I am not alone, because as a woman and a minority I feel completely powerless in finding this snake of an owner accountable. The bait-n-switch, the deception evidenced by the coded language he used to conceal that he was robbing me without full-out admitting it, paying me at $6.75 for what I thought was one day of training which turned into 41 hours of work at $6.75. Nothing in writing and no stubs that were promised to me. 

A lying, thieving snake who is enriching himself and his family while living in his Long Island Hamlet. Disgusting and evil to rob people already making minimum wage, and exploiting them to get as much work done as possible while one has them at their mercy for a promise of payment. And then the switch to add insult to injury: ‚ÄúPay? What money are you talking about? I already paid you...‚Äù

I‚Äôm CERTAIN this will only get worse and more pervasive now that the minimum wage has increased. There are owners who probably just scoffed at the idea of abiding by the new wage law. I‚Äôll be submitting documents to the Department of Labor of course (with plenty of photographic evidence to boot), as I not only want him to be held accountable for my theft but also the theft of the others, all young women in their early 20s (one girl disclosed he doesn‚Äôt pay overtime while she has had to work 50-60 hours during the holidays; she worked knowing he wouldn‚Äôt pay her. Poor girl is only 21 and thinks this is OK and probably expected).

What the hell is wrong with NYC? I‚Äôm honest and pay my damn taxes (and expect to; he provided no stubs when I‚Äôve requested them twice) and yet these scumbags operate without a care in the world.

This really makes me consider moving to a state with stronger wage laws; I feel NYC should be at the forefront of punishing these violations harshly given our massive work force and its demographics but I feel it‚Äôs a lost cause. NYC loves cheap labor and I want no parts in this, none. I have become angry to the point of retribution but it‚Äôs not worth going to jail over. The violation, anger and vengeance you feel cuts down to the bone when your money has been stolen.

And as it turns out, my brother revealed to me that two cousins of mine (both in their 20s) have become wage theft victims themselves in the past, which is disheartening. I was robbed of over $350, which is a speck compared to other thefts I‚Äôve read about, but it‚Äôs still theft and I needed that money to pay for this month‚Äôs metro card and groceries. I‚Äôm going to have to borrow from my dad.

How much more of living here can I take?!

P.S. If you are a someone who puts tips on the card, let‚Äôs say at coffee shops or restaurants, your tips may be pocketed by the owner and not collected by the counter person/server/etc. who assisted you. Customer tips intended for me literally just went straight into this snake‚Äôs pocket this past holiday season. Just be aware of this is all I‚Äôm saying.",nyc,Just became a victim of wage theft and I‚Äôm in utter disbelief

Barnes, a satiric play about the history and present of everyone's favorite personal injury lawyers, Cellino and Barnes. It was advertised on this sub a month ago, so I decided to check it out with my girlfriend, and here's my review:

&gt;!The play begins with Cellino proposing breaking up the firm, with Barnes throwing a fit over it because they've been in business so long and they've become wildly successful, despite seeming to be an incompetent and less-than-ethical law firm. Barnes is depicted as a cold, yet intelligent aficionado of the law, while Cellino is the dim-witted, happy-go-lucky face of the company, who is in charge of the firm's social aspects, such as sweet talking judges and other lawyers. Cellino wants to break up because Barnes will not hire his daughter, Jeanna (pronounced Gina).

&gt;!In the second act, we learn about what happened in the firm's past. Part of Act 2 is set in 2005, where Barnes visits a suspended Cellino. He got suspended for loan-sharking clients by giving them their settlement money before suits were settled and then charging extreme interest for repayment. Because Cellino was suspended, Barnes sets up ""The Barnes Firm"" and plans expansions all over the country. This upsets Cellino because he wanted to keep the firm as a local ""pop and pop"" firm. Eventually, Cellino partners back with Barnes and everything is okay for the time being.

&gt;!In the conclusion, Cellino and Barnes eventually make up and agree not to dissolve the firm. Barnes instructs Cellino to shred the breakup paperwork which they already signed, but Cellino accidentally faxes it, making the breakup official. But Cellino sees an opportunity for the firm to become even more successful, as he thinks the firm will get more business if people keep seeing ads for Cellino AND Barnes, despite them breaking up, so naturally, people will be intrigued.

Overall, a very funny play with great actors. But the real kicker? Most of the stuff I described actually happened. Cellino and Barnes did break-up partially over Barnes not wanting to hire Jeanna, Cellino was indeed suspended (not sure about the loan-sharking), and The Barnes Firm did indeed exist. So lots of bonus points for being historically accurate.! I'm not sure when they're playing next, but be on the lookout!",nyc,Cellino v. Barnes - My Casual Review (spoilers)

Yesterday I was riding the F train at commuting time (around 6:30pm) and the train was fairly crowded. I was sitting on the seat closest to the mid-cart door looking down at my phone and my friend was standing across from me. 

At the 14th Street stop (I think, I was looking down and barely paying attention) I all of a sudden felt my head snap back and it took me a few seconds to realize I had been punched in the side of the head. 

A (seemingly) homeless man who seemed to be on drugs at the time was exiting the train and turned back and punched me as he exited the train on the side of my head. This is on a crowded train in the early evening. I am a small-ish woman, and he was an older man. 

I was so shocked at first I didn‚Äôt know what to do and heard yelling outside and then the train pulled away. 

My friend saw him better than I did, and people were really concerned and saying I should report it and asking if there were cameras on the train and such but I was so overwhelmed I didn‚Äôt know what to say or how to react. 

I was so shocked I just started laughing - but now (the next day) my head still aches, I‚Äôm having trouble focusing, and I‚Äôm concerned he might hit someone else harder or in their face.

748,dentalcleaning,1578597479,emef0k,Nan,"Good afternoon everyone,

I posted here a few months back to offer the same service and I had met the most interesting and wonderful patients. Thank you all who trusted me and it is with your help, that I am now in my final semester of the dental hygiene program at City Tech. I'm now looking for patients again who may be interested in a deep cleaning. My clinic is located in downtown Brooklyn. The cost of the cleaning is $20 (Cash only) and no insurance needed. For seniors, it's $10. Yes, we also do cleanings for kids, it's $10 but the legal guardian must be present during the appointment. Along with this fee, you'll receive a goodie bag filled with dental product samples (toothbrush/floss/mouthrinse, depending on availability). If you were seen before and would like to return for another cleaning, you are more than welcome to come again!

Every initial visit will involve medical and dental history and a thorough assessment. This will help determine whether the individual patient is suitable for treatment at our facility. Cases that are beyond our scope of treatment will be given a referral. Dental x-rays and/or Medical clearance from a physician may be required prior to dental hygiene treatment.

Dental hygiene appointments are approximately 3-3.5 hours in length and the number of appointments needed to complete dental hygiene care will be determined by the type of treatment the patient requires.If you haven‚Äôt gotten a dental cleaning done within the past year, chances are you may have to come for more than one session.

All treatment is provided by students and supervised by licensed dentists and registered dental hygienists.

Clarification: You do have to be there for 3 full hours. Few people messaged me thinking they can book an appointment between the hours I provided. One session = one appointment.

Clinic Schedule:MONDAY 8AM-12PM, MONDAY 1-5PM. THURSDAY 8AM-12PM 

Appointments are available Starting February 2020 through May 2020. (I am graduating in May 2020)

Clinic address: New York City College of Technology - 285 Jay St (New Academic Building) 7th floor, Brooklyn NY 11201

Please email if you are interested in scheduling an appointment : [dentalcleaning2019@gmail.com](mailto:dentalcleaning2019@gmail.com)

 Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson are behind the creation of the Broadway musical based on their 1990s sitcom *The Nanny.*

The project was just announced this week by producers Brian and Scott Zeilinger with direction by Marc Bruni and music by *Crazy Ex-Girlfriend*‚Äòs Rachel Bloom and Adam Schlesinger. Bloom, who co-created and starred in CW‚Äôs *Crazy Ex-Girlfriend*, will write the musical‚Äôs song lyrics alongside Schlesinger; the team won an Emmy award for music from *Crazy Ex-Girlfriend*. Bloom shared with [***Deadline***](https://deadline.com/2020/01/fran-drescher-rachel-bloom-the-nanny-broadway-musical-1202824670/) that she‚Äôs excited for the film because *The Nanny* was ‚Äúa fundamental part of my childhood.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was the first time I saw an openly Jewish female protagonist on television,‚Äù Bloom said. ‚ÄúThe story of Fran Fine, however, is a universal one that has touched the hearts of people of every race, religion and orientation. I am so proud to be using[(read more...)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/01/fran-dresche-the-nanny-broadway-musical/)",nyc,"Fran Drescher, Rachel Bloom To Develop ‚ÄòThe Nanny‚Äô Broadway Musical"

Weird question: do you think you're expected to tip Capsule delivery drivers? I completely understand the realities of the delivery business, gig economy, etc. So if someone's living relies on tips by the very design of their pay structure, I don't want to stiff them. 

But, we don't tip everyone, right? So this one seemed like a possible grey area to me.

Capsule (prescription delivery service) really makes sure to tell you in their advertisements and on their website that ""delivery is free!"" And in the checkout &amp; payment process, there is nowhere to add a tip, like there is for similar services (Seamless, etc.). 

The first time I had something delivered, I didn't even think about a tip, since I always handle it during online payment for everything else like this, and the delivery is always, ""someone rings your bell, you open the door, say hello, they hand you the thing, transaction over.""

I thought about it after and felt like a jerk when I realized maybe I was supposed to tip! Argh! So, what does society say? Should I make sure to have cash on hand to tip Capsule delivery people? And if so... what's the norm, haha? A percentage of a prescription feels weird. Maybe just 5 bucks or something?

Perhaps one day we'll evolve beyond tipping, but for now, I just want to make sure I don't stiff someone who needs it!",nyc,Tip Capsule delivery people?

That said, I was hoping to ask this community for help: if you are comfortable sharing your story in a way that might help others understand your experience, I would love to include it on the website (they should be relatively brief -- maybe 2-3 paragraphs).

928,BigDongSingALong,1578798443,enhymf,Nan,"Forgive me for how long this is, I just see lots of discussion about the bail law and I‚Äôve heard way more about Mets tickets than the actual law.

First, I just want to talk about bail generally. When we talk about bail, we are talking people who are presumed to be completely innocent and are only *accused* of a crime. Once someone is accused of a crime and their criminal case begins, until the case resolves in a plea deal, dismissal, or trial, bail can be required by the court. If bail is set, they are required to pay the money or they are stuck in jail until their criminal case resolves. The thinking is this will force the accused person to have their ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù financially, so they‚Äôll be motivated to come to court and not violate their court conditions so they get their money back at the end, otherwise they lose their money and go to jail when they come back on a warrant.

Second, I‚Äôd like to talk about why bail reform happened.

**1. With bail, you are better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent.**

Nothing changes outcomes in the criminal legal system more than money. Imagine two people, similarly situated except for income. One living paycheck to paycheck, the other being well off. Judge imposes $10,000 bail on their cases. The accused living paycheck to paycheck will have no choice but to go to Rikers while his case is pending. How long will it take for them to lose their job, their kids, their home, their belongings? Can they really wait months or possibly years to get a trial and force the prosecution to prove their case ? Or will they end up pleading guilty even if they are innocent just to get out as fast as possible? What about the accused who is well off? They immediately pay bail, never spend a day in jail, and maintain everything they have while helping their attorney prepare their case for trial or negotiate a plea deal that doesn‚Äôt involve jail time. How meaningless is the experiment that is Democracy and America if money is more outcome determinative in a criminal legal system than the actual truth of what happened?

**2. It costs a lot of money and does not make us safer.**

It costs the state and city more than $300,000 per inmate a year to jail someone in Rikers Island. Yes, there are some scary people in there, accused of some very serious crimes, but most are not. Unfortunately, it costs the same to house an accused murderer as it does the homeless guy who stole Doritos from a CVS in Time Square. For people accused of crimes closer to the homeless guy who stole Doritos, you could keep them free and flush $300,000 in the toilet and it would be just as helpful for public safety as putting them in jail. The public does not get its monies worth on pre-trial jailing in terms of safety: the accused person returns to society almost always worse off than when they came in, making them more likely to recidivate. If you had a job and a home, those may be gone by the time you get out. If you were homeless and on a waitlist for housing, you may have lost your spot. If you were suffering from mental illness, your stay at Club Rikers certainly didn‚Äôt make you more sane and law abiding. Also, other jurisdictions like NJ and DC drastically changed their bail practices and saw no change in public safety- why not save the money or spend it on changing the root causes of crime?

**3. Prosecutors abused bail and helped create the current era of mass incarceration.**

The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail. Despite that, prosecutors regularly ask for bail amounts accused persons could never pay. The prosecutor‚Äôs incentive is the incarcerated accused will more likely take a plea deal and do it quicker- so that means they do less work and clear up their caseload while getting those ‚Äúwins‚Äù they need to go up the ladder. Judges never checked them because they want to resolve cases and clear up their calendars- they also didn‚Äôt want to end up on the cover of the NY Post for letting the wrong guy go, so they‚Äôd rather be overly cautious and lock up more people for their own job security.

**4. Legislatures listen to national bail bond companies and judges consider them in their bail determinations.**

If you can‚Äôt make bail, you go to a bail bondsmen. Typically you pay 10% of the bail set by the judge to the bail bondsmen, and they pay the whole thing. However, they get to keep your 10%, that is how they make money. Judges consider bail bondsmen when they determine how much bail will be set, and rather than making it affordable for the accused outright, they make it so if they could make it, they‚Äôd have to give money to a bail bondsmen. These companies are making money off the most vulnerable people and their families.

So that is some of the reasons why the new bail law happened. You could understand why some conservative prosecutors, judges, legislators, and bail bond company lobbyist paying those legislators could be upset. And why they could be describing the bail law in apocalyptic terms.

Lastly, I‚Äôd like to talk about the new law itself. Rather than have interested parties paraphrase it for you, you can read it for yourself here. [https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/CPL/510.10](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/CPL/510.10). Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt find anything about Met‚Äôs tickets in there.

The law requires courts to do an analysis. First they must presume that the accused should be released while their criminal case is pending. However the judge may impose conditions like bail if the person has a history of ‚Äúflight to avoid prosecution‚Äù and if the person is accused of a ‚Äúqualified offense.‚Äù This is short hand, but serious felonies fall into ‚Äúqualified offenses.‚Äù Almost all misdemeanors and many non-violent felonies are not ‚Äúqualified offenses.‚Äù Now this is a serious policy question that reasonable minds can differ on: do we want to spend a lot of money jailing a guy accused of a misdemeanors? Misdemeanors can include the Dorito theft from CVS as well as an assault that did not cause an injury. The legislature made a decision that it was not. Other jurisdictions like NJ and DC made the same decision and it has been working out for them.

Now you may be wondering, why did I write all this? Because until someone fixes the MTA, bail reform is the best thing the NYS government did in a while.",nyc,Lets talk about Bail Reform

Where: Around the Fulton and Franklin C and Shuttle stop


My account: 

I left Doris (a bar), only to step out to heavy rain. I'm wearing flyknit Nike shoes (I wear for work). Thinking I left just in time to catch the shuttle, I hurry to the Franklin ave stop. Totally missed it. Fuck it. I'll get a Lyft. Only over 4 bucks. While I wait, I stand just outside the station entrance doors. To the right of me, there's this Mac Miller looking type, wearing black sweatpants, a grey hoodie, and red hat. I immediately got bad vibes. He just stood there with no purpose. He kept pacing, he paced up to me, saw that I saw him looking at me. I instinctively knew to step back into the subway entrance. My lyft is two minutes away. I decide to stand on the entrance FURTHER away from him. Well, he paces again towards me. This time with his hand in his hoodie. I noped and decided to wait next to the turnstiles, in eyesight from the booth, where the MTA worker can undoubtedly see me. For one moment, I thought ""maybe he's also waiting to be picked up"" and suddenly, I could feel and hear, from underneath me, the train arrive at the stop. I'm stayed out at the turnstiles. One minute till my Lyft arrives. Few people come out, and one stood out. This thin woman. I only see the back of her. From her hands, possibly white. She was wearing blue jeans, black suede looking high heels, and a football or basketball puffy jacket that had blue and red colors. My lyft arrives, I stay on alert for this guy and ultimately, I get into my car safely. We turn the corner on Franklin Ave, going south, where between Fulton and Atlantic, there are about THREE TO FOUR lights that have not worked forever. Making that stretch completely dark. Well,  guess who also LEFT the subway entrance and is now 4 feet away from that woman? As we pass him, we make eye contact. It felt like slow motion, almost cinematically cliche in how slow it felt. I instantly felt a gut churning feeling come over me and decide to call the police immediately. I hope she got home safely.",nyc,Possibly saw a woman get followed

996,Forking_Shirtballs,1578894543,eo009d,Nan,"Moved to the UWS and have tried Zabar's a few times. The last time we got a cinnamon babka I decided I was done with it -- too dry, some odd bitter notes; looks much better than it tastes, ultimately a disappointment.

In the nice weather today, we decided to meander and found ourselves at Zabar's. Mrs Shirtballs decided we were getting a babka despite my protest. I decided to make a last ditch effort to enjoy it, and heated my slice in the toaster oven until it was sizzling, then hit it with a few pats of kerrygold salted butter.

It was a fucking revelation. So much ooey gooey cinnamon goodness, luscious from the better, and the salt from the butter turning off the bitter. I'm still thinking about it 12 hours later.

So how do people in the know eat their babka? 

I gotta think that hot is the way to go, and that room temp was my biggest problem previously. And the butter was so so good, but on the other hand kerrygold (salted, has to be salted) is so good it would elevate a piece of wonderbread to scrumptious -- so it feels a bit like gilding the lily.",nyc,How to eat babka?

Good afternoon everyone,

I posted here a few months back to offer the same service and I had met the most interesting and wonderful patients. Thank you all who trusted me and it is with your help, that I am now in my final semester of the dental hygiene program at City Tech. I'm now looking for patients again who may be interested in a deep cleaning. My clinic is located in downtown Brooklyn. The cost of the cleaning is $20 (Cash only) and no insurance needed. For seniors, it's $10. Yes, we also do cleanings for kids, it's $10 but the legal guardian must be present during the appointment. Along with this fee, you'll receive a goodie bag filled with dental product samples (toothbrush/floss/mouthrinse, depending on availability). If you were seen before and would like to return for another cleaning, you are more than welcome to come again!

Every initial visit will involve medical and dental history and a thorough assessment. This will help determine whether the individual patient is suitable for treatment at our facility. Cases that are beyond our scope of treatment will be given a referral. Dental x-rays and/or Medical clearance from a physician may be required prior to dental hygiene treatment.

Dental hygiene appointments are approximately 3-3.5 hours in length and the number of appointments needed to complete dental hygiene care will be determined by the type of treatment the patient requires.If you haven‚Äôt gotten a dental cleaning done within the past year, chances are you may have to come for more than one session.

All treatment is provided by students and supervised by licensed dentists and registered dental hygienists.

Clarification: You do have to be there for 3 full hours. Few people messaged me thinking they can book an appointment between the hours I provided. One session = one appointment.

Clinic Schedule:MONDAY 8AM-12PM, MONDAY 1-5PM. THURSDAY 8AM-12PM

Appointments are available Starting February 2020 through May 2020. (I am graduating in May 2020)

Clinic address: New York City College of Technology - 285 Jay St (New Academic Building) 7th floor, Brooklyn NY 11201

Please email if you are interested in scheduling an appointment : [dentalcleaning2019@gmail.com](mailto:dentalcleaning2019@gmail.com)

So my apartment building is electrically heated, which means my power bill goes crazy in the winter. It's fine, it is what it is, plus my rent is like $300 below market rate the rest of the year, so I'm okay with it. This season, however, things have been *insane.* I'm talking like $500+ a month for power, where last year I paid no more than like $300. 

Naturally when I noticed this I was pretty mad. Con Edison is a monopoly, I thought, they must be doing something new and horrible just to screw me. The first thing I noticed was that this hike in prices coincided really well with the new smart meter they had just installed in my building. I figured this meter must be broken or somehow improperly configured, because there's no way I could actually be using this much power. I spent a few days getting mad and preparing for a showdown. 

However, what happened when I finally got on the phone surprised me. The customer service lady took a look at my account and said the readings are accurate and that the smart meter's output looks consistent with last year's readings. What she found, though, was that I was using an ESCO. 

**Dafuq is an ESCO?**

The electricity market is a complicated beast. In the 90s the NY electricity system was opened up to competition, meaning where people used to pay Con Edison, full stop, now they have the option to purchase electricity from third party companies, called ESCOs (Electricity Supply COmpanies). You'll always be paying Con Ed for *delivery*, since they own the power lines and transformers and whatnot that lie between you and the power plant. However, you won't necessarily be paying Con Ed for use of their power plants. If you want to use renewable energy, for instance, you can find an ESCO that generates its power from solar or wind and pay them instead. 

You don't need to use an ESCO. Con Edison can be your supplier, in which case they purchase electricity from the grid at the lowest available price and charge you what they paid. By law, they cannot turn a profit on supply, they have to charge you exactly what it cost them to buy the power. That price fluctuates, but since it's a market rate, it tends to be pretty low. ESCOs can help by offering price guarantees or additional services like maintenance, etc. 

Not all ESCOs are benign, though. Once they have you in a contract, they may have the right to raise their rates. As you probably know, electricity is sold by the kilowatt-hour, and ESCOs make their money by charging you some amount of money for every kilowatt-hour you use. Once you enter a contract with your ESCO, you're bound by those terms, including potentially exorbitant price hikes. 

This is how a lot of ESCOs make money. They pour tons of money into marketing, lure people in with promotional deals offering cheap power for six months, only to jack up the price at the end of the promotional period in the hopes people are too confused by their power bill to notice. All those annoying pamphlets you get in the mail offering you savings on your power bill? Those are ESCOs. Those weirdly chipper people on the sidewalk carrying clipboards who say something about clean power before you pass out of earshot? They're pushing ESCOs. Some are more legit than others, but brief promotional rates followed by price hikes are a tried and true technique for extracting money from people. 

**What should I do?**

This is what happened to me. When I was young(er) and (less) dumb, I had set up a new Con Ed account when I switched apartments. I immediately received a landslide of promotional crap, and in the process I inadvertently signed up with an ESCO that I won't name. To give you an idea of how bad a deal this has been for me, the going rate for electricity in my area is currently about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. My ESCO was charging me *nineteen*. I was overpaying for my electricity by *three times,* and all the while I had no idea. Over the four years since I had been suckered into signing up with them, I had overpaid by almost *four grand*. And since this was all within the terms of my contract, I will never see that money again. 

You can protect yourself. Look at your Con Ed bill, and on the page where it breaks down your charges, checkl if they say something like ""Your electricity is supplied by XYZ Corp."" If it does, beware, you might be getting ripped off. Call Con Ed and ask about ESCOs, and you're more than likely going to talk to an exasperated customer service rep who's seen this story play out a thousand times. Mine was very helpful: she told me about the current market rate, waited patiently for me to pick my jaw up off the floor, and removed me from my ESCO contract in about thirty seconds. I'm on track to save over $500 this winter alone. 

*tl;dr: For once someone other than Con Ed is screwing you. Electric Supply Companies (ESCOs) often trick people into signing up for seemingly cheap power, only to jack up their rates later. Most people are too ignorant about the system to realize, and so end up overpaying for power by crazy amounts. Check your bill to see if you're using an ESCO, and if you are call Con Ed to find out if you can save money by dumping them.*",nyc,I overpaid my Con Edison bill by more than $4000 over four years.

LOWER MANHATTAN (WABC) -- Police are hoping new video will help them find the masked attacker who threw a bicycle chain at an off-duty police officer at a Manhattan subway station.

The 37-year-old officer was taken to the hospital after suffering pain and bruising to her face and is now on medical leave.

The victim was aboard a northbound 2 train when it stopped at the Park Place station around 3 p.m. Tuesday. When the doors opened, authorities say the suspect threw a metal bike chain through the open car door and struck the officer in the face.

No words were exchanged, and the attack seemed to be random.

The man then got on the same train and rode one stop before exiting at Chambers Street and fleeing the scene.

Police say shortly after that incident, someone was robbed at the Chambers Street station by a man fitting the same description.

The suspect is described as being approximately 6-foot-2 and 200 pounds. He was last seen wearing a white mask, a green jacket and khaki pants.",nyc,Off duty officer attack on the subway

Neat article about how Minnesota is leading the way when it comes to community solar. They've installed nearly three times as much capacity as the second-best state, Massachusetts and about 8 times more than New York. It argues that Minnesota's program is much more successful than others because of one thing ‚Äì program design. The state places no caps on the development like many other states do. It‚Äôd be great if we did the same thing in New York and removed further restrictions for the program.

&amp;#x200B;

Some things that could help:

* Transmission build out
* Easier siting and permitting process
* Better community engagement to avoid non-starter policies like a moratorium

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a [community solar company](http://powermarket.io/) in New York City, so I'm obviously an advocate of it. Quick primer if this isn't too familiar. You sign up for a large farm in your utility and get a lower bill. People  don't install anything like if they were building a system themselves. And 99% of the time you're guaranteed to save money. Renters typically like it as do people who can't afford the steep cost of building their own system, or others who are unable to or choose not to build it on their own properties. The reason this program exists is because utilities often don‚Äôt like to build renewable energy themselves. However, because of policy, they have to take any electricity a solar farm generates and spread it out on the bills of whomever is signed up to it.",nyc,Minnesota has way more community solar than New York.

I have been researching a potential move to a major metropolitan area since the summer, but in the past few months, my research has shifted ever more specifically onto NYC. 

I am on Diggz and NYC apts, looking at apartments/rooms in my perspective price range (probably somewhere in the 700-950 range). I know a lot of these places probs won't be available come May, but I wanted an idea of what neighborhoods/types of arrangements were feasible for me. 

My sister (28F) and I are planning a weekend trip to NYC sometime in April to vet any potential places I might be interested in at that time. 

I do not have a specific job lined up, but I have been visiting career services at my university and talking to alumni, and they say I have a strong resume/Linkedin. I've just been waiting to apply in late Jan/early Feb. I'm looking to start a career in nonprofits (with the goal of either going back to grad school one day on an assistantship for poli sci or public admin, OR building up impressive enough work experience to apply directly into the sort of positions I'm interested in at an international level). The entry-level salary in the nonprofit sector is anywhere from 30k to 40k. I will be notifying prospective employers that I am committed to moving to NYC post-grad in my cover letters. 

I've been running hypothetical budgets based on salary info I found on Linkedin for various positions I could potentially apply for. I've been accounting for taxes with the SmartAsset income after-tax calculator (which will account for the zip code or city you enter). I took other estimates on how much things cost in NYC (food, transit, utilities, entertainment, etc) from this very forum, various articles online, and wherever else Google would lead me.

I've found, based on my lifestyle, I might not be completely screwed as long as I can find a job that pays around 32k a year, but I best aim for the 38k range (preferably with medical coverage) in order to do more than merely scrape by. 

Right now, I am saving up for moving expenses. I work as an RA and earn a bit more than 1k a month. I've put away 4.5k already and plan to have 7.5k saved up just for the move by May.  I know my expenses will include not only the cost of moving my belongings to NYC, but also furnishing a space (probs off Craigslist/Amazon), the deposit, first and last month's rent, and a possible broker fee. 

All that said, is there anything I'm missing? Something I haven't thought of? A major flaw in my thinking? 

Does 7.5k sound like enough to start a new life in NYC? Is there any general advice I could get about starting said new life? 

Any steps to be taken once I get to NYC (besides changing my address for various things, or getting a metrocard or that neat pass to get myself into museums for free for one year)?

When I heard she'll be doing announcements on the subway, I thought, well, that would be a nice change from the recorded voice and more so from the ad-hoc announcements that train operators make on barely-audible audio equipment in older-model train cars.

But the way the whole thing is playing out is making me a bit uncomfortable. First, there are jokes thrown in  like ""hold your breath because we are going underwater"". Those are pretty harmless, but for the fact that  announcements are supposed to convey important and serious information about the state of the system. If I expect something useful and hear a joke instead, I am more likely to tune out of the announcements the more jokes I hear.

Second, there are jokes about manspreading, whose naming (not the practice itself) is a bit of a contentious issue. MTA has several public information channels that discourage riders from taking more space than necessary, but they usually have gender-neutral graphics and language. 

Third, it is not like I can stop riding the subway if the announcements sound problematic to me. People are on their fucking commutes. They are not looking to be entertained at that time, and certainly not in a manner that makes it impossible for them to leave the area. It is the exact reason MTA allows performers at the platform but not in a moving train.

Finally, MTA is doing native advertising now? They had print ads already, but now they are putting ads within announcements? 

Am I reading too much into the situation here? Anyone else bothered by these announcements?",nyc,Anyone else see a problem with having comedy/promotions in the subway announcements?

1382,very_wherd,1579294388,eq6apz,Nan,"Hey r/nyc

I live out of state and recently got a BS ticket while working freelance in the city for a day (Manhattan). While making a right turn on a green light, I allegedly made a pedestrian pause in the crosswalk. I originally was going to try and fight the ticket, which would mean that I have to go to a court hearing back in the city. After doing some research and checking how likely it would be for me to win, I figure it is the lesser of two evils to just pay the dang thing and move on with my life so I don't go all the way into the city from Eastern CT just to lose and drive home. 

**HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEM BEGINS**

I have 15 days to pay or plead before my license gets suspended. It took them over a week to even enter the ticket into their system so there goes the first half. Before the ticket is entered, trying to enter your information on their site just kicks you back to the homepage without giving a reason or error - but that's just me airing my other frustrations with the system. Now, I can tell that it HAS been entered into the system, but they must have entered it in incorrectly because when I enter the info from my ticket as an out-of-state driver, I get an error message telling me my info doesn't match theirs. I have tried triple checking it and even testing any typo I can think of based on the handwriting on the officer - no luck. 

So then my option is to call the Traffic Bureau number - which I have called every day for several days, at different times, and it always gives me a message about high call traffic and then immediately hangs up on me. I am not convinced you can even get a real person. There is a live chat that is only open until 3pm, so I can't get to it because of work. I tried calling the police precinct number, but no matter which automated option I select, the transfer just goes to phone lines no one is attending. 

I am only left with the option of mailing it in with a check at this point, but it DOES NOT say on my ticket how much I owe or if my offense comes with any points on my license. I believe the violation says 403a. I have tried looking up the cost and points penalty with no luck. 

What can I even do at this point? I may have 1 hour of time to try the live chat on Monday before a job, but I have no faith it will work or that I'll even be able to connect to anyone. 

ADVICE?

For years I was too sad and too scared to do much of anything, especially visit new places. Throughout it all, he stuck by me and I want to celebrate that in a big way.

Main questions: 
‚Ä¢ What borough do we stay in to be close to stuff, not spend a fortune and also not get murdered? 
‚Ä¢ Are AirBnbs actually illegal? I have a ton saved, but am not convinced.

When I first arrived to New York I was living in Brooklyn and was invited to dinner in another part of Brooklyn that was inaccessible by subway. Looking at transit directions, the best option was to take two buses, so I did without second though - where I come from, people ride all sorts of transit modes as part of their daily life.

I embarked on the first bus ride. It took me through this neighborhood filled with men with large beards and hair ringlets wearing black trench coats and enormous circular fur hats in the middle of a sweltering summer day, followed by pale women wearing polyester wigs pushing strollers and trailed by 5 or more extra children. These were everywhere. What a fascinating sight.

I got off that bus and waited for the second one in some place I have no idea where, but it was like I had flown an international flight and landed in the Caribbean - everyone was of African descent in vibrant color and fashion, fun music could be heard coming from everywhere, and the smell of amazing cooking surrounded me. I couldn't believe where I was.

I finally get to my dinner, reeling from such a sensory experience of the diverse and colorful worlds I saw, and I excitedly explain the journey I just had to my white dinner companions. Looking down their noses at me, their first response was 'you took the bus?', and then they uncomfortably shifted in their seats as if I was a homeless beggar who just made eye contact with them.

What the f\*\*k?!

Since then I've come across an aversion to riding the bus by other white people in conversations I've had with them on this topic, without understanding a compelling reason why. Is it a racial/segregation thing that's lingered from your country's past? Has it formed a part of the DNA of small-town Becky from Ohio who came to New York to be Carrie from Sex and the City, and subconsciously carried across this racist attitude?

Today I live in Queens and it's the most interesting and diverse place I know. I take the bus regularly, love to look out the window and see the world in front of me, and enjoy seeing a mix of people and cultures, of all shapes, sizes and colors riding with me too. I take the subway every day too, and see this mix of people as well, but I also see those pretentious white people squeezed in there like rats underground and think 'if only you took the bus once'.",nyc,"Rant: why do white people in NYC have such a horrible attitude about riding the bus, particularly in the boroughs?"

They then proceed to tell me I can‚Äôt take up multiple seats that other passengers might want that they need to be on the floor. I take my bags off the seat and put them on the ground and he goes onto ask my name to run it... he has no fucking reason to stop me and run my name he‚Äôs hoping that it comes back dirty and he has a reason to arrest me. I‚Äôm now forced to give him my name, he runs it and it comes back clean, he then gives me a fucking ticket!!!!

Which was good, because then my 2 bags taking up ONE seat for the manpower it deserved with 5 cops surrounding me while one wrote a ticket. While I was in the station I saw 4 separate people shoot up, an obvious drug deal take place but no, nyc is safer by getting me ticketed for my bags.

A few years ago I took the S train between GC and Times Square that was fully wrapped to look like the Connors living room as a promotion for Roseanne's reboot. Now, I despise intrusive advertisements plastering our subways and found the Awkwafina advertisements to be somewhat dystopian but THIS. This was memorable, immersive, and frankly it was fun. 

If increasing advertising revenue is the goal, then the MTA should do it creatively and with the end-user in mind. Imagine walking into a subway car that looks like Mandalore or a Star Wars destroyer that's promoting Disney+, or maybe below you're underwater sitting on a coral reef referencing the new Planet Earth series. Local artists could even take a stab to promote exhibits and heck - the MTA could recreate the old tartan seats and vintage advertisements to promote the NY Transit museum (Quick shoutout to the NY Transit museum I'm a total train-head and did that last year on my birthday - solid post-brunch activity). 

Train travel is such a worthwhile endeavor for our city and for our environment.

They claim that with the code they give you that tickets are 50% off, essentially giving you buy ons get one free, buy Part 1 and see Part 2 for free etc.  Sounds great.  

It's not a discount code you use at the end of your purchase though.  It's a Ticketmaster code you enter while looking for tickets that unlocks specific seats that are otherwise unavailable without said code.  So not all tickets are discounted, only certain ones, AND those seats are ONLY available with the code.  Following so far?

Well I didnt really feel like the price of those now unlocked tickets was that good, considering I had looked for tickets before and am familiar with the price range.  So I decided to check ticket prices for shows at the end of February and in March, after Broadway Week promotion is over.  And guess what?  The tickets in the exact same seats that are only available through the Broadway Week code right now, are the same exact price after the promotion ends.  

Now maybe you say to yourself, well maybe they would've been discounted once he went to checkout.  Nope, not all.  Everything is exactly the same.  So I ask, is Broadway Week a scam?",nyc,Is Broadway Week a Scam?

### Our Fellow Americans: A Symposium on Public Conviction Registries, 1/25
Presented as part of Meet the Chicago 400: Lessons in the Carceral State the third Winter Term, which is an initiative that investigates drawing as a tool for addressing inequity and encouraging social change, this public symposium is organized in conjunction with the Chicago 400, a grassroots campaign of formerly incarcerated and convicted people experiencing homelessness in Chicago, and artist, policy advocate, and researcher Laurie Jo Reynolds.   Featuring a range of participants, the symposium builds upon the Chicago 400's ongoing advocacy work and explores the intersection of drawing and criminal justice reform, specifically as it relates to fear-based policies, the unintended consequences of public registration laws, and the expansion of the carceral state.   Symposium Schedule  12‚Äì1pm | We Carry the Laws Out: Opening Reception + Exhibition Walkthrough Join members of the Chicago 400 Art Committee for a walkthrough of the exhibition of drawings that diagram and depict how they follow the registry regime and housing and public space banishment laws.   1‚Äì1:45pm | Meet the Chicago 400: Lessons in the Carceral State Learn more about the Chicago 400‚Äôs unique arts and organizing campaign to reform registry and banishment laws. The conversation will describe the organizing strategy, how art is a transformative part of the work, and advocacy for policies that prevent victimization, support survivors, and hold people accountable for harm.  Participants include: Laurie Jo Reynolds, Coordinator, Chicago 400 Alliance; Members of the Chicago 400; Maya Szilak, Research and Policy Counsel, John Howard Association of Illinois   2:15pm‚Äì3:30pm | Let Us Try to Explain This: New Yorkers Are Detained in Locked Facilities Because They Can‚Äôt Find Housing That Doesn‚Äôt Exist Visitors to the exhibit may wonder if there is a similar problem in New York, or a campaign to address it. Indeed, New York also has policies with extreme unintended consequences. Learn about the people affected, the constitutionality of this arrangement, and strategies to address this crisis from legal experts, advocates, and people who have been through this experience.  Participants include: Pauline Syrnik, Fellow, Legal Aid Society, Criminal Appeals Bureau; Allison Frankel, Aryeh Neier Fellow, Human Rights Watch/ACLU; Charles King, Chief Executive Officer, Housing Works; Robert Newman, Legal Aid Society, Criminal Defense Practice, Special Litigation Unit; and counsel for Richard Alcantara in Alcantara v. Annucci   4pm‚Äì4:45pm | The Logic of the Punitive State Lester Packingham was convicted of a felony for saying ‚ÄúThank you Jesus‚Äù on a public Facebook post. He decided to challenge it, ultimately taking the case to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously that his First Amendment rights were violated. Using this rare victory as a point of departure, Goldberg will discuss strategies for addressing the expansive reach of the carceral state. Lancaster will historicize this discussion by exploring the complicated relationship between sexuality and punishment in our society, the modern suburban culture of fear, and the punitive logic that has put down deep roots in everyday American life.  Participants include: David T. Goldberg, constitutional and public law litigator in the U.S. Supreme Court and federal and state appellate courts, and counsel for Lester Packingham in Packingham v. North Carolina; and Roger Lancaster, Professor of Anthropology and Cultural Studies, George Mason University, and author of Sex Panic and the Punitive State   5‚Äì6pm | Closing Reception Join organizers, presenters, and other policy advocates for a closing reception of the show and the symposium.   6‚Äì8pm | Next Steps Mixer and Dinner (organized by the New York Action Alliance)   The New York Action Alliance and The Chicago 400 are co-hosting a ‚ÄúNext Steps‚Äù Mixer to bring together professionals, advocates, those directly impacted, and/or anyone else interested in helping New York and other states become leaders in transforming their public conviction registry laws.

Did you know that Brooklyn is one of the areas most undercounted by the U.S. Census? The census is a count of every person in the United States, and takes place every 10 years. The Census  determines  federal funding for education, healthcare, public housing and our parks, as well as our number of representatives in Congress. It‚Äôs  essential that every New Yorker is counted, and our voices are heard.

Why is the 2020 Census Critical for Brooklyn?

Every 10 years, every person living in the United States is counted to make sure we‚Äôre getting our fair share of federal funding for schools, roads, parks and other essential community resources.
The count of each New Yorker represents $3,000 in federal funding: $650 billion per year distributed among 200 vital programs. There is almost no issue or program that is unaffected by the Census count.
In the 2010 Census, Brooklyn was one of the most undercounted places in the entire United States.
If Brooklyn is undercounted again, we could lose up to two seats in Congress, which means less of our voice in Washington on decisions that affect the future of our community.
The 2020 Census is the first time you'll be able to respond online, in addition to phone and mail. The Census asks basic questions about your home in Brooklyn to make certain everyone is counted: a two-minute, 10 question survey. 
The Census will not ask for your personal information, such as your social security number, political beliefs or financial information. All information you share is kept confidential and protected by law. 

Let's make certain Brooklyn counts 100% in 2020‚ÄîRSVP today!
Presented by Prospect Park Alliance in partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau, NYC Census 2020, the Brooklyn Borough President, the Brooklyn Community Foundation and community partners, including the Brooklyn NAACP.

1591,throwaway_samaritan,1579558955,erksgt,Nan,"This a throwaway.  And I just wanted to vent because I am peeved with all parties.

I watched some theater and went to an all night diner in Andrew's Coffee Shop at 9 PM.  I was reading a book and was about to leave at 11 PM when I overheard 2 Spanish tourists get a message from a friend where it seemed she was being assaulted by other men - and she called for help, before the WhatsApp message got cut off.  I then saw these two women try to call the police, and due to their language (and unfamiliarity as tourists) they didn't know what to.  Along with trying to call this friend to make sure she was alright.

So as a good samaritan (I sighed), I went to table and asked if they needed help.  They said they were visiting and went to happy hour left a friend there at a nearby bar/club an hour ago.  They did call 911, so I also called 911 to report a possible assault and if they could send police to help.  Gave the address of Andrews Coffee Shop, the cross street 35th, and 7th Ave, and told the horrified women to wait until the police to show up.

And the police never did.  For several minutes.  I have the call logs.  I then asked them, where this place is, because they don't know where this friend was etc... So logically - I told them to go back to this place they came from to at least see what happened or where she could be.

Eventually went to this place ""Magic Hour Lounge"" at Moxy NYC Times Square, with one of the women because the other was waiting for police.  Apparently at the hotel reception, nobody wanted to help, but they seemed to recognize the name of this woman and said this story that she was really drunk, and they took her by EMS to some hospital somewhere, and to basically go away.

I asked them to call 911 and they refused, and even when I asked bystanders to ask and call to report a possible rape / assault, the entire front desk was belligerent and seemed they did not want to help these tourists with a friend who is in trouble and wanted them to leave and direct them away....

I called 911, and told police to come to this hotel so at least they can get this sorted.  Told them all the details and the address, and this was now at 11:56 PM now, (first called 911 at 11:15) alleged struggle / assault was 11 PM ish , and not one police car showed up.  The women were not buying the hotel people's excuse as he was randomly calling hospitals saying if they found this friend of theirs and it really seemed really fishy.  So I finally had to run in middle of street to flag down police cop car, take them to hotel, and then to these poor confused tourists trying to find friend who could possibly being raped.

They started playing the recorded message of struggles, and cop said they could handle it from here etc...

Anyway - I am angry at everyone

1) How the hell can you come from another country, and leave your random drunk friend in some shady club/bar alone so she could be possibly gang-raped by strangers?

2) This is blocks from Times Square - in middle of New York, and both the wait staff at Andrew's Coffee Shop refused to help (saying they did not want to get involved), random people I asked for help -&gt; only to call 911 they all refused.  Random NEW YORKERS ARE COMPLETE TRASH!!!  And the hotel staff at this Moxy Place / Magic Bar are completely trash as manager was saying "" this is not our problem, we don't want to get involved / we can't have you making accusations etc..."" rather than trying to figure out what is going on - actively trying to cover it up so they do not get fired.  People only care about money and their own ass rather than helping others.

3) 911 is useless.  I reported a possible rape/ assault in progress and for over an hour (I checked the call logs when I got home) - not one police showed up.  It was only because I flagged down cops that anything happened.

4) Hopefully it is some stupid drunk incident and as the hotel person says, she was drunk and kicked her out or whatever - though it seemed really bad what was happening from the message I heard -&gt; if this was a friend, a sister or daughter -&gt; as a good samaritan I thought at a minimum that just to be safe - someone should check to see if this person is fine.  If you heard someone you knew calling for help / fighting against others, and then not picking up afterwards, would you think I'm over-reacting to call 911???

Bottom line is:

1) do not trust New Yorkers to help - they are scum bag.

2) 911 is useless - do not rely on police coming if you are in danger.  Call them anyway, but rely only on yourself

3) Try to flag down a real cop if you need help.",nyc,Tried to report possible Rape/Assault in Midtown - Called 911 and police never came

The way you were keeping your eyes on me, whether I was in front of you or you were in front of me, and the way you followed me every time I crossed the street. Even when you stepped inside one of the restaurants until I passed you once again, only to step out afterwards and inched closer until I passed behind that white van, then vanished as you waited on the other side. Yeah, I figured you wanted to cause trouble, so I side-stepped and went the opposite way and went back up 6th avenue one block and went down 46th street. I felt kinda bad, so I went around the block back to 45th to see if you were there. Sure enough, you were gone. 

I work security detail, dude. I literally get paid to keep my eyes and ears open. Here'sa tip. If you're following someone, don't make it too obvious. Even a blind man could see how hard you were trying. I'm thinking you never did that sort of thing before. And don't go gung ho. You don't know what I was carrying. I could've been armed with O/C or a stun gun, or even a knife or a firearm (I wasn't armed with anything. Just proving a point.)

Here's an even better suggestion: If you really want to follow people around, go take some security classes. Get a criminal justice education and go find a job as a private investigator.

 Following the holiday rush, Broadway box office sales took a slight decline last week, dropping 28 percent to $31 million, [***Deadline***](https://deadline.com/2020/01/broadway-box-office-down-winter-david-byrne-west-side-story-1202829346/) reports.

Attendance reportedly dropped to 259,101, which fell 18 percent from the previous week, *Deadline* noted in a report from the trade group Broadway League. The show roster has decreased from 36 shows to 29 shows, which likely has to do with the decrease in sales. Additionally, ticket prices were generally lower than those during the holidays.

Nonetheless, some plays rose to the occasion and continued to be top-runners on the Great White Way, including David Byrne‚Äôs *Utopia*, which is set to close on February 16, pulling in $1.1 million. *Beetlejuice*, another show set to close this year, continues to remain[(read more...)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/01/box-office-sales-decrease-on-broadway/)",nyc,Box Office Sales Decrease On Broadway Following Holiday Rush

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non- invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires, two neuroimaging sessions, and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS.
Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

If you are interested, please contact Young at 646-774-7603, or at young.cho@nyspi.columbia.edu. More information is also available at https://tdcsresearch.wordpress.com/. It is better to reach out to us directly through these channels rather than sending me a message here.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

I believe I was under the impression (I assume as I don't blatantly break the law) that
-  the sign on the right with *Right turn only* was meant to specify the right lane is _right turn only _ as it appears to be right under the most right lane.
- the sign on the left was indicating trucks and busses are only allowed to go straight, hence *Trucks and busses*.

I witnessed a large truck back into a sedan while at a full stop before driving away. I was rushing to take care of my own personal emergency, buy managed to snap [a few pictures](https://imgur.com/a/beHzJRv). I feel terrible for not being able to help more and am hoping you can assist. Details below:

* Location: West Houston Street btwn 6th and Varick (Approx. 228 West Houston Street, New York, NY 10014)
* Date: Today, Wednesday, January 22nd
* Time: Approximately 12:00pm ET

The white truck was sitting at a full stop at a red light. It was, originally, approximately 8-10 feet farther in front of the black car than in the image depicted. It began backing up (with no backup beeping indicator), a few people started yelling, and then a giant crunch was heard, at which point I took the first image. The truck was planning on making a left (going south on Varick Street). It is very cold in NYC today and it seemed like the driver of the sedan assumed the driver was just taking a little while to get his papers together or something. After about 15-20 seconds, with the light still red, the driver of the car had not gotten out. At this point, a bystander started running up to the sedan, yelling to the driver that the truck was about to drive away and the driver better get his info ASAP.

The driver of the sedan appeared to be a middle-aged Asian man, approximately 6 feet tall, who was a bit confused and/or overwhelmed. A bit of a crowd had grown at this point and the light turned green. The truck indeed made a left onto Varick Street as the driver of the sedan tried to take pictures. Unfortunately, there didn't appear to be any rear plates.

I'm a Prime member, and the filters ""Get it by tomorrow"" and ""Same Day"" completely disappeared from the left hand side of my search. But NYC zip codes come up as eligible when you search for them on the Same-Day shipping info page. 

I chatted with customer service asking if it still existed, and they said yes but that they can't filter for it. I then asked for ONE example of an item eligible for same-day. 

After a ton of back and forth, it basically boiled down to: customer service has no way to search for Same-Day eligible items, you can to go to items one-by-one and search to see if they have that as an option. Customer service could not give me even ONE example of a same-day item. 

They told me to go to this page: [https://www.amazon.com/b?node=8729023011](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=8729023011). I told them hey, look at all of the categories on the bottom of that page...""electronics"", ""home &amp; kitchen"", ""health and personal care"", etc. Each of those links is dead, with zero items listed. Amazon rep was unable to prove same-day delivery still existed, and now I'm honestly fucking mad that Amazon is charging money and advertising for these delivery options that don't actually exist.

I am in my final year of medical school in New York and have lived in the Midwest up until med school.

I have not really considered myself a NY State resident until now since I am only here for school and don't know where I will be in 6 months when I graduate (and I will cancel my medicaid then, since my medical residency program will provide health insurance).

However, my home state denied me for medicaid, saying that I have been in NY for several years. So I applied for NY medicaid and was accepted without any real proof of being a resident except giving my apartment address.

My drivers license is still from the midwest. I guess I need to switch this over to NY now? And I will file NY taxes for the past year? (have not filed in med school since I have had no income). Is there anything else I need to do to be a ""NY resident""?

The Saudi Connection: Inside the 9/11 Case that Divided the FBI


Yesterday the New York Times Magazine, in conjunction with Pro Publica, published an article called ‚ÄúThe Saudi Connection: Inside the 9/11 Case that Divided the FBI‚Äù, by Tim Golden and Sebastian Rotella. The article is about the decade long investigation conducted by the FBI about the role of Saudi government officials who supported the 9/11 hijackers in California. The article reveals for the first time the classified name of that investigation ‚Äï ‚ÄúOperation Encore‚Äù ‚Äï and showcases the efforts of a former San Diego FBI Special Agent, Danny Gonzalez, to get to the truth.  

For the past two years, Danny and another former law-enforcement official mentioned in the article, Efrain Vasquez, have been consultants to Kreindler &amp; Kreindler in support of your lawsuit against Saudi Arabia. Two other agents quoted in the article, Ken Williams and Steve Moore, have also provided help to our efforts.

Some of the highlights of the article that are new to the public include:

The full story of the FBI‚Äôs investigation into Saudi Arabia‚Äôs ties to the 9/11 Attacks has remained largely untold, and many former and current FBI agents and others involved in the investigation firmly believe that Saudi government officials provided a support network for the hijackers, and that the information held by the FBI must be made public.

The hijackers had numerous in-person contacts not only with Saudi government agent Omar al-Bayoumi, but also with Saudi diplomat and Imam Fahad al-Thumairy, who worked for the Kingdom at the King Fahad Mosque in Los Angeles

A third Saudi government official ‚Äï a ‚ÄúSaudi religious official with diplomatic status who served in the United States‚Äù ‚Äï is the person who ordered Bayoumi and Thumairy to assist the hijackers.

The Saudi government officials instructed several young men in Los Angeles and San Diego to help the hijackers with such things as translation, obtaining driver‚Äôs licenses and flight lessons and how to function seamlessly in the U.S.

The FBI found evidence that when the hijackers first arrived (they couldn‚Äôt speak English and had never been to the U.S.), Saudi diplomat Thumairy made the arrangements for them to stay for several weeks in the Los Angeles apartment of an Eritrean man. 

Within weeks of the 9/11 Attacks, the UK‚Äôs Scotland Yard seized a document from Saudi agent Bayoumi‚Äôs papers which was an ‚Äúaviation diagram of a plane descending to strike a spot on the ground.‚Äù The FBI analysis of the diagram concluded that it contained a formula for ‚Äúan aerial descent like the one performed by Flight 77, the jet that Hazmi and Mihdhar hijacked, before it struck the Pentagon.‚Äù

Two other Saudi officials, Adel al Sadhan and Mutaeb al Sudairy stayed in the same small rooming house as the hijackers and their travel paths suspiciously intersected with the hijackers. The FBI‚Äôs surveillance operation of Sadhan and Sudairy was thwarted by a likely tip-off to Saudi Arabia by the CIA. 

The FBI Operation Encore team sought to question several key witnesses and obtained Grand Jury subpoenas in 2015 to get them to talk but in February 2016, those subpoenas were withdrawn by a federal prosecutor from the Southern District of New York.

After pressing to move the case forward, the Operation Encore team was closed down by senior FBI officials in 2016. A respected member of the team filed a final 16 page summary which contained everything the team discovered about Saudi Arabia‚Äôs involvement. The FBI is withholding that document. We currently have a motion pending to obtain release of that document, but expect that the FBI will claim that it is a ‚Äústate secret‚Äù.  

We owe a debt of gratitude to Danny Gonzalez, who showed tremendous courage to come forward, along with the other Operation Encore team members, and appreciate the ProPublica reporters who helped unearth the facts behind our government‚Äôs refusal to provide information to the 9/11 Families about Saudi Arabia‚Äôs involvement. 

This article shows that the FBI is holding back key evidence that supports our case. For whatever reason, they are fighting our efforts to obtain that evidence and helping Saudi Arabia. We have much work ahead to force our government to reveal the truth about the Saudi government officials who helped the hijackers carry out the worst attack on our Nation in its history.  

We are incensed that our government would label this information as a ‚Äústate secret‚Äù to keep it kept hidden from the 9/11 Families and the American people. That goes against all of the principles of freedom and justice for which our country stands. We must find out the complete truth now.

The forces working against us are very powerful, but we have a strong voice that will be heard.  We will continue to need your help to keep the pressure on the White House and the Congress, and appreciate your support and efforts.

1926,Rosalind_,1579885949,etdai0,Nan,"I've been hearing a lot of coughing and sneezing on the buses and trains this week so I figured I'd remind people that NYC has a law guaranteeing sick leave for most people working in NYC.

**Who does the law cover?**

If your employer (for-profit or non-profit doesn't matter) has 5 or more employees, you get paid sick leave. If your employer has 4 or fewer, you get sick leave but it doesn't have to be paid. These employees do not need to be in NYC.

You are eligible for sick leave as long as you work more than 80 hours per calendar year in NYC. Yes that means even if your employer is based outside of NYC and even if they don't have an office in NYC, if you are working at least 80 hours in NYC, you are guaranteed sick leave. This means if you work from home or make deliveries in NYC for at least 80 hours a year, you're covered.

There are a few exceptions such as government employees, people under certain collective bargaining agreements, etc. In most cases, these people should already have sick leave as part of their employment.

**But I only work part-time. Am I covered?**

Yes as long as you work at least 80 hours in NYC per calendar year.

**How much paid sick leave do I get?**

At least 40 hours per year but your employer can choose how you accrue those hours as long as you accrue 1 hour per 30 hours worked. Your employer is also required to allow you to rollover up to 40 hours of unused sick leave from the previous year.

**My employer wants a doctor's note every time I call out sick.**

Legally they can't do that unless you are out for more than 3 consecutive days. If you are out for more than 3 days, your employer must give you at least 7 days to provide a doctor's note. They also cannot force you (or your doctor) to specify the reason for taking sick leave.

**My employer says I have to give them a minimum amount of notice when I call out sick.**

Your employer can only do this when you have advanced notice that you're going to be using sick leave (e.g. for a doctor's appointment or surgery). They cannot require this otherwise.

**Can I use sick leave for a checkup or other preventative medical appointment even though I'm not currently sick?**

Yes. Your employer can ask for advanced notice of up to 7 days in these situations.

**Can I use my sick leave for mental health care?**

Yes.

**Can I use my sick leave to care for others such as a sick child or grandparent?**

As long as they are a family member. The law is a bit vague on what constitutes a family member but it can include unmarried couples who have been in a long term commited relationship, for instance.

**Can my employer write me up, punish, or retaliate against me for using sick leave appropriately?**

No and you can report an employer who does such here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/workers/workersrights/file-workplace-complaint.page

**I have questions not answered here.**

nyc.gov/PaidSickLeave is where I got all the information for this FAQ. I'm also happy to try to answer any questions you have.",nyc,"PSA: If you work in NYC, you almost certainly have paid sick leave by law"

I found flights that work somewhat well for me - I'm to be landing in NYC at 4:30pm, and flying out at 6:45pm. The problem is that I arrive at JFK and fly out from LGA. 

I have no checked suitcases (just a small carry-on) so I won't need to waste time claiming baggage. I also won't need to go through customs since I'm flying from LA to NYC (since I can't fly direct to NYC from Sydney).

Would I have enough time to get between airports (two domestic flights with no checked baggage) and get off/on flights in 2hr 15min?  
The distance between airports is about a 12-14min drive according to Google Maps but I'm not sure what the best way to get between JFK and LGA is - I'm on a relatively tight budget, so preferably I'd go for the cheapest option, but I'll Uber/Lyft if need be.

Last Monday I got an email from my property management company to give them a call. I thought it would be about an issue with my sink. Instead it was a guy (M) telling me they were ‚Äútaking a more active role in the building‚Äù and that my neighbor‚Äôs unit was recently vacated and they were wondering if they could cut me a check to ‚Äúcover my moving costs‚Äù wink wink and move me to another rent stabilized unit in a building down the road. 

I was super burnt out last week, so I agreed to at least look at the other unit but never did because I didn‚Äôt have the time or energy after work. I also began frantically researching wtf was going on, found a lot of information about buyouts, and wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of this not-buyout buyout. 

M emailed me and called me on Monday, which I ignored because 1) busy 2) not my emergency 3) I had no idea what I wanted to do by that point. Yesterday he was in the building and stopped by with the super to offer me a smaller, cheaper unit on another floor if I wanted to stay in the building. He also pushed back when I used the word ‚Äúbuyout‚Äù, but literally said ‚Äúname your price‚Äù. I agreed to look at the other unit today. 

At this point I have a decent sense of what my ‚Äúprice‚Äù would be, but I have no idea how unusual this whole thing is and what impact the shady/informal aspect of it would affect what I could get, taxes, etc. 

I should probably hire an attorney except I don‚Äôt want to sink that cost if I don‚Äôt end up moving / getting money. I at least know I‚Äôd be protected by the new harassment laws if I end up not going through with it. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Have any resources or advice? I think I‚Äôve reached the limits of what I can google here.",nyc,Off the books buyout?

### Queer Archives: Between the Individual and the Institutional, 1/27
The Magnus Hirschfeld Institute for Sexual Science (ISS) was founded in 1919 in Berlin as a communal, sexual, political, and emotional space for people of different genders and orientations. In 1933, the ISS was the target of an early Nazi raid, and the spectacular bonfire of its books and holdings began the horrific destruction of its idealist commitment to queer ways of being. In the wake of this violent destruction, the Magnus Hirschfeld Society now pursues the seemingly impossible task of recuperating the Institute, its history, its memory, its research, and its books. Utopian in vision, in their thirty years, the Society, a group of gay men and archivists, has met with limited but significant success in their ‚ÄúArchiv der Erinnerungen‚Äù (archive of remembrance) project.
 
The Vera List Center for Art and Politics hosts a conversation about archives in general and queer approaches to archives in particular with artists Dean Erdmann, Tiona Nekkia McClodden, Carlos Motta, and scholar Shannon Mattern.
 
This conversation takes Erdmann‚Äôs work with archives, both their own family‚Äôs archive and that of the Magnus Hirschfeld Society‚Äôs, as a starting point for discussing artistic and queer approaches to individual and institutional archives or their absence. After an introduction to some key considerations on archives by New School professor Shannon Mattern, each artist presents their approaches to working with archives and queer reparative strategies.

### Precarious Labor: Freelancers, Community Art Practice and Museums, 2/1
Join us for a roundtable conversation prompted by artist and educator Kerry Downey on the practice and implications of using freelance and precarious workers to execute community-based arts programs. The conversation will cover a range of topics that illuminate how and why art museums and nonprofits employ freelancers, short-term, and contingent arts workers to design and lead public programs and, in particular, programs for communities of people that institutions may label as ‚Äúunderserved‚Äù. Case studies will be shared and the discussion will cover areas that will support Downey in their research and upcoming essay on queering museums while exploring strategies to address the valuation of cultural work and institutional investment in the public. This program is free and open to the public with RSVP.

### Good Morning India: Media Making Workshop, 2/1
The spirit of resistance is alive in India. The forces of facism are met with the love, care, humor, and strength of a newly forming people‚Äôs movement. For a month the whole nation has been in protest against Hindu supremacist laws that suppress the basic rights of several minority groups, particularly Muslims. Sounds and images have been a vital part of this resistance. WhatsApp memes, songs, music videos, kolams, and a range of posters have flooded our imagination, describing the nation that we want to live in.
 
Join us for a workshop and talk with Flux resident Sindhu Thirumalaisamy where we will listen, view, read, and contribute to the resistance with sounds and images.  Prior to the talk, the Flux Factory gallery will turn into a workshop for media making. Do you want to make a poster? A meme? Want to record a video? A song? Want to learn how to draw a kolam? Want to chat with about what is happening in India and beyond? We will gather materials, equipment, and people to help make all of this happen.
 
Sindhu Thirumalaisamy is an artist working across sound, video, text, and installation. She is a participant of the Whitney Independent Study program in 2019-20. Sindhu holds an MFA in visual art from the University of California, San Diego, is an alumnus of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, and a fellow of the Robert Flaherty Film Seminar.
 
This workshop is open to people of all ages and backgrounds but an RSVP is required. Refreshments will be provided. Please RSVP to maya]at]fluxfactory.org

TLDR: Is there anything I can put in the window to keep my cat from falling out?  


[https://imgur.com/a/MSJw4OG](https://imgur.com/a/MSJw4OG)

I moved back to the city about a year ago, after a breakup, the ex took the cats. When she and I lived in Brooklyn, there was always a fire escape on the window and we were on a 2nd-floor rear-facing side. So I wasn't afraid of the cat's going out.  


I didn't expect to get a cat, but I thought I might want one in the future. So I met Ghost. He was abandoned when his owner died. The people who came for the old owner's stuff threw him out with the rest of the garbage. I was with a friend and she told me his story. She thought he was adopted, but he showed up 6 months later. I got really upset seeing him living on a pile of trash so I took him home.  


Now I keep my windows wide open with a screen. I'm on a 5th fl walkup. When he first came home with me he was very docile. It was the end of fall so the windows were open a bit, but he hadn't come out his shell. In the last 5 months, he's become very active and will charge at pigeons, sometimes butting up against the glass. He's a young cat, maybe 1.5 years according to the vet. Male. He's been fixed and I play with him as much as I can. I'm just afraid as summer comes he's going to get too excited with the pigeons and charge at one right out a window. When we're playing sometimes he'll dive at the toy headfirst into a wall r fridge. He's fearless.  


Is there anything I can put on the windows to keep him from going through one? The only thing I can think of is a child window guard, but my landlord knows I don't have kids so I'm guessing they won't put them up for free.",nyc,Cat people; Do you worry about your cat going out the window?

I moved into an incredible apartment in Brooklyn last year with two roommates that already lived there. One of them left shortly after I did, so the remaining roommate found E to replace him. Soon after E moved in, the remaining roommate also left so E and I had to find a third person very shortly after both of us moved in. 

E has never liked me. We had a discussion on politics early on that went sour (stupid of me to engage, I know) and shes held a grudge against me ever since. I dont like her either, and for a while we got by just ignoring each other. 

Since that first argument, shes repeatedly told me she wants me out of the apartment, directly saying things like ‚Äòi want to kick you out‚Äô. I have tons of texts from her bugging out and saying legit crazy histrionic things to me, calling me names and being rude. 

She is a neurotic cleaner and has always accused me of not cleaning enough. I said fair, okay, and have tried to step it up but its still not enough for her, not to mention she doesnt note when I do clean. All this came to a head this weekend when she went off about me leaving some dishes in the sink overnight and some coffee grounds on the counter. Then, when I wasnt home, she decided to ‚Äòreclaim‚Äô a public closet space (with mine and the other roommates clothes, with enough space for E‚Äôs clothes too), and took all my clothes out, tossing them nearby. She even admitted to doing this out of spite, because she ‚Äòdoesnt like me‚Äô. 

When I sent pictures to the group chat and said we need to not touch each others things and be disrespectful, the conversation escalated back to her saying she wants me out and now shes called the landlord to come over tomorrow and talk about it. 

I know I havent done anything wrong, but I have no money and no recourse.. I‚Äôm a little scared I might lose my apartment. Any advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated, thank you.",nyc,Roommate trying to kick me out

I have two MacBooks and they both fail identically. On both, Brave starts to open and then crashes just as it is about to open the home screen. Because I cannot get Brave to open, I am unable to play with the settings or turn off or remove the extensions from within Brave proper.

I have tried deleting and then reinstalling a freshly downloaded copy of Brave but it made no difference. The settings and extensions on the MacBooks are identical to those on the MacBook Pros but obviously, something is different on the MacBooks from the Pros.

So I would like to completely remove Brave including all my settings and extensions and then download and install a completely vanilla new copy of Brave with default settings and no extensions.¬†

I am a Long Island AP Research student conducting research on the people who currently reside in New York about their opinions on vaccinations. This information will be used for research purposes only, and any answers given are confidential and anonymous. If you would not mind taking a few minutes to help my research, any participation is welcomed. There is no identification information needed, so all of your answers are protected. 

My research is about how the generation of a person and/or how their immigration experiences may influence vaccination decision. I am conducting this survey to find if these factors may have a correlation with each other.

Participation time depending on the extent of answers may be between 5 to 15 minutes. Your participation in this survey is highly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

If you wish to participate, please be born between the years 1946-1996. 

Any spread of this survey to others living in New York is also highly appreciated. The more data collected, the better the outcome. Honesty is much appreciated.

Thank you once more for your aid in this research. Please follow the link attached.

I'm in a fairly well kept apartment building. In November, my neighbour passed away. I only know this because the smell was unbearable and it's not the first time I've smelled a deceased person. He lived alone, and was a hoarder. There would have been a lot of stuff in his apartment that needed to be dealt with.

The NYPD placed a green DOA sign on the door, sealing it for about a month and a half. I'm sure they removed the body before this. In the past month they've been clearing out the apartment. 

We share a wall with him. The smell is incredibly bad and just keeps getting worse, to the point where my apartment is smelling. My landlord won't acknowledge that he has passed for privacy reasons, which I understand, but because of this she wont give us any information or timeline for when everything will be removed from the apartment.

What are my rights? What do I do next?",nyc,Rental Advice Horrible Smell as a result of Neighbour Death.

When the bill  came, we noticed a 18% ""suggested tip"" added to the bill. But they also  had to nerve at the bottom to add a blank \_\_\_\_\_\_ for you to add a ""tip""  that you also wanted to give. The people at the other table next to us  noticed the same thing and they didn't like it either.

The bottom had four options with percentage amounts and the dollar value for you to choose one to give.

The  funny thing is that the ""suggested tip"" which was already added on top,  ended up being cheaper than the ""tip"" amounts they wanted you to circle  at the bottom.

Many people do not read their bills, and end up paying more.

For instance, my tenant has a girlfriend who stays overnight very often.  Or offers a friend to house-sit while away on vacation.

According to this: [https://www.landlordology.com/guest-become-tenant/](https://www.landlordology.com/guest-become-tenant/)   

**‚Äú*****Depending on the individual state laws with respect to the issue, once someone has started receiving mail at an address they have established residency. That can be done without someone actually occupying a property. If the guest spends more than half a month at a place they could also be considered a tenant at that point as well. Our lease forbids more than 14 nights in a month for anyone not named on the lease for this reason.*****‚Äù**

What this means is that once the girlfriend has stayed over 14 nights, then she has tenant rights?  What happens if an apartment is rented for Airbnb for 2 weeks?  Does then the Airbnb guest have the rights of a tenant...and would I have to go though an eviction process to get them out?

Anyone out there with direct experience/knowledge?

### What's Your Pronoun? Dennis Baron With Diana Tourj√©e, 2/4

How did we get from he and she to zie and hir -- and singular they? While it may seem like adding preferred pronouns to email signatures and nametags at conferences is part of the zeitgeist, pioneering linguist Dennis Baron provides historical points of reference that shed light on a long tradition of coining gender pronouns. Shakespeare invoked the use of singular they and women adopted the generic use of he to assert their right to vote. What‚Äôs Your Pronoun? examines the role pronouns have historically played in determining our rights and identities. From legislation to literature to the press, Baron shows the many areas of life where pronoun-expression matters and affects the way we treat different groups. Baron is joined by award-winning journalist for Vice, Diana Tourj√©e.

### This, That, and the Third, 2/6

The exhibit features five hand-sewn, embellished masks, six self-portraits, and 50 accompanying quick response (QR) codes that feature public performances, written text, and supplemental imagery. When viewed in tandem, they create fractured narratives making reference to historically stereotypical representations of black women in media and film, dominance politics, and the sociopolitical consequences of existing as a marginalized individual in public space. Also at the reception: John Mejia's The Puerto Rican War tells the story of Puerto Rican revolutionaries in 1950 with costumes, puppets and marionettes.

### Home/Land Opening Reception, 2/2

Curated by Katie Fuller, Home/Land looks at the influence of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 on Lewis Latimer‚Äôs family, focusing on the tactics used to detain, deport, and re-enslave ‚Äúrunaways‚Äù with current practices used by Immigration Customs Enforcement to control the influx of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.

The exhibition pairs true stories of those who escaped or attempted to escape slavery in the years surrounding the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 with current experiences of families attempting to migrate to the United States with the hope of finding a home in the land of the free.

Participating artists were given access to primary source documents from the past to create works that show a connection between then and now. Basing their art pieces on families‚Äô migration journeys and their encounters with ICE brings the pain of the past into the present. Excerpts from historical documents: runaway slave ads, letters, journal entries, will be posted on the wall next to the art piece. Displayed together, the documents and the artworks will ask viewers what, if anything, has changed regarding how this country treats humans labeled as ‚Äúillegal‚Äù.

Selected artists to be announced soon.

The exhibition will be on view through Sunday, June 14, 2020.

We talk about a wide variety of concerts in venues throughout New York City, in the hopes of getting more people out to them to support artists and share in the live music experience with others.

This week's episode we recap Tredici Bacci's show at Mercury Lounge on January 26th. This included performances from Mr. Transylvania, Starla Online, Eyes of Love, and Godcaster. These acts ran the gamut from bizzare art performance, to sleepy bedroom pop, to wild mixes of punk rock, baroque classical music, and soundtracks from '60s Italian movies. Just give it a listen, I'd have to put in a tl;dr here to describe these acts.

We spend some time talking about a bit of the history of Mercury Lounge. Some really legendary acts got their start there (ever hear of this cool band called The Strokes?), and even though it doesn't necessarily have that same mystique to it, the venue still delivers. We personally like that the acts have to walk through the crowd to get to the stage at Mercury Lounge. What's a venue quirk that you personally like the most?

[Here's the link to the episode on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/33NYdLE4ilpmEZ72Jy3xsv?si=9VeASZnZTRyzdTxfhCXbRA) , and you can also find us on Apple Podcasts and SoundCloud as well. If you like this one, be sure to check out our earlier episodes as well, we cover all kinds of music from rock and indie, to EDM, to underground local acts that need some love.

There are flea market style places to buy things, cheap and good quality. It really feels bustling. So many open air markets, food stalls, it's amazing. However, I'm worried. LIC is new with residential buildings, and commercial tenants will presumably start to string up. However, all I'm seeing under construction is gourmet markets, and upscale restaurants. Why does gentrification do this? I'm white, I make a gentrification-level salary. But, I obviously prefer paying less for much better service than what gentrification gives you. Like why are all the vegetables so expensive here. It's the same f\*cking thing. The restaurants want to charge me $17 for PASTA. It probably costs them less than a quarter to make it - isn't capitalism supposed to guarantee me low margins? And it takes an entire hour to get through these restaurants, instead of the 40 seconds it takes to get food in deeper Queens. Why is this the standard here? And yeah, I'm totally fine with it, if it was 20% of the restaurants for this experience and the other 80% were what deeper Queens has to offer. But it's not, it's 100% expensive shopping, expensive restaurants, expensive groceries, but at no perceivable increase in quality, and tbh the food is just mostly bland in these expensive restaurants, no matter how much money I throw at it. Like I understand that me, as a gentrifying force, bring absolutely no culture to the table. If I had to open a restaurant, yes I would either sell pasta pizza or like a sandwich, even though the food is mediocre. I have no idea how to make Peking Duck. But shouldn't free market forces dictate that some business man can pull this off? It's clearly better? Free market should mean low prices?

Background on me before anyone says ‚Äúit‚Äôs New York, if you don‚Äôt like it, get out‚Äù... I grew up in Manhattan part time and part time in the Midwest in the 90s-early 2000s due to some custody agreements with my parents, so I‚Äôm not ‚Äúnew‚Äù to the city in any way. I lived over in Queens from 2011 to 2017 and since 2017 I have been living in the Columbus Circle/CPS area. Prior USMC, so I also have pretty thick skin. 

This past month, three separate incidents have occurred in which three different individuals verbally assaulted me out of nowhere and for no reason at all. 

- Today, I was walking out of the door from Nordstrom by Columbus Circle, not distracted or anything, and a guy who was walking by just started to shout at me, calling me a ‚Äúgay ass, f***** ass, b****, who should get their f***** ass beaten.‚Äù I just walked away and he was still shouting at me. 

- At a local newsstand near where I live at Columbus Circle a week or so ago, the guy who runs it looked at my ID and started making comments about how I should grow my hair out to attract a man and ‚Äúthe nonsense‚Äú I dress in is offensive. 

- And then right after New Years on the Q train, some guy started shouting at me called me every curse word in the book as I was just standing up pretending to read signs and listening to music to ignore him. 

All of these cases, no one did anything. I didn‚Äôt do anything. But who‚Äôs to say something worse won‚Äôt happen next time? None of these people were your stereotypical homeless person who shouts random obscenities at strangers, they all seemed to have means or a job of sorts, the first one had AirPods in and was dressed fairly nice. It‚Äôs baffling and I‚Äôve never experienced it. 

Honestly, before this year, and I mean 2020, I had not ever had any incident with homophobia here. I don‚Äôt wear rainbow flags, no PDA with my partner, or flaunt my sexual orientation in any way. With that said, I am a more masculine of center person (have been since 2009) who is more often than not thought to be a teenage boy.",nyc,Is it me or is there an increase in homophobia lately?

They all seem to know each other and hang in groups. Many times they're right in front of the Flushing Library drinking, throwing bottles everywhere. Other times, they're all over flushing, mainly walking down Kissena BLVD and they just usually hang in one spot/corner through kissena BLVD  for hours and pass out there at night.  They speak no English neither, so probably illegals.

WORST OF ALL, i've seen them publicly piss in front of the streets, people and kids and they're not arrested?  I thought that exposing yourself in front of kids will get your slapped as a sex offender?  I was walking near main one day and this drunk hispanic dude out of nowhere pulls out his shit and pissed in front of the street near the flushing library, I was far away and i saw water coming out, i thought he was dumping a water bottle, then as i walked closer, i immediately realized what he was doing and turned my head.  Several young kids and elderly people walked by. Another time, i've seen 2 of these dudes piss right on front of the LIRR entrance, WHICH IS LOCATED RIGHT NEXT TO THE MOBILE POLICE STATION NYPD set up.  I've called 311 but nothing happens.  Police don't seem don't give a shit.  I've seen plenty of NYPD stand inside main street station all day trying to catch old chinese people sharing unlimited metrocards or going threw the gate, BUT THEY RATHER not solve real issues.

NYPD has been reduced to being MTA goonie henchemen, catching people skipping $2.75 fares, intentionally or unintentionally, rather than solve crimes that go out in front of their eyes.  I might make a post on this issue alone.!

And I'm usually too shy to post on Reddit overall I'm a lurker. But damn I was more emotional and proud of myself for accomplishing this walk than my own damn undergrad graduation. I enjoy going on long walks around New York City since I was a kid, probably because of me being a loner who knows. So whenever I find the time to do so in between job-hunting and working I'll put on my worn out 'walking' shoes aka an old Nike sneaker I found at the Goodwill in Livingston Street and just aimlessly walk around until my legs are burning and I can barely go on. But usually, when I go on these long walks it's between 4-8 miles. I've always wanted to see if I can walk from somewhere in the Upper Westside to my home in Brooklyn for about 6+ months now maybe even longer, but always either procrastinated on the idea or just convince myself that I can't do it or if I ever do it I should go with someone else, etc, etc. Literally use every excuse in the book to not attempt. But this year I decided to make it a New Year Resolution to step out my comfort zone and just do it. And I did it!! I'm so proud of myself for doing that!!! I just want to go on top of my apartment building and shout it for all of New York City to hear! I walked from the Upper West Side to Crown Heights Brooklyn!! Yes, I did that shit! And because this is my year of stepping out of my comfort zone, I also vlogged the entire experience with my phone camera. Mostly because if someone doesn't believe me, (my own damn friends didn't believe me until I show them the vlog) I'll just pull out my phone and said NOPE! Eat your words cuz I did it!

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/nyregion/cuomo-andy-byford-mta.html


&gt; On another evening, Mr. Cuomo arrived unannounced at the 207th Street train yards in Upper Manhattan. The public was spending millions of dollars every week to overhaul train cars, three shifts a day, but at this hour, a few minutes after 10 p.m. on a Monday in April, there was neither sight nor sound of work. 

&gt;One man scrambled from a booth to greet him. Yes, he said to the governor, the crew was working on trucks ‚Äî the wheels and engines that the shell of a train car sits on. 

&gt;‚ÄúWhere are you doing that?‚Äù Mr. Cuomo asked. 

&gt;The man pointed to a long line of trucks, one after the other, above a shallow repair pit.

&gt;‚ÄúThey are working here?‚Äù Mr. Cuomo asked.

&gt;Not a soul was in sight.

&gt;‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù the man replied, nodding vigorously.

&gt;‚ÄúThey must be very short people,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said. ‚ÄúOr invisible.‚Äù

&gt;About 130 people were being paid to work until 11 p.m., though their day had clearly ended well before that.


Pretty crazy article that shows how totally screwed up the MTA is and the culture of accepting failure. Actually made me like Cuomo

One more:

&gt;About two feet of water had pooled in a clogged holding basin between the tracks, a murky tea of subway filth. The basin‚Äôs drain pipe was blocked. The governor had seen dozens of them, and they still infuriated him.

&gt;During the 2017 crisis, transit managers told him that standing water on tracks was a chronic problem that caused delays. Since the subways have an ingenious drain network, Mr. Cuomo assumed that climate change and rising water tables were to blame. Not so.
&gt;The water had nowhere to go because most drains, like the one at 59th Street, were silted shut. The governor called for inspection reports. They falsely showed that drains were open. Of roughly 418 miles of drain pipe, just 17 miles were scheduled for annual cleaning. Even that was not being met.

I have bought our tickets (with Concorde Experience) to the Intrepid Museum for next Thursday. We will fly to NYC this Saturday. I have received an order confirmation and receipt from them upon purchasing (it was 8 days ago, 28Jan) and they stated (I selected Mobile delivery):

&gt; ***This is your receipt.  If you selected the 'Print at Home'  or 'Mobile' delivery method, your tickets will be forwarded in a  separate email.*** 

Now, I still have not received any separate e-mail containing our tickets. Via e-mail they are not reachable, only via phone, but to be honest I would like to avoid that as calling to the U.S. from my country would be quite expensive.

Is it normal that they don't send out the tickets even after 8 days from the purchase? Or will they send it out only 1-2 days before the booking? Any experience?

Or, by Mobile delivery, are there any iOS apps that I've not seen and should use?

The black guy then said, ""What are you doing here? You looking for the Statue of Liberty?"" They nodded. He then got to the point: ""OK, You have to go to that booth right there and buy tickets.""

So 1) he probably wasn't security. 2) the tourists probably just wanted to get on the Staten Island Ferry for free. 3) these guys diverted the tourists to a booth where they had to shell out cold, hard cash.

Was wondering what some of my fellow New Yorker‚Äôs unpopular opinions about our city were. It‚Äôs been a little while since the last thread of this kind.

For me, I actually really love Times Square. I try to get out and see different areas to the city when I have time to on the weekends, but if I have a little time some evenings I love to head up and people watch/ admire the lights. Something about the spectacle of it all really amazes me for some reason. 

I‚Äôd like to hear what you guys think.

I live in a shoddy building - but rent is cheap, I have a large living space for nyc and the neighborhood is safe. I like to think I‚Äôm a pretty good neighbor - no loud tv or music, no smoking, no parties, rarely have people over, etc. 

There‚Äôs only 3 other tenants in my building - a basement apartment, 2 other girls across the hall and a family that lives downstairs. 

I work nights and for a few months now the woman living downstairs will bang on her ceiling if she hears me walking around after 9pm. So I stopped wearing shoes inside and put my heels on out in the hall before work. Well she hears me coming down the stairs and will rush to her door to try and beat me to the punch before I can leave. Everytime it‚Äôs the same thing ‚Äúbe quiet no shoes be quieter you walk too loud‚Äù I even showed her I was tip toeing down the stairs.

Finally, a couple days ago I got sick of being accosted by her everytime I leave the building so I told my landlord. Well turns out she has filed 8 complaints with him of me stomping around and making noise! I told him there‚Äôs nothing I can do - clearly the building is shoddy if she can hear me walking around and getting ready. He suggested I get a rug and I said I would.

Well, lo and behold I‚Äôm lying in my bed today window open and I can hear her screaming at him from outside that ‚ÄúSHE STOMPS LIKE AN ELEPHANT ALL HOURS ELEPHANT STOMPING‚Äù

For those that don‚Äôt know, the college and the residence halls are right by the junction in Flatbush. 

I lived in Brooklyn my entire life, specifically Windsor Terrace, and I know my way around most of the city through working different jobs, and I‚Äôve seen which areas to avoid, etc. 

I‚Äôve been in this specific area plenty of times and it seems a little rundown but not too bad compared compared to some places in Brooklyn. That said I‚Äôm sure visiting from time to time is a lot different then actually living there, walking around late at night, etc.

Most of my friends were happy for me, but a few of them shared their concerns about dorming there. They swore they‚Äôve seen ‚Äúcrazy shit‚Äù out there, but then again they‚Äôre from park slope and bay ridge so they might just be being dramatic. It kind of make me think a little bit though. 

Also I‚Äôll be most likely working somewhere in the area, so it‚Äôs very likely that I‚Äôll be working after class and coming home later at night. Hopefully I find a job within walking distance like target, so i don‚Äôt have to take the train, but it all depends on who hires me. I have quite a bit of time so I gotta wait a while before I cross that bridge.

I‚Äôm not looking for parties 24/7 and fancy coffee shops and shit like that. Honestly the main draw for me is having my own living space (I was lucky enough to get a single dorm) and having that sense of independence and privacy that comes with it, along with not hearing my mom and siblings screaming in the house. I just want to make sure the area is okay before I make the move",nyc,17M. Should I be concerned about living on campus at Brooklyn College?

Personally, I've tried to use less plastic/paper bags when I go to whole foods/trader joes etc. Years ago I searched for a good ""reusable"" bag and came across something that I fell in love with.

LL Bean is famous for [a canvas tote](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/677?originalProduct=33381&amp;productId=7197&amp;attrValue_0=Blue%20Trim&amp;pla1=0&amp;mr%3AtrackingCode=CB6BAF02-BFE7-E511-80ED-00505694403D&amp;mr%3AreferralID=NA&amp;mr%3Adevice=c&amp;mr%3AadType=pla_with_promotiononline&amp;qs=3125176&amp;pcd=GREAT20&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhZXgvfvA5wIVg5yzCh1zYg5AEAQYASABEgLwrvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)\- but I found the canvas bag to be too heavy and too rigid for my shopping even though these bags are bullet proof.

so I found another product of theirs that I have fallen in love with: their ""everyday lightweight nylon tote"" line. Below are some of the color options currently available:

[option 1](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/120013?page=everyday-tri-color-tote&amp;bc=50-516672&amp;feat=516672-GN1&amp;csp=f)

[option 3](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/119817?page=everyday-lightweight-tote-katahdin&amp;bc=50-516672&amp;feat=516672-GN1&amp;csp=f)

why i love them: reasonable price, super high quality and double stitched for strength, zip top, they come in medium and large sizes.

The bags are built for durability/life long use/even r/BIFL would love it. I have bought several of these bags (maybe too many lol). i have used them for years and they're perfect for grocery and farmers market runs. they're very light weight, machine washable and built to hold a ton of weight.

They run about $30-$40 each which is pricey but what you are paying for is quality. moreover, i never paid this price for them. ll bean always has some sale going on (20 or 25 % off) and sometimes these bags are at a lower clearance price. The most I've paid for one of these large bags is maybe $25. most were about $20/21 bucks.

I wanted to follow up on a reddit post from yesterday in which I said I can bet this guidance does not mean a god damn thing and brokers are still going to get theirs. 

I viewed three apartments around Park Slope today, 1 of which was listed as no fee, which does seem to be the case. However the other two did not say in their listing and when I asked both brokers were adamant that there is still a fee. 

One said that by viewing the apartment, we are entering in a partnership and they are representing me, therefore the fee is still valid (15%, go fuck yourself).

The other out right said that the New York Times interpretation was false, broker fees are not illegal and gave me some convoluted explanation on representation and how we are liable for the fee, not the landlord. 

Both units I found on street easy and never contacted the brokers firms to work with them directly. 

The sad thing is, the last apartment (with the broker who said the NYT is wrong) is the perfect apartment, perfect location and accepts my dog. Exactly what I feared, if you really want an apartment, you are going to be forced to play by their rules. 

All in all, I am pretty sure nothing is going to change for the better.",nyc,"Viewed three apartments today, brokers are still saying fees are not illegal"

In the Company of Hal Prince will explore Prince‚Äôs reinvention of musical theatre from the script- and score-based model created by Rodgers and Hammerstein and George Abbott to a more visual, almost cinematic art form in which the director is auteur.

3248,rentersdilemma,1581260142,f19nj1,Nan,"Hello,

I'm in a bit of a bind and could use some advice. I've been looking for apartments for a quite a while, and last Monday I finally found a good one. Initially I was told I could sign the lease Thursday. On Monday during the initial showing, I'd agreed to the price and the brokers fee. Because at that point it was the norm. When the news broke Thursday they told me I would have to wait until the following day to sign the lease. I'm assuming their company was in an emergency meeting with lawyers trying to figure this whole thing out. 

Of course, I asked about the fee and they said that I still have to pay it regardless, and that they were tenant's agents not representing the landlord. But, I found this specific address and unit on streeteasy. I didn't contact their agency to help me find an apartment. The photos of the listing are not even of the same apartment that I was shown, so obviously they are responsible for renting more than one unit from the landlord. And this was basically confirmed before Thursday when I'd been speaking with the broker. The broker (who I don't believe is a licensed real estate agent) has refused to allow me to speak with his boss, or the landlord at all.

They are now telling me that if I refuse to pay the brokers fee, then they won't give me the apartment anymore. In their words ""You can fuck off and we'll give it to someone else.""

I already contacted the Met Council with this info, and they informed me that in this situation, it is illegal for me to have to pay the fee. They recommended that I either confront the agent, or pay it and try to go through legal channels later to get my money back. 

But I have to be out of my current living situation by Tuesday and so I don't have a ton of leverage here. I also don't have a backup place lined up that I could move into within a day or two. I'm not quite sure what to do. Do I contact a lawyer and get them to write a letter saying what they're doing is illegal? Do I just pay the fee and hope it all works out later? Do I try and negotiate the fee alone?

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",nyc,Broker's Fee Question

My name is Joong-Hwan Oh. I am Professor at Hunter College of The City University of New York in the Sociology Department. I hope you are doing well. Currently, I am conducting a research study examining the relationship between one‚Äôs past memorable experience on a public space in New York City and his or her current perceptions, attitudes, and modes of behavior in public appearance. You are invited to participate in this study. My research on this topic (#2020-0003) received approval from CUNY Human Research Protection Program.

By and large, this research study, entitled ‚Äú*How We Become New Yorkers*,‚Äù will provide better understanding of why mostly unknown people in the crowded New York City public places maintain urban civility or public social order to one another. Participation in this online survey through an anonymous link will involve 30-45 minutes to complete the mostly open-ended questions (e.g., your unique experience in a public place of New York City, such as an encounter, event, or an incident with unknown persons) and some basic demographic questions (i.e., gender, ethnicity, education, employment, and so on). Although there is no anticipated risk or discomfort to your participation, you can choose whether to be part of this study or not. If you volunteer to be in this study, you may withdraw at any time. You also have the right to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer. During your survey responses, it is also important not to write your name or your other personal information.  

Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained without any identifiers or codes so that data is never directly linked to individual identity. The data collected will be retained for approximately three years after this study has been completed and then destroyed, thereafter. Moreover, the data will be safely stored in the researcher's password protected computer.  After collecting and analyzing data, a summary of the research findings is made available only to those participants who request it.

If you have questions or would like to participate, you can be reached at (212)-772-5588 or [joonghwan.oh@hunter.cuny.edu](mailto:joonghwan.oh@hunter.cuny.edu).

If you decide to participate, please copy, paste, and open the anonymous survey link below on your computer having an internet connection.

3345,Popdmb,1581353062,f1sy6z,Nan,"There seems to be a ton of threads coming in about brokers continuing to act out on this new - and very real - protection for New York renters. We just went through a move and I figured I would help give tips on how to do this. I am not a lawyer and you will want to double and trip check yourself, but the below is what we did to secure a good apartment.

1. **If you have a lease expiring in 2-3 months, begin looking now.** I don't care if you aren't sure you're going to renew, I don't care if you are ""waiting to see what you roommates do"", you should see what's out there. Why? Because a) a small amount of units are coming up now on StreetEasy for things like an April 1 date and b) You need to see what your money is going to get you in certain neighborhoods, what the competition for open houses is like, etc.  sketchy brokers will try to use your desperation against you. While making you pay them a fee while they act as a landlord's broker is illegal, losing an apartment while haggling with someone who is unsure of the law isn't ideal either.

2. **If you see duplicate listings being posted on StreetEasy, IMMEDIATELY REPORT THEM.** Unlike Craigslist which was the Wild West, their is explicitly a report feature for non-exclusive listings. Brokers posting 3A or A3 to game the search are breaking the terms of service, and they do take them down. Go into to the listing. Click on the top right menu. Report the listing for being non-exclusive. They usually turn this around quickly. 

3. **Don't delay in reporting the broker.** You can report a complaint against a real estate broker at www.dos.ny.gov or by calling (518) 474-4429. Should the building you are applying to is being run by a management company, contact them and explain the situation, and see if you can apply with them directly. 

4. **Application Fees**. The ""bad actor"" brokers are already drumming up ways to skirt broker fees with legalese. Remember that an application fee for a landlord's broker can't be more than $20, and that a broker can't act on behalf of both the landlord and a tenant.

5. **""A broker is making me sign something.""** Anything you sign with a broker should be audio recorded on your phone. If you have an iPhone, use the voice memo function and have it recording before you walk in to a unit. You can and will be able to sue a real estate firm for violating the protections.  The PR and renewed public interest in this would absolutely hurt the reputation of the brokerage that engaged in a deceptive practice in the industry now that this law has taken effect.

I hope our check list helps answer many of the questions that keep getting posted here. We had some form of each of these things happen in our time in New York. If you paid a fee in the last week, it's worth calling the DOS to see what your recourse is.",nyc,Tips for Renting Apartments During this Broker Fee Transition

I hope this is okay to post this here. Disclaimers that (1) I am using a throwaway for obvious reasons, and (2) I am a local nanny. This is NOT nanny shaming. I support and appreciate people who care for children (including myself) but what I saw was totally beyond unacceptable.

If anyone has any ideas on how to get into contact with the parents who employ this nanny, I would really, really appreciate it. I've had 2 scary encounters with this woman recently, so I'm going to post info here in case anyone recognizes her by chance.

Location: In front of Azzuros on Clinton St, about 9:35am. And on corner of Montague and Henry.

Description: Tall (maybe 5'8""ish) woman. Buzzcut. Cropped cargo pants, light blue/grey sneakers, green military-ish jacket, purple scarf. Double stroller, possibly a double YoYo. Grey suncover/seats to stroller, black handle. There were two blonde children in the stroller, who looked to be about 2 years old. One of them was definitely a little girl.

Incidents:

First: Walking to work one morning, I spotted the back of an unattended double stroller in the middle of the sidewalk (Clinton St, Brooklyn) with a purse hanging off the back of it. I thought I would watch the person's belongings until they got back. Walking around to the other side, I actually saw that there were two young children in the stroller, left totally unattended. I waited another 60 seconds or so with the kids (stroller was in my line of vision for at least 2 minutes, unattended), before their nanny came out of the dry cleaners. Before I could say a thing, give her a look, anything, I immediately got an angry, ""What are you looking at? Mind your own business."" She proceeded to scream at me very aggressively, with swearing, in front of the ignored children. When I eventually raised my phone to photograph her, feeling so unsafe and threatened, she lost her shit. Grabbed for my phone, cut me with her nail, growled like a dog, raised her firsts to my face, and smiled when I literally cowered down in fear. Finally, she literally ran away with the stroller.

Second: I spotted the nanny again, 2/3 weeks after first incident, standing on a street corner. She was SCREAMING on her phone, not pushing her nanny kids in the stroller at all, getting aggressive and angry on the phone. I watched for a while, but my nanny baby needed to sleep, so I kept walking. When I passed by that same corner 1.5 HOURS later (!) she was still there. Still talking on the phone. I got close enough to listen - she appeared to be talking about a man she knows who shot someone, saying she couldn't believe she knew ""that guy."" She said, ""I can see it! I can see it."" There was more, I can post below. However, when she spotted me listening, she gave me this threatening, crazy glare, so I felt like I had to walk away with my nanny baby.

Hopefully some of this makes sense.... Apologies if it doesn't.

If you think this is possibly your nanny or a friend's nanny, please PM me. I have a photo of her back (without your children in it).

Any advice in getting in touch with these kids' parents is so appreciated.",nyc,"Spotted a Neglectful, Violent Nanny in Brooklyn Heights - Trying to Warn the Parents"
3407,Slay3d,1581388932,f21qmk,Nan,"So I have an old email that has a lot of spam in it and it seems some real estate company bought an email list with that email in it. Here is the email with how brokers will continue to charge a fee. No revealing information is included.

Dear REDACTED,

Last week, the DOS unexpectedly blindsided the real estate industry with a new rent law that stipulated that the tenant can no longer compensate the landlord's agent - meaning, if you deal directly with a landlord's agent, you can't be charged a broker's fee. 
 
OMG!  Does that mean that as of last week I'm out of a job?  Lucky for me, no! 
 
And lucky for us,  I can still rent your apartment!  
 
Here are the 2 ways we can still continue to successfully work together!
 
1.  You will give me an ""open listing"" with an Exclusive Agent agreement.  REDACTED is working on modifying all contracts to comply with this new law.  Stay tuned:  In this case, the tenant is allowed to pay me my fee, and you still get the same high level of marketing and branding that I've always given your home!  It's only about the shift in representation to the tenant instead of you, and the tenant still pays, so zero out-of-pocket costs for you.  Easy, peasy!
 
2.  We inflate your asking rent by 20% and you pay the commission - but now you are offering a 2 year lease ONLY.  Why?  Because on year 1, you pay the broker's fee, and receive 5% higher rent.  At the end of year 1, you've recouped the broker's fee. So, here you are in year 2, suddenly collecting a rent that is 20% above market!  Sure, you are initially out-of-pocket but here's the beauty of it :  YOU COLLECT THE BROKER'S FEE OVER AND OVER AND OVER! 
 
For instance:  if you rent your apartment that is only worth $1700/ month for $2000/ month, after paying the broker's fee of $3600, you collect $3600 EXTRA over the course of the second year.  And the third year, and the 4th year and the 5th year and so on!  That's before you implement the expected $50-$100 annual cost-of-living increase!  In this case, I remain your broker and still represent you. 
 
If hired to represent your units, I'll share with you one other way some of my regular landlord clients who pay my fee are just raking in extra money.
 
Always remember, if you look hard enough, you can always find the opportunity - and I'm so very grateful for the opportunity to continue to be a part of your success.
 
If you have any questions at all about the new rent laws or if you are considering renting or selling your home, please reach out to me today for a customized marketing plan.",nyc,The scum known as NYC real estate

3416,IanKetterer,1581398869,f23sb4,Nan,"Oh hey, my name is Ian. I am looking leave Seattle and head to LA or New York. That being said, I'm making this very personal post because, why not? Life is about meeting kind and amazing people, and my life is going to take a turn soon, and with that turn I want to face it head on as honestly and true to my heart as I possibly can. Are you ready for an unexpected stupidly long reddit post that gets really personal? Well great, then here you go!

A bit about me, I was born without a thumb on my right hand, and without an ear on my right side. I'm completely deaf on my right side. (I'll explain why I'm telling you all this in a bit) Despite those things, I taught myself how to play piano, sing, and mix music. Throughout my life I never thought of these as setbacks, ever. Until I started teaching myself how to mix. It was a really big wakeup call when I realized that no matter what I do, there is no possible way I will ever be able to hear in stereo, it's only mono for me my friends!

Anyways, I knew this was the case my entire life, but it didn't really hit me until I started mixing our record. I had to find different ways to interpret what stereo meant to me, and how I perceived it. I ended up really thinking about loud vs soft when it comes to stereo, and whenever I'm mixing in stereo I always turn my head to the right so I can hear both speakers equally from my left ear. I was also born with something called Tracheoesophageal Fistula. Basically, something was wrong with my esophagus as an infant and they had to do an emergency surgery on my throat or I would have died that day. I'm 34 years old now and also had open heart surgery when I was 23. I had just booked my band's first six shows back in 2008 and had to cancel all of them due to needing this impromptu surgery on my heart. They told me I was going to die within 6 months if I didn't get the surgery done. SOOOOO, I mean, I did it. I was mostly upset that I had to cancel my bands first six shows though. This past year has been insane, the album we produced, recorded, mixed and mastered in our Seattle basement ended up taking us on a small national tour and it also landed us an NPR Tiny Desk Concert in Washington DC. The amount of self-doubt I have had during the entire process of making that record, all started to seem like it was paying off, and it was a humbling feeling to say the absolute least.

BUT, music is not everything, and sometimes life happens, and you need to really look at the true meaning of it all.

OKAY, SO... why the fuck did I just tell you all of that? You don't know me at all, and I'm just looking for a place to live. All of this is true, and valid indeed. But I believe in the beauty of humanity, and what it has meant to me so far in my life.

I was fortunate enough to be in love and love someone for 15 years of my life. I am currently going through a divorce and despite all the other health shit I've gone through, none of it compares to this insanely heavy set of emotions. She saw me for me, and I believe we really really loved each other for so many beautiful years. She saw me through my heart surgery and numerous other difficult times. When you're with someone basically your entire adult life, who you met when you were 19 and she was 16, you really don't think about abnormalities in your own self. Or at least I didn't. I had it all, I was good. I had music, I had my beautiful wife, my dog, and honestly my life was complete. Fast forward 15 years, and as these things usually unfold, life got really confusing, and to make a very very long story short, this is now where my life is. I'm picking up the pieces while doing everything in my power to live honestly and true for myself.

I have noticed my own insecurities more as of late, and the only way to put them to rest, is to talk, and live my fucking life. I have so much I want to do, and explore, and live for, that I don't have time to dance around not talking about things that I know will eventually come up if we were to live together. Yeah there is way more to that story, and I'm more than happy to talk about it, maybe that day will come, who knows, I don't know who you are or if you even exist yet haha. Though you're reading this, so you definitely do exist.

A bit more about me, I do not drink, never have. I also don't smoke cigarettes, weed, or do any other type of drug, never have. None if it interests me. I couldn't care less how other people choose to live, absolutely zero judgement here. It's just never anything I was interested in. That being said, I am not religious, at all. Most people think when they hear that I don't do any of that stuff, that I must be in a cult, or super religious or something, but that couldn't be further from the truth haha.

Honestly, I really really enjoy the complexity of my brain and others', and how the brain works through emotions, sadness, happiness, conversation, etc. I have no interest in making it work any differently. Sadness is terrible, happiness is wonderful, love is beautiful, and life is fucking gorgeous. I appreciate all the emotional facets life has to offer, of which it surely does offer.

If you feel liking looking into my band or me anymore, my instagram handles are below. Don't worry, I fully realize how much information this all was, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for toughing it out and reading it all haha.

I'd love to hear from you! Maybe we'll be friends, see ya!

The biggest services brokers provide are things like giving tenants tours, making sure they don't flake and collecting security deposits and lease signatures from them, and posting the listings on various websites. 

Having said that, it's clear the landlords benefit from their services much more than tenants do. Therefore, you'd think landlords would be fine (but not happy) with paying the fees themselves because of how valuable the services are.

By arguing against this law as ""disastrous"" for them, aren't brokers essentially admitting that their services aren't as valuable as they make them seem, since they're saying that once landlords have to pay for it, many of them will choose not to **despite** the fact that they're the ones benefiting from the services to begin with?

I know we share the english language and it's common to use phrases that others use...but this is odd to me.

The other thing that is odd is that they all responded to me. They all sound like people, too. They are really well written adds. But why would they use so much similar language? Am I being paranoid or just cautious/smart?

**(1) STEP ONE: UPDATE YOUR RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS WITH THE DMV**

* Make sure your residential address is up to date with the DMV.  Don't worry, to update your residential address, you do NOT need to get a new driver's license.  In fact, you can update the address on DMV.org today, and change it back to the old address tomorrow **so long as** when you update it tomorrow you note that you do not want your voter address to be updated. 

* To update your address with the DMV, go to https://dmv.ny.gov/mydmv/mydmv - the update takes place effective immediately and it takes 2-3 minutes, tops.

**(2) STEP TWO: REGISTER TO VOTE ONLINE BY FEBRUARY 13**

* Registering online is simple - just go to https://www.ny.gov/services/register-vote

* The entire process takes 4-5 minutes, but be sure to have updated your residential address with the DMV first because your residential address with the DMV determines the location where you will be required to vote

* What you need to register is simple: (a) the last four of your social security #, (b) your driver's license ID #, and (c) your driver's license document number.

* Don't know where the ID# and document # is located on the driver's license - look here: https://dmv.ny.gov/id-card/sample-photo-documents

* Please note that you **must choose** what party you want to be affiliated with in order to vote in the primary.  Even if you don't have a party affiliation, you are advised to choose a party so that you can at least have some influence on what candidates will be put forth (i.e. if you're an independent, you may as well register as a democrat if you have a nominee you strongly favor).

The most important thing to note is that registration must take place on or before February 14.  However, this deadline is only available to those who want to register **IN PERSON**.  In order to register online, you must register **ON OR BEFORE FEBRUARY 13.**  In fact, when you click through to register with New York State using the link above, the following notice is plastered on top of the page after you provide your social security and drivers license:

* ""February 14 is the deadline for a Board of Elections to RECEIVE a voter's request to change their party enrollment for this year's primaries. THEREFORE, ANY CHANGE OF ENROLLMENT VIA THIS DMV SITE MUST BE FILED BY FEBRUARY 13TH IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR THIS YEARS PRIMARY ELECTIONS. You may still hand-deliver a party enrollment change directly to your local Board of Elections on February 14.""",nyc,NEW YORK: HERE IS ALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO REGISTER TO VOTE - YOU MUST REGISTER ONLINE ON OR BEFORE THURSDAY FEBRUARY 13!!!

 David Byrne‚Äôs *American Utopia* may be heading into its final week on Broadway, but the show set a box office record at the Hudson Theatre last week.

Currently, *American Utopia* is running at the theater through February 16 and has only been on Broadway for a limited time. However, during the week ending February 9, the play grossed $1,416,344 for just seven performances, beating the previous high-water mark set by eight performances of *Sunday in the Park With George* back in April 2017. The record-setting numbers helped the box office reach 154 percent of its potential, [***Deadline*** ](https://deadline.com/2020/02/broadway-box-office-david-byrne-american-utopia-house-record-1202856770/)notes, meaning that the premium-priced seats helped the show go above and beyond its standard-price potential.

*Utopia*‚Äòs performance helped the overall Broadway box office bump its sales last week, jumping from $26,036,075 the previous week to $26,971,364. Average ticket prices for the show rang in at around $211, reaching up to $649 for top premium[(read more...)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/02/american-utopia-sets-broadway-box-office-record/)",nyc,‚ÄòAmerican Utopia‚Äô Sets Broadway Box Office Record

3634,Coldbrewaccount,1581640184,f3jtnf,Nan,"I always feel as though a sampling of random citizens of NYC should be more intelligent than the rest of the country. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm continually blown away by the desire to keep raising costs for commuting with a private car into the city. 

At some point, you all have to recognize that things like congestion pricing aren‚Äôt actually what make cities like London more tolerable places to be a pedestrian. Unless you find free street parking every day, the price for commuting into Manhattan by car is quite a bit higher than London. This is even more crazy when you think about how taking a commuter train is much more expensive for London than it is Manhattan.

I drive into the city every day. I live in New Jersey. My rent is 1365 for a large one-bedroom apartment with an assigned parking spot. I pay about 1000 a month for all of expenses relating to a car. Having a car is about half paid for by freelance work I get that I‚Äôve found by having a car. I could get a Manhattan studio or a large one bedroom somewhere like Astoria for the premium I pay for my car. But then, I would pay city taxes and then NY state taxes for all of my jobs out of state. Here‚Äôs the thing: my jobs start and end outside of congestion times. I get to the city around 3pm and leave anywhere from 11pm to 3am. My life becomes SIGNIFICANTLY shittier if I take transit. 

Let me be clear, for me and many others, a several thousand dollar increase in my yearly driving expenses is still a better option than moving into the city and/or taking public transit. For those whom the increase would make driving unaffordable, congrats, you‚Äôve just made driving a more pleasant experience for me.

The RPA‚Äôs pricing model (which was the only info I could find on the plan for peak vs non-peak charges) is much shittier for drivers than London‚Äôs. Their flat fee suggests a total of around $12 whether you enter or leave any time between 5am and 11pm. Their peak pricing still suggests a $3 fee for leaving outside of the peak hours. London charges 11.50 pounds only between 7am and 6pm. The most innocent explanation is that there is less demand for driving outside of rush hour in London than in NYC, though I would suggest that that demand exists solely because of the staggering awfulness of NJ Transit and the MTA. 

But here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand. Haven‚Äôt the city and state governments proven that my extra money is better spent almost anywhere else than as extra taxes? The figures I‚Äôve seen suggest a revenue increase of 15 billion for congestion charges. Didn‚Äôt they just pledge to spend 5 BILLION to outfit stations with elevators? Nobody can possibly have the expectation that the congestion charge will exist solely to fix the subway. Even less should have the expectation that it will make an appreciable dent in the service quality of the MTA.

Why does everyone feel as though drivers being made to have a worse experience will usher in a pedestrian utopia? Even if you were to ban all cars, the tech companies would work tirelessly to find a solution that sidesteps the subway because UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY FIX THE DAMN SUBWAYS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A DEMAND FOR ANOTHER OPTION. In short, either vote out the entire leadership structure, be complicit in their corruption, or take away everyone's money.",nyc,I don't understand how so many anti-car voters have faith in a corruption-free government

Ramia Begum was slashed by a stranger while riding the subway home after work on Wednesday night.

A Bronx woman can‚Äôt fathom why an unhinged stranger slashed her in the face as she rode home from work on the subway.

‚ÄúHe was a very scary man,‚Äù Ramia Begum, 19, said at her home Thursday. She sported a jagged jagged scar from her forehead to her left ear.

Begum said she noticed the attacker when she boarded a Pelham Bay-bound No. 6 train at 125th St. around 9:45 p.m. Wednesday, as she headed home from her job at a Harlem Dunkin‚Äô Donuts shop.

Soon, the man began acting erratically.

He wouldn‚Äôt stop staring at her, Begum said.

Feeling uncomfortable, she moved to another train car ‚Äî but the man followed her.

Then the suspect lunged at her with a sharp object, slashing her forehead and hand as the train entered the Brook Ave./E. 138th St. station in Mott Haven, the Bronx, two stations away from 125th St.

‚ÄúHe attacked my head,"" Begum said. ‚ÄúI hold my face and [he] attacked my hand.‚Äù

The stranger continued with his assault even after Begum fell to the ground.

‚ÄúHe kicked my head,‚Äù she said.

The attacker didn‚Äôt say a word as he cut her, police said.

Concerned straphangers rushed to the woman‚Äôs aid.

‚ÄúAll of us tried to help her the best way we could,‚Äù said one good Samaritan, who declined to give his name. ‚ÄúI tried to cover the cut and tried to suppress the cut from her bleeding out until the ambulance came.‚Äù

Begum was in shock and couldn‚Äôt stop crying, the good Samaritan remembered.

‚ÄúShe was hysterical because of what happened to her,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo one should have to go through that and endure that at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúI really hope they catch the guy for doing this to her, because it was so wrong,‚Äù he added.

Witnesses told police that the suspect fled the station moments after the assault.

Medics took Begum to Lincoln Hospital, where she was treated and released.

Resting at home and trying to put the vicious assault behind her, Bagum said she didn‚Äôt know if she would take the subway again.

‚ÄúBefore, I am not really scared,"" she said. ""Next time, I am too scared‚Äù

Cops are looking for the attacker, who appeared to be between 20 and 30 years old and was wearing blue jeans and black sneakers.

Police released surveillance video of the suspect Thursday in the hopes that someone recognizes him.

Miraculously, the robber‚Äôs relentless attack didn‚Äôt break any bones, but the 38-year-old victim told the Daily News she‚Äôs blessed to still be alive.

‚ÄúThank god he didn‚Äôt kill me,‚Äù said Rosa, who asked her last name not be used because she fears for her husband and two children‚Äôs safety.

Police said the crook crept up behind Rosa on Wilson Ave. near Dekalb Ave. in Bushwick about 7 a.m. Tuesday and shoved her to the ground.

She was on her way to her 7 a.m. shift at work, she said, carrying her phone and wallet in her pocket, and clothes for her job in her bag.

‚ÄúGive me the money!‚Äù the robber screamed repeatedly as he tried to take her purse.

He hit her in the back of the head with what looked like a hammer, sending her sprawling flat onto the pavement, she said.

When she refused to let go of the purse, the robber struck her over and over in the back of the neck and on her back and knees.

The crook then ran off down Wilson Ave., empty handed.

Because the robber didn‚Äôt get any of Rosa‚Äôs property, she still had her phone and was able to call the police as he fled.

Rosa said she spent the day at Woodhull Hospital. She suffered a deep gash on her forehead and cuts under her right eye. Doctors and nurses quickly treated her, and she was soon released.

It seems really sketchy because it's a deli, but it's closed during normal business hours and seems to open around 7 pm and stay open throughout the night. What's really weird is that a large group of men seems to gather here at like 1 am or later and stay there for most of the night (on weekdays too). I initially thought it might be some sort of taxi driver hub, but there's never any taxi's parked outside.

3714,s3co2,1581723921,f411f4,Nan,"A French tourist was randomly slashed in the neck while strolling around Harlem with his girlfriend Friday, police said.

Shocking video obtained by The Post shows the young man kneeling on the ground holding a piece of cloth to his neck, a heavy pool of blood forming around him, as his distraught girlfriend stands next to him.

The couple was walking on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard between 132nd and 133rd streets in Upper Manhattan around 11 a.m. when a stranger suddenly jumped the 27-year-old victim and slashed him across the face and neck with a knife, cops said.

The man and his girlfriend had just walked out of the IHOP on 135th Street when the unprovoked attack happened, police sources said.

EMS rushed the victim to Harlem Hospital, he was listed in critical but stable condition.

Police canvassed the neighborhood for a suspect dressed in black and wearing Air Jordan sneakers but had yet to find him.

A man who works in a nearby building saw the incident on surveillance tape and detailed what happened for The Post.

‚ÄúA man and woman were walking down the street, and a guy was walking beside them, like side-by-side. Then [the attacker] turns towards [the victim], looked him in the eye and pulled out ‚Äî it looked like a box cutter ‚Äî and sliced him on the neck,‚Äù the worker said.

‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt know him,‚Äù the building employee added of the victim. ‚ÄúHe even looked at the guy before he cut him and made a surprised face.‚Äù

Other neighborhood people were just as upset by the attack.

A worker from the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Homeless Shelter said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so surprised. I just want them to catch this guy. It‚Äôs so random, and it could have been me.‚Äù

William Modeste, 38, a local real-estate agent with Uptown Flats, added, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a random attack and so unexpected.

‚ÄúWe always have plenty of visitors in the neighborhood, and when I heard about it, I just thought, ‚ÄòThis person had cruelty on his mind.‚Äô ‚Äù

My road bike was stolen from my apartment's basement at some point recently. In the grand scheme it's not a huge deal, but it's my most expensive asset and I'm tight on money.  

I already went to the NYPD precinct, and they said I needed to go back to my apartment, call 911, and they would file a report and check the apartment cameras. There's also someone selling the bike on Facebook Marketplace, so I know where it is. Here's the catch.

I'm subletting, and the person whose lease I'm on never told our landlord. If I file a report will it backfire on me? I don't know much about subletting rules, but I'm worried the police will contact my landlord and it could screw over my living situation.

What's the move from here? Seems like I can file a report and possibly get my bike back but also get me kicked out of the apartment (?). Should I take the L?

We want a quiter simpler living but it comes with a catch. All our family and friends live here. We don't want to live too far especially with my partners older mother living here. She doesn't want to move and wants us close but is understanding of our reasoning of wanting  better opportunities and living situations. So we want to move somewhere maybe 1- 2 hours tops away, small town nice schools and community for where we grow our family and we want to make it a steady move meaning first and final move. Where not planning to move for another 5 years max as we want to do our research and be completely sure and prepared for the change as all we know is the nyc life.

3779,s3co2,1581796667,f4eq0v,Nan,"He‚Äôs up to 139 arrests ‚Äî and he says he can‚Äôt be stopped.

Serial subway crook Charles Barry walked out of Manhattan Criminal Court early Saturday after his arraignment in his most recent arrest on Thursday afternoon.

He knew that except for having to spend about 36 hours in police custody, there were no immediate consequences to his alleged crimes, which include charges he snatched cash from people trying to use MetroCard machines.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm famous! I take $200, $300 a day of your money, cracker! You can‚Äôt stop me!‚Äù Barry yelled to a Daily News reporter late Thursday night as police led him out of NYPD Transit District 1 headquarters in the Columbus Circle station.

‚ÄúBail reform, it‚Äôs lit!‚Äù Barry said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Democrats! The Democrats know me and the Republicans fear me. You can‚Äôt touch me! I can‚Äôt be stopped!‚Äù

Barry was taken from Columbus Circle to Manhattan Central Booking, where he cooled his heels for about 24 hours in a courthouse holding area.

When he was finally released after his hearing early Saturday, Barry was still enthusiastic about Albany‚Äôs decision last year to eliminate bail for non-violent crimes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great thing. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey punk‚Äôd people out for bulls--t crimes.‚Äù

Barry, 56, who‚Äôs served six stints in state prison, has been arrested six times since New York‚Äôs bail reform laws took effect Jan. 1.

After each arrest, he was freed without bail because the charges against him did not involve violence. Twice, he was charged with stealing money unsuspecting straphangers were trying to insert in MetroCard vending machines.

Barry found himself in trouble again Thursday just hours after his face appeared on a Daily News front page that headlined the MetroCard machine heists.

Officers who‚Äôve gotten to know Barry over the years were looking for him that day because two warrants had been issued for his arrest after he missed court dates.

One court hearing Barry skipped is related to a Jan. 19 incident in which he was given a desk appearance ticket for allegedly stealing $50 out of woman‚Äôs hand inside the subway station at W. 42nd St. and 6th Ave. near Bryant Park. The other hearing he missed was related to a theft in December.

Officers spotted him jumping a turnstile in Penn Station and began following him, said police. They lost track of him briefly before they found and arrested him around 1:30 p.m. at the subway station at W. 50th St. and Eighth Ave.

The arrest was the 139th in Barry‚Äôs career. His criminal record includes six felonies, 87 misdemeanors, and 21 missed court hearings, records show.

Since the bail law took effect, Barry has been freed three times on supervised release, which did not require him to post bail. He was convicted of a minor charge of bending a MetroCard in a way that would let him on the subway for free, and sentenced to time served.

Police officials said that under the state‚Äôs former bail laws, Barry would more likely have been held on bail, thereby increasing the number of days he spent in custody.

It‚Äôs not clear how many times Barry was held on bail in his 133 pre-bail-reform arrests.

The Legal Aid Society said the NYPD is using a few cases to stoke fears after six weeks that bail and other reforms are a failure. It also said that despite what police say, ‚Äúpre-trial incarceration actually erodes public safety and perpetuates recidivism.‚Äù

### Masq Cycle 001 Circle 4: Masc-Allyship, 2/20

Masq is a healing initiative that aims to evolve our relationships with masculinity, thru open-conversation. We strive to destroy the toxic elements that exist within the identity, and embrace its existence beyond it‚Äôs cis-expression. This installment of Masq is going to be largely focused on how we, as masculine-identifying individuals, can utilize our power and privilege in our intimate realities  to do our part in dismantling our patriarchy. This discussion can be broken into 2 parts, intervention in ways that are obvious (external), &amp; intervening in ways that are less obvious (internal). 
Anjan Alavandar (they/them) is the founder of Masq. Anjan is an American born South-Indian community organizer who was raised in North Carolina. Anjan has been exploring the confines of masculinity from a young age. They work with All Kings, a new organization that is establishing a healing-based re-entry program for recently incarcerated men in Harlem and Brooklyn, NY.

### Community Create-A-Thon: Census 2020, 2/21

No one knows your community better than you. So, whether you want to design a sticker, draw a poster, write a poem, sing a song, or choreograph a dance, Lincoln Center teaching artists will be on hand to help you shape your ideas. Come collaborate on fun and accessible art projects to help reach the people in your life and share the importance of the census.  

Lincoln Center, in partnership with Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer and the U.S. Census Bureau, wants to ensure that our communities get their fair share, especially people in historically under-counted groups. These include people of color, immigrants, LGBTQIA people, people experiencing homelessness, people with low incomes, renters, single-parent households, people with limited English proficiency, and children under the age of five.

Why the Census Matters 
The Census, a once-a-decade population count, affects your representation in government, and determines how much funding your community receives. When a person isn‚Äôt counted, they lose out on nearly $2,000 every year for TEN YEARS in direct services like SNAP, WIC, hospitals, schools, transportation, and road maintenance.

So recently I started a website called [Firefly List](https://www.fireflylist.com/) to send out all the international flight deals I come by out of a few different cities. I've been travelling a bunch and figured I could set up a way to share the deals I come by. Full disclosure, it is a freemium list, so there's both a free and paid option. As it's grown, I started incurring hosting and email fees, so the premium list has really just helped me pay for those expenses. I posted over in /brooklyn a few months back and got great response so I figured i'd share here as well.

It's grown quite a bit and has been super fun to work on. Basically, you can select your city, (only 5 right now, sorry) and I'll send you cheap round trip deals departing that city.

I moved to the city in 1989, from New Haven, CT. where I worked as a 19 year old assistant manager at the New Haven branch of the Cameras Shops of New Britain. 

After a couple years in New Haven, one of the photographers I knew from the shop said he knew of a camera shop in Manhattan, where I‚Äôd dreamed of living, who had an opening in their rental department.

The shop was Photomarketplace, at 11 W 20th St., 3rd floor. It was soon to be bought by Chicago‚Äôs Calumet.  In fact, I appeared on the back cover of the 1989 Calumet catalog for the NYC branch. 

This was back when B&amp;H had just moved into Cambridge Camera‚Äôs old spot on W17th, well before the big move to W34th. 

Back when State Supply was a big prop house. Back when there were 20+ E-6 labs to choose from, from L&amp;I to Baboo to Duggal to my personal choice, Larson Color on W19th. 

Anyone as old as me here?

And how about the most posh camera shop in the city, Ken Hansen Photographic, where I once met Eli Reed, and almost sold him my Leica M2?  RIP Ken, who left us last year. 

Who remembers trudging a roll of seamless from Set Shop back to their studio and trying to fit it into the passenger elevator? Or dragging a Speedotron 4800 pack in a Lightware case from Flash Clinic, walking by Big City Productions, dreaming of working on the next Absolut ad?  

Who got black and white developed at Kennedy Labs on 23rd St?  I was there picking up some contact sheets the day OJ was acquitted, and the entire city was silently scratching their heads. 

Who rented from Lens &amp; Repro but called it Lens &amp; Ripoff?  Who remembers Gil Ghitelman, the Hasselblad and Leica dealer whose much younger assistant was actually his wife?

How many tuna melts did you sneak at Eisenberg‚Äôs when you were supposed to be picking up a lens rental?

3886,britishbeercan,1581946234,f58rca,Nan,"A New York City man who‚Äôs now been arrested 139 times thanked Democrats for guaranteeing his immediate release despite repeatedly swiping hundreds of dollars from unsuspecting subway commuters since the state‚Äôs new bail reform law went into effect Jan. 1.


Charles Barry, 56, has been arrested six times since the start of this year. He‚Äôs been released each time without having to post bail under New York‚Äôs new bail reform law since his alleged offenses were nonviolent, the New York Daily News reported. In the past, Barry‚Äôs served several stints in state prison and has a lengthy record, including six felonies, 87 misdemeanors and 21 missed court hearings, the newspaper reported, citing court records.
After his most recent arrest Thursday, Barry was held in custody for about 36 hours until his Saturday morning arraignment hearing in his Manhattan Criminal Court. He was then released before trial without paying bail. He had two warrants out for his arrest for missing court dates related to past alleged subway theft, including one instance in January when he allegedly snatched a $50 bill out of a woman‚Äôs hand while she was trying to buy a Metro card at a Bryant Park station machine.

Officers arrested him Thursday after he was spotted jumping a subway turnstile in Penn Station. Barry, a career criminal, has repeatedly duped subway-goers by dressing as MTA officials and robbing people after offering to help them buy their tickets, police said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm famous! I take $200, $300 a day of your money, cr----r! You can‚Äôt stop me!‚Äù Barry shouted to reporters.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great thing. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing. They punk‚Äôed people out for bullsh-- crimes.‚Äù

A high-ranking official in the New York City Police Department said because of the new bail reform law, offenders like Barry are released and then repeat the same crimes because judges cannot order them to be held in jail before trial. Sometimes, what begins as a nonviolent crime often turns violent if a robbery goes awry, he added.

‚ÄúAt least before, he‚Äôd be remanded and be behind bars for a couple of days. He wouldn‚Äôt be able to victimize people,‚Äù Assistant Chief Gerald Dieckmann, the No. 2 officer in the NYPD‚Äôs Transit Bureau, told the New York Daily News. ‚ÄúWhen someone doesn‚Äôt pay them or give them the money, it‚Äôll turn into a robbery, a slashing an assault.‚Äù

The French photographer who had his throat slit on a Harlem sidewalk last week had just flown into New York to surprise his girlfriend for Valentine‚Äôs Day.

Gabriel Bascou described to The Post on Monday how he was randomly attacked by an ex-con on Friday as he and girlfriend Manon Duma were leaving a breakfast date at IHOP.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in really bad shape for now,‚Äù wrote Bascou, who can‚Äôt speak due to a tracheotomy, that‚Äôs also left him with a lung infection.

The 28-year-old tourist was still recovering in the Harlem Hospital ICU on Monday. He explained through a series of WhatsApp messages how his romantic Big Apple reunion turned into a nightmare.

The Parisian shutterbug had wanted to visit New York ‚Äúsince forever‚Äù and decided to fly in to surprise his girlfriend for Valentine‚Äôs Day.

They hadn‚Äôt seen each other in just over a month, since Duma, 23, moved to work as an au pair for a family in Harlem.

The lovebirds were stepping out of an IHOP on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard near West 132nd Street around 11 a.m. ‚Äî when a man slashed Bascou in the neck and face with a knife.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see him coming,‚Äù Bascou said. ‚ÄúAt first I thought it was a punch.‚Äù

The attacker ‚Äúturned around and looked me in the eye and started running,‚Äù Bascou recalled. ‚ÄúThen, I felt the warm blood run inside my coat.‚Äù

Passersby ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt understand what was going on,‚Äù Bascou said. His girlfriend began to shout for someone to call 911, which he said a bicyclist did.

‚ÄúThe people around me seemed terrified,‚Äù he recalled.

A former nurse, Bascou ‚Äúdid everything to stay calm‚Äù and gave Duma his blood type and list of allergies in case he passed out.

He said he needed a transfusion of two pints of blood.

Video obtained by The Post showed him kneeling on a sidewalk as his blood spilled onto the pavement and Duma holding him while talking to police.

Since the horrific attack, Duma, who is also a model, ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt slept‚Äù in part due to the attacker still being out on the streets.

That is, until Monday afternoon, when police announced that they arrested 28-year-old Khalief Young as a suspect in the attack.

Bascou wrote he was ‚Äúsuper excited‚Äù when told that that cops had someone in custody.

‚ÄúI want my girlfriend to stay safe here,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIf they caught someone in just a few days, they did a great job.‚Äù

Duma, meanwhile, was in shock, asking tearfully: ‚ÄúIs it really him?‚Äù

Also on Monday, Bascou‚Äôs mother, Marielle Debayne, a nurse from Marseille, arrived in New York to be with him ‚Äî as he‚Äôs set to stay hospitalized for at least another seven days.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so awful,‚Äù the distraught mom told The Post. ‚ÄúGabriel was here for one day. He walked [less than half a mile] in New York and was cut.‚Äù

Friends of Bascou have also started an online fundraiser to help him out with bills, he said.

Despite his ordeal, Bascou said he‚Äôll make it back to the Big Apple for a visit, especially after not seeing much else besides the inside of the Harlem IHOP ‚Äî a breakfast he dreams about as he hasn‚Äôt been able to eat anything else since.

‚ÄúI plan to come back there as soon as possible and discover this incredible city,‚Äù he said.

Man who allegedly slit French tourist‚Äôs throat arrested

The man who allegedly slit a French tourist‚Äôs throat last week has been arrested, the NYPD announced Monday.

Khalief Young, 28, was busted by an officer who spotted him on the street around 3:50 p.m. Monday, police sources told The Post.

He was charged with two counts of assault in the second degree, police said.

Young is accused of slashing 27-year-old Gabriel Bascou in the neck on Valentine‚Äôs Day just as he and his girlfriend were walking out of an IHOP around 11 a.m. on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard near West 132nd Street.

Bascou was caught on video bleeding on a sidewalk as passersby rushed to help him.

He‚Äôs been recovering at Harlem Hospital.

Young lives approximately two blocks from the pancake restaurant and has randomly attacked at least two others in the past, police sources said.

On my way back home two ladies approach to me right in the children‚Äôs room and asked me a few questions (where did I buy a bag, do I live in this neighborhood, how old is my son). They told me that they are from Japan, and one of them lives in UWS (I don‚Äôt really remember details). I was in hurry so I finished this convo and forgot about them.  Today I went to the library again. As soon as I walked in the children‚Äôs room I‚Äôve noticed them again. I went straight to a librarian to ask if it is allowed to stay in the room without children. He said no and that he will follow up on this matter. When he approached them these ladies were speaking with a mom and her child. He asked if they are here with a baby, and received back a lot of smiles and nodding, so he left them. I felt bad for being too paranoidal. But after 20-30 minutes they left the room without a baby (during the convo with that mom they took a lot of photos for some reason). I went back to the librarian and shared my observation. He said that they were with a family here. And I don‚Äôt have to be worried.  I spoke with a nanny who were also concerned, then we asked this mom if she knew them. It turned out that she had no idea and she felt that they were creepy. They also said to her that they are tourists. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Everyone clearly didn‚Äôt think that it was much of a big deal. So I gave up. And now I have second thoughts. Do you go to this library? Have you seen those ladies? Is it normal ?

I normally am courteous and remove my backpack to give people more room but the absolute rush to get on the train didn‚Äôt give me time or room to remove. I‚Äôm on the packed train and a girl‚Äôs water bottle in a side pocket of her own backpack is digging into me so I move slightly. I consequently have my bag knock into another guy who shoves back. I move and don‚Äôt make much fuss other than see him glaring back at me.

I make mistake number one and ask why he‚Äôs giving that look given we‚Äôre on a absolutely packed train, it‚Äôs gonna happen. He remarks back I‚Äôm the reason people have trouble on the train and says what I‚Äôm gonna do about it. Well I‚Äôm not going to fight someone on the train that‚Äôs for sure.

A few stops later I laugh to myself seeing he‚Äôs not courteous himself and continues to stand in the door while people are trying to get off. Big mistake. He notices that and yells back that I‚Äôm the reason people hate Williamsburg and he‚Äôs gonna kill me when we got off the train. 

Thankfully I have a few options of train stops so I‚Äôm not overly worried. We get to Bedford and I courteously step off to allow people by. As I‚Äôm outside the door he walks out and shoves me into the train. He keeps on going and I say to myself screw it I‚Äôm not going to play the victim, so call out a Frodo Baggins reference against this man suffering from a Napoleon complex. I must‚Äôve hit a nerve and he rushes back trying to grab me off the train, unsuccessfully. 

All in all a very tame confrontation by the outcome, but am I crazy to think this whole thing was way overblown?? Does anyone else experience these tough subway encounters? Is it just claustrophobia in the tunnels? Are there just people out there looking for the conflict and I‚Äôm taking the easy bait?",nyc,Are subway confrontations common?

ive produced it, written vocals to different songs with no music to it yet and i could kind of sing but of course would like to take classes to better.

the music.. well if i had to name influences to the songs i made, the two main ones that pop up easily are coldplay 21 pilots and a little bit of red hot chili peepers oh and mgmt (because two of the songs are synth based.

probably bassist because some are piano, drum, guitar and vocals based, some are both bass and piano and some with out piano at all. so 5 members me included =)

As the victim was waiting for a Bronx-bound No. 6 train at the 33rd St./Park Ave. South station a short while later, the assailant reappeared and argued with the man.

A man was slashed in the face in Midtown early Thursday by a stranger who thought the victim was recording him, cops said.

The 26-year-old victim was recording local streets, panning his camera back and forth at 33rd St. and Park Ave. around 6:30 a.m. when the suspect stormed up and demanded to know why the victim was recording him. The two argued briefly before walking away from each other.

The suspect then whipped out a razor and slashed the victim across the face, leaving him with a large gash on the right side of his face, cops said.

Medics took the victim to Bellevue Hospital.

No arrests have been made.

The dialogue about the impeachment starts near the beginning. Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.

See the latest PDF updates: FBI Director Wray, AG Barr, SoD Shanahan, &amp; SoS Pompeo each raped boys and were paid billions in bribes for a Soros &amp; Koch funded child rape org.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do without it!‚Äù Barbara White, 70, said while clutching her plastic bags Saturday outside an East Harlem grocery store. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so used to this kind of way. And I usually get more than I bargained for when I go in there.

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs for the green, whatever that thing is called ‚Äî climate change,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in trouble.‚Äù

State lawmakers approved a ban on most kinds of single-use plastic bags last year, saying the move would reduce litter and help the fight against climate change. There are exemptions including for take-out orders, dry cleaners and garbage bags.

New Yorkers support the ban 62-33, according to a Siena College poll conducted after it was passed.

Opponents fear an economic burden in counties allowing a 5-cent fee on paper bags as a way to encourage consumers to bring reusable bags when shopping.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unfair,‚Äù said India Gonzalez, a teacher in her 30s making a grocery run to City Fresh Market on E. 116th St. ‚ÄúThere are people who can‚Äôt even afford 5 cents. You‚Äôve gotta take this into consideration.‚Äù

Most city lawmakers have embraced the ban, which kicks in on March 1, but two of them led a rally calling on Gov. Cuomo to put a hold on enforcement. A state official said Tuesday that Cuomo was doing just that, but Councilmen Mark Gjonaj (D-Bronx) and Ydanis Rodriguez (D-Manhattan) weren‚Äôt aware of the hold at a rally Thursday.

‚ÄúOur future and the environment is important to us, but it‚Äôs not exclusive that this should be done on the backs of small businesses,‚Äù Gjonaj fumed. ‚ÄúIn particular, 13,000 bodegas in New York City are not prepared for this regulation.‚Äù

Shops won‚Äôt face any consequences for the foreseeable future.

‚ÄúEnforcement will follow in the months ahead,‚Äù state Department of Environmental Conservation Chief of Staff Sean Mahar said on WAMC radio.

‚ÄúOur goal is to make sure that there‚Äôs a smooth transition for consumers and affected retailers with this ban,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut we want to give a period of transition.‚Äù

Earlier this month, the governor announced a campaign to educate New Yorkers about the ban, in tandem with the distribution of 270,000 free usable bags statewide.

But Gjonaj and Rodriguez said the state hasn‚Äôt done nearly enough.

‚ÄúCustomers ‚Ä¶ are not aware of this regulation and will not be prepared to shop locally,‚Äù said Gjonaj, who‚Äôs reeling from a series of scandals.

Low-income New Yorkers ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the resources to buy recycled bags,‚Äù said Rodriguez, who promised to devote ‚Äú5-10%‚Äù of his discretionary funding to reusable bag giveaways.

Business leaders at the rally said they haven‚Äôt had time to inform customers and stock up on supplies.

‚ÄúWe need to allow the time to the chambers to source [reusable bags] in Latin America with our counterparts,‚Äù said Frank Garcia, chair of the Chairman of the National Association of Latino State Chambers.

‚ÄúGov. Cuomo ‚Ä¶ you hurt the small businesses that are the heartbeat of New York!‚Äù he added.

Ban supporters are focused on the local and global environmental damage from plastic bags including manufacturing pollution, littering the streets, clogging landfills, and harming wildlife.

‚ÄúReusable bags have been a thing for 10, 15 years now. Everyone should get with it,‚Äù said Nikki Anderson, 28. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we all just get on board for the one world that we have?‚Äù

By rejecting a compromise offer from Gov. Cuomo, they just shot their pretext in the second foot.


Leaders of President Trump‚Äôs Department of Homeland Security have been claiming that they had no choice but to end Global Entry and other Trusted Traveler Programs (TTP) because New York blocked federal access to DMV data under a new state law granting undocumented immigrants driver‚Äôs licenses. The feds claim that data is essential for investigating TTP applicants‚Äô trustworthiness, despite the fact that they already get applicants‚Äô complete criminal records through other channels.

Cuomo said Washington was welcome to access any TTP applicant‚Äôs DMV data on a case-by-case basis ‚Äî giving Washington everything it claimed it needed.

Acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Matthew Albence wouldn‚Äôt take yes for an answer. He is insisting on full access to all New York‚Äôs DMV data, undergirding suspicions that ICE and DHS simply want DMV documents so they can locate, arrest and deport undocumented residents, supercharging a power they already have and undermining important protections in place in the Empire State.

That gave the game away. So why is Cuomo bending even further, with an offer to hand over the state‚Äôs entire DMV database, with Social Security numbers redacted, to federal immigration authorities? He half-backtracked in a statement late Friday.

That idea, which the Legislature likely wouldn‚Äôt even approve, would give ICE the photographs and addresses of thousands who, when the Green Light Law took effect, lined up to get standard licenses marked ‚Äúnot for federal purposes‚Äù ‚Äî a veritable goldmine for intrusive and indiscriminate enforcement.

No good.

I walked out of the hospital dizzy and i couldn't even walk properly due to a headache induced by the doctor violently thrusting a stick like object into my ear in an attempt to extract the ear wax.

Brazen bandits target e-bike deliverymen along Queensboro Bridge
By THOMAS TRACY and WES PARNELL
NEW YORK DAILY NEWS | FEB 23, 2020 | 6:34 PM

Violent and brazen bike bandits are targeting e-bike riders crossing the Queensboro Bridge, jacking their bikes by force, police are warning.

The group of thugs have bum-rushed e-bike riders, punching them, pulling out knives, threatening violence, and in once case, pulling out a gun, to steal their valuable bikes and personal possessions, police said.

On average, an e-bike used for deliveries costs around $1,500, according to Chas EBike, an e-bike retailer on the Lower East Side.

Five e-bikes have been jacked from delivery riders crossing the bridge late at night, four of the robberies pulled off since January, cops said.

‚ÄúMale suspects acting in groups of 2-3, forcibly rob bikes &amp; cellphones, from mostly food delivery personnel. They have both threatened force &amp; used force,‚Äù said a tweet from the 19th precinct Thursday.

The first attack happened in October when a rider was approached by two men, one of them wielding a knife, according to police.

By late January, the robberies picked up. On Jan. 22, two robbers flashed a knife and a gun and made off with a rider‚Äôs e-bike. On Feb. 11 an unsuspecting biker was punched multiple times in the face and robbed of his bike.

Two days later a group of three robbers ambushed a biker, striking him in the face with a bike lock, knocking him off his bike, beating him and then making away with his e-bike, two cell phones, and cash.

The last attack occurred Feb. 15, when the suspects stopped the biker, punched and kicked him, then made off with his cell phone and e-bike.

4508,no_re-entry,1582570078,f8vxq9,Nan,"Hi All, just wanted to post my experience at an On Site Opera event that took place at Hill Country BBQ in midtown earlier this month. I sent this as feedback to the show but also wanted to post it elsewhere in case they do it again in the future so potential audience members can be wary.

Hopefully since this show was in NYC with an NYC company it's valid and can stay, but if it's against the rules or would belong in a better subreddit please let me know and I'll move it.

The show: [https://osopera.org/productions/bbq/](https://osopera.org/productions/bbq/)

**REVIEW:**

I was told about this show by a friend. Being an opera singer/BBQ lover from Texas I had high expectations for the event, but was ultimately disappointed.

I attended the show on Feb 11th with a group of eight people. First impressions went well, the space seemed cool and it looked like it was going to be a lot of fun. The impression did not stick.

First problem, the food. The food for this event was called ""a family style BBQ"". I don't know if whoever wrote that has never been to a real ""family style BBQ"" or just has a family that likes to starve themselves. There was not near enough food per person at the table and that was the most frustrating thing of the night.

Myself and my guests all split the food on the table initially, there was just enough for everyone to have a bite of everything so we split it accordingly and then waited for the second serving. After a bit of not seeing it we waved down the server and he said what was served was all the food for the evening. We were all aghast. The food was great but there was not near enough food and the majority of the group was hungry and upset over spending $45 on food ($95 total so $45 show and $45 dinner). You can get WAY more food for $45 just by going upstairs and ordering separately. I ask you, please in the future, there needs to be double the amount of food or people need to be able to order what they want.

Second problem, the show. The show actually had a lot of great parts to it. Overall it was a lot of fun and had some really great music! Do you know where I could buy the sheet music for it? There's actually a song I'd like to learn.

I understand the reason y'all did what y'all did, I get it. The easy props, the easy costumes, the number of actors-- I get it, y'all are trying to keep costs down. While your strategy makes sense it definitely had some drawbacks.

Props/costumes- props and costumes were actually great. I think you somehow could've been more obvious which character is who, but no real complaints here.

Number of actors- the actors y'all found did a wonderful job of performing, kudos to them! However, due to the number of actors compared to characters (not to mention the character's complicated relationships) it was hard to follow/unclear at times who was who and what was happening. In the future I'd suggest adding one or two more actors to the roster to make it less costumes for the audience members to follow.

Last problem, the sound. As an audio engineer myself, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the sound quality (small space and singers with big voices helped) praise be there was no feedback.

I do think the audio engineer could've done a better job at mixing the audio for the audience. There were definitely times I couldn't hear the actors fully and just gave up trying to hear what they were saying.

That's the voices, the band audio was much worse.. y'all had this awesome fiddle player and I could hardly hear her... when you're gonna play Texas music and have fiddle in the band, you've actually got to hear the fiddle in the band!! Overall I could've used more band sound as a general note but not hearing the fiddle was the most disappointing part.

I would rate the experience like this:

Show: 6.5/10

Food: 4/10

**Overall:** 5/10

Summary: At this time a show not worth it's price tag. A good idea that fell short of the expectations it presented.

Went down, and the whole place had water. During this whole interaction, squatters were filming us. 

We couldn‚Äôt figure out the source of the leak and after 30 minutes, our plumber came. He inspected the entire unit. No sign of leaking. He even saw open dry walls to check. At the end, he asked to see the boiler room. It was an insane amount of water but there was nothing leaking. He also noticed that the locked door has sign of forced entry and the valve (way above ground) was touched. (This plumber was the one that installed the boiler a year ago.)

At the same time, the squatters kept saying that the antiques and merchandises were ruined (they sell used shoes) and needed our flood insurance. Since we have attorney, we asked them to contact our legal representative. 

The plumber said that someone deliberately opened the valve to create the flood and we should install cameras.

There‚Äôs a woman in my neighbourhood who is obviously on drugs and will con people into giving her money by claiming she has ‚Äúblood running down her leg,‚Äù which seems to happen every day, and she tries to chase after people when they walk or run away. Then there‚Äôs that guy on the L and G train always announced his presence by ‚Äúcan someone please give me (insert exact amount of change) fucking cents‚Äù in a really aggressive tone, and then will curse and rant when nobody gives him money. Something needs to be done about these people because they are borderlining on serious criminal activity.",nyc,Homeless people on the subway

The apparently unprovoked attack happened around 9:10 a.m. Wednesday on a R and Q train platform.

Fortunately, the victim was not struck by a train. He was helped to safety and brought to Bellevue Hospital with a cut to his hand.

Subway riders CBS2‚Äôs John Dias spoke with said they were concerned.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs horrible. Why [do] people do stupid things?‚Äù one woman said.

‚ÄúPeople just have to be aware in the world we‚Äôre living in today. You see people standing next to the tracks with their phones,‚Äù said Jozie Rowell, of Harlem. ‚ÄúYou have to be aware, put your phone away sometime and watch your back.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt stand next to the platform. I stand a bit farther back,‚Äù Nash Benaim, of Midwood, said.

Investigators said they‚Äôre searching for a man wearing a Chicago Bulls sweater and black hat.

I just saw ***yet another*** delivery bike ignore all common sense (and basic traffic rules) and crash head on into a crowd of pedestrians trying to cross the street at Astor Pl.

Yet somehow this guy decides to SPEED UP, crash into a handful of people as they are stepping into the street, and still has the audacity to scream at them to ""figure out where they are going."" Another friend of mine recently had to go to the ER because a delivery bike was doing 20 mph down a one-way street *in the wrong direction* and she didn't see him in time before they collided.

I just don't get it. We all have places to go. I realize delivery drivers have insane pressure to deliver on time, but there is literally nothing to gain from purposefully lunging yourself into a crowd of people when your light is red. Just fucking wait or go around.

# When and How to Wash Your Hands

**Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Learn when and how you should wash your hands to stay healthy.**  


#### Wash Your Hands Often to Stay Healthy

You can help yourself and your loved ones stay healthy by washing your hands often, especially during these key times when you are likely to get and spread germs:

* **Before, during,** and **after** preparing food
* **Before** eating food
* **Before** and **after** caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea
* **Before** and **after** treating a cut or wound
* **After** using the toilet
* **After** [changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/diapering/index.html)
* **After** blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
* **After** touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste
* **After** handling pet food or pet treats
* **After** touching garbage  


#### Follow Five Steps to Wash Your Hands the Right Way

Washing your hands is easy, and it‚Äôs one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community‚Äîfrom your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals.

Follow these five steps every time.

1. **Wet** your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
2. **Lather** your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
3. **Scrub** your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù song from beginning to end twice.
4. **Rinse** your hands well under clean, running water.
5. **Dry** your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.

[**Why? Read the science behind the recommendations.**](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-handwashing.html)  


**Use Hand Sanitizer When You Can‚Äôt Use Soap and Water**  


Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations.¬†If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based [hand sanitizer](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html)¬†that contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol by looking at the product label.

**Sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of germs on hands in many situations. However,**

* Sanitizers do **not** get rid of all types of germs.
* Hand sanitizers may not be as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy.
* Hand sanitizers might not remove harmful chemicals from hands like pesticides and heavy metals.  


#### How to use hand sanitizer

* Apply the gel product to the palm of one hand (read the label to learn the correct amount).
* Rub your hands together.
* Rub the gel over all the surfaces of your hands and fingers until your hands are dry. This should take around 20 seconds.

 Broadway‚Äôs *The Inheritance* will close next month after struggling at the box office.

Matthew Lopez‚Äôs two-part drama, which takes inspiration from E.M. Forster‚Äôs *Howards End*, began previews at the Ethel Barrymore Theater this past September. Though it received positive reviews, the modern 21st century tale ‚Äì which revolves around a handful of gay men in Manhattan ‚Äì did not sell as well as producers would have hoped. During the week ending February 16, the two-part show only pulled in $345,984, which is just 30% of its $1.1 million potential. It only managed to hit a high of $738,918 in early November before opening on November 17.

Producers Tom Kirdahy, Sonia Friedman Productions, and Hunter Arnold announced that the musical will officially close on Sunday, March 15. In a statment, the producers noted that audiences have been ‚Äúprofoundly moved‚Äù by the play ever since[(read more.....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/02/the-inheritance-to-close-broadway/)",nyc,‚ÄòThe Inheritance‚Äô To Close Broadway Curtain Following Slow Sales

4839,covid19throwthrow,1582912106,fayko1,Nan,"Hello,

Just giving a heads up to what I and my doctor both considered a very fucked situation. I just spent a week in Japan, a country at high risk for COVID-19. I wore a mask and essentially tried to stay away from most touristy places (not my first time there), but trains and stations are still packed with people, so there's really not much you can do.

On arriving back to America (3 days ago), I developed a 102F fever, coughing, and aches. I went to a local hospital in Brooklyn's ER. I informed them of my travel, they provided me a mask, and redirected me to a private room and followed infection protocols (full face covers, gloves, aprons, etc.). I had a chest x-ray and testing for flu/cold/pneumonia/and about 25 other viruses. They all came back negative.

At this point, the hospital called the CDC requesting permission to perform the COVID-19 testing. The CDC denied the request on the ground that I did not have the most life-threatening symptoms: chest pain and shortness of breath. According to everything I read it's very likely not to have these symptoms if you're in your 30's and relatively healthy.

And... that was that. They discharged me, said I don't have Corona virus, since they didn't test me for it, and said I can ride the subway, return to work, do whatever I want. 

Of course my doctor disagreed. She said I should treat myself as if I am infected. My partner is currently staying in a nearby hotel since we live in a studio apartment. I've performed a self-quarantine for 14 days. Fortunately I can work from home and my partner can deliver me groceries if I run out.

But I don't think that many people are aware of the fact that they're actively not testing people for COVID-19, even people who have travel history to high-risk places.",nyc,My COVID-19 Story. Brooklyn.

Section 7-103 entitles a renter to receive interest on their security deposit. It also entitles the landowner to take 1% of the deposit as ""administrative fees"". I think it's pretty ridiculous that they didn't make that % dependent on actual interest rates, because presently interest rates are \*much\* lower than 1% so you're actually losing money when the landlord holds your deposit.

Also, for those unaware, your landlord is required by law to give you written documentation stating where your money was deposited.

Shit is getting real. California has two victims of unknown origin meaning local spread has been ongoing for some time. You should be worried as people fly from CA to NY all the time. I honestly think there should be domestic flight temperature checks between cities but I doubt bureaucracy is gonna make this a thing. To be honest, I think the virus is already here in NY (common sense).

Here's what I am doing to reduce the risk of getting infected or bringing it into my home (aside from wearing N95 masks when you're in a public space).

1. Carry mini hand sanitizer. Use it after touching public surfaces (ATM machines, payment gates, subway poles, etc.). Use it before eating. Use it before entering using car/home keys and entering home.

2. Take off your jacket and shoes in a specific area. Wash my hands with antibacterial soap and also wipe faucet handles/surfaces.

3. Spray jacket and shoes (especially the bottom since people spit on sidewalks) with Lysol. (UPDATE: somebody said it's better to wipe because sprays can aerosolize viruses, not sure if true but it's up to you to decide. If using sprays, don't spray on object directly. Spray above and let it land). Let it sit for 15 minutes before touching.

4. Use wipes to clean my smartphone, house/car keys, wallet, and my hands again.

5. When receiving Amazon packages, Spray all six sides of the box with Lysol and leave it near the door for 15 minutes. (AGAIN: somebody said it's better to wipe because sprays can aerosolize viruses, not sure if true but it's up to you to decide. If using sprays, don't spray on object directly. Spray above and let it land).

6. Bring wipes with you to wipe surfaces clean before using (desks, restaurants tables, toilet seats, etc.)

7. Bring your own water bottle (large one preferred so you don't have to refill in public spaces) and reusable metal straws if you plan on eating out.

8. Clean your hands with wipes or hand sanitizer before using your phone. It doesn't have to be every hour or anything like that. Just after you were in public space like a restroom or subway.

9. If dealing with cash, make sure you use wipes on the cash. Try not to use cash. There's a reason why China started burning their paper money. Virus lingers on surfaces for up to 9 days.

10. Stock up on antibacterial soap, alcohol wipes, Clorox bleach, and Lysol.

11. This might be a bit too much, but for maximum safety, you might have to Lysol your clothes before coming back into your home. That's what doctors are doing in China right now.",nyc,New Yorkers Be Prepared for incoming NCOV-19 - HERE'S THE PROTOCOL to Decrease RISK of Infection

I'm an software engineer living in Tokyo. Another engineer created a covid-19 tracker and I've pitched in some small additions. Seeing the numbers and knowing the population density here is really comforting.

[https://covid19japan.com/](https://covid19japan.com/)

I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/fayko1/my_covid19_story_brooklyn/) and thought I would shed some light on what it's like and the probability ( *not a statistician, so if you are please feel free to post corrections or amendments  )*.

Anyway, at the moment, *it would be quite hard*  to run into someone with the virus with respect to the population. There is concern that people aren't being tested enough here,  but there are only **45** confirmed cases in Tokyo and **70** in Hokkaido (**242**  cases in a country of 126 million). Since u/covid19throwthrow traveled here sometime before today, the confirmed cases would have been even lower at that  point.

In contrast, South Korea is reporting 3,000+ cases.

Not to downplay the reported symptoms, because it's possible that they were really unlucky; however only *0.00000192063%*  of the population currently has the virus. I'm not a statistician, but I  believe the odds of being struck by lightning and getting the virus, *currently*, are nearly the same (1 / 700,000) or *0.00000142857%*.

If the u/covid19throwthrow can confirm they contracted the virus, I would love an update on the original post. 

I hope this calms any fears of a potential outbreak in Brooklyn or fear of people traveling from Japan ( *soon to be me* ).",nyc,Chances of getting corona virus in Japan

As I was walking to work, I was accosted by an immigrant in his SUV with his family, what seemed like his wife and two teenage kids.  The vehicle sported FL plates. The man started talking to me from his vehicle.  He sobbed a bit and said he has no money for gas, offering his two gold rings for cash.

His wife donned some kind of religious clothing.  He had a noticeable accent. It seemed like they were lost, desperate to get home. I didn't have more than $5 in my pocket. I thought about the kids sitting in the back. So, I asked him to follow me to the bank a few miles away, and withdrew some money just so he could get home safely.  He kept offering his gold ring even while I asked for his contact info.  He said he didn't have email and wrote down his phone number.

I wished him luck and drove back to work.  A few days later, I tried calling Mr.  Ringman.  You wont believe this but no answers when I call!  It's like he drove to Disney Land.  I'm afraid to report his plates to the police because Child Welfare might get involved.  Has this ever happened to anyone?

I know how the subways are.  I see people scrounging for aluminum cans in the street.  I never thought a guy with his family in an SUV would panhandle. It looks like there are all kinds of beggars in NYC.

Some observations

- Parking was crazy busy

- They were not wiping shipping cart handle bars as suggested in the other thread

- I did not find any items completely sold out

- Typical New Yorkers rushing to get their stuff. No panic

- I talked to some of the good workers. Aside from getting more free samples I got some insights. Most said that this Saturday and Sunday were especially busy. One worker estimated that Saturday saw 60% more traffic. Another worker said he noticed people buying a lot more cleaning supplies. Said that Saturday there were people waiting in line to get carts which was abnormal. Costco still has the best clan chowder I know

- Everything is orderly. No one pushing or yelling

- Some people were obviously preparing. Carts were loaded to the brim

- Only saw two people with masks

Riding the Lex uptown over the weekend, and at the gym a few times, I noticed people from Beth Israel, Bellevue, NYU Langone, Weill Cornell, and Mount Sinai, all going to/from work in their scrubs. Apparently it's on them to bring scrubs to and from, and wash them themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

WTF? Wearing their scrubs to and from, and washing the scrubs themselves, means: a) they're exposing immunocompromised patients to whatever they picked up on the way into work; b) they're trekking whatever pathogens were in the hospital out into the world at large; c) there are no standards by which all that clothing is being cleaned, and it's probably happening in public laundromats more often than not.

&amp;#x200B;

So really, wtf? Why aren't hospitals providing scrubs across the board? It keep pathogens out of the hospital and getting already sick people even sicker. It helps contain whatever is around the hospital, in the hospital. And it ensures that everything \[is cleaned to some uniform (no pun intended) standard.\]([https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(11)01011-X/abstract](https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(11)01011-X/abstract))

5186,s3co2,1583216049,fcqe7i,Nan,"It took a global health crisis for the MTA to step up its cleaning of the subway.

Workers will use bleach and hospital-grade disinfectant to aggressively sanitize the agency‚Äôs entire fleet of 6,400 subway cars and 5,700 buses to prevent the spread of coronavirus, transit officials announced Monday.

Every one of the agency‚Äôs train cars and buses will be disinfected every three days, and every subway station will be scrubbed on a nightly basis until the virus is contained, officials said.

The scrub strategy comes a day after New York health officials confirmed the state‚Äôs first case of the disease, which has infected more than 88,000 and killed more than 3,000 people across the globe. The vast majority of cases have been recorded in China.

Metropolitan Transportation Authority crews clean the bulk of the agency‚Äôs train cars and buses every day ‚Äî but they‚Äôre rarely given a full-fledged dousing in disinfectant.

Subway stations are cleaned less often, and the MTA has over the last year relied on outside contractors to ‚Äúdeep clean‚Äù more than 100 subway stations and 3,000 train cars, a move that nearly sparked a union picket by Transport Workers Union Local 100.

The MTA‚Äôs in-house mobile wash unit already uses bleach for sporadic scrubs of stations.

Transit officials are working to redeploy the outside contractors and internal wash crews so they‚Äôre able to meet their ambitious cleaning goals.

[More New York] Man, 48, fatally stabbed in Upper West Side domestic quarrel: cops ¬ª
‚ÄúIf MTA officials and the authority‚Äôs chief hatchet man are still thinking about laying off transit workers, they need to have their heads examined,"" said Local 100 president Tony Utano, referencing transit officials‚Äô plans to cut 2,700 jobs this year.

The scaled-up efforts hope to limit the spread of coronavirus among 8 million daily subway and bus riders, and the work might change the smell of buses, trains and stations, Gov. Cuomo said during a briefing Monday morning.

‚ÄúIf people smell ‚Äî it smells like bleach ‚Äî when you get on a bus or when a child goes to school, it‚Äôs not bad cologne or perfume,‚Äù the governor said.

Commutes will actually smell more like lemons, as transit crews will use ‚Äúlemon-quat‚Äù disinfectant cleaner, an ammonium chloride solution typically used in medical facilities and nursing homes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has cautioned that a person can contract the virus ‚Äî formally called COVID-19 ‚Äî by ‚Äútouching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.""

The CDC says the disease is most easily contracted through close contact with an infected person, something that‚Äôs hard to avoid on the MTA‚Äôs packed rush hour subways and buses.

MTA chairman Pat Foye said last week that transit officials hold daily briefings with CDC officials on coronavirus. The agency will also roll out public service announcements at subway stations to promote good hygiene practices to stave the spread.

Don't believe that masks won't help -- standard surgical masks are not very effective, but the N-95 masks are made for this. I wouldn't be in a subway without one or even a gas mask. If you have to go to work, take an Uber -- ride solo. If you can't afford that you need to call off.

According to Bruce Aylward: ""I think people aren‚Äôt paying close enough attention. The majority of the response in China, in 30 provinces, was about case finding, contact tracing, and suspension of public gatherings ‚Äî all common measures used anywhere in the world to manage \[the spread of\] diseases.""

Because of the nature of exponential growth, the sooner these social distancing measures are implemented, the more effective they will be, and the fewer additional measures we will need to resort to. This will free up healthcare resources that will allow us to properly treat people who do have the illness and keep the morbidity and mortality rate of the illness lower. 

Cleaning public transit more frequently is a good idea but it is very unlikely to significantly slow the spread of infection. The CDC points out that [most spread is from direct respiratory contact](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html) \- for example, being nearby someone infected with coronavirus who is [breathing into the same air as you are](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1081).

We have unfortunately confirmed that our student has tested positive for COVID-19 and our thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family as well as to all those affected.

We are taking every precaution by canceling all classes on the Wilf Campus in Washington Heights for Wednesday March 4, 2020. This includes all in-person graduate courses on that campus as well as at the boys‚Äô high school.

This precautionary step will allow us to work with city agencies and other professionals to best prepare our campus and ensure the uncompromised safety of our students, faculty and staff.

All classes and operations at our other campuses continue as normal.

What this means for students on the Wilf Campus:
‚Ä¢ Dormitories and food services will remain open for students who stay on campus
‚Ä¢ Office of Student Life and Residence Life are available to help if students have concerns or need additional support
‚Ä¢ Students who have been quarantined or in self quarantine will be monitored by our health center along with guidance from city agencies, and we will provide them with food
‚Ä¢ Midterms will be postponed for the day
‚Ä¢ Our Counseling Center is available for students who would like additional support

For faculty and staff on the Wilf campus:
‚Ä¢ All essential staff should report to work, while non-essential staff may work remotely. Please let your supervisors know your plans.
‚Ä¢ Please communicate with your students regarding any midterm exams for this week.

As new information emerges, the YU administration and faculty will share it with you. We have every expectation that Wilf will reopen tomorrow. In the meantime, we have been working to set up remote access for classes and administrative work.

Seriously.

So, uh, hiyas from Victoria, BC, Canada! I've been working on this for about ~~five~~ eight hours ~~today~~ yesterday (but I've been following Covid-19 closely since mid January). I went through the profile of reactive responses already: panic, denial, anger, acceptance, etc. 

Yet this has been on my mind for a while, because I suspected I was capable of drafting something truly useful. This post has already gone through one live [trial test run in Seattle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/fd595k/psa_a_note_of_caution_regarding_covid19/) (we're neighbors and they're experiencing an outbreak).

Anyway, in the spirit of cooperation, I thought you might find this useful too. Please feel free to share this post without attribution to me. I mean that. I am not an expert, rather a volunteer with a particular communication skillset. I did this in my spare time because this thing is creeping closer and closer to my hometown every day, and I figured we're all in this together, so why the hell not. I mean, how often do any of us *truly* get to contribute?

Lastly, feel free to constructively suggest changes. But if you're going to be a jerk about it, I'm just going to block and ignore you. I simply don't have time for that.

You ready? Because this is going to suck a little bit.

The other day the WHO [said the following:](https://mobile.twitter.com/WHO/status/1234872254883909642) ""Globally, about 3.4% of reported #COVID19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected."" 

In addition, a recent in-depth [scientific study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious Covid-19 is.

In other words, this is not a drill, people. Y'all wanted a reason to pay attention, well here it is.

The bad news: unfortunately the spread of the virus has not halted, therefore this beast is well and truly upon your doorstep. That means there is silent human-to-human transmission in your community. 

The good news: knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching? Yeah, *that*). Using science, we discovered the modern practice of the vaccine, which in turn led to discoveries like penicillin. 

And so, a hundred years later, here we are again. The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried in a ton of noise.

And so here we are. Just the critical info incoming.

Now before we continue, unless stated otherwise, all facts below are sourced from the [recent WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), which I encourage everyone to read.

Gird yourself, because this isn't going to be easy to hear. In fact, some of this will be downright jarring. That's good. You need to hear jarring now.

#**Critical to know:**

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people from of all ages will require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source2 ](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of Covid-19, **the danger is not the mortality rate but overwhelming the health infrastructure**, which in turn causes unnecessary death. You paying attention here? Because what you just read is deadly serious. You could die at this spot here. Focus.

* In the USA there are only 2.77 beds for every 1000 people, and 2.58 in Canada. [Check where your country ranks here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds). Why is this important? In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it).

* Because it's still flu season, hospitals are already busy with flu patients. This means it's extra important for the next month or so that we do our part to avoid spreading the new virus.

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for at least another year, if not more.

* Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease and 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure).

#**Psychology**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). 

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) is real and you must therefore be careful who you pay attention to. You will hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to get too concerned about."" These sorts of people have either not been paying attention or could be in denial, a natural reaction to a looming threat. 

* It is better to overreact than to be in denial, as the former gets you prepared while the latter puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial will not take precautions, and they may take foolish risks, such as attend events with large crowds in the middle of an active global outbreak that is showing [no signs of slowing](https://i.imgur.com/GM2gQJQ.png).

* Remember that people in authority are human and can be susceptible to denial. For the sake of everyone, [we must take the risk of scaring people](https://virologydownunder.com/past-time-to-tell-the-public-it-will-probably-go-pandemic-and-we-should-all-prepare-now/).

* [Here is a short Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. Read it. Seriously, it's *really* good.

* Now is *not* the time to listen to denial. Now is the time to listen to caution.

#**Preventative measures**

* Practice social distancing

* Do not touch your face

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). Carry disinfectant with you.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places. 

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). Especially stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, touch things in public with your knuckle, do not shake hands.

* Pass along facts to your colleagues and family while avoiding alarmism (feel free to share this post). 

* Consider pressing your boss to work from home. Many transmissions happen at work.

* If you have extra face masks, please consider donating them to senior care facilities and hospitals, as there is a global shortage and they will desperately need them in the coming months.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine.

* Always remember the top three: Disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**Typical symptoms:**

People with COVID-19 generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days).

Fever (87.9%)

Dry cough (67.7%)

Fatigue (38.1%)

Sputum production (33.4%) (a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract)

Shortness of breath (18.6%)

Sore throat (13.9%)

Headache (13.6%)

Joint pain (14.8%)

Chills (11.4%)

Nausea or vomiting (5.0%)

Nasal congestion (4.8%)

Diarrhea (3.7%)

Hemoptysis (0.9%) (coughing up of blood or blood-stained mucus from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs)

Conjunctival congestion (0.8%) 

[Here is what those symptoms look like on a visual timeline.](https://i.imgur.com/6BSEg6n.jpg). Update: [A better, newer graph](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452-f1).

#**Comorbidities**

Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include people aged over 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer. Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%)

#**Mortality rate:**

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0 as of now
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | 3.6%
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | 8.0%
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | 14.8%

* COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed.. COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences, and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the pangolin ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)).

**For countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks of COVID-19:**

1. Immediately activate the highest level of national Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures.

2. Prioritize active, exhaustive case finding and immediate testing and isolation, painstaking contact tracing and rigorous quarantine of close contacts.

3. Fully educate the general public on the seriousness of COVID-19 and their role in preventing its spread.

4. Immediately expand surveillance to detect COVID-19 transmission chains, by testing all patients with atypical pneumonias, conducting screening in some patients with upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent COVID-19 exposure, and adding testing for the COVID-19 virus to existing surveillance systems (e.g. systems for influenza-like-illness and SARS).

5. Conduct multi-sector scenario planning and simulations for the deployment of even more stringent measures to interrupt transmission chains as needed (e.g. the suspension of large-scale gatherings and the closure of schools and workplaces).

Taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.  During a black swan event, knowledge is power. Arm yourself by [reading the full WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).

&gt;‚ÄúThe masks are the biggest seller. I tell them, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt get caught without one! This corona nonsense got them crazy!‚Äù Sam Hopkins told The Post at Main Street and 41st Avenue in Flushing.  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúFive dollars for the hand sanitizer!‚Äù he bellowed about the 8-ounce bottles.  
&gt;  
&gt;Packs of 50 alcohol wipes were going for $5 each, while canisters of 35 Lysol wipes fetched $4 apiece.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also selling fast were 12-ounce bottles of alcohol for $3.

&gt;  
&gt;The buyers, who did not want to be interviewed, plunked down cash to buy the items in bulk.  
&gt;  
&gt;Masks were a hot commodity, with boxes of 50 going for a whopping $70 each before running out. Boxes of 20 masks sold for $50 each.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the surgical masks. These are just the regular ones,‚Äù the supplier said.

They replied with a very formatted response that boiled down to ""come to the office unless otherwise told"".  When i asked in person they proudly announced  they put out purell stations to stop the virus so i didnt need to worry. Ok. Sure. 
We have the ability to work from home and are expected to bring our laptops home every night. ""Just incase"".  Now that the cases are starting to pick up, a coworker of mine reached out stating they would be WFH due to concerns over their own health. They almost recieved a word for word response from HR as mine, stating they were expected in until further notice. Its almost negelegance to force workers to commute who have the means to stay home come to work.  Wouldnt it be more proactive to tell people to wfh instead of potentially adding to the spread? Personally for me, im worried this corporate mandate might prove fatal. Maybe im over reacting, this just doesnt seem like something to mess around with.",nyc,HR says purell stations are enough to stop covid. Rant

The way it got in contact with people is with money. The virus soon was getting to big and the government set up a place known as the dark zone. This is the place where quarantine first started and where most would go. These factions started to rise to power and would start doing things. Like recruiting and claiming parts of the city.


The government brought in the national guard to help police retake back the city and to stop mass panic.  They couldn‚Äôt stop the riots and things. They then called in the first wave of division agents to help control the city and figure out a cure for the virus. The government soon realizes that they can‚Äôt stop the virus as it was getting too big and they couldn‚Äôt stop the virus. 


The Government pulled outta the dark zone and ended up leaving the first wave of division agents and 1000s of citizens. They left them to die the first wave of division agents were either killed by the virus or were killed by the factions of people. Some of the agents went rogue and gave up on the mission and now were trying to get back at the government. The second wave of division agents were sent it to find out what happened to the first wave of division agents. Almost all of them end up dying in explosion planned by the rogue agents. Just the player and a couple others were alive. This was also set in NYC if anyone was wondering",nyc,Do you guys think something like the Division could happen?

I walk past two people doing some kind of drug and push open the restroom door. Lo and behold, there's a woman taking a massive shit. She's facing me and squatting and clenching her teeth.

Our plan is to arrive Monday night and drop our people off at about 11pm and then just head to hotel to sleep for the night. Tuesday we want to grab brunch and dinner somewhere and also go to some popular coffee shops. The one other thing we really want to do is check out the Vessel structure. Besides that we are looking for other things to do and I thought about asking on here.

We've been to your city several times before, so we don't want to do all the crazy touristy things. We've been to Times Square, Brooklyn Bridge, One World Observatory Deck, etc. Looking for something that's a cool experience, but more on the lowkey side. I remember seeing some pictures of like a museum with a room full of these like turquoise-colored ball. It was basically a massive ball pit from what I remember. Is that something worth checking out?

As far as food goes, budget would be about $20 per meal, $30 max. Open to any kind of cuisine.

And for coffee shops, we've been to Project Coffee NYC every time we went, really love the experience there. Looking for something different this time. I know there are several unique places all over this city and open to suggestions. Would prefer a place to be more newer/modern. Something that'd basically look cool on Instagram is what I'm trying to get at I guess. Overall just a nice, chill, relaxed coffee shop experience.

Then Wednesday were just planning to go to Sojo for the day and go home afterwards.

I hope I included enough information for you guys to help out. If there is anything I'm missing or something I could add that'd help, please let me know.

Thank you, r/NYC!",nyc,Looking for help planning trip to NYC next week

I have a few friends from online but no one really to spend the day with as most of my online friends that live in NYC are either at work or in school so they'll be spending their day with that and the only time I can spend with them is going to be the weekend. Therefore I will be travelling alone for the most part around NYC. Last bit is regarding the coronavirus itself, personally I'm not scared by it at all. It's just another version of the flu and most of us will be able to recover anyways on our own so I'm not all too worried. But I still wanted to ask a couple questions related to it and the environment around NYC.

The places I've been recommended to go to so far:  [https://pastebin.com/yth59XLw](https://pastebin.com/yth59XLw) 

**THE QUESTIONS**:  
1. What are some places that ARE NOT on the list already that you'd recommend that I go to? 

2. What's should I do about the me being alone situation? I'm not scared of being alone but I feel like being alone and not having anyone to enjoy experiences with, let alone for example have someone to take a picture of me at x place might ruin the trip and make things get very boring quickly. Is their a way to connect with other people just visiting or is anyone here wanting to do some NYC exploring with me? Any help is appreciated with this cause I'm really not sure what to do. 

3. What are some good safety measures to try and prevent coronavirus? I got the flu vaccine and bought myself some wet wipes to keep with me in my backpack when walking around but is that enough or should I walk around with latex gloves on always?

4. What are the best ways other than train/walking to get around the city?

5. Is pick pocketing something that is quite common in NYC and should I be on the look out for that?

6. In general, what are some things about NYC or the people or the culture that I should know before hand just for the sake of my trip and to have a better experience? Example like certain do's or don'ts, places to avoid, people to avoid, terms to say/avoid, etc. 

7. Any other tips/tricks to help me have a good week in NYC would be extremely appreciated!

Today, I was verbally assaulted by a fellow Asian man (I am Chinese-American) for talking to my boyfriend in close proximity to him, and spreading my ‚Äúwater germs‚Äù to him because I could have Coronavirus and infect him. He spoke to me in Cantonese, telling me to shut the fuck up because I was spreading my spit everywhere and would make him sick. He was trying to tell me to stop speaking in his direction and my boyfriend quickly jumped to my defense. Soon, the situation escalated and the man started accusing him of being Italian (he‚Äôs Pakistani). While it is true that simply talking could possibly spread respiratory droplets, I was not displaying any symptoms whatsoever and not even facing him. I was trying to tell my boyfriend to stop and just ignore him, but he was just getting super heated and didn‚Äôt listen. 

The Asian man left to go sit on another part of the train and another man began defending the two of us. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt record anything at the time because I was so overwhelmed with what was going on but I wish I had. 

As a brief reiteration of what the random man said, saying things like that to Asians or anyone for that matter is UNACCEPTABLE. Believing that an illness is racially exclusive or living under the assumption that everyone around you has Coronavirus is wrong. Protecting yourself and practicing safe hygiene does not equate to villainizing everyone simply out of fear. 

Lastly, to that man who took the time to speak up for a measly 17 year old girl, thank you. You got off the train at Church Ave and I believe you were wearing gray. Maybe you‚Äôll see this.

By Olivia Bensimon  New York Post | March 6, 2020 | 5:12pm

A man was slashed in the face after getting into an argument with a fellow Bronx bus rider who believed he was talking about him in another language, surveillance video released by cops on Friday shows.

The 20-year-old victim was sitting in the back of a northbound Q44 MTA bus in Unionport on Feb. 23 at about 5 a.m. when he got into an argument with another man, police said.

The man grew angry, believing the 20-year-old was talking about him to other passengers on the bus, according to cops.

Footage released by cops shows the moment the man gets up and pulls out what looks like a box cutter and quickly slashes the 20-year-old in the face.

The slasher then walked off the bus at Brush Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard and running away, police said.

The victim was taken to Jacobi Medical Center to be treated for his a laceration to his left cheek, cops said,

**SEE IT: Man gets slashed in face after angry stranger fears victim was talking about him in foreign language: cops**

By MICHAEL SHERIDAN | NEW YORK DAILY NEWS | MAR 06, 2020 | 2:57 PM

An irate bus rider convinced another passenger was talking about him in a foreign language stood up and slashed the stranger in the face in front of other horrified commuters, cops said Friday.

The 20-year-old victim was on a northbound Q44 MTA bus when he got into a dispute around 5 a.m. with another man sitting at the back of the bus, authorities said.

The suspect apparently got angry when he believed the victim and another person were talking about him in another language, police told the Daily News.

Surveillance video released by authorities on Friday captured the moment when the man suddenly stood up and approached the victim. The man is seen pulling something from his pocket as he advances on the victim, who was sitting a few feet away. In a flash, the attacker swings and slashes the man‚Äôs face with the object, which looks like a box cutter or knife, cops said.

The suspect then hopped off the bus at Brush Ave. and Bruckner Blvd. in Unionport and fled, police said. The victim suffered a laceration on his left cheek. He was treated at Jacobi Medical Center.

Police are looking for the suspect, who they described as about 30-35 years old with a beard and mustache, wearing a multi-colored hoodie, a black jacket and dark pants with red and white sneakers.

5723,MysteriousCartoonist,1583601251,fey2vj,COVID-19,"Long before the first confirmed cases here in NYC people have been avoiding Chinatown and claiming that it was a 'reasonable precaution' to take ([Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/f2vwyu/despite_zero_confirmed_coronavirus_cases_in_new/) \- one of several threads). No evidence provided other than vague claims about Chinatown having the ""highest concentration of Chinese in Manhattan"" and that many residents/employees ""were likely to have travelled to China"", but lots of dog-whistling about ""poor hygiene practices"" in Chinatown and the like. 

Many Chinatown residents/business owners have been in NYC for many generations and may very well not have any relatives left in China. Especially in Manhattan's Chinatown, where most immigration wasn't recent. People speak Cantonese by default, rather than Mandarin - quite indicative of the place of origin (hint: not Wuhan) and that they probably came here in earlier waves of immigration. Chinatown is a fairly low-income neighborhood - these aren't the people jet-hopping around the world on business trips. 

If anything, the places with the largest concentrations of people who most likely have travelled to China recently are universities like Columbia or NYU, with tons of rich international Chinese students returning from winter break. Have we heard anything about avoiding Morningside Heights or Noho/Washington Square Park?  

I'm not saying avoiding Chinatown is as bad as spewing racism at Asian people or some of the hate crimes reported so far. But let's not kid ourselves that the avoidance of Chinatown isn't a form of racial bias, or at least poorly-informed bias. It's not all that different from crossing the street to avoid an Asian man or not sitting next to an Asian woman on the subway. And yes, this includes Asian Americans claiming it was 'perfectly reasonable' to avoid Chinatown in particular (but not places chock-full of tourists and international travellers like Times Square, or transport hubs with thousands of people passing through?). 

Think about it - after the outbreak in Italy, did anyone think about 'avoiding Italian restaurants' or Little Italy? After all, aren't these the places where Italians are ""likely to congregate""? What about Koreatown? Before you say that Italian immigrants have probably been in NYC for a long time and probably haven't gone to Italy recently, what about Chinese immigrants in Chinatown? Did you stop to think or find out about the demographics or the history of Chinese immigration before just instinctively avoiding Chinatown? 

I get that we all have instincts of self-preservation and that no one is sitting down to think for 10 minutes before they decide which places to avoid. But they do reveal the kinds of subconscious biases we harbor and should maybe take a minute to reexamine.",nyc,"Out of 45 cases in the NYC area, none have been Chinatown residents as far as we know. Is it still ""quite reasonable"" to avoid Chinatown?"

The dialogue about the impeachment starts near the beginning. Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.

&gt; The Metropolitan Transportation Authority should first look to improve its fare-collection methodology on the Long Island Rail Road before looking to issue an increase.

&gt;
For the past several months, after using the Ronkonkoma and Port Jefferson lines into the Penn and Atlantic terminals, I see it‚Äôs losing revenue because conductors cannot collect all the train fares. The worst case is between the Atlantic terminal and Jamaica Station during rush hour. In a full train with standing room only, a conductor cannot effectively move within the train and check every passenger‚Äôs ticket.

&gt;
I‚Äôve also noticed on the double-decker cars that it‚Äôs easy for conductors to miss passengers moving between cars and especially those using a restroom. Although conductors can recognize regular commuters, all too often it is easy to overlook transient riders on full trains.

&gt;
It‚Äôs unfair to continue increasing fares for regular commuters because the LIRR‚Äôs collection methodology is inefficient and obsolete.
‚ÄÉ¬†

&gt;
I‚Äôve commuted for many years into Penn Station, and often have needed to use the subway and LIRR elevators. Possibly in the next several years East Side Access might finally open, and if it does it will have some very expensive new elevators. At Penn already, most if not all elevators are used nearly nonstop by junkies and the homeless as urinals. It‚Äôs so bad that you have to watch carefully where you step, and sometimes the smell is so horrible that no matter how hard, you have to take the stairs ‚Äî unless you can‚Äôt physically do that.

&gt;
What will the New York City Transit Authority and the Long Island Rail Road ‚Äî and MTA Police do about this? Most of Penn is overrun by the homeless, in the bathrooms and fast-food locations. A couple weeks ago, I tried to have a quick meal in the Amtrak area food court and I couldn‚Äôt find anywhere to sit that didn‚Äôt already have beggars and others all over you. Penn is pretty awful and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo‚Äôs plans have only made it worse, but this often makes it unbearable. And when I go to Grand Central, it‚Äôs no better.",nyc,LIRR needs to collect fares better

5775,MysteriousCartoonist,1583627774,ff4i1y,Nan,"Long before the first confirmed cases here in NYC people have been avoiding Chinatown and claiming that it was a 'reasonable precaution' to take ([Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/f2vwyu/despite_zero_confirmed_coronavirus_cases_in_new/) \- one of several threads). No evidence provided other than vague claims about Chinatown having the ""highest concentration of Chinese in Manhattan"" and that many residents/employees ""were likely to have travelled to China"", but lots of dog-whistling about ""poor hygiene practices"" in Chinatown and the like.

Many Chinatown residents/business owners have been in NYC for many generations and may very well not have any relatives left in China. Especially in Manhattan's Chinatown, where most immigration wasn't recent. People speak Cantonese by default, rather than Mandarin - quite indicative of the place of origin (hint: not Wuhan) and that they probably came here in earlier waves of immigration. Chinatown is a fairly low-income neighborhood - these aren't the people jet-hopping around the world on business trips. 

If anything, the places with the largest concentrations of people who most likely have travelled to China recently are universities like Columbia or NYU, with tons of rich international Chinese students returning from winter break. Have we heard anything about avoiding Morningside Heights or Noho/Washington Square Park? 

And look at the actual coronavirus cases that have been identified in NYC - none of them are Chinese or even Asian as far as we know, and none of them live or work in Chinatown. 

I'm not saying avoiding Chinatown is as bad as spewing racism at Asian people or some of the hate crimes reported so far. But let's not kid ourselves that the avoidance of Chinatown isn't a form of racial bias, or at least being poorly-informed and jumping to conclusions. It's not all that different from crossing the street to avoid an Asian man or not sitting next to an Asian woman on the subway. And yes, this includes Asian Americans claiming it was 'perfectly reasonable' to avoid Chinatown in particular (but not places chock-full of tourists and international travellers like Times Square, or transport hubs with thousands of people passing through?). A lot of people have said their Asian parents told them to avoid Chinatown, which I don't think is outright racist, but still really ill-informed. 

Think about it - after the outbreak in Italy, did anyone think about 'avoiding Italian restaurants' or Little Italy? After all, aren't these the places where Italians are ""likely to congregate""? What about Koreatown? Before you say that Italian immigrants have probably been in NYC for a long time and probably haven't gone to Italy recently, what about Chinese immigrants in Chinatown? Did you stop to think or find out about the demographics or the history of Chinese immigration before just instinctively avoiding Chinatown?

I get that we all have instincts of self-preservation and that no one is sitting down to think for 10 minutes before they decide which places to avoid. But they do reveal the kinds of subconscious biases we harbor and should maybe take a minute to think about.",nyc,Anti-Asian bias in avoiding Chinatown

In July 2019, New York passed The Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) of 2019, which capped the security deposit at 1-month rent at most. ([https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2019/10/fact-sheet-09.pdf](https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2019/10/fact-sheet-09.pdf)) When I emailed the link of the new law to the management company and asked whether there would be any change in the amount of security deposit if we renewed our lease this year, the agent refused to provide an answer by email and asked me to call him. (I assume he didn't want to leave an documentary evidence.) He denied the existence of the new law and told me that the security deposit would remain the same this year, which is clearly against the act. I have no idea how to deal with this.

### Cairo: City of 1000 Minarets, 3/9

Join Iman R. Abdulfattah, PhD Candidate in Islamic Art and Archaeology at Universit√§t Bonn, for a visual journey into the riches of the art and architecture of this important metropolis. When the Fatimid dynasty conquered Egypt in 969 AD, they founded a fortified palatine city to serve as their new administrative center. This new city, named al-Qahira ‚Äì meaning ‚ÄúThe Victorious‚Äù ‚Äì gave the present capital its name. Since the 10th century, Cairo has served as a major center of the Islamicate world and seat of several important dynasties, reaching its apogee under the Mamluks (1250-1516 AD), who gave it an architectural character that symbolized the image of the Islamic city for centuries. These empires also left behind a staggering number of impressive buildings meant to emphasize courtly patronage and dominate the panorama of the city, lending Cairo the nickname of the City of 1,000 Minarets. Today, more than 400 extant registered historic Islamic monuments survive tucked away amid the modern urban sprawl, many of which remain largely overshadowed by their more ancient counterparts.

### Arsenal Gallery Exhibition Opening: Alice Momm: The Gleaner's Song, 3/12

Join NYC Parks for the opening reception for our new exhibition Alice Momm: The Gleaner's Song in the Arsenal Gallery.
The Gleaner‚Äôs Song is a collection of mixed-media works, words, and photographs by artist Alice Momm, inspired by her daily, immersive walks in Central Park. The materials and impressions gathered on these rambles become the seeds of artworks that pay tribute to the ragged beauty of found objects in nature and honor the quiet dramas unfolding in unexpected places. While often humorous, the artworks reflect a deep concern for our environment and an appreciation of the interconnectedness of all living beings. This solo exhibition is Momm's love song to Central Park and an invitation to find wonder and joy in New York City‚Äôs parks.
This event is FREE and open to the public.
The exhibition is on display in the Arsenal Gallery on weekdays from March 13, 2020 through June 4, 2020. Please note that the Arsenal Gallery will be closed on Monday, May 25, 2020.

### Two Elizas in Old New York (1875): Eliza Greatorex Picturing Eliza Jumel‚Äôs Mansion With Professor Katherine Manthorne, 3/12

Join as Professor Katherine Manthorne explores the interconnected lives of two influential women from 19th Century New York, Eliza Jumel and  Eliza Pratt Greatorex.
Eliza Jumel, a self-made woman who used her intellect to become one of the richest women in New York, was Morris-Jumel Mansion‚Äôs longest living resident. Four years after Jumel‚Äôs death, Eliza Pratt Greatorex was one of  America‚Äôs most famous women artists and only female member of the National Academy of Design. Professor Manthorne‚Äôs illustrated presentation focuses on Pratt Greatorex‚Äôs folio volume Old New York: From the Battery to Bloomingdale (1875) in which the artist depicted the city‚Äôs threatened architectural landmarks during the post-Civil War building boom, including Morris-Jumel Mansion and its grounds. Enjoy this special preview of Manthorne‚Äôs forthcoming book, Restless Enterprise: The Art and Life of Eliza Pratt Greatorex, which will be published in January 2021.
Katherine Manthorne is a Professor of Art History at the Graduate Center, City University of New York, and a specialist in American art and culture with attention to the contribution of women. Soon to be published by the University of California Press in Jan. 2021, her book, Restless Enterprise: The Art and Life of Eliza Pratt Greatorex, brings back to life this feisty, remarkable figure and her extensive network of art women to shed light on the still-misunderstood visual culture of the post-Civil War years.

### Everyday Ecologies, 3/14

Everyday Ecologies is a full-day conference held on Saturday, March 14 at the Bernard and Anne Spitzer School of Architecture. Experts across the fields of design, urban ecology, and social science will be speaking to how we support and exist within ecosystems, and how we can investigate new approaches in the world of urban ecological systems.  
To instigate new approaches, we have invited designers, planners, historians, and social scientists to talk about everyday ecosystems: the boundless communities we are part of‚Äîa cocktail of cultures crossing economic and class strata with overlapping gender, racial, and spiritual identities‚Äîthat complement but also compete with each other and conflict internally for rights and means to perpetuate their cultural identities, social relations, and environmental resource needs and desires. Speakers will present the idea or theory that one of their projects is contested through design, planning, or projective research and analysis. Together, we aim to develop principles that will establish a foothold from which to launch new approaches and ideas for changing the complex world future generations will inherit.
Featuring: Thaisa Way, Tim Maly, Kate Orff, Heather McMillen, Elizabeth H√©naff, Lindsay Campbell, Kristina Hill, Justin Garrett Moore, Andrew Bauer, Liz Barry, Andrea Parker, Sean Weiss, Julia Czerniak, Maria Villalobos, Sierra Bainbridge, Joy Bailey Bryant, Erika Svendsen, Denise Hoffman Brandt

Whining about people violating quarantine and wondering how China was able to do it and hinting about deploying China-level tactics. What the fuck is this man doing? This is the worst way to do a press conference and does not provide any confidence to residents.

Of course New Yorkers will violate quarantine because it is called freedom and selfishness. It‚Äôs the responsibility of the state and city authorities to ensure quarantine is followed by immediately doing door checks and deploying status and city apparatus to keep a tab on the patients and not pin their hopes on goodwill that they won‚Äôt step out of their house. There is no easy way to do this. However, it is totally wrong to give a detailed status report on tv and then go full whiny on people violating quarantine and that cases will double. Does this guy know what executive leadership means?? This is a complete failure and the rising coronavirus cases is a direct result of unpreparedness in the state, especially NYC. 

They should have readied their resource in early January when China was going into quarantine. I still can‚Äôt wrap it around my head that Cuomo sat there and complained instead of inspiring confidence. If you want to enforce quarantine, then do it secretively without making it a breaking splash news deal.

Dear Redditors,

I'm a photographer working for a national newspaper and I'm in NYC. I'm working on a story about the outbreak in the city/tri-state area. It's not an opinion piece‚Äìit's a factual, news photo essay. 

I'm here  to ask if anyone has gathered a significant items in the case they are self quarantined/isolated at home? We know this is happening city wide, and I'm looking to photograph someone at home with their supplies.

Please email me (gilbertson@viiphoto.com) if you'd like to know more, and might be keen!

Yours,

Just got this email from the University President:

------

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I am writing this evening to notify everyone that, because a member of our community has been quarantined as a result of exposure to the Coronavirus (COVID-19), we have decided to suspend classes on Monday and Tuesday. This suspension of activities will allow us to prepare to shift to remote classes for the remainder of the week. I want to emphasize that the individual who has been quarantined has not been diagnosed at this point with the virus. 

Please understand that the decision to suspend classes does not mean that the University is shutting down. All non-classroom activities, including research, will continue in accordance with the new travel and events restrictions announced recently. At this point, just to restate what is important to know, we do not have a confirmed case of the virus on campus. This action is intended to prevent the virus from spreading. 

This message will soon be followed by more specific information from deans and other University leaders, including plans for remote instruction beginning Wednesday and continuing until the start of Spring Break on Friday. 

Let me say how much we appreciate the efforts of everyone who is helping us work our way through this challenging situation and your understanding and attention. As always, we are especially committed to providing updates as we have more information and recommendations. 

Sincerely,

A neighbor, whose daughter attended her local high school in Queens (and graduating second in her class), absolutely got destroyed in one of her SUNY colleges as an engineering major, and her confidence was never the same after that (dropping out of college) shortly joining the army after. Do the specialized high schools just do a better job of teaching better work ethic and focus than regular NYC high schools (and less distraction from cell phones)? I am assuming engineering disciplines need to be fully and developed properly at a younger stage, such as high school (where Stuyvesant and Bronx Science HS do a great job of teaching fundamental Math skills), and a weaker foundation in the math will lead to disaster in college if one attempts to pursue an engineering or Math major in college, from a weaker high school.",nyc,NYC EDUCATION SYSTEM

It wasn't until news of the Coronovirus that I started to see LEGIONS of the older Chinese population (Aged 50+) wearing those little cheap masks. I just got on the train this morning at a station right in the middle of Chinatown and literally every old Chinese person was wearing one of the masks. I felt really bad because I know it affects mostly older populations and I've read a while back in multiple sources that those little masks don't help at all. Im just really hoping they're all gonna be okay and everyone for that matter. 

Also makes me think about the homeless population in NYC and how they're going to deal with the virus. They're already an at risk population who won't be able to go to doctors, who's immune systems are already compromised, who won't be able to keep up with proper hygiene...

Dear Members of the Campus Community,

Effective 1 p.m. today (Monday, March 9), we are taking the significant step of suspending face-to-face instruction on all Fordham‚Äôs New York-area campuses. Face-to-face classes are suspended for the remainder of Monday, March 9, and Tuesday, March 10. (Existing online instruction will continue uninterrupted.) All residential students are encouraged to return home immediately. Beginning with the start of classes on Wednesday, March 11, faculty will teach their classes online or electronically. Over the coming days, the University will also curtail some on-campus operations and redirect specific personnel to work remotely rather than coming to campus.

Over the weekend, we learned of an undergraduate commuter student who exhibited symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. That student has been tested for the virus, and is self-isolating at home. We will inform the campus community immediately if we learn that the lab result is positive for the COVID-19 virus. If the student is in fact positive for the virus, following established protocols, the New York City Department of Health will work in concert with University Health Services to reach everyone with whom the student has been in contact, and University staff will also follow-up on this initial contact with each person.

We reported on March 6 that the parent of a prospective student fell ill in Duane Library. The parent was tested and found to be negative for the COVID-19 virus. We also had previously reported that there were two faculty members and three students who may have been exposed to COVID-19 off campus. Following the guidelines of the CDC, out of an abundance of caution they are self-isolating at home for 14 days, and the faculty are teaching their courses online. In all cases, we have been checking daily for any appearance of symptoms with students, faculty, and staff members who are self-isolating at home. As of this morning there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Fordham.

What does this mean?

* Face-to-face classes will not meet on campus, effective 1 p.m. today, March 9, until further notice. (Classes will resume online/electronically Wednesday through Friday, March 11 through 13.) Deans will be providing guidance to students from their school/college.  Each instructor will be communicating with their students how their specific class will proceed in an online environment.

* Spring break will run as scheduled from March 14 through 22 (except for the Graduate School of Education, the spring break for which is April 14-18).

* Students are advised to take what they need from their rooms before leaving campus for spring break, i.e.: all textbooks, notes, course materials, etc., with them, so that they can continue their coursework online without returning to campus after the break.

* After the break, classes will resume, in an online format, on Monday, March 23: during that week the University will evaluate, in consultation with public health authorities, whether conditions allow students to return to campus, and resume face-to-face instruction on March 30. The Office of the Provost has offered guidance to instructors regarding online instruction. Faculty Technology Services provides myriad support for online technologies.",nyc,Fordham University suspends classes after suspected undergraduate isolated

New York state is producing and distributing its own hand sanitizer free of charge amid reports of price gouging of the product on the market as the coronavirus outbreak spreads globally and across the U.S.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre introducing NYS clean hand sanitizer, made conveniently by the state of New York,‚Äù Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Monday. ‚ÄúThis is a superior product to products now on the market.‚Äù

Cuomo said the state‚Äôs product is 75 percent alcohol compared to name-brand competitor Purell, which is made of 70 percent alcohol. Health officials recommend using a hand sanitizer made of at least 60 percent alcohol. 

The New York product also has a ‚Äúvery nice floral bouquet‚Äù scent, Cuomo added. 

‚ÄúTo Purell, and Mr. Amazon and Mr. eBay, if you continue the price gouging, we will introduce our product, which is superior to your product,"" Cuomo said. ""And you don't even have the floral bouquet, so stop price gouging.‚Äù 

A spokesperson for eBay said the online retailer is ‚Äútaking significant measures to block or quickly remove items‚Äù that make ‚Äúfalse health claims‚Äù and ensure that sellers on the platform follow local laws and its policies.

Spokespeople for Amazon and Purell were not immediately available for comment. 

New York will distribute its product to government agencies, including schools, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and prisons. 

Cuomo said creating and distributing the product is cheaper for the state than purchasing competing brands. 

Cuomo announced 37 new confirmed cases of the virus in New York, bringing the total to 142 across the state. The hardest hit region is Westchester with 98 total cases, including 16 of the newly-announced cases. 

There are also 19 confirmed cases in New York City, 17 in Nassau County, four in Rockland County, two in Saratoga, one in Suffolk County and one in Ulster. 

Lawmakers have called out Amazon over reports of price gouging of hand sanitizer amid the coronavirus outbreak. Last week Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) questioned the online retailer over reports of up to 2,000 percent markups on some items. 

‚ÄúInternet-based retailers such as Amazon.com have a particular responsibility to guard against price gouging in current circumstances as consumers ‚Äî who are finding the shelves of local brick-and-mortar stores bare, and who may wish to avoid venturing into crowded stores and shopping malls ‚Äî turn to the internet,‚Äù Markey wrote in a letter to the company. 

In response, Amazon‚Äôs Vice President Brian Huseman wrote to Markey on Friday that price gouging will not be tolerated on Amazon. 

Huseman said Amazon removed more than 530,000 offers from its store over coronavirus-based price gouging, and suspended more than 2,5000 seller accounts in its U.S. store alone for violating price gouging policies, according to a letter dated March 6.

Aamar Alaahri, a married father of five sons, was stabbed eight times inside the Yasser Deli on Central Ave. near Madison St. in Bushwick on New Year‚Äôs Eve, police and his family said.

The attack appears to have been unprovoked, authorities said. Relatives of the victim said police told them the killer had been waiting outside for Alaahri for about 90 minutes and then stabbed him when he appeared in the store‚Äôs doorway.

‚ÄúHe just came in and started stabbing him,‚Äù said the victim‚Äôs daughter-in-law, who declined to give her name. ‚ÄúHe was waiting for the person he wants to stab.‚Äù

The victim‚Äôs widow, who also declined to be named, said her husband was ‚Äúsweet"" and ‚Äúkind.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want [the suspect] to go to jail and never come out,"" she said, speaking at the East New York home she shared with her late husband.

Alaahri was taken to Brookdale University Hospital in critical condition and died there on March 3 with his family at his side.

The suspect fled in an Acura SUV. On Jan. 3, Pablo Sierra, 44, was arrested for attempted murder, assault and weapons possession.

What's shocking is that if you dig deep into the comments section and open up the threads, you constantly hear Anti-Asian rhetoric from the Black community, some of them are sadly NYers. It is just disturbing. 

Common statements include things like:

""How do you feel now that you're suffering like African Americans?""

""That's what they get because they're racist to Blacks anyways.""

"" Well maybe now Asian folks will stop being racist towards black people and understand they will never be like whites.""

"" I remember when they discriminated against blacks for years now that this disease exists they see how it feels towards them.""

""It's what they get for eating rodents.""

This is getting infuriating and has to STOP. It's not just. I've seen these kinds of comments and worse in the comments section.

THIS IS GASLIGHTING and the worst kind of gaslighting: RACIST GASLIGHTING

Asian Americans are constantly victims of Black violence. 27.5% of victims have black perpetrators while of black crime victims only 0.1% of perpetrators are Asian according to the US Department of Justice. Most of the crimes are not charged as hate crimes. A lot of times we don't even get justice for crimes committed against us.

To say that Asians are automatically racist and we somehow deserve this treatment is just mind-blowing. Please, if you are Black and another Black person says these kinds of things, call them OUT. I do the same when I am around Asians and Whites who would say something racist against Blacks.

The worst part is that these kinds of comments seem to be so commonplace in channels like The Real that has a lot of Black viewership. These anti-Asian tropes are starting to become accepted as mainstream and truths in the Black community as well and this needs to STOP.",nyc,Disturbed by Black

Then we started having kids. 

For the past five years we‚Äôve added three human babies to our roster. As a result attention on our little buds has become more and more scarce.

For the past few years the signs of aging for both pups are becoming more and more apparent. Which is where I‚Äôm at now. Both dogs seem to have lost complete control of their pee and poop. Everyday this past week we‚Äôve cleaned up two urine puddles every hour and four or five piles of poop a day. This includes them having their five walks a day and going to the bathroom then as well. 

If it were just my wife, myself and the dogs it would be fine. But having a one year old, three year old and five year old complicates these things tremendously. And unfortunately the priority always ends with the children being number 1.

6187,developmentfiend,1583908497,fgsv3g,Good Read,"Tonight I did a deep dive I thought you all might find interesting. I was thinking about the impending apocalypse etc and went back to Spanish Flu. I think one of the more interesting things about the Spanish Flu is that it came in multiple waves, first mild (Feb-April) then severe (Sept-February). This got me thinking -- what is the confounding factor here that could explain this -- and my mind went to Vitamin D.

First Google found below paper --

ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800462/

Most relevant:

Our finding that the case fatality rate in Bergen during the summer of 1918 (although not significant) was only half the rates during the following 2 waves is in line with observations that pandemic summer waves in the Northern Hemisphere are usually mild, partly due to the protective effect of vitamin D induced by sunlight [25, 26]. Access to vitamin D from ultraviolet-B radiation during the summer months was actually negatively correlated with case fatality rates in a study of 10 of the 18 canvassed areas of the US household surveys conducted in 1918‚Äì1919. Furthermore, these rates depended on how far north they were located [27]. The demonstration that induction of previtamin D3 during the summer months was much higher in Boston, at 42¬∞N, than in Bergen, at 60¬∞N [28], could thus possibly explain why a pandemic summer wave in Baltimore, at 39¬∞N, might have been overlooked.

Despite the fact that the effect of sunshine in Bergen is less than in Baltimore, the morbidity during the autumn wave in 1918 was only approximately half that in Baltimore, and with similar case fatality rates, indicating that the population in Bergen was somehow otherwise protected. At that time, ie, approximately 1900, Norway and the other Scandinavian countries had higher life expectancy than any other European country [29]. It is tempting to link this to recent studies showing that the Norwegian population had high levels of vitamin D, probably due to year-round consumption of fish and cod liver oil [25].

I think this correlation is very interesting. And so I continued delving further, and found this paper, which expands on the topic additionally:

https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/246737/

While working as a psychiatrist at a maximum-security hospital, John Cannell screened his patients for vitamin D and found that all had very low levels. This led him to recommend that they take 2000‚ÄâIU/d of vitamin D, the US ‚Äúupper limit of tolerability‚Äù. Several months later an epidemic of influenza broke out at the hospital. Cannell noticed that none of the patients on his own ward developed symptoms, yet sickness was rampant among patients on adjacent wards, despite intermingling between patients and nurses [36]. This observation suggested to Cannell that vitamin D supplementation protected against influenza, an idea consistent with several facts: influenza is a wintertime illness; children with rickets are at increased risk of respiratory infections; and elderly individuals in most countries are more likely to die in winter than in summer months. Cannell and associates [33‚Äì35] proposed that influenza is a dormant viral disease that becomes active in response to vitamin D deficiency. Seasonal fluctuations in influenza were explained in terms of annual fluctuations in 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels due to lack of exposure to sunlight. The vitamin D deficiency hypothesis similarly explained the following observations: (i) the appearance of influenza in winter, when vitamin D levels are at their lowest, (ii) the disappearance of influenza following the summer solstice, (iii) the increased prevalence of influenza in the tropics and other areas during rainy seasons, (iv) the inverse association between influenza and outdoor temperature, (v) the decreased incidence of colds among children exposed to sunlight.

And it goes on to note....

Cannell and his associates [33‚Äì35] proposed that this seasonal stimulus is an impaired production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) due to reduced concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(25(OH)D), following reduced exposure to solar radiation. Support for the suggestion of a marked seasonal decline in vitamin D levels is provided by a prevalence survey of hypovitaminosis D in the British white population [43]. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D] was measured in 7,437 whites from the 1958 British birth cohort when they were 45 years old. Hypovitaminosis D was highest during the winter and spring; 25(OH)D concentrations &lt;25, &lt;40, and &lt;75‚Äânmol/L were found in 15.5%, 46.6%, and 87.1% of participants, respectively, compared to 3.2%, 15.4%, and 60.9%, respectively, during the summer and fall. 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly higher in participants who used vitamin D supplements or oily fish than in those who did not (P &lt; 0.0001 for both). 25(OH)D concentrations &lt;40‚Äânmol/L were twice as common in the obese as in the nonobese and in Scottish participants, as in those from England and Wales. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in the general population was described as ‚Äúalarmingly high‚Äù during the winter and spring, warranting action at a population level.

In conclusion: I think that Vitamin D deficiency in the general population coincident with declining seasonal insolation was the major driving factor behind the lethality of the second wave of the Spanish Flu. Extrapolating to today's events, Vitamin D deficiency is also a potential major causative factor behind the spread / lethality of COVID-19. It is interesting to note that when Wuhan was worst-hit (I don't believe their numbers but maybe they actually aren't lying too much on the new reports of decreases), it was right after solar minimum, and it was also choked by smog / etc. The factory shutdown / start of spring / cessation of smog coincided with a rapid drop in infections in Wuhan, obviously aided by containment efforts as well, but coincident to rising insolation (they are pretty far S, but not tropical). But it is even more interesting to note that while Italy, US, etc have seen rapid spread of the virus, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong -- some of the first places to see cases, although they do have stringent protocols for containment -- have been almost entirely spared so far.

Furthermore, if you look where the worst cases are happening today, they are all in northern climates. Europe is freakin' far north, Milan is at the same latitude as Montreal, which is coincidentally the same latitude as Seattle. And why are all the old people in nursing homes dying? Because they receive 0 natural sunlight, essentially like prison populations, which probably amplifies mortality well BEYOND pre-existing conditions when infected with this virus.

In any case, I think another month or so has the potential to show that Trump is somehow actually going to be correct in his assertion that ""come April, it's just going to disappear!"" (LOL!). BUT! The catch is that while CFR and spread will decrease, it will keep spreading in an innocuous / mild format through a much larger percentage of the population. And come September-February of 2020-21, the death toll is going to be extremely severe (IMO), much much worse than this current event, as Vit D levels once again plunge across the general population.

The overarching conclusion here is that GENERAL POPULATION levels of Vitamin D are extremely important to stopping novel viruses and their spread, and reducing their impact. This virus caught the tail-end of Northern Hemisphere winter and while numbers are now exploding, there is a chance that as the general populations in Europe and elsewhere above 30N see increasing sunlight / uptick in Vit D, the proportion of mild or asymptomatic cases is going to increase dramatically.

HOWEVER, when we hit September and October, this could very well be worse than the second wave of Spanish Flu.",nyc,"An explanation of the Herald Wave, Vitamin D deficiency, and what comes next."

Imagine what would happen if the virus spreads uncontrollably in NYC? The unimaginable: the lockdown of NYC, driving downhill the economy, and deaths everywhere. That could happen (hopefully not) if the City insist of big gatherings for the celebration of St. Patrick's day. In Ireland, the celebration was suspended, and in other cities everywhere, such as in Cleveland, Dublin, just to name a few. Why not here?

Then, those dozens of people with the virus, will spread it out in the subway trains, and will spread out exponentially, to reach hundred of thousands of people.

Blasio/Cuomo keeps saying about how testing is ""free"" but it's actually not. If you don't have insurance, they'll bill you. If you do have insurance, they'll bill your insurance company. Cuomo says he asked insurers to remove copays for coronavirus...

BUT self-funded insurance plans aren't exempt. Which means when your insurance get billed, you pay higher premiums the following year. So it's not free to get tested.

Basic game theory.

If you get tested, you pay thousands in medical bills. If you have it, you get loss of income (which Blasio won't pay for). If you don't have it, nothing happens.

If you don't get tested, you pay nothing. If you have it, you avoid quarantine. If you don't have it, nothing happens.

There's no cure... your health outcomes don't improve if you get tested. Therefore any rational self serving person will never get tested. The upside is nothing for yourself. The downside is medical bills + quarantine.

Good luck.",nyc,Why smart people don't get tested

But I became a teacher because I wanted to teach, not because I wanted to babysit New York's teenagers. I live with two people in their 70s, and while they are in good health, their age still puts them at risk. I teach in a school that, combined students and staff, has over 4,000 people in it in the middle of the day. Everyone in that building is at risk, as is everyone in every school.

I find it so incredibly ironic that teachers are given the short end of the stick, yet so many people rely on us. You don't care about my health but I better be on time and present for work to take care of your kid? Where is the logic?

Thank god no one has physically harassed or accosted me yet, but about a week leading up to my office mandating WFH this past Monday (cheers for them being one of the first companies to do so) I've experienced my fair share of microaggressions. One dude decided to loudly rant about ""the Chinese"" on a crowded subway I happened to be on, my headphones were on so I could tune out most of it but definitely heard at one point ""they're not even wearing masks!"" People have ""subtly"" covered their face with their scarves (ineffective anyway but ok, Jan) when they see me get on the subway or stare at me longer than is appropriate. Sadly the only times I'm not scrutinized in public is when I'm with my white roommate, because then by association I must not be contagious after all! 

I was super ready and fine with working from home once my office declared the shift because I didn't want to deal with any more bigoted BS. Today I had to leave the apartment for a bit to return a UPS package I ended up not needing. The workers there were dismissive towards me but whatever, it's an in-and-out exchange anyway. The real kicker was when a lady with a stroller saw me and turned the corner, and then proceeded to legit *jog* away when she realized that I was walking in the same direction as her. Things are scary right now, but the ignorance in people is even scarier.

So yeah - if you're Asian and you're fortunate enough to be in a position where you can work from home, definitely take advantage of it right now and lay low if possible. I know it fucking sucks and we should be free to live our lives as much as anyone else, but when you hear stories of people getting fucking punched in the face for just existing it's really messed up.

The issue is that I'm a dorm student. My school has chosen to keep the dorms open, so I have to make a choice between staying and leaving.

On one hand, leaving is selfish, as I might spread the virus to my hometown; I also need to worry about my older parents getting it. I have no clue if I have it, so I'm just assuming I do. It would be completely irresponsible if I end up having it and passing it around my town just because I wanted to be home with *mommy*. That's just fucking terrible to think about carrying on one's shoulder.

On the other hand, if I don't leave soon, I won't be able to. de Blasio has already hinted at applying a New Rochelle-type quarantine to NYC, and I've been hearing (unsubstantiated) rumors from city workers that the trains will close Friday evening. If that's the case, I need to leave today, or I won't be able to leave at all. The virus is already in the town neighboring mine, and I wouldn't want to be stuck here while a family member dies or something. A reptilian part of me just wants to be with my family.

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:  


As promised, I am writing with an update on how the University needs to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. We all know this is a rapidly evolving and very challenging situation. Yesterday afternoon, the World Health Organization officially declared this to be a pandemic. Thus far, we continue to have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on our campuses. Just to be clear, the principle that has guided us up to this point is to maintain the mission of the University as much as possible consistent with preserving the health of every part of our community. To that end, as of yesterday, we launched nearly 2,000 classes online and continue to prepare to teach classes virtually for the remainder of the semester.  


In light of the spread of the virus, especially in the New York metropolitan region, we now need to take further steps. Specifically, in order to reduce the density of our residential environment, while respecting the interests and needs of students who have reason to continue to remain in residence on campus, we are instituting three critical decisions: (1) The University will remain open and functioning; (2) All classes for the remainder of the semester will be conducted online; and (3) We encourage any students who are able to move out of undergraduate residence halls for the rest of the semester to do so, and we are ready to help in that process. The Office of University Life and your school will follow up with more information.  


It is worth repeating that our campuses will remain open. However, we have restrictions in place for those who have traveled to severely affected areas, as per guidance from the CDC. We will, as indicated previously, actively discourage congregations in large numbers. We also strongly discourage holding any events with over 25 people, at least through April 30th. All Columbia business travel, both international and domestic, is now suspended for all affiliates.  


This is a hard time for all of us. We are concerned about every student, colleague, friend, and neighbor. Clearly, balancing all of the interests of all parts of the institution is an extraordinarily complex undertaking. I am so grateful to all of you and especially to those who daily help us chart the right course for Columbia through this crisis.¬†

6440,WendyMoira123,1584042908,fhmfep,Nan,"Is either likely, in this sort of unprecedented situation?

(This is both to vent and I guess ask other people who they feel.)


My mother - who admittedly gets a lot of right wing news - has visions of people setting fire to apartment buildings and then shooting, murdering our super, and looting building complexes. Horrible stuff. She wants me to leave the city. She rents a house; her entire goal is to get our family (particularly my father, who faces the most risk) away from this. 

It might sound silly but I'm actually ok just chilling in my apartment, maybe walking down the block. My mental block is being taken out of NYC indefinitely with no way to get home (except by bus - that's a great way to avoid this), come home to no job. 

I'm working remotely and am honestly hoping to not leave the apartment for a month except to get food/supplies. I'm pretty much a shut in when I'm not working as is. I'm hoping the people in my life will be there when and if this passes.

It didn't happen in Sandy. 

There is a little voice in my head that says ""just go/you have no choice/she might be right."" I believe in erring on the side of fear most of the time but I think that's the line. 

Does anyone have these fears in their head at all?

(Please be respectful)

By the way - honestly it isn't lost on me there's always horrible violence and crime here. I'm lucky, my neighborhood is pretty safe most of the time. It has a bar culture and there is a homeless population, but it's quiet. But she's envisioning...food shortages, riots, a total breakdown of the police state, and basically, open season for the sort of person that would set fire to random apartment buildings by the time EMS and the fire dept are under strain. 

I'm paranoid enough that I can't argue. Not even ""why doesn't that happen the rest of the time?"" Works. This disease is unprecedented not just for its economic and death toll; the level of public sacrifice that's being requested of ordinary people and the lack of reassurance re: care, paid sick live, or provision...fleshes out her death spiral.

That combination plus a total sense of helplessness over the people around us (like this asshole - JFC - https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-jetblue-passenger-tests-positive-on-flight-to-florida-2020-3

I have a horrible coworker babbling about going to Disney for spring break, the douche, to prove a point) is really wearing me down psychologically. It's physically exhausting being under this much stress.

I would like to eat, work, watch TV to deal with boredom, and just lay low for a month. (I know the effects will last longer.)

Her goal is to move for two months.

I want to stay. That's the bogeyman she's putting in front of me - sickenened FDNY, sick doctors (I know that one is real), and a breakdown of civil order

I feel horrible with every story of an Asian person getting harassed. It'S almost always on public transit. I imagine the Asian American community is pretty frightened right now.

I honestly can't even gauge what's real. It's a horrible image but I'm such a misanthrope I can't even use reason. 

I would prefer for my sanity to stay in my home and be able to take a cab to my office (I am trying very hard not to be fired, even though I think any *office* that can let employees work remotely is opening themselves up to lawsuits at this stage - my mother is all but willing it). 



There is no one I can talk about this with IRL so I'm asking if it's crossed the mind of anyone here


If you had the chance the leave, would you? Why?

This is my home and as pretty much every person in my life *other* than family is likely going on as normal (none of my friends ask me how I'm doing or give a shit when I post on social media), that's it, that's the line of ""there are certain disruptions to ordinary life I want to not entertain.""

I'm timid by nature, and I often avoid escalating situations because what can a 5'1 chick do when someone decides to get physical? I occasionally kickbox but I highly doubt my muscle memory will work during my ""fight/flight"" mode.

I carry pepper spray with me but I don't feel safe, and I'm sure I'll end up spraying myself in panic. I wouldn't bother arguing back because those people who choose to behave that way often lack reason. I also can't loudly argue back because I cry when I get upset/argue (and then I start bawling because I'm crying...I need therapy I know). Trusting other bystanders to intervene is out the window now that nobody wants to be near me to begin with. Port Authority's got enough crazies even before COVID-9, but I fear getting attacked because my seasonal allergies are here and my sneezes/coughs will definitely trigger suppressed racism in some folks.

These recent events is making me question my identity. I'm not Asian enough in Asia, due to my ""Americanness"", and I'm not American enough due to my ethnicity. I can't choose my race or ethnicity, what the hell?!

Polo, an Italian national who was traveling from Rome to New York, scored one of the last seats on a flight from Italy before President Trump‚Äôs coronavirus travel ban goes into effect.

Under the ban, much travel from Europe -- with the exception of the U.K. -- will be suspended in an effort to contain the potentially-deadly COVID-19 virus that is wreaking havoc across the globe.

‚ÄúWhen Trump made the announcement that he was banning flights from Europe, I was awake,‚Äù said Polo, an Italian national who was abroad for a visit. ‚ÄúThank God. I got my ticket right away.‚Äù

Polo lucked into a business-class one-way ticket for about $1,000 or Norwegian Air Shuttle.

‚ÄúI was lucky,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll the other companies were asking for around $2,800, one way,‚Äù he said.

Polo‚Äôs flight is one of the last of the day, and was scheduled to land less than two hours before the Friday ban begins.

Polo has lived in the U.S. for more than 20 years and works at his own radio station based in Chinatown, Radio Nuova York. That may be his new home for a while.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to come back to them yet,‚Äù he said of his family. ‚ÄúI will put myself I quarantine at the radio station for two weeks.‚Äù

Benaissa Shahinaz, 36, flew into New York with two family members Thursday for a vacation in the Big Apple. Her flight back to France has already been canceled.

‚ÄúWe lost our money for our return flight,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe will have to fly back to London,‚Äù she said.

Traveler Ann Getts made it back from Paris under the deadline.

I have never met my landlord and do not have a way to contact them. All i know is their name and PO box. 

Since I will likely be relocating in August/September, I was hoping to do a month-to-month deal for a few months or maybe work out a 6-month lease. Recently, My landlord sent me a new lease to sign. It's a 12 month contract and rent has DOUBLED. I'm not sure that this is legal, but I don't have my lease contract to consult.

My super has stopped responding to all messages and will not provide any contact info for the landlord. Additionally, the gas has been shut off in my building for 4 months and the super has provided no timeline for fixing it. 

No gas. Doubling rent. No way of contacting anyone to ask questions, complain, or negotiate. What can I do? I'm I able to withhold rent payments? Is there any legal action I can take to compel the landlord to engage with me?",nyc,I need some advice about how to handle my Super/Landlord.

I work in a Catholic school and we got word this morning that our schools will be closed next week.  I'm in a bit of a unique situation in that I'm not an employee of the school, I work for a nonprofit that places me in the school to provide services for its students. 

I was told today that next week I need to report to our organization's main office and work from there.  This is totally ridiculous because I'll be bringing my work computer and work-issued cell phone home with me, and since the school will be closed I'll only be doing administrative work next week which I can absolutely do from home.  I relayed all of this to my boss and told her that considering all the advice to work from home if possible, it didn't seem wise to go in to the main office, but according to her our executive director is insisting on working from the main office - which is a 500 square foot room where I'd be with at least 4 other people.  It seems like I'd be taking unnecessary risks just for a ""butts in seats"" mentality.

I thought I‚Äôd post here and potentially ask for some advice due to my current financial situation in result of what‚Äôs been going on. I‚Äôm a paralegal who recently left my firm in November of last year. It just wasn‚Äôt working out and I had to jump ship before it compromised my well being. During the meantime I had a savings account that got me through the next couple of months. I also do some stagehand freelance work on the weekends for some extra change in my pocket. Now I‚Äôve pretty much depleted my savings and just landed another position at a firm in Manhattan which would have pretty much saved my ass financially. However, due to recent events (COVID-19), my new firm pushed my start date back a full two weeks which pretty much leaves me with no rent money for next month. Also, all of my stagehand jobs have been canceled so I have no other way of making money. Can anyone recommend a solution to this?

FYI* I appreciate any advice I can get, but please save any of the ‚Äúwhat you should‚Äôve done‚Äù advice. I need some insight on what to do now, not what I could have done prior.

Take a day to set yourself up at home. During this day, you will work on setting up your workspace physically and mentally. 

**1. First, take a moment to think about your circumstances.**

Do you have kids/roommates in the home with you all day? Do you need to worry about not clashing with someone else who is working from home? Is figuring out bathroom schedules going to be hard with you at home all day? 

You will need to communicate with those you live with to work issues like this out. You may need to come with a signal to your kids that they can understand means you are busy/on a call and cannot attend to them, or work out with your roommate a way to ensure you are able to work together in the same space peacefully.

**2. Take a moment to think about your working style.**

Do you work on the computer a lot, or are you mostly on the phone? Do you work better in a dedicated workspace, or do you end up moving around a lot? Do you get sleepy if you work from your bedroom or easily distracted if there is a TV in the room? Will you be able to work at home while knowing the house is a mess and there are 500 you need to get to in front of your face?

You will need to be able to imagine how you could be most productive in your existing space with its own challenges while being mindful of your ideal situation. For some people, this may mean committing to waking up and making the bed/cleaning the whole house prior to sitting down during work hours for work so they are not distracted by mess or tempted to work from their bed. For some it may mean putting a tarp on the tv or hiding the remote during the day. For others it will mean creating a space they can pace around within. Whatever you need to do for yourself, work it out, and create a time table for your day that accommodates this. If you have roommates or spouses who need it communicated to them that you are taking certain measures to ensure your productivity and don‚Äôt mean to step on toes, take the time to do that.

**3. Third, invest in the materials you need to create a workspace.** 

As an NYC resident, I don‚Äôt have much space. So these are the items I purchased to create a ‚Äúput away when done‚Äù yet productive workspace:

¬∑ Headphones (not linking these as most people have some already)

**4. Create a work-from-home plan with your colleagues.** 

Talk to your colleagues about implementing a communication platform like Microsoft Teams or Slack to work together using. Come up with a list of statuses that you share the meanings for amongst yourselves that help you understand when someone is available for chat, on a phone call, stepped away for a moment or focusing on a timely task. 

Create a mutually agreed check in schedule and utilize a project management tool like Mondays.com to track progress on tasks. A more low-key solution could be a simple shared google-document.

Be prepared to utilize conference-calling systems like Zoom and learn how they work so you are efficient about starting meetings, tracking which participants are on, screen-sharing and the process of muting and unmuting participants. 

**5. Be open to adjusting and evolving your work-from-home journey as you proceed.** 

As you work-from-home more and more, your process for focusing and getting work done will change, and you can change your setup and methods accordingly.",nyc,Work From Home Tools &amp; Tips

Yesterday I tried to set up an appointment with my Dr, who at first said she would only meet with me virtually or over the phone AND THEN realized that she is completely booked and cannot speak to me this week.

After being on the phone for 20 minutes as she tried to squeeze me in- I was advised to call the Health Department.

I explained to a lady at the NYC Health Department that I have a fever and I would like to be tested. I explained that I work at a public school and I would like to report to my school if I have coronavirus or not. She explained to me that RIGHT NOW I cannot be tested because I have not recently traveled out of the states and I am not sick to the point of hospitalization. NYC has limited testing kits at the moment, this may change in weeks to come....

This is what this tells me- NYC public schools will not close UNLESS someone becomes sick to the point of hospitalization because in order for someone to be tested- they need to be that sick. I feel like we are just waiting around for people to become VERY SICK before we shut down public schools. This really scares me.

There are a lot of older staff at my school and a lot of students who are medically fragile- all of which are more vulnerable to this virus than I am.

I am really unhappy with the way everything is being handled but I acknowledge that the city/ the health department are being faced with impossible decisions. I believe closing schools (proactively instead of reactively) may be one way to slow the spread of this virus in NYC.

I work in a bar in Midtown. PABT and Penn are big drivers of business. While there has been a significant decline in business, for the past couple of days we have still had a steady stream of people coming in and hanging out. While usually I would put on a smile, sling drinks and happily take your money, im begging people to just go home! 

Service industry staff come in contact with a wide variety of people, from different parts of the globe. Usually, these are anonymous interactions, not knowing where people have been or who they have been in contact with. This leaves my brothers and sisters in the game at a high risk of infection. Owners will keep the doors open until they are mandated to shut up shop. The only other way this may happen is if people stop coming in.

I totally understand that there are many who disagree with me on this subject. People have to eat, pay rent, live there lives etc. Theres a part of me that feels like an ass for saying this. Personally, I feel that the social distancing and hygienic practices are ignored in a bar/restaurant because its a safe, normal place for a lot of people (Think Shaun of the Dead). Its a mish mash of different neighborhoods/industrys/cultures all bundled into one, and as such, widens the risk of exposure to everyone who walks through the door. 

These are gonna be a really tough couple of weeks/months for everyone, but will have a significant hit on those in the service industry. Once everything goes 'back to normal', the residual effects may last even longer for us. If given the opportunity, I would self quarantine right now, in the hopes that this would blow over sooner rather than later. But, as long as people keep coming in, I am required to work my shifts, interacting with patrons for a sustained period of time in close proximity. No amount of hand sanitizer, Clorox wipes or pairs of gloves will give me peace of mind. We do not have the liberty of working from home, but in a lot of cases, are not given the opportunity to call out, due to fear of losing our jobs. No sick pay, no vacation time. We live between a permanent rock and a hard place.

These are just how I feel about the whole situation. I'm not a doctor or a government offical. I'm just a guy who wants things to get back to normal as soon as possible. Please practice social distancing; drink at home, save a few bucks, and just wait this out.",nyc,A message from a bartneder in Midtown: PLEASE STOP COMING IN!

6782,ticktockitsjaws,1584190525,fihxka,Interesting,"I keep to myself, so I'm only a little dumb, not dumb enough to think new yorkers are by nature panic buyers.

For the last couple of WEEKS, i bullshit with the retail workers and check on their gloves section, i like those black synthetic nitrile gloves Rite Aid used to sell, they are now walgreens and gloves are no more. I digress.

Anyways, gloves, masks and sanitizer hasn't been arriving on their trucks for the last couple of deliveries, when i saw on my snapchat some news about the state of emergency being declared, i read the fine print which explains the state can hoard whatever they want without paying, a seizure of assets, if you will.

Putting two and two together i realized all franchise/corporate chains have been cleaned out and their deliveries seized, projecting the image that we, new yorkers, are reacting. But its a feint and we as the public have fallen for this ruse.

I see panic buying increasing exponentially, things are actually running out now, we are blaming each other, the animosity, the aggro which should be locked onto the state preventing the public from having masks, sanitizer, medical attention, is instead focused on each other in a way and it eases the pressure the public can apply on those in power. Especial while everyone is worried about wiping their ass, how do we distract the people? Toilet paper! Everyones literally got shit on the brain.

Im just a loser, though, from where I'm Standing, it feels like someone is using alot of smoke and mirrors to spread this virus, spread the fear, rip away supplies needed for the situation at hand, and then let us blame each other, like toddlers being led around by the nose.

I soke to my hardware store guys and they say the same things i was already expecting to hear, big customer called, wants 30,000 n95 masks.

The masks are gone but no-one paid, yet every day panic buyer videos, all these people going insane, yet when i ride the train i rarely spot anyone with a mask or gloves, why? Because they dont care? No, because uncle sam didn't even leave any scraps, maybe he is hoping we turn into cannibals once shtf.

Idk man im going nuts here, i feel like someone is fucking with me and my city, yet everyone is falling for it like a snowball rolling down into an avalanche threatening to drown us with an economic downturn of doom.

Also this virus feels like it just made everyone into an assasin, you show no signs but could easily spread the virus? Seems like a golden opportunity to those families with long histories, who have older elders still alive with a tight grasp on power due to their faction built up over their life time, the yakuza comes to mind, so do freemasons, greed sprouts within the heart, after all. 
The Rothschild family and others like it probably have older power players as well they would love to take out. This feels like a weaponized virus, with a manmade touch on speed of contraction.


Blah, I've been bottling up my observations for over a month and its still bothering me! Theres so much sketchy shit going on right now in nyc and it feels like social media is portraying it as us new yorkers wildin outta control! My people are ruthless, we don't react like this without manipulation, we've been... Herded i fear.

Wanted to post this here as a warning to everyone. Yesterday, I left the house to move my car at 11am, and as I drove past my building (I live in a townhouse that's been converted to apartments) I saw a National Grid van double-parked in front of my house, and a guy in a National Grid outfit standing on my stoop. Figured he was there to read the meter, and that he'd leave a note if nobody answered the door. I parked, came back 10 min later, and he was gone, no note.

Couple hours later, my landlord (who lives in the downstairs apartment) emails me. Says she met the guy at the door, only to find he had no ID, wouldn't give his name. He took off fast when he saw the house had people in it. She wasn't expecting National Grid to come by, so she called them up after he left -- and they said they hadn't dispatched anyone to our address. 

I'm not sure whether they were planning on sneaking in if nobody was home or were planning on forcing their way in if there was just one person home, but either way, it's fucking scary. 

Just to reiterate: they had an honest-to-God National Grid van, with the right logo and branding and even flashing yellow lights. The guy was wearing a National Grid vest. 

We called the police and filed a report with the 72nd Precinct, but I figured it was worth broadcasting it here for everyone. If you see National Grid at your door and you're not expecting them, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR. Call the company and make sure they dispatched someone. If they didn't, call the cops.",nyc,Watch out for fake National Grid employees! Tried to get into my house in Brooklyn on Friday

This may need to be stickied by the mods if there is enough interest. Any other housing attorneys, please feel free to chime in since the developments in our housing courts are ongoing as we speak.

Your rights as an apartment renter are the same, so if you keep missing rent then your landlord would still have to initiate a non-payment case against you in Housing Court. You have to be properly served by your landlord or else the case can be dismissed. If you are served with court papers that indicate an eviction case has been filed against you for non-payment of rent then you have 10 days from when you are served to go to court to file what is known as an Answer and you'll be given a court date. Obviously go to the clerk's office at the court house indicated on the paperwork you were served ASAP to get this done or the court will consider your lack of action as a basis to then give the landlord and the Marshal in charge with evictions in your area authorization to issue what's known as a ""warrant of eviction."" This is what would get posted on your door and you would have 15 days before the Marshal and police come to your apartment to remove you and/or your belongings. If you are served with the initiating court papers, known as a ""Petition"", get representation from one of the many housing law organizations like NYLAG, LSNYC (has branches in every borough), Lenox Hill, Northern Manhattan Improvement Co., Legal Aid Society, and others (see the list [**here**](https://www.lawhelpny.org/find-legal-help/housing/eviction?location=New%20York%20City%20%28all%205%20NYC%20boroughs%29)) by calling their hotlines to set up an appointment to see one of their attorneys. These organizations usually have their own income requirements so you can't be overincome (like making more than 200% of the federal poverty level for your household size \[[see here](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/) for the guidelines depending on your household size\]; e.g., this is about more than $24,000 for a 1-person household).  Obviously, if you are jobless then your income is $0. 

(1) If you live in the following Zip Codes:

Bronx 10457, 10467, 10468, 10462, 10453

Brooklyn 11216, 11221, 11225, 11226, 11207

Manhattan 10026, 10027, 10025, 10031, 10029, 10034

Queens 11433, 11434, 11373, 11385, 11691

Staten Island 10302, 10303, 10314, 10310

(2) AND you have a household income (this would include your roommates' income too) of less than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines then you are guaranteed a lawyer and can keep postponing your case until you get one.

If you have no income or can't get unemployment for some reason apply for ""Cash Assistance"" (CA) (which is a monthly stipend for those without income) and ""food stamps"" (you can only get CA if you are signed up for food stamps, known officially as SNAP or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) through the Human Resources Administration (HRA) website ([**here**](https://a069-access.nyc.gov/accesshra/)). If you feel you are wrongly rejected unemployment, then contact the organizations I listed above. 

Getting a roommate, or getting a friend or family member to commit to paying your rent may be necessary so you can then apply for what's known as a ""One-Shot Deal"" or OSD through HRA (see [**here**](https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/get-help/im-in-need-of-housing/one-shot-deals/) for more details), and you're only going to get the OSD if you can show that you can afford your rent moving forward (hence the advice about financial assistance above). The OSD will pay for your  arrears/rent owed but your chances of getting one will be slimmer the more you owe (we're talking if you go above $10,000 in arrears/rent owed), so don't delay to seek legal help or HRA's help. 

Anyone, feel free to DM me if you have more questions. I'm a housing attorney (for renting tenants not those with mortgages).

Legal aid-type organizations, tenant rights groups, and others are trying our best to reach out to our elected officials for a moratorium/freeze on evictions (a 1-week moratorium was just announced yesterday, but obviously this is not long enough). 

If you want to help us get this done then please: 

* Contact your elected officials via phone, email, fax, or social media (find your NY and NYC officials [**here**](http://www.mygovnyc.org/)); AND/OR
* Sign a petition that requests a freeze on evictions in NYC and the boroughs ([**here**](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-cuomo-freeze-evictions/) is one of the major ones that has about 13,000 signatures at the time of this posting).",nyc,Your Rights as an Apartment Renter in NYC

I worked in an events based industry in the NYC area as their Marketing Manager. The job was a start-up that I worked for part-time for a year, up until January, when I came on full-time (leaving my previous full time job to do so). The CEO convinced me the company was doing well, stable, and on track to have it's best year yet. The past 3 months had been hard with people cancelling their tickets to our events. We had brought this up with the CEO numerous time, which he just laughed off and didn't address. Obviously no one could have seen this coming, but the CEO was not worried about it, so we felt we had no reason to worry, that we had a runway to work with should we need it.

It finally came to a head yesterday. We were all working from home, and had a scheduled conference call with the CEO. Right off the bat he laid off all full time staff (4 people total) saying that the NYC ban on gatherings of 500 people or more has officially stalled the business. That was it, no warning, no 2 weeks notice, no severance.

I was shocked, I still am shocked. I left a very stable job to support a cause I loved and to work with people who I thought would look out for me. Now here I am, unemployed, at the beginning of the largest recession since 2008, at a time where every business has mandated working from home, and I have to somehow go job hunting. How am I supposed to navigate this? I can't sign up for unemployment until Monday, and I'm getting antsy waiting all weekend, and even then I don't know how long it will take to go into effect and how much it will cover.",nyc,I lost my job because of the event ban

To my surprise they got back to me immediately for an interview, at an unspecified address ""Boundary Co-working Space¬†(39th street, between 8th &amp; 9th Ave). New York, NY 10018"" The name of the company I applied to was ""Soho!"" ( [https://www.sohonetwork.co/](https://www.sohonetwork.co/) ), but as I'll explain later they go by several different names.

At the office space I was asked by reception what company I was there to see, and was given a form to fill out while I waited with around two dozen other people to be interviewed. After a quick interview I was invited later that day to attend an ""experiential day"" with the company. After a longer interview with them they explained the job and position, which would be a face-to-face, commission based marketing role where I would be trying to sell either Spectrum or get donations for the Humane Society at Best Buys around the city.

The culture at the company was very welcoming and all the employees and managers were extremely laid back and informal. I was told I would start out as an ""account executive"" (A glorified one-on-one liaison between the company and any poor suckers I was able to sign up). After several weeks I would be promoted to a Corporate Trainer, where I would help train new recruits and get them familiarized with the system. Following that after several months I could be promoted to an ""Assistant Brand Manager"", overseeing corporate trainers, and from there you could be promoted to a ""Brand Manager"".

As I said before, this position was NOTHING like what the original job listing said, but I figured I could make some good money, get to Corporate Trainer real quick for a nice little resume bullet point, and find other jobs in the meantime. During my two weeks there I worked long hours 6 days a week, starting from 10 am at the office, going to the Best Buy from 12-7, and returning to the office and leaving at 8. After putting in roughly 100 hours, I was able to make $400 across two weeks thanks to a few employees who helped me with sales.

After coming across several similar Reddit threads regarding this location, I confronted my trainer one morning who sat me down with the Brand Manager I worked for. I confronted her about the different names working from the same space, and she told me that once being promoted to ""Brand Manager"", you would be given your own company to name and assistant brand managers under you. I followed up with asking what the name of the umbrella corporation was, to which she responded there was none. I asked whats stopping Brand Managers from taking their company and leaving, to which she said that there was nothing stopping them and ""they just hoped they wouldn't do that."" When asked about how they attracted clientele without an umbrella corporation and each company acting independently, I was told that there were separate regional representatives from Creditco who would help attract clients to each individual company. I confronted her and told her the whole thing seemed like a pyramid scheme, even drawing it out for her, and was told that ""You can draw out any company and have it look like a pyramid scheme"" (Remember, Account executives and corporate trainers work solely on commission, giving no incentive for the Brand Managers to stop hiring."" At the end of the conversation I politely quit and walked away.

Not going to lie, I feel like a sucker for having wasted two weeks and countless hours at such a shit job. The whole company structure is sus as hell, and I've been weighing on whether or not to report them to the Better Business Bureau for the past month. If you're very charismatic and fluent in Spanish (About half the customers I saw my trainer sell to solely spoke spanish), then this could be a fine job where you make good money as long as you don't care about selling shit products and conning Account Executives. The promotion rate is actually relatively fast, and the day I walked in to quit at the end of my second week I was given several documents to prepare for becoming a corporate trainer before quitting.

Overall though, I'd recommend staying away and spending your time trying to find work elsewhere. If you decide to pick up this job, you'll have to sacrifice your free time and sanity just to make a couple bucks.",nyc,Watch out for 331 West 39th St; Multi Level Marketing Scheme

Assuming an average increase of 20% cases per day, it will take 30-45 days before we hit 100,000 cases, which is about roughly 1% of the city's population. At 100,00 it's likely you will know of someone who has contracted the virus (again, rough math).

I had some ideas and would like to hear more:

Tape up a notice in the entrance/lobby for ""Coronavirus Assistance"" for people to add their name, age, phone number, and apartment number. Given the wide range of ages and cultures in NYC, I think the simplest solution is to just list cell phone numbers. I think more technologically advanced solutions like group chat apps could be too complicated for the elderly. I believe all cell phones have the capability to do group texts now?

The purpose of this is for people to contact their neighbor if they need food/supplies delivered to their apartment if they are unable to go out.

Another purpose to check in to make sure your neighbor is okay.

Deliveries should be left outside of their door. Knock or call/text to indicate the delivery. It's probably not a good idea to physically engage.

The superintendent told me that I should never do that again, that the residents were very offended by my note. I apologized for not running it through her first, and then asked why the neighbors found my note so offensive when I was just trying to help.

After a few seconds of thinking, she said that I was suggesting that they're not independent people and can't figure things out on their own.

Now I'm wondering -- Is that the NYC culture? Do people really get offended when you suggest they can be vulnerable?

This will seriously overwhelm the healthcare system, and the people with severe cases will be forced to wait in line. They will likely drop dead waiting, as we've seen in Wuhan.

Basically I‚Äôm a 29 year old college graduate currently working a job that pays $16.00 an hour and I feel stuck. Even though I appreciate living with my family, I feel stuck because I‚Äôm unable to afford to move out in this city on my own.

For the past few years I‚Äôve really wanted to move to a different state, but my family is hesitant on wanting me to leave because they feel I won‚Äôt be able to handle it.

The problem is, there‚Äôs no way I can afford to live anywhere in New York and this city has gotten way too competitive for me to even consider building a career.

I‚Äôm also not much of a social person, I don‚Äôt hate people, but all my hobbies are solitary so I don‚Äôt get any enjoyment working with others doing them (Illustrating and writing stories).

Even if I were to decide to rent an apartment in somewhere in Queens, my best bet would be to live with two or three roommates and that is too much for me to handle (I love my privacy).

This is basically why I‚Äôm considering making the jump to either Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Chicago or somewhere more affordable a single guy can live in.

I currently have 20K saved up working my main job and doing side jobs over the weekend.

A Brooklyn man who was shot in the head in Park Slope by a short-fused driver apparently enraged when his car was cut off, died Saturday of his injuries, police said.

Dean Lawrence, 31, of Flatbush, succumbed to his injuries at 5:17 a.m. at Methodist Hospital, cops said.

Lawrence was stopped in his white Chevy sedan on Sixth Avenue between First Street and Garfield Place in Park Slope at around 5 p.m. Friday when another driver pulled over, got out of his car and squeezed off four shots, police sources said.

The gunman, whose car had New Jersey plates, then got back into his ride and drove off, cops said. He was still being sought on Saturday.

Lawrence had been working for the US Postal Service ‚Äî same as his mom ‚Äî while pursuing his passion for hip-hop, those who knew him said.

‚ÄúHe was above the bulls‚Äìt,‚Äù former neighbor Kimberly Forsythe, 38, said. ‚ÄúHe was the last person you would suspect to be killed by a gun.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good kid. Really good kid,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAlways carried my bags.‚Äù

And his mom kept him on the straight and narrow and taught him good manners.

‚ÄúYou know how hard she worked to keep him safe?‚Äù Forsythe added.

Lawrence‚Äôs last post to his Instagram in July 2019 shows him in Miami Beach, posing with a series of luxury cars.

‚ÄúYou was everything to me as a friend. You cherished the ground that I walk on. You taught me to love myself the way I do now,‚Äù one friend posted to his account Saturday. ‚ÄúMy heart is broken. I‚Äôm gonna f‚Äìking miss the s‚Äìt out you.‚Äù

She is seeing a therapist, but my friend feels like she isn‚Äôt a good fit and isn‚Äôt helpful. It‚Äôll be weeks/months before she can get in anyone else‚Äôs office, even if she acts now (which she isn‚Äôt).

I‚Äôve talked to her, I‚Äôve sent her articles, and she still feels powerless to leave. He‚Äôs really done a number on her self-worth. I don‚Äôt know how else to help.

The city's policy is that workers must take sick leave or vacation time in order to stay home. As of now, they are not allowing for flexible WFH policies or additional sick leave.  If employees choose to stay home and don't have enough PTO, they could risk their employment. In some cases, employees even need a doctor's note to call out sick on a Friday or Monday.

7055,apriltion,1584284576,fj2lpi,Nan,"I‚Äôm a student doctor at a dental school located in Westchester County, New York. While all other dental schools are taking actions to protect their students, faculty and staff, and patients by temporarily closing down their clinics, my school announced that they‚Äôre just ‚Äúreducing‚Äù the number of patients being seen, starting tomorrow. 

I‚Äôve been buying food/water/whatever supplies I need to sustain myself just in case this outbreak gets even worse. Haven‚Äôt been eating out or going to any sort of crowded places to avoid being exposed. I do not feel safe going into school to treat patients, given:
1. The nature of our job (working IN patients‚Äô mouth, plus not being provided with N95 grade equivalent or surgical masks) AND 
2. The school‚Äôs location, in heart of Westchester County (which New Rochelle, Westchester County, is now the US‚Äôs first ‚Äúcontainment zone.‚Äù)

I would be really upset if I end up catching the virus, after taking this matter very, very seriously and taking all the precautions I could have, because it wasn‚Äôt taken seriously enough by some others. I would be even more upset if I happen to be a ‚Äúsilent carrier‚Äù for some reason and end up infecting my patients without knowing (since we have many elderly patients coming in also). I‚Äôm just little frustrated here because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel safe coming in‚Äù would NOT be an appropriate and legitimate excuse to miss clinic and who knows what consequences I‚Äôd have to face when it‚Äôs all over. Just want to know what you guys think - Am I taking this pandemic situation TOO seriously and being a crazy/over-reacting one here? Or should the school re-consider closing the clinic?

Here are few key points from the email we received from one of the deans:
- ‚ÄúDaily appointments reduced by 50%.‚Äù We‚Äôre told a ‚Äúfaculty‚Äù will be deciding which patients should be re-scheduled vs come in as scheduled?
- ‚ÄúEach appointment currently in the book will be evaluated for medical history, age of the patient, and procedure being done (non-urgent), some patients will be reappointed to fit the new schedules, some patients will be reappointed for several weeks into the future. Crowns, Dentures, Implant restorations will be prioritized.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúChair assignments will be done for every other chair, creating the social distance needed.‚Äù This, cutting 50% of patients each day
- ‚ÄúMOST students will only need to report to the building two days a week. BUT if your schedule‚Äôs inconsistent, a student may see patients up to 3-4 days a week.‚Äù Meaning, depending on your patient schedule, you could be going in up to 4 days a week. So basically everyday.
- ‚ÄúCannot use cavitron (the instrument that vibrates/squirts water out we use to clean your teeth).‚Äù So if you need cleaning or deep cleaning, we‚Äôll just have to use hand scalers, which I feel is a disservice to our patients.
- ‚ÄúStudent doctors will now be provided face shields when treating patients. These will be worn over to standard face masks.‚Äù But we will be still be using the ASTM level 1 masks.
 - ‚ÄúIntake and the specialty clinics of Oral Surgery, Endodontics, PEDIATRICS, and Orthodontics will operate normally, and students are expected to maintain their externship schedule as usual.‚Äù

Here are few reasons I could think of why school doesn‚Äôt want to close down:
1. School will be losing significant amount of money by closing down clinic. They somewhat ‚Äúfollowed the protocol‚Äù by switching gear to deliver lectures online.
2. Tremendous work it would take to re-schedule ALL the patients in the future.
3. Dental licensing exam, WREB (for the graduating 4th year students), that would take place now through end of March. If the school is closed, students cannot bring in the patients to take their licensing exam.
4. 4th year students will have to finish taking their competencies by beginning to May, before their graduation. Competencies are 30-40 hands-on exams/requirements that you have to pass in order to graduate. You‚Äôre tested on all dental procedures (e.g. denture, crown, implant, extraction, filling, cleaning... etc you name it) to demonstrate that you‚Äôre able to successfully carry out these procedures. So think of it as one-on-one midterms &amp; finals with a faculty member (on a patient) that you can take anytime during 3rd-4th year of school. They‚Äôre afraid that taking weeks off won‚Äôt give the 4th year students enough time to complete their competencies before graduation.
5. There ARE patients who should be seen now than later - e.g. denture patients without teeth. Root canal patients. Root canal treated teeth that should be immediately crowned...etc.

Gahhh. Anyways, thank you so much for listening to my long and obnoxious rants. Just a helpless student wanting to ask for everyone‚Äôs advice and opinion...

Yesterday they managers old us the owner was coming in to talk to us. We all mentally prepared for the worst, thinking he was coming to tell us we would temporarily close. What happened was the exact opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

He told us for his bottom line, the best thing to do was close three days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead we are staying open. We are cutting hours, but NO ONE is getting laid off.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are insured through work and aren't meeting the minimum hours, you will still be insured.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are uninsured and want to get tested for coronavirus, the company is going to pay for testing. 

(I know the CDC said they would pay for all testing, but there has been no confirmation and even still that is a GRAND gesture). 

&amp;#x200B;

If we feel uncomfortable coming to work, we can stay home and will still have a job when this is all over.

&amp;#x200B;

If we are at work and there is a large party we don't feel comfortable working, we don't have to work.

&amp;#x200B;

If we want to serve tables with gloves on we may do so.

For Android there is no quick silent option by default, you can try adding a emergency number option through third party apps, or maybe someone here can provide a tip on how to do it quickly.

Once 911 has been called you don't have to say anything to them, the police will be dispatched to your cell tower location or gps location, and the dispatcher will be listening in on the line to figure out what the issue is and relay that to police.  So if you begin to tell loudly and say exactly what is going on the dispatcher will here and dispatch accordingly.  So if you start yelling ""why did you guys me"" it'll get dispatch as a assault in progress, if they just here yelling they will get it as a argument.

Even if location isn't 100% at least they will start going to your area and possibly catch the person who might still be in area.

I can also understand why when asked if he is secretly stuttering he will deny it. I am not sure if this is a positive or a negative politically. He will say he overcame it.... and this is largely true. Joe Biden is one of the most exceptional speakers when it comes to stuttering. He is now able to speak to large crowds of people and is now even able to be a leading presidential candidate. The average stutter can only dream of this.

This is more or less the average stutterer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR4RrTTciMw

Worst case scenario (I know how the video is titled, but remember he has to live like this, be able to find friends and a significant other, be able to ask to use the bathroom, ask for directions, and other things you take for granted):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8xP5UFlArw

In my opinion Joe Biden is a covert stutterer. He has largely overcame it but it comes back on certain words from time to time. Instead of doing ""Ba ba ba ba"" on national TV he tries to just switch up the word. **The IMPORTANCE difference between regular people who speak and sometimes stutter and the stutterer is that the stutterer -may not- come back from that ""Ba ba ba ba"" and may continue for even 25 seconds and will have to force and tense their face muscles to be able to say words. Think for a second how this is a real disability and when trying to make friends/find a significant other/asking to use the bathroom/asking for directions can get to be almost impossible**

A teenage boy accused of joining his 13-year old friend on a fatal joyride in a stolen SUV in Harlem has been criminally charged, cops said Sunday.

The Saturday night crash on 116th St. at Morningside Ave. claimed the life of Dejuan Wynn, a young basketball player who was a regular at a nearby community center.

Dejuan was behind the wheel of a stolen Nissan Armada when he blew a red light in front of a cop then took a left turn, police said. He and his 15-year-old pal now facing charges tried to bail out of the SUV while it was still moving.

But the vehicle took the turn too fast and slammed into three parked cars before it flipped over, pinning Dejuan, who died at scene.

Friends and counselors at the Dunlevy Milbank Community Center, where Dejuan was a regular, were in shock Sunday.

‚ÄúHe was a good kid. Knew him since he was a kid, a baby. I knew the family for years. I can‚Äôt really process things right now,‚Äù said one counselor, Elijah Brown, 29. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just mad that this happened the way it happened. I wish it could have ended a different way.""

Dejuan‚Äôs young passenger was taken to Mount Sinai Morningside in stable condition.

The passenger, whose name was not released because of his age, is charged with grand larceny of an automobile, criminal possession of stolen property and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.

Dejuan played basketball for the Milbank Flyers, the community center‚Äôs basketball team.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good kid. He loved basketball, he lived for basketball,‚Äù said the father of one of Dejuan‚Äôs teammates. ""I saw the scene, I learned later on that it was him. It‚Äôs devastating, I never expected that. He was a really good kid. He was a really talented basketball player.‚Äù

If you are a doctor or a nurse treating patients in the ER or ICU of a hospital in NYC and require childcare:

I (39 f) work in finance (but am a former healthcare worker). I have two kids of my own who are older teens and live outside of the city with their dad. They are not visiting for the duration. I am 100% work from home (and have been for the past week and a half). 

I am on the UWS not far from Columbia U. I am happy to supervise up to two kids aged 6-12 yrs (after work hours can be younger) at a time if you have nobody to watch your kids while you work. 

I have extensive credit/background checks due to my job and can provide proof. I have a 2 br apartment and live alone so decent space. The danger as you know is cross exposure if I watch more than one family‚Äôs child/ren. 

I would not charge any fees whatsoever, just ask you to bring snacks for kids. Any schedule is OK- I only leave to go to the market. My second bedroom has bunk beds. 
 
So... If you have a childcare EMERGENCY which would prohibit your ability to go to work at a hospital, and you work/live UWS - DM me. I will require proof of your position. I am happy to provide copies of ID, background info, etc.

7266,SleepyLi,1584338557,fjg62f,COVID-19,"This is the first post I‚Äôve ever put up on Reddit, so excuse me if this shit jankey asf, or in the wrong place. A comment I left on someone‚Äôs post received some really good feedback, so I figured there would be other folks who might be experiencing a rough time as well, so here I am being proactive. 

As we all know, COVID-19 is fucking shit up. Most folks are working from home, but that‚Äôs generally for folks working white collar jobs with job security, which a fuckton of NYC heads don‚Äôt have. Folks in the service industry don‚Äôt get paid if they don‚Äôt work, so there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to WFH and bus my own fucking table‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet me make that drink for you bud‚Äù in ya own kitchen for ya cat. So money is tight for some of y‚Äôall. And I get it. I‚Äôve been in that position before, shit sucks and gurgles donkey dick. So here‚Äôs my PSA:

I help run a wholesale/retail meat shop in NYC, specifically the LES, in Chinatown. I‚Äôm open, cause how else is everyone going to eat and cook at home? Just as I told someone before, I‚Äôll say the same thing here: $10 will get you something like 13 pounds of chicken drumsticks, plus a dozen eggs. Don‚Äôt like drum sticks? Fine, get something else, our prices are lower than your GPA and your parents‚Äô expectations for you. We don‚Äôt sell rice, but a 20lb bag of rice runs like $25 bucks in our area and if you ask, I‚Äôll tell you exactly where to go. Our location is:

47 DIVISION STREET
GROUND FLOOR
NEW YORK, NY 10002

B/D to Grand Street, F to East Broadway

Now you might say some shit like ‚Äúthis is a shameless cash grab, etc.‚Äù And you know what my response is to that? 

What the fuck are you talking about, and you can suck my fucking ass. I‚Äôm not going to get rich making ten bucks off 13 pounds of drumsticks and a dozen eggs (if we even have anymore). This is for folks that are hurting real bad or just plain about to fucking be put out cause $10 is all they have. If I was trying to get rich, being the local pig boy is obviously not the right trade to get into, now is it. 

For those that also see this and start scheming on if you can roll up on my spot and try to make me run my pockets for $10: come and find out whether or not you have a first class ticket to meet God, express lane. Or just come and tell me you want to shoot the fair one for fun, I‚Äôll oblige too. 

If you have a healthy savings account, please don‚Äôt come to my shop at this time. If you‚Äôre stocked up and can weather a self quarantine, again, please don‚Äôt come to my shop at this time. I‚Äôd appreciate the business during a more normal period of time, but as of now, it‚Äôs geared towards my fellow NYers who are most at risk due to their economic situation. I have a limited supply of produce and I‚Äôd like to give us all a fighting chance. 

In this time of great uncertainty and fear, we New Yorkers must stand together and be each other‚Äôs keepers. Take care of your folks, your neighbors, each other. We‚Äôve weathered 9/11 together, Superstorm Sandy, shit, the fucking 2016 election, and this too will be something that we will weather and emerge victorious from.

TL;DR: if you‚Äôre a poor fuck and worried about how you will eat during COVID-19, come hither you poor child, for I have wares for cheap. But for real, give me $10 and I will feed you for a week.

Discover- covered my payment in full for this month and said they will reevaluate next month based on the severity at that point in time. They also said interest rates will be reduced due to the Fed moves last few days but this did not matter for me as I am on 0% promotional offer. Nonetheless it may matter for some of you.

Citi Bank- currently offering nothing for people working in industries affected by the coronavirus. They are offering their regular debt reduction programs but unless you are bankrupt those are the type of plans you avoid. First rep was a foreign worker who didn‚Äôt even understand what i was asking and I had to be transferred and put on hold only to be told they aren‚Äôt doing anything specifically for the coronavirus. 

They even said that if they were to do anything to change my interest rate on the account they would shut down my account after debt is resolved. Needless to say i will be doing that on my own once I clear the account.

I live in an apartment complex with a fair amount of low-income families that have multiple generations living together.

I was thinking batchable items like Chili, soup/stew, or rice with beans/lentils.  Would anyone who is more knowledgable on the situation be able to offer advice on how to go about this in the safest way, or post some recipes that would be good to scale up safely?

Moving up here almost a decade ago, the masses I saw every day were an abstraction; just an unknowable ever-changing sea of people. But every now and then, and especially when I needed help, that sea turned into a few distinct faces of people who were willing to act kindly to a stranger in need. I see little moments of this every week on the train. A lot of us will be missing those moments. But let's find new situations in which to practice kindness and generosity towards our neighbors in these trying times. People we might not have paid much attention to before. Now is the time. In the words of one of my all time favorite authors and part time New Yorker:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you've got a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babies - God damn it, you've got to be kind.  
&gt;

Peace and love. We can get through this together.

# The Making of a New Yorker - O. Henry

Besides many other things, Raggles was a poet. He was called a tramp; but that was only an elliptical way of saying that he was a philosopher, an artist, a traveller, a naturalist and a discoverer. But most of all he was a poet. In all his life he never wrote a line of verse; he lived his poetry. His Odyssey would have been a Limerick, had it been written. But, to linger with the primary proposition, Raggles was a poet.

Raggles's specialty, had he been driven to ink and paper, would have been sonnets to the cities. He studied cities as women study their reflections in mirrors; as children study the glue and sawdust of a dislocated doll; as the men who write about wild animals study the cages in the zoo. A city to Raggles was not merely a pile of bricks and mortar, peopled by a certain number of inhabitants; it was a thing with a soul characteristic and distinct; an individual conglomeration of life, with its own peculiar essence, flavor and feeling. Two thousand miles to the north and south, east and west, Raggles wandered in poetic fervor, taking the cities to his breast. He footed it on dusty roads, or sped magnificently in freight cars, counting time as of no account. And when he had found the heart of a city and listened to its secret confession, he strayed on, restless, to another. Fickle Raggles!‚Äîbut perhaps he had not met the civic corporation that could engage and hold his critical fancy.

Through the ancient poets we have learned that the cities are feminine. So they were to poet Raggles; and his mind carried a concrete and clear conception of the figure that symbolized and typified each one that he had wooed.

Chicago seemed to swoop down upon him with a breezy suggestion of Mrs. Partington, plumes and patchouli, and to disturb his rest with a soaring and beautiful song of future promise. But Raggles would awake to a sense of shivering cold and a haunting impression of ideals lost in a depressing aura of potato salad and fish.

Thus Chicago affected him. Perhaps there is a vagueness and inaccuracy in the description; but that is Raggles's fault. He should have recorded his sensations in magazine poems.

Pittsburg impressed him as the play of ""Othello"" performed in the Russian language in a railroad station by Dockstader's minstrels. A royal and generous lady this Pittsburg, though‚Äîhomely, hearty, with flushed face, washing the dishes in a silk dress and white kid slippers, and bidding Raggles sit before the roaring fireplace and drink champagne with his pigs' feet and fried potatoes.

New Orleans had simply gazed down upon him from a balcony. He could see her pensive, starry eyes and catch the flutter of her fan, and that was all. Only once he came face to face with her. It was at dawn, when she was flushing the red bricks of the banquette with a pail of water. She laughed and hummed a chansonette and filled Raggles's shoes with ice-cold water. Allons!

Boston construed herself to the poetic Raggles in an erratic and singular way. It seemed to him that he had drunk cold tea and that the city was a white, cold cloth that had been bound tightly around his brow to spur him to some unknown but tremendous mental effort. And, after all, he came to shovel snow for a livelihood; and the cloth, becoming wet, tightened its knots and could not be removed.

Indefinite and unintelligible ideas, you will say; but your disapprobation should be tempered with gratitude, for these are poets' fancies‚Äîand suppose you had come upon them in verse!

One day Raggles came and laid siege to the heart of the great city of Manhattan. She was the greatest of all; and he wanted to learn her note in the scale; to taste and appraise and classify and solve and label her and arrange her with the other cities that had given him up the secret of their individuality. And here we cease to be Raggles's translator and become his chronicler.

Raggles landed from a ferry-boat one morning and walked into the core of the town with the blas√©e air of a cosmopolite. He was dressed with care to play the r√¥le of an ""unidentified man."" No country, race, class, clique, union, party clan or bowling association could have claimed him. His clothing, which had been donated to him piece-meal by citizens of different height, but same number of inches around the heart, was not yet as uncomfortable to his figure as those speciments of raiment, self-measured, that are railroaded to you by transcontinental tailors with a suit case, suspenders, silk handkerchief and pearl studs as a bonus. Without money‚Äîas a poet should be‚Äîbut with the ardor of an astronomer discovering a new star in the chorus of the milky way, or a man who has seen ink suddenly flow from his fountain pen, Raggles wandered into the great city.

Late in the afternoon he drew out of the roar and commotion with a look of dumb terror on his countenance. He was defeated, puzzled, discomfited, frightened. Other cities had been to him as long primer to read; as country maidens quickly to fathom; as send-price-of-subscription-with-answer rebuses to solve; as oyster cocktails to swallow; but here was one as cold, glittering, serene, impossible as a four-carat diamond in a window to a lover outside fingering damply in his pocket his ribbon-counter salary.

The greetings of the other cities he had known‚Äîtheir homespun kindliness, their human gamut of rough charity, friendly curses, garrulous curiosity and easily estimated credulity or indifference. This city of Manhattan gave him no clue; it was walled against him. Like a river of adamant it flowed past him in the streets. Never an eye was turned upon him; no voice spoke to him. His heart yearned for the clap of Pittsburg's sooty hand on his shoulder; for Chicago's menacing but social yawp in his ear; for the pale and eleemosynary stare through the Bostonian eyeglass‚Äîeven for the precipitate but unmalicious boot-toe of Louisville or St. Louis.

On Broadway Raggles, successful suitor of many cities, stood, bashful, like any country swain. For the first time he experienced the poignant humiliation of being ignored. And when he tried to reduce this brilliant, swiftly changing, ice-cold city to a formula he failed utterly. Poet though he was, it offered him no color similes, no points of comparison, no flaw in its polished facets, no handle by which he could hold it up and view its shape and structure, as he familiarly and often contemptuously had done with other towns. The houses were interminable ramparts loopholed for defense; the people were bright but bloodless spectres passing in sinister and selfish array.

The thing that weighed heaviest on Raggles's soul and clogged his poet's fancy was the spirit of absolute egotism that seemed to saturate the people as toys are saturated with paint. Each one that he considered appeared a monster of abominable and insolent conceit. Humanity was gone from them; they were toddling idols of stone and varnish, worshipping themselves and greedy for though oblivious of worship from their fellow graven images. Frozen, cruel, implacable, impervious, cut to an identical pattern, they hurried on their ways like statues brought by some miracles to motion, while soul and feeling lay unaroused in the reluctant marble.

Gradually Raggles became conscious of certain types. One was an elderly gentleman with a snow-white, short beard, pink, unwrinkled face and stony, sharp blue eyes, attired in the fashion of a gilded youth, who seemed to personify the city's wealth, ripeness and frigid unconcern. Another type was a woman, tall, beautiful, clear as a steel engraving, goddess-like, calm, clothed like the princesses of old, with eyes as coldly blue as the reflection of sunlight on a glacier. And another was a by-product of this town of marionettes‚Äîa broad, swaggering, grim, threateningly sedate fellow, with a jowl as large as a harvested wheat field, the complexion of a baptized infant and the knuckles of a prize-fighter. This type leaned against cigar signs and viewed the world with frapp√©d contumely.

A poet is a sensitive creature, and Raggles soon shrivelled in the bleak embrace of the undecipherable. The chill, sphinx-like, ironical, illegible, unnatural, ruthless expression of the city left him downcast and bewildered. Had it no heart? Better the woodpile, the scolding of vinegar-faced housewives at back doors, the kindly spleen of bartenders behind provincial free-lunch counters, the amiable truculence of rural constables, the kicks, arrests and happy-go-lucky chances of the other vulgar, loud, crude cities than this freezing heartlessness.

Raggles summoned his courage and sought alms from the populace. Unheeding, regardless, they passed on without the wink of an eyelash to testify that they were conscious of his existence. And then he said to himself that this fair but pitiless city of Manhattan was without a soul; that its inhabitants were manikins moved by wires and springs, and that he was alone in a great wilderness.

Raggles started to cross the street. There was a blast, a roar, a hissing and a crash as something struck him and hurled him over and over six yards from where he had been. As he was coming down like the stick of a rocket the earth and all the cities thereof turned to a fractured dream.

Raggles opened his eyes. First an odor made itself known to him‚Äîan odor of the earliest spring flowers of Paradise. And then a hand soft as a falling petal touched his brow. Bending over him was the woman clothed like the princess of old, with blue eyes, now soft and humid with human sympathy. Under his head on the pavement were silks and furs. With Raggles's hat in his hand and with his face pinker than ever from a vehement burst of oratory against reckless driving, stood the elderly gentleman who personified the city's wealth and ripeness. From a nearby caf√© hurried the by-product with the vast jowl and baby complexion, bearing a glass full of a crimson fluid that suggested delightful possibilities.

""Drink dis, sport,"" said the by-product, holding the glass to Raggles's lips.

Hundreds of people huddled around in a moment, their faces wearing the deepest concern. Two flattering and gorgeous policemen got into the circle and pressed back the overplus of Samaritans. An old lady in a black shawl spoke loudly of camphor; a newsboy slipped one of his papers beneath Raggles's elbow, where it lay on the muddy pavement. A brisk young man with a notebook was asking for names.

A bell clanged importantly, and the ambulance cleaned a lane through the crowd. A cool surgeon slipped into the midst of affairs.

""How do you feel, old man?"" asked the surgeon, stooping easily to his task. The princess of silks and satins wiped a red drop or two from Raggles's brow with a fragrant cobweb.

""Me?"" said Raggles, with a seraphic smile, ""I feel fine.""

He had found the heart of his new city.

In three days they let him leave his cot for the convalescent ward in the hospital. He had been in there an hour when the attendants heard sounds of conflict. Upon investigation they found that Raggles had assaulted and damaged a brother convalescent‚Äîa glowering transient whom a freight train collision had sent in to be patched up.

""What's all this about?"" inquired the head nurse.

""He was runnin' down me town,"" said Raggles.

""What town?"" asked the nurse.

""Noo York,"" said Raggles.",nyc,The Making of a New Yorker

7540,RaspberrySyncope,1584418450,fjywqh,Nan,"First of all I just want to say that it‚Äôs insanely frustrating being chronically ill at 31 and having the whole world really only consider the elderly as being the vulnerable population. A 70 year old has a better chance of surviving the coronavirus than I do. I have a neuroimmune illness called ME/CFS. And I‚Äôd like to just get to the point of how absurd and existentially petrifying this pandemic is for people like me (of which there are tens of millions) especially when seeing posts and photos and crowds clearly larger than ten and so many people not giving a shit about legal restrictions.   
   

As someone who has THE most debilitating chronic illness (confirmed in multiple academic journals) and am extremely immunocompromised, if I catch SARS-CoV-19 I have like zero chance of survival. So if your apathy, amusement, denial, and risky actions don‚Äôt make you pause for a minute and think about people like me, you need to ask yourself some deep questions.   

This is the reality of what will happen to me and everybody like me if people don‚Äôt get their immature shit together. I‚Äôm sorry this post is so long, but I wanted to include a lot of details to really help folks understand what immunocompromised people are facing.   


Let‚Äôs go over this for a minute. If I arrive at a hospital (I am too physically ill to walk to a clinic - or anywhere) I will be greeted by medical staff who have no idea what ME/CFS is despite it affecting over tens of millions US citizens. It is still not taught in medical schools due to politics, stigma, and sexism. I would need to have the clinician‚Äôs guide to ME/CFS on me for them to figure it out and even believe I‚Äôm immunocompromised, as well as a list of medications that MUST be administered every day for ME. Next they‚Äôre not going to understand why I literally cannot sit up, speak, or grasp a pen to write with. I will be physically paralyzed as a result of exacerbated ME core symptoms. Like, think catatonic level paralysis.   


They will take vitals and become immensely confused when every autonomic metric is insanely out of line for both healthy people AND those with COVID-19. 
My body has been incapable of even mounting a fever for the last seven years. My low blood oxygen levels and BP will give them a false alarm of impending ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) which will mean they will likely ignore monitors that would preemptively detect actual ARDS. So that‚Äôs one way I could just immediately die on the spot in like five minutes. 
They will take my tachycardia, low BP, and rapid shallow breathing as being immediately and solely symptomatic of the virus, when meanwhile this is just how I live now. So they are going to be confused - as am I, as I won‚Äôt know which worsening symptoms to attribute to which illness. Again, I will not be able to move or speak and hospital settings trigger EVERY sensory issue that comes with ME/CFS.    


I will need a ventilator asap as I have enough trouble breathing with just ME and its respiratory inflammation.
The coronavirus has been accurately described to produce immense respiratory inflammation by ‚Äúflooding it with cytokines.‚Äù That also roughly defines the literal mechanism of action of ME/CFS. This means I will either suffocate to death quickly or need extremely strong steroids to bring the viral inflammation down (steroids have no affect on ME inflammation). So contracting this virus basically puts me in a position of having DOUBLE ME/CFS in an incredibly critical location (yes hi hello lungs and all other respiratory components).   


Next is congestive heart failure. Many have died from this alone with the virus if they have heart conditions. I know this might take many by surprise but ME also causes abnormal heart activity and both my heart and body circulation are autonomically just out of control doing their cardiac dysfunction dance.  


Now let‚Äôs say I‚Äôve cleared these first three hurdles somehow. Being immunocompromised means I am extremely susceptible to secondary infections like pneumonia, strep, bronchitis, possibly sepsis, and the like. I don‚Äôt know how or how long it would take them to identify the bacterial respiratory conditions from all the other shit, but they better get those antibiotics fast or I‚Äôm, again, dead. Also there‚Äôs a chance that the abx won‚Äôt be effective at all or quickly enough so I‚Äôll just die from the infections anyway since I have literally ZERO antibodies in that area according to my labs. There will likely be more than one secondary infection as well.   


If I‚Äôve made it this far, somebody will have to address both my sleep and pain issues. They are not allowed to give me enough ambien to actually induce sleep, opiates have no proven effect on ME neuropathic pain, they are not allowed to give me a dosage of ANY benzo that would be effective, and any novel drug they do give me will stop working after three days and they‚Äôll need a new plan. My tolerance is such that I woke up in the middle of surgery after only the third time, meaning after just 3 doses of propofol (anesthesia) I already developed a tolerance and they had to increase my dose above the clinical dose for someone my size. I also developed an immediate tolerance to Xyrem (GHB) so I can‚Äôt even be roofied. I once ended up taking like 30mg of a CII where people have died from 5mg... I felt nothing and forgot I had even taken the pills. So yeah, the pain and the insomnia would be indescribable if they can‚Äôt manage my ability to sleep or level 10 on the pain scale. My body will shut down purely due to lack of ATP and weak immune activity, and succumb to the SARS-CoV-19 viral activity itself if I don‚Äôt sleep (which I can‚Äôt without enough medication to match my rapid drug metabolism and high tolerances so this is serious).   


If I survived, I think I will have wished I didn‚Äôt. The post-viral symptoms would make my life that much more unlivable.
Reinfection of the virus has been reported hundreds of times as well, and now scientists are starting to wonder if it‚Äôs like the herpes viruses in that it stays dormant  in your body forever. This is a prominent theory of what drives the immune dysfunction in ME/CFS patients. So again, my life after corona won‚Äôt be livable.

Seeing how I was one of the last foreign tourists in a forseeable future, I though you'd might like be party to a couple things that struck me as odd about your town, compared to my home of Denmark.

Be aware that this is all in good fun, and in no way supposed to be me complaining about how you do things. You do you, New York. Wouldn't be much fun to travel if things weren't weird.

Anyways:

- Pedestrian Crossing Lights  
These seem to be purely advisory in nature. After observing the natives, I figured out GREEN means ""The cars are supposed to stop for you, take care out there."" RED (blinking) is ""Move slightly faster on your way across, thanks"", while RED (solid) is ""There might be cars in your way. Godspeed."" As for lights for cars, there are helpful signs like ""Stop on red"", for when they really mean it.

- Number of skin, eyebrow and nail technicians as a ratio against total population is approaching 1:1  
Should I be ashamed of my nails? I know I am now, but should I be?

- Construction  
There seem to be plenty of people doing nothing. I observed 6 people in high-vis standing around talking in the street and shuffling things, while a single jackhammer or such was heard at work inside. I reasoned it was a break, and the one guy working was a ""rookie"" or somewhat of lesser statue.

- Law Enforcement  
The Emergency Lighting seems to be on as standard. I came across an officer sitting in his patrol car, checking his phone and drinking coffee, with lights flashing. Had it been here, flashing blue lights would mean people clearing the streets and having cell phones recording, because things would be *going down.*

- Crossing Guards at Schools  
These are adults, here. Grown adults, not older kids. How does the older students earn a trip to the capitol here, I wonder.

- I am underdressed  
It is 60 degrees fahrenheit, and I am wearing a light coat over my shirt. New Yorkers wear hats, sometimes with a cover inside the hat, gloves, a stout overcoat, scarves, and weatherproof footwear.  And they look cold, and are giving me sideways glances.

- (Street Number / 2) / 100  
This is the formula for the percentage of how sure you are you're going to get mugged.

- I am the whitest person in town  
At home, I am considered of normal complexion, if not a bit tanned, as I spend time in nature. In New York, I am pasty pale. Everyone is a darker shade.

- Tipping is a science  
You must, apparently, weigh in actual service recieved, plus chance of not wanting to be an asshole, minus the chance of not being taken advantage of, plus social indignation, minus ""how is this even a service?"", minus general mood of the whole day. Even then you feel bad about your tip.",nyc,"""Observations &amp; Curiosities, as Recollected by a Scandinavian in the City of NEW YORK"", circa 2020 (colourized)"

My dad has offered to rent an RV and drive up from KY to get me. It‚Äôd be a 48 hour endeavor just for him to get here. I don‚Äôt have any symptoms but since I‚Äôm in nyc I fear I could be a carrier and don‚Äôt want to pass it to my parents or anyone else in KY. My boyfriend told me tonight that his coworkers bf tested positive, and given he saw her last on Friday, the likelihood of me being a carrier is even higher.

My parents don‚Äôt have underlying health issues but at 59 I‚Äôm just not comfortable w the risk but at the same time am dreading the potential loneliness of being quarantined alone here in nyc white things are getting scary. My boyfriend is allergic to my cats so him staying at my place long term isn‚Äôt an option...and I can‚Äôt stay w him cause I have to take care of my cats.

Is it a terrible idea to take my dad up on his offer to get me so that I can have some support and not be alone in possibly the worst place to be in this country? I am 90% leaning towards thinking it‚Äôs a bad idea to risk spreading it...",nyc,Should I get out of nyc?

My place or employment closed down and I will not be able to work. I was not fired or laid off we were asked not to come in this week. My work is reliant on the school system ( I don‚Äôt work in a school) so I most likely won‚Äôt be back until schools are back.

Other info. My boss sent an email saying we will get paid for this week. Once schools were cancelled my other boss sent an email and by the sound I don‚Äôt this we are getting paid for the week. 

Communications sucks from the employer and they did not provide us any info. The secretary told me that the place is screwed because of all the lost income from school trips and programs. 

Could I use sick time for a week and wait it out? 

Should I just apply for unemployment, even though I was not officially fired, laid off or told about anything passes this week?

Should I email my boss ask if we will be in before April 20th and if she says yes then apply?

I've been using homechef (similar to blue apron or hello fresh) for a few months now, and this is not an advertisement by any means, but so far nothing has indicated to me that they will be stopping deliveries in the midst of this crisis. I get 5 two-serving meals every week, and this week's box just arrived. They have other options (i.e. more servings/fewer meals).

This is potentially a stupid idea for the following reasons:

1. Not everyone can afford these services, especially those out of work
2. These companies likely can't handle an outrageous increase in customers right now
3. Delivery companies may be suspending services at some point
4. Probably more but those feel like the big ones

All that being said, if you can afford it and are worried about getting everything you need for proper meals at the grocery store, I might look into one of these guys. Plus, the actual act of cooking the meal is a good way of keeping busy/active at home as well.

**This is at 3 am in UWS Manhattan:**

""The ambulance rattled at the speed of light through Manhattan‚Äôs vivacious Upper West Side....""

""The stretcher coasted through the crowded corridor of the century-old Mount Sinai Hospital. The smell of sanitized plastic wafted through the sterilized hallways.""

"" Students rushed in and out of the Columbia University Student Affairs office. In the marble-walled hall, people in their respective rooms argued about financial aid allotment, course registration, and graduation applications.""

**Other scenes:**

""In the bodega, merchandise piled over each other. The thin columns between the shelves made it hard to find anything at all.""

**Robbery of the bodega:**  

""The crash of a door knocked off its hinges reached Majed's ears. A husky man in a thick hoodie burst in. His sunglasses and heavy hat shielded his identity.

""Oh, shit."" Majed‚Äôs whole body froze.

""You already know what it is!"" the husky man yelled while slamming the Glock on the counter.

Carlos looked as unamused as he always did when checking out Majed‚Äôs wares. He unlocked his cash register and handed the husky man, whose hands shook from nerves, a couple of sorted bills in ten seconds. Just as quickly as he flew in, the robber whipped around and faced Majed head-on.

‚ÄúYou know what to do!‚Äù the husky man said, pointing the gun to Majed‚Äôs nose.

Standing there, Majed saw a man could end his entire life in a split second with the application of subtle pressure on a trigger. He dropped his grocery bag as all his senses disappeared.

‚ÄúDamn, you‚Äôre not even worth the bullet.‚Äù The mugger ripped the wallet out of Majed‚Äôs hands. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even get robbed right!‚Äù

He dashed out the door as sirens went off in the background.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Sitting on the red leather seat in the back of the black Mercedes, Majed gnawed at his thumbnails. 

Clutching the wheel, Paul cruised down the streets of NYC. As the journey progressed (what neighborhood could I set his destination to?), the lights got a little dimmer, and the grime got realer. The potholes deepened, rattling the car like an old rocking chair.""

**What part of NYC could this be:**

""As Majed rest his head on the bus‚Äôs windows on the way to work, he observed the cultural landscape of NYC. Sex was everywhere. It was in the billboards, advertisements, TV shows, music, and prancing around the streets.""

""After a hectic day of organizing daily club appearances, concerts, and acting gigs, Majed entered his family‚Äôs Upper East Side villa.""

I like running too. It's one of my favorite forms of exercise. But don't be a dick about it. We are all supposed to keep about 6 feet away from other people right now. Do the best you can to keep your distance from others. If you don't know how to run without keeping distance from others, you shouldn't be running right now. 


Here's some tips:


If you don't have room to pass with a safe distance from others, slow your pace and wait until you do.


If you're running with others, don't run side-by-side if there are other people around who you'll be passing. Go in to single file then. Otherwise, the people walking have to get squashed between your group.


Honestly though, most of the people who nearly hit in to me today had zero reason to do so, I was one of the few people out on the road I was on, there was ample space.


Also, two days ago, one actually *spit* while running and it landed on my husband. Disgusting. People, don't do this.

They'll be reimbursing up to $50 per family for grocery costs for as long as they have the funds to do so. I've shared with all those I know who use SNAP, and hope this can help others.

Stay safe, everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;These are unprecedented times, and it's inspiring to see communities rising to the challenge. However, not everyone has the resources to ""shelter in place"" especially the millions of people in the [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program) (SNAP). Living paycheck to paycheck is hard when millions of businesses around the nation are closing down indefinitely, and hourly workers (including those dependent upon tips) are the hardest hit. In particular, families with kids whose primary meals happen at school are especially vulnerable when those schools shut down.  
&gt;  
&gt;With this in mind, Expensify.org is going to temporarily redirect all of its charitable funds to Expensify.org/hunger. With its ability to reimburse volunteers directly in real-time, Expensify.org is uniquely positioned to help families in need immediately. Until today, this fund was focused on paying off kids' [""lunch debts""](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/school-lunch-debt-lunch-shaming-problem-needs-national-solution-ncna1066461) , but with schools closed around the nation, that isn't the top priority. Instead, we're devoting everything to a new program: matching SNAP grocery purchases up to $50 per family. It works like this:  
&gt;  
&gt;Purchase food as normal with your SNAP card  
&gt;

&gt;Set up your [bank account](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5864/how-to-add-a-personal-bank-account-to-receive-reimbursement) to receive the funds  
&gt;  
&gt;So long as we have funds available, we will reimburse up to $50 per family (one time), the very next day.  
&gt;  
&gt;To be clear, we can't commit to reimbursing every single person in need ‚Äî we have no idea how many people will do this, and unfortunately, we don't have unlimited funds. We also don't know how long this crisis will last and how far our brand new charity's resources will stretch. But we're going to do what we can with the funds donated on behalf of Expensify Cardholders via the [Karma Points](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5984/the-case-for-karma-points-the-only-card-reward-that-makes-a-difference) feature, as well as by the extremely generous donors who have signed up for our [Corporate and Personal Karma](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5997/two-new-easy-ways-for-any-expensify-user-to-make-a-difference-corporate-and-personal-karma) programs.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a truly global crisis, and it is only beginning. We all need to work together to weather the storm, and on behalf of Expensify.org's many generous members, we're eager to help.  
&gt;

&gt;

Trader Joe's on 32nd st was packed this morning due to potential coming shelter-in-place. I was in the middle of a long line for checkout

A man tried to cut the line in front of me but failed. (I'm sure he intended to do it because staff was hold ""check out end of line"" sign right near by, he just wait the staff turn around and then tried.) Later I found him behind me.

 I stopped, talked to the man who was originally behind me LOUDLY: ""Sir, YOU were behind me, not him"". got answer: ""I don't know how he get here, he just cut the line, Hmmm, I'm OK with that"".

&amp;#x200B;

I let it go because dude was OK with that. I was planning to push more aggressively and finally evict the line cutter out of there, though. I was not seeking support from others but going to do it all alone.

7936,IrishinManhattan617,1584555701,fkubvl,Nan,"Most of us on reddit are not in the high ""at risk"" group, but our neighbors may be.  These neighbors won't access the internet as much, creating a bit of an information void.  In addition, they aren't as able to go outside generally, and will be very hesitant to do so now.  Old folk need help, but conversely they are also loathe to ask for it.  

So here is what I did in my building.

* First, go to your super and ask them to identify all persons who are 65 or older, or have an underlying condition - you will be shocked at how well your super or doorman knows everyone.  You'll also be surprised at just how many old folk are female (blew my mind - us fellas don't do well in those numbers).

* Second, get each of their names and their apartment numbers from the super or doorman.

* Third, ask the super or doorman which are very mobile, which have been recently seen going out a lot, which have left for the other family, or which have family who they can rely on - this is just helpful information to know how to target and who may not even be home or need your help.

* Fourth, write up a letter introducing yourself - give your name, phone number, and apartment number.  Explain that you are available to run any errand for them outside the building (grocery shopping, food pick up, pick up medication), and explain that you're also happy to talk to them about the virus if they have any questions - see my letter below.

* Fifth and most importantly, wash your hands thoroughly before and after drafting the letters - minimize transmission.  Then spray disinfectant on the letters (don't worry, it dries quick).  Flip them again, and do the same with the back, and the envelopes.  Then, if you want to be EXTRA cautious, you can leave the letters overnight for any potential infection to die off. 

* Sixth, wash your hands thoroughly again, and put on gloves (this is NOT likely to help, but will put them at ease when you open the door - to show you are being protective).

* Seventh, go door to door in your building to those who are older.  Knock on the door and take two big steps back.  When they answer the door, maintain a minimum of 3 feet distance and talk downwards (tilt head).  Explain who you are, and that you're hear to help; both by answering any questions about the virus and running errands.

* Eighth, you aren't available all the time and there are a lot of old folk in many buildings.  Explain that you will always be available for certain hours (pick a four hour block on weekends), and then say you may be otherwise available during the week but it all depends.

The response? 

* I made contact with 80% of the residents; I keep trying to make contact with one or two of them who the super does not think has left, because I'm concerned they are locking themselves inside - no dice

* Of the 80% I made contact with, I was surprised that 100% were incredibly grateful (I expected some independent older folk to be insulted - they weren't).  In fact, two older women cried, one especially so as she had been very frightened and didn't have family.  I was surprised I had not thought of the fear folk may have in that age group, and that they may be abandoned, but ""rent control"" actually allows very, very old folk to be financially independent in the city.

* Of the 80% that I made contact with, 50% have actively reached out after I made contact and asked for help; thus far, no issues managing the load, but my point is that there is demand for this.

I am writing to see if anyone would be willing to loan us their apartment during this time for our nanny. My husband is a healthcare worker and I have been working full time from home. We are hoping to figure out some arrangement whereby our nanny can stay nearby and care for our 14 month old son while we both work. One of us would pick her up and drop her off by car everyday to ensure she doesn‚Äôt have to take public transport. She currently resides in Brooklyn which is unfortunately too far to do this everyday, so we are looking for someplace a bit closer. We live on the upper west side but think anywhere in Manhattan would work.

If anyone has an empty apartment they would be willing to let us use (and we‚Äôd be happy to have a discussion on price too), that would be greatly appreciated. I know that a lot of people have migrated from the city. We would of course pay for a full cleaning afterwards, bring our own sheets, etc - whatever you are comfortable with!

So lets shut that down so during these times, doctors and nurses and what ever emergency workers have to find other ways to get to work, spending maybe an extra few minutes on these moving petri dishes. 

Lets have a train sitting at a station for 20 minutes because theyre using a single track to run both directions of train traffic.

8046,bonyponyride,1584583421,fl1wwz,COVID-19,"My fellow citizens,

The coronavirus is currently changing life in our country dramatically. Our ideas of normality, of public life, of social interaction - all of these are being put to the test as never before. Millions of you can't go to work, your children can't go to school or go to daycare, theatres and cinemas and shops are closed, and, perhaps the hardest thing: we all miss the encounters that are otherwise taken for granted.

Of course, in such a situation, each of us is full of questions and worries about how to go on. I turn to you today on this unusual path because I want to tell you what guides me as Chancellor and all my colleagues in the Federal Government in this situation. This is part and parcel of an open democracy: that we also make political decisions transparent and explain them. That we justify and communicate our actions as well as possible so that they are comprehensible. I firmly believe that we will succeed in this task if really all citizens see it as YOUR task.

So let me say that this is serious. Take it seriously too. Since German reunification, no, since the Second World War, there has not been a challenge to our country that depends so much on our joint solidarity. I would like to explain to you where we currently stand in the epidemic, what the Federal Government and the levels of government are doing to protect everyone in our community and limit the economic, social and cultural damage. But I would also like to explain to you why you are needed for this and what each and every one of you can contribute.

As far as the epidemic is concerned - and everything I am telling you about it comes from the Federal Government's ongoing consultations with the experts of the Robert Koch Institute and other scientists and virologists: research is being carried out under high pressure worldwide, but there is still neither a therapy against the coronavirus nor a vaccine. As long as this is the case, there is only one thing we can do, and that is to slow down the spread of the virus, stretch it over the months and thus gain time. Time for research to develop a drug and a vaccine. But above all time so that those who fall ill can receive the best possible care.

Germany has an excellent healthcare system, perhaps one of the best in the world. That can give us confidence. But our hospitals would also be completely overwhelmed if too many patients who suffer a severe course of corona infection were admitted in the shortest possible time. These are not just abstract numbers in a statistic, but a father or grandfather, a mother or grandmother, a partner, they are people. And we are a community in which every life and every person counts.

I would like to take this opportunity to address first and foremost all those who work as doctors, in the nursing service or in any other function in our hospitals and in the health care system in general. They are at the forefront of this struggle. They are the first to see the sick and how severe some courses of infection are. And every day you go back to your work and are there for the people. What you do is tremendous, and I thank you for it with all my heart.

So: the aim is to slow down the virus on its way through Germany. And in doing so, we have to rely on one thing, which is existential: to shut down public life as far as possible. Of course, with reason and a sense of proportion, because the state will continue to function, the supply will of course continue to be secured and we want to preserve as much economic activity as possible. But everything that could endanger people, everything that could harm the individual, but also the community, we must reduce that now.

We must limit the risk of one infecting the other as much as we can. I know how dramatic the restrictions are already: no more events, no more fairs, no more concerts and, for the time being, no more school, no university, no kindergarten, no playing in a playground. I know how hard the closures, which have been agreed upon by the federal and state governments, interfere with our lives and also with our democratic self-image.

They are restrictions such as have never been seen before in the Federal Republic. Let me assure you: For someone like me, for whom freedom of travel and movement was a hard-won right, such restrictions can only be justified as an absolute necessity. In a democracy, they should never be decided lightly and only temporarily - but at the moment they are indispensable to save lives.

That is why the tightened border controls and entry restrictions to some of our most important neighbouring countries have been in force since the beginning of the week. It is already very difficult for the economy, for large companies as well as small businesses, for shops, restaurants, freelancers. The coming weeks will be even harder.

I can assure you: The German government is doing everything it can to cushion the economic impact - and above all to preserve jobs. We can and will do everything we can to help our employers and employees through this difficult test.

And everyone can rest assured that the food supply is secure at all times, and if shelves are emptied for a day, they will be refilled. I would like to say to everyone who travels around the supermarkets: stockpiling makes sense, it always has, by the way. But with moderation; hoarding, as if nothing would ever happen again, is pointless and ultimately completely lacking in solidarity.

And let me also express my thanks here to people who are too rarely thanked. These days, anyone who sits at a supermarket checkout or fills shelves is doing one of the hardest jobs there is at the moment. Thank you for being there for your fellow citizens and literally keeping the place running. Now to what I feel is the most urgent need today: all government measures would come to nothing if we did not use the most effective means of combating the virus spreading too quickly: and that is ourselves. Just as any one of us, indiscriminately, can be affected by the virus, so now everyone must help.

First and foremost, by taking seriously what we are talking about today. Don't panic, but don't think for a moment that he or she really matters. No one is expendable. Everyone counts, it takes all our efforts. This is what an epidemic shows us: how vulnerable we all are, how dependent we are on the considerate behavior of others, but also: how we can protect and strengthen each other by acting together.

It depends on the individual. We are not condemned to passively accept the spread of this virus. We have a cure for it: We have to keep our distance out of consideration for each other. The advice of the virologists is clear: no more handshakes, wash your hands thoroughly and often, at least one and a half metres away from the next person and, preferably, hardly any contact with the very old, because they are particularly at risk. I know how difficult it is to do what is required of us. We want to be close to each other, especially in times of need.

We know affection as physical closeness or touch. But right now, unfortunately, the opposite is true. And that's what we all need to understand: Right now, distance is the only way to express caring. The well-intentioned visit, the journey that did not have to be, all this can be contagious and should really not take place now. There is a reason why the experts say: grandparents and grandchildren should not get together now.

If you avoid unnecessary meetings, you will help all those who have to deal with more cases every day in the hospitals. This is how we save lives. This will be difficult for many, and that's what it will come down to: not leaving anyone alone to take care of those who need encouragement and confidence. As families and as a society, we will find other ways to help each other. There are already many creative forms that defy the virus and its social consequences.

Already there are grandchildren who are recording a podcast for their grandparents so they won't be lonely. We all have to find ways to show affection and friendship: Skype, phone calls, emails and maybe write letters again. The mail is delivered. We now hear about wonderful examples of neighbourhood help for the elderly who cannot go shopping themselves. I am sure there is much more to come and we will show as a community that we do not leave each other alone.

I appeal to you: stick to the rules that now apply for the near future. As a government, we will always re-examine what can be corrected, but also what may still be necessary. This is a dynamic situation, and we will remain capable of learning from it, so that we can always rethink and react with other instruments. We will then explain that too. That is why I ask you not to believe rumours, but only the official communications, which we always have translated into many languages.

We are a democracy. We do not live by force, but by shared knowledge and participation. This is a historic task and it can only be accomplished together. I am absolutely certain that we will overcome this crisis. But how high will the victims be? How many loved ones will we lose? It is largely in our own hands. We can now, resolutely, all react together. We can accept the current limitations and stand by each other.

This situation is serious and it is open. This means that it will depend not only, but also on how disciplined everyone follows and implements the rules. We must show, even if we have never experienced anything like this before, that we act cordially and reasonably and thus save lives. Without exception, it depends on each individual and therefore on all of us.

Take good care of yourself and your loved ones. I thank you.",nyc,"In case you're missing a sense of leadership and solidarity in this health crisis, here's today's speech by Angela Merkel translated into English"

By Tina Moore and Daniel CassadyMarch 17, 2020 | 10:36am


An Asian woman was assaulted in Manhattan by a stranger who blamed her for the spread of COVID-19, the latest case of a suspected coronavirus-inspired hate crime, police and sources said.

The 34-year-old woman was walking north on Madison Avenue near East 25th Street in Manhattan around 6:15 p.m. Monday when Lynn Ferguson, of the Bronx, walked up to her and spat in her face after blaming her for the spread of the deadly virus, cops said.

When the woman tried to walk away, Ferguson, 33, attacked her, yanking at her hair hard enough to pull some of the hair out, cops and sources said.

Ferguson was apprehended by a traffic agent who saw the scuffle, and was later arrested, sources said.

She was charged with hate crime assault, aggravated assault as a hate crime, possession of a hypodermic instrument, and possession of marijuana, cops said.

The victim was treated and released at the scene, sources said.

Hello friends. I'm Rasul (go by Russell). I'm an immigrant newyorker since 2016 and was trying and doing my best to achieve my American Dream in NYC. I tried so many jobs and gigs, but driving for ride-sharing apps like Uber/Lyft/Juno was the best option for me to learn English from natives and improving my socializing skills, which I desperately wanted. I've been doing it for 2.5 years and did my best to provide top-notch service. I organized my car in a way that every passenger will be satisfied riding with me. I had candies, gums, hand sanitizer, chargers, tissue, bottled water, puke bags for drunk passengers, Advil/Tylenol since day one. [I'll be attaching photos of my car's interior as well as my Uber Driver profile]. And newyorkers really appreciated my effort and my rating has been 4.99 for a long time. But there's no reward from Uber to have such a high rating, but I was really doing it for people. Just wanted to make my fellow newyorkers day a little better with ""Smarties and Jolly Ranchers"". But I also became heavily depressed for no reason since 2017. It's been with me since then. Slow paced, but continues depression that I'm experiencing, is hard to explain. And that depression made me to finally give up everything and end it all together. It was hard for me to decide, but I have no other choice (unless someone magically helps me to solve my problems, which is very unlikely) Long story short: I failed. I failed my American Dream. I failed my family. I failed the US. I couldn't do anything that I can be proud of during my life in here. I'm just a nobody who lives in Brooklyn and makes money only to pay bills and food. Couldn't save anything. Couldn't really socialize. Dropped out of college. Couldn't find any legitimate friends. And now, with this coronovirus epidemic, I'm financially ruined. There are no rides. I'm already in debt for car rental, my apartment bills, and some money I borrowed from friends. Today, was the last straw. I'm just giving up. I left my shithole country thinking I can achieve something big in the land of opportunities, but in reality, if person is a loser, they will be loser wherever they go. I haven't seen my mama, papa, bro, sis for more than 4 years and miss them a lot. It's going to hurt them so bad. But I can't stand it anymore. So, yeah, fellow redditors. You're reading some poor loser guy's last farewell rant. I still have some things to do before ... you know... ""the end"". So if you have any good things to write, please do it. I'm desperately missed warm emotions and good words from people. Also I want to give away my coin collection to someone who is a real numismatist like myself. So, yeah, people. Take care of your emotional and physical health. At the end of the day, without those two things in tact your life is gonna be miserable like the one I have. I'm so sorry.... I love you Mom. I love you Dad. I love you sis. I love you bro. Please forgive me for making you to face this. I'm really sorry üòî If anyone still reading this, thank you for being a good human being. I have 2-3 days to organize everything and give my collection to someone worthy.

The attack happened around 1 p.m. at the Associated Supermarket on Louis Nine Boulevard in Claremont Village section.

Police said the suspect was upset his groceries weren‚Äôt delivered in a timely fashion.

He allegedly visited the store and confronted the 69-year-old deliveryman, who had gotten lost and returned.

Police said the suspect punched the deliveryman in the face, causing him to hit his head on the ground and lose consciousness.

When the 67-year-old manager intervened, the suspect allegedly punched him in the face, too.

Police said the man took off heading west on Jennings Street.

The deliveryman was rushed to St. Barnabas Hospital in serious but stable condition, while the manager went to another hospital on his own and was treated for cuts and bruises.

I work for the Mount Sinai Health System and we are being told a few things. First, we must preserve PPE. Second, we are out of some PPE. Finally, if we are sick stay home but if we have been exposed to known COVID cases, just come to work anyway because we are short staffed. 

Great, but here's the kicker...

Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai West, and Mount Sinai Beth Israel are still doing elective, non-urgent surgeries. These surgeries not only expose patients to potentially infected healthcare workers but they also expose countless doctors, nurses, techs, and aides to potentially infected patients. Not only this, each surgery uses dozens of gloves, 6-10 face masks, ventilator tubing, drugs, supplies, etc. Some of these surgeries are for cancer (that's can't wait) or life threatening situations, but many of these surgeries are for purely non-urgent conditions or cancers that are slower growing and can be delayed or treated with other forms of therapy (chemo/radiation). 

I wish someone with a real voice would call them out on this practice. The doctors can't stop because they have contractual obligations and the hospital won't stop because they don't want to lose more money.

As you step up your normal cleaning routine and sanitize your home, don‚Äôt forget about your fine surfaces, such as upholstery, carpet, and rugs. These surfaces are often overlooked. The couch is a cozy, comforting place to rest when one has a virus. Although we cannot claim to completely eliminate the possibility of preventing the spread of the new strain of coronavirus, or any virus for that matter, we can tell you that the conditions created by professional carpet cleaning are not hospitable to the infectious lifespan of viruses. Proper professional carpet and upholstery cleaning involves both heat and moisture, so having your carpets and upholstery cleaned can help ease your mind.

For context, I've been living in NYC for 6 months and my parents live on LI. My mom is strongly asking me to head back but I'm hesitant.

4. I live in a 2 unit building, there are only 3 people living here (my roommate and I in one apt, neighbor upstairs), and we're all stocked with food for a month, ready for iso
5. If things do take a turn for the worse, I don't think LI hospitals will be any better equipped than NYC hospitals for emergency care due to population density

My boyfriend and I left the city to his parents vacation home about a week ago before the coronavirus situation got super bad. We were expecting to come back after the weekend but the news has made us stay put to see how the situation in nyc plays out. We would happily stay put until the situation resolved since we can both work remotely - the problem is our two cats are still in our apartment. My friend is checking on them and changing their water and litter but since we don‚Äôt know how long this is going to last we really want them next to us. 

Our options are this: 
1. Head back to the city and bunker down with the cats potentially getting COVID-19 in our travel exposure. 

2. Head back to the city and grab our cats and go to my parents house in PA but potentially expose my diabetic father to COVID-19 from our city exposure. 

3. Stay in Florida until the city stabilizes and just let my friend continue to check in on the cats.

Right now, there are many people out there spreading the virus via droplets coming out from their mouth and nose, and they do not know they are infected. These people are either asymptomatic or they have mistaken their Corona virus with the common cold, since they share the same symptoms. There have even been [studies](https://coronawiki.org/page/study-17-9-of-people-with-covid-19-coronavirus-had-no-symptoms) of people remaining asymptomatic for the whole duration of their sickness. These people are constantly contaminating surfaces such as door knobs, hand rails, chairs, tables, etc and infecting other people through those things. You and I could easily be one of these people, and not know about it, because there are not enough test kits for everyone to be tested.

Having everyone wear face masks is the most obvious solution besides social distancing, to prevent these people from spreading their virus. I know there is a shortage of surgical masks and n95 masks. But those masks are not necessary and should be reserved for healthcare workers. Any kind of facial covering would be effective in preventing the virus from leaving people's mouths, such as scarves, bandanas, shirts, paper towels, etc.

People really need to change their stigma about wearing masks, and start wearing masks. We have already taken extraordinary measures to prevent the virus, so why not take the most obvious one? Wearing masks will help mitigate the spread of the virus and flatten the curve faster so we can resume our normal lives.",nyc,Covering your face with a mask needs to be mandatory

**Tl;Dr** I've spent all week in the city and the cops are really going after cars.  Lots of towings and tickets.  Be careful!

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a hospitality company and have been working hard to shutter all our locations, get everything cleaned for long term storage, and most importantly transporting food to one central venue where we are cooking it and giving it away for free to any laid off restaurant worker.

Scum bag NYPD towed me after I parked my car for 3 hours.  Called 311 and it said the reason was for street cleaning which has been suspended.  Car is in my Girlfriend's father's companies name so it was a complete nightmare getting my car back.  Took 3 trips to the Tow Pound.  The stories I heard while I was there were insanely unfair.  One of the employees (I'm not sure if they are cops or not) was bragging about how busy they had been this week.

When I finally got my car there was a ticket envelop on it with nothing inside.  App says I don't have a ticket.  I guess they just did it for a little extra revenue.  

Went back in today to clean out another restaurant and clean out my personal belongings in my office.  I was so paranoid I had friends help keep watch of the car.  I saw so many traffic cops out giving tickets and pulling people over.  Lot's of tow trucks with fresh catches driving around.  I don't know why but they're having an absolute field day.  They've gone haywire!

Unfortunately that seems like that will never happen, and while the government is being praised for cutting the workforce of most industries, we are still expected to report to work every day on job sites with hundreds, if not thousands, of other workers commuting from all over the tri state area. Not coming to work is not an option because we will in fact lose our jobs. 

It was beginning to seem that the only way they would realize the severity of the situation would be once someone got the virus at work. This morning, I was informed a onsite worker has tested positive for the virus and we were instructed to stay home. FINALLY they are coming to their senses right? WRONG! We were then informed that the entire site would be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized and they would hope to re open in a few days.

If a lender does allow the borrower to pause payments, they're fully allowed to continue adding interest onto the loan (aka this is called forbearance).

8318,hollybee81,1584682627,flplgu,Nan,"Here's what I've been doing to reduce my risk of infection for the coronavirus.

1. Bring hand sanitizer with you and use it every time after touching public surfaces (subway poles, checkout terminals, doors, public keyboards, etc.). Bundle hand sanitizer usage if possible. For example, use it after you touch product shelves, checkout, and push the door open to leave the grocery store. You want to conserve what little you have. 

It's crazy to try to play the game of don't touch your face as you do it subconsciously. Don't go too long without using sanitizer if you're switching from one activity to another. Ex. After you shop, you have to go to the bank. But between the two tasks, there's a 20-minute walk. Also, wipe your phone often throughout the day.

If you don't have any hand sanitizer, then bring bottled soap water with you as soap water kills the virus. And while you're at it, buy some hand lotion to use as your hand will dry and crack if you overuse hand sanitizer.

2. Wear a mask, any mask. Anything is better than none. The studies show that even a reusable cotton made mask can reduce infection risk. You can also get creative and add things like air conditioner filters, paper towels, and extra layers of cotton behind the mask. If you're using a cotton mask, bleach it every day. Also, clean the front of the mask with sanitizer and then clean your hands every time you take it off. Don't risk viral particles flying all over when taking off the mask. Gov't doesn't want you to wear a mask because they need the surgical and n95 masks for healthcare workers.

3. Wear different clothes every single day as particles can stick to clothes. Set up a quarantine bin. Launder every week. For jackets and shoes, I like to Lysol them outside my place every day. 

4. Quarantine mail and packages for 2 days. You can use alcohol wipes as well. I personally like to open my packages outside after the quarantine period and throw the box out right away. I also wipe the packaging for the products I order. For plastics, it's especially important to wipe as virus can live on it for up to 4 days.

5. Wipe keys, smartphone, wallet, and cards at the end of the day.

6. After shopping, wipe the handles and bottom of my reusable bags.

7. Social distance and read my guide again. :-)

Stay safe everyone.",nyc,How to Reduce Risk of Infection (NY edition)

8373,Ocantico,1584713579,flvody,Nan,"Hello New Yorkers. 

Many of us will be stuck in our apartment buildings for some time. We will need to depend on one another, and help each other out to get through this. 

**The challenge**

The building I live in has 500 apartment units, and a mix of older residents, young people, and families. I realized that, while we often do the morning head-nod greeting, aside from a few neighbors I've made a point to meet, there is no unifying community that easily allows us to come together. 

**A solution**

So, I decided to make a community chat group with the primary purposes of 

(1) allowing young people to **help/perform errands for our older residents**, allowing them to stay quarantined; also be ""tech support"" for older people who may need help with Video chat with families and friends, order food online, etc, 

(2) **provide a ""home base"" community for residents who are doctors, grocery store workers, etc** \- a group of people that could watch their kids, walk their dogs, etc while they are at work being heroes, 

(3) Everyone else - share news, recipes, supplies, etc. Build a community where if someone gets sick, we can spread the information quickly. Deal with situations - as they happen - with camaraderie. 

Take the ""Invite link"" for WhatsApp or Discord, and print that as a QR code. If you don't know how to do this, check it out on Google. Many tools. For me, this was the first time actually interacting with a QR code. It's pretty cool. Modern iOS devices automatically do a pop-up the second the phone's camera sees the QR code. So at least that part is easy. The rest - installing the app, creating a login, etc. Please be aware, for older people who are not familiar with the tech tools we use daily - this stuff is SUPER complicated and confusing. 

**Results so far**

* 35 residents have joined, and each has posted introductions in the #introduce-yourself channel
* We have fulfilled several ""helps"" for older residents (e.g. needing toilet paper, carrying boxes from the package room, etc). 
* People have been really responding positively - I've virtually met so many neighbors I didn't know before.

&amp;#x200B;

**Advice**

**Be patient** \- face it that you are probably the ""tech expert"" for your building, whether you like that label or not. We should not be getting physically close to people, which makes this even more excruciating. But be calm, take your time, keep it happy and light. Show old people how to video chat with friends and family, play music on their phones, order food/supplies online (while we can).

**Evangelize** \- ""Build it and they will come"" &lt;--- This is false. If you have contacts in the building, encourage them to personally reach out to other people they know, help install the app, show them how to post a friendly introduction to that chatroom, along with a selfie (helps build empathy).

**Model the behavior/attitude you want to see** \- if you want people to share supplies, you should do it yourself. Post news &amp; guidance. Ask questions to the community. Don't incite panic with fear-mongering news. Ask for recipes, share music you're jamming to, make it the community you always wanted it to be. S

&amp;#x200B;

**Be strong, be kind**

We are New Yorkers. Take care of yourself, your family, and your local community. Things are going to get rough, and we need to come together to get through it.

To our Brooklyn and Queens riders,

There‚Äôs a lot going on right now, and as we face this uncertain time we want you to know that our top priority is keeping you safe. 

Please use Revel only for essential trips, whether it‚Äôs to your job at a hospital or to the grocery store. Our mopeds are a safe way to travel alone for these purposes and we‚Äôve ramped up our cleaning and disinfecting procedures for all vehicles and helmets, including the use of COVID-19-effective disinfectants. We also encourage you to wash your hands after each ride.

To support those on the front lines of this crisis, we‚Äôre offering free rides to all health care workers in our active cities. Starting today, healthcare workers can receive free rides by visiting https://gorevel.com/safety/coronavirus/ and uploading a photo of their work ID.* 

We‚Äôre also expanding our Brooklyn and Queens service area to make it easier for health care workers and others to get to and from major hospital centers like Elmhurst Hospital, Maimonides Medical Center, NYU Langone Hospital Brooklyn, and SUNY Downstate Medical Center. 

When we started Revel, our mission was to increase access to transportation for people who live and work in cities. Right now, we hope that Revel‚Äôs main function can be as a means of transportation for people providing essential services.

Thank you to everyone who is doing their part - at home or in the community - to keep themselves and others healthy and safe.

Or if I watch the prices and then pay and *then* bag... then the entire area is taken up by all my stuff. It takes me a couple minutes to bag everything up, so the next customer's stuff is coming over and mixing with mine and it's a mess, or the whole line is annoyed they have to wait.

8423,Dreidhen,1584722304,fly32c,Breaking,"&gt; On March 20, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State will be going under PAUSE. The policy, which stands for Policies that Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone, places more restrictions on the entire state population, with different regulations for vulnerable and non-vulnerable populations.
&gt; 
&gt; Vulnerable populations cover those who are 70 and older, and those who have compromised immune systems. Provisions for the vulnerable populations, which Cuomo has called ‚ÄúMatlida‚Äôs Law,‚Äù include remaining indoors, but allows for outdoor solitary exercise. All visitors must be pre-screened by taking their temperature and the vulnerable population cannot go visit households with multiple people. Vulnerable persons should wear mask in company of others, and everyone in presence of vulnerable should wear mask. Finally, all vulnerable individuals must stay at least 6 feet from individuals and should not take public transit unless it‚Äôs urgent or necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; For the non-vulnerable population, all non-essential gatherings have been cancelled, and any concentration of individuals outside home prohibited unless essential. Individuals should also limit outdoor recreational activities to non-contact as well as limiting their use of public transportation unless absolutely necessary. Sick individuals unless they are going to receive medical care.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, all non-vulnerable populations must continue to practice social distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from others, and businesses that are essential must implement rules to make this possible.
&gt; 
&gt; These new provisions will take effect on Sunday. Additionally, all nonessential businesses will have 100% of their workforce stay home. 
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThis is the most drastic action we can take,‚Äù said Governor Cuomo. ‚ÄúThese provisions will be enforced. These are legal provisions. There will be civil fines and mandatory closures for businesses that do not comply.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; However, Cuomo held firm that this new plan is not a shelter-in-place order.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a shelter-in-place order,‚Äù said Cuomo. ‚ÄúPeople are scared and people panic. Why am I increasing the mandates? Because the numbers are increasing. I said from day one, this is science and math. Watch the trajectory ‚Äì you have the density control valve. If the numbers starts to go up, tighten the valve. If the number doesn‚Äôt slow down, tighten the valve more. If the number doesn‚Äôt go down, close the valve. We‚Äôre closing the valve.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; At the time of the conference, New York State has 7,102 cases of coronavirus, with 1,255 people hospitalized and 35 deaths. 32,427 people have been tested so far. New York City has the most cases in the state with 4,408 cases.
&gt; 
&gt; During the press conference, Cuomo stated that the state is looking for ventilators. If a health facility has a ventilator that they are willing to lend or sell to the state, they should contact the Department of Health.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, Cuomo announced that all evictions will be paused for 90 days.

8430,revunitedfront,1584723283,flyd6o,Nan,"As government agencies open the floodgates for bailouts and payouts, the sober reality is the present economic crisis is only going to get worse, and is quickly ‚Äúinfecting‚Äù supply-chains and financial systems already severely weakened by epidemic related work-interruptions.

A prescient framework for understanding ‚Äúsupply-chain infection‚Äù was mapped out in 2012, in a paper by risk consultant David Korowicz, titled [Trade-Off Financial System Supply-Chain Cross-Contagion: a study in global systemic collapse](http://images.feasta.org/2012/10/Trade_Off_Korowicz.pdf).

The paper examined how the interrelated nature of the global economy can quickly lead to massive failure because of the reliance of production of goods and services on a limited number of essential but vulnerable systems‚Äîin particular in the financial and energy sectors. The financial sector has already contributed to the compromised nature of our present economy because of a constantly increasing debt-to-product ratio. In other words, the amount of actual money being lent out in the global economy far exceeds the monetary value of actual goods and services, and this is particularly bad news in crisis situations.

If major agencies default on debt payments, the credit market could quickly freeze up. Withheld letters of credit could quickly threaten basic trade, as such guarantees are used to insure the safety of transactional agreements. This would lead to severe shortages very quickly. It is possible authorities may manage to stave off such a crisis in the United States, as they just barely managed to do in 2008. But even in this optimistic scenario, it would be unreasonable to believe the fundamental problems underlying the crisis would be resolved.

Furthermore, while the mess of our financial system in crisis will be difficult for authorities to untangle, Korowicz convincingly argues that production and supply-chain relations are *even mor*e complicated. The complex interrelation of goods and services required for creating the basic necessities of life, including food, transportation and other commodities, is nearly impossible to fully map-out. One example of this complexity is that on average 15,000 individual parts are necessary to produce a single car. The loss of even one critical component for producing such an item can lead to massive interruptions, as this would result in paused production on this and all other lines requiring that component, or which require components that incorporate that critical part.

This is already starting to occur, as large scale work interruptions around the globe are creating shortages of goods. In one case, Boeing‚Äôs 787 and 767 planes require parts from a manufacturer in northern Italy. General Electric, which supplies 90% of Boeing‚Äôs engines, also requires parts from Italy. Production of [a whole series of goods has ground to a halt in Italy](https://qz.com/1815731/italys-luxury-manufacturing-is-threatened-by-coronavirus/) while the country is on lockdown due to the Coronavirus. Coupled with Boeing‚Äôs ongoing safety and reliability problems, this has pushed [the company to the point of collapse.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/economy/boeing-coronavirus-economy.html)

Korowicz convincingly argues that the highly interrelated nature of our global economy *makes it even more vulnerable to crises*. In Boeing‚Äôs case, had the company maintained its traditional vertically-integrated manufacturing strategy (i.e. primarily in-house, U.S. based production of its various components) that it abandoned in the early 2000s, it would now face less immediate fallout from the present loss of production capability in Italy. Interestingly, the company‚Äôs move towards aggressive outsourcing was not merely part of a larger global trend, but was [promoted by its partners in the U.S. military](https://www.csmonitor.com/1996/1216/121696.us.us.1.html) in the mid 1990s.

Following the [hundreds of deaths resulting from the company‚Äôs 737 Max engineering disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/business/boeing-737-crashes.html), the company has tried to reverse its decades long shift away from vertical integration. However, [it has faced major obstacles in doing so](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-experts-suppliers-talk-of-pushing-up-jet-production-while-pushing-down-costs/).

While limited shortages have already been reported for food and other supplies, breakdowns in supply chains have likely only just begun. Stores and agencies generally have a certain reserve capacity on hand for sudden interruptions in supply or for increases in demand. Right now many stores and other businesses are using such reserves to restock depleted supplies, *but this will not be tenable long-term*. It is essential to grasp the non-linear impact of a crisis. Operations will increasingly fail because of a lack of cash-flow or because of a lack of labor. Already many people laid off from jobs are worried about how they will buy food even with a mostly stable situation at supermarkets at present. Disconcertingly, if food supply chains start to crumble, Korowicz states that cities only have about a three day food supply on hand at a given moment, and that without serious pre-planning, *authorities will not be able to establish alternatives for weeks.*

Likewise, the impact from serious disruptions caused by the last several days of U.S. work stoppages will have major implications in the weeks ahead. As Korowicz states, ‚ÄúPandemic modeling has shown that removing at random only small numbers of a population can cause cascading failure of functions across an economy.‚Äù He states that these failures would soon threaten to disrupt the functioning of large infrastructure such as power plants. Such pieces of infrastructure require thousands of specific parts to operate, as well as specialized skills to carry out repairs, possessed by people who may well be unable to work now because of sickness or quarantine. The impact of disruptions are magnified when they occur in a major economic power such as the United States, which provides many irreplaceable skills and services to the global economy.

Such shockwaves are likely to increase in the near future, driven by an economic system made even more vulnerable by its reliance on debt. As Korowicz states ‚ÄúA contracting economy is incompatible with the credit backing the global economy.‚Äù

In one example of how the pandemic crisis is already cascading into a financial crisis, New York‚Äôs Metropolitan Transportation Agency (MTA) yesterday requested [a federal bailout of $4 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-subway-federal-aid-.html). The MTA requested this nicely rounded figure based on a projected decrease of ‚Äú$3.7 billion *from lost fares in the next few months*, should ridership trends continue‚Äù and for ‚Äúcoronavirus-specific expenses, like disinfecting subway cars and stations‚Äù estimated to reach $300 million.

These numbers do not add up.

According to the MTA‚Äôs own numbers, the agency collects about [$741 million in total fares, tolls, and advertising per month](https://new.mta.info/document/12481), meaning that the $3.7 billion figure is closer to a situation in which the number of NYC commuters *was reduced to zero for a five-month period*. And this is without even factoring in operating savings that would accrue to the MTA given reduced bus and train schedules due to future interruptions.

As the *New York Post* pointed out, the MTA is hiding its obvious debt problem. One of the MTA‚Äôs biggest expenses is simply paying back interest on a debt which is [projected to rise to $52 billion in 2023](https://nypost.com/2020/03/11/subway-riders-might-pay-for-mtas-debt-with-fare-raises-cut-service/), up from $35 billion last year. Simply paying interest on its debt approaches the total annual amount the agency pays for labor. As a result, a relatively minor immediate loss of revenue can be disastrous to the agency, making it unable to make payments to its creditors. Put another way, the agency even in normal times is barely solvent, creating a scenario in which a ripple, such as present difficulties, threatens to quickly submerge it and its financial backers, putting them beyond a point of no-return.

‚ÄúThe gist of it is that the risk of debt is just the same for the MTA as it is to a person,‚Äù said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, quoted in the Post‚Äôs article.‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt afford to have anything go wrong. You can‚Äôt lose your job. The MTA can‚Äôt have any setback of any kind or you won‚Äôt be able to pay off your debt.‚Äù

And the same applies to the economy on a wider scale. It is extremely vulnerable to disruption.

As Korowicz [stated in a blog post earlier this month](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-03-04/we-need-to-talk-about-catastrophic-global-risk/), ‚ÄúThe government will no-doubt do everything they can to support businesses and the banking system with credit and stimulus, adding yet more debt to an already overindebted system. That will constrain future economic growth, increase the likelihood of future financial crises, and make the country less resilient to the next shock, from whatever the source. It is also straining political legitimacy, adding further uncertainty.‚Äù

In other words, the government will attempt to continue to plug up the vast numbers of holes in what amounts to a doomed ship, rather than creating a solid foundation to address the present medical and economic catastrophe.

Tellingly, as part of an apparent organizational hope within the *New York Times* that large-moves by the state and federal government can resolve the present crisis, the paper yesterday did not see fit to include any reporting about the MTA‚Äôs debt burden in its coverage of the agency‚Äôs bailout plea.

As crises continue to flare related to the pandemic, it is important to comprehend the even greater perils that may soon emerge. From Trump, to state government, to liberal critics, it seems that these risks presently are simply not being taken into consideration.

She now wants her deposit back, even though we had a rental agreement. I explained to her that even if I wanted to give her back the deposit, I've incurred damages due to her breaching our agreement:

- i lost the security deposit in my other place abroad when i left rushed back to nyc 
- had to book a last-minute ticket back to NYC because i was afraid  the borders would continue closed and I'd be paying double rent while totally unemployed at the moment
- it costs me way more to be here than where i was abroad

She says that since I'm now living in the room, that I should be able to give her back her full deposit. I feel really torn, from an ethical standpoint I wish I could give her the money back. From a contractual and financial standpoint.. My business is likely going bankrupt from everything soon due to coronavirus because we can't keep up with the costs due to the major loss of income... so I personally cannot pocket 1,300 to give back to her right now as an exception even if I wanted to...

TL;DR buy online gift cards from small businesses that offer services. 

First off, I appreciate that not everyone may be able to do this in light of massive job and hour losses. But if you are in a position to help, please do! 

A lot of small businesses will be/have been closing doors this week. We all know how valuable these mom-and-pop places are when it comes to the landscape of our neighborhoods. I don‚Äôt want to see my local salons, stores, niche businesses, and family owned services disappear in the next month or so, so I‚Äôve reached out to a few to purchase on-line gift cards from them. Even small gift card purchases make a difference. (5$ and 10$ purchases add up for businesses) 

Once the closures are lifted, I‚Äôll be able to treat myself to long overdue haircuts, dog groomings, and seasonal attire, all while keeping the businesses I actually want to support in business, and it‚Äôll be during a time when I might not have the funds to splurge (though I do have a little money saved right now that I am eager to put to good use!)

They state we are taking safety precautions to abide by the 'Social   Distancing' recommendations from the CDC, but I can assure you that is   not the case. We are sending people out on test drives by themselves and   often forget to sterilize the car they were in including the keys we   hand to them. We are forgetting to do this because the amount of volume   we have with limited staff due to most of the employees not coming in   because either they're sick, or don't feel comfortable coming into work   due to the spread. We have managers making ""secret work from home""   schedules being sent out to managers only, without their employees   seeing it because 'I don't want it to be public knowledge that we're   letting people work from home bc everyone will ask to do it.' - **Manager**.

As of today, head of HR sent this email attached stating to reach out  this  new email alias for questions relating to COVID-19, instead of  just  being upfront and transparent. Why do we have to fish for the  answers  when our local governments are telling us very clear, and  concise  directives?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
‚ÄúGood evening

I can not believe how insulting you write your email considering what is going on in New York and the entire world. I told you last week Saturday that I will try to come to the city the week after next, which means this week coming. I was meeting not only with you, but another tenant. 

Considering the situation currently we are all home bound and I can not send anybody out to do any repair or remodeling. As I mentioned to you before I told Andy to replace the sink and replace the kitchen door. 

I need to wait out and see if Andy or anybody is aloud in the city. I have been in touch with him in reference to flooring kitchen and bathroom. But I am very disappointed, the building I always kept up and when your husband was there I ask when renewing if we can paint and clean up and refresh the apartment. But I never got any approval because of your pets and other reasons.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

She says she‚Äôs disappointed, but for what I have no idea. She hasn‚Äôt stepped foot in this apartment for over a decade, so she has no idea what it looks like now. She has never offered me a paint job or any kind of ‚Äúclean up‚Äù or refresh like she mentions at the end of her email, and certainly never during a lease renewal. 

And she is making things up about speaking to my husband about pets or something, but even if she had, his name is not on my lease and he doesn‚Äôt even live here anymore. Also I don‚Äôt know if she has dementia but my kitchen doesn‚Äôt even HAVE a door - it never has!

Now she‚Äôs called me several times within the past hour and it‚Äôs freaking me out on top of everything else that‚Äôs going on. I just want to confirm she can‚Äôt evict me as of now, is that correct? I have been a good, quiet, respectful tenant and neighbor for all the years I‚Äôve lived here. I have NEVER missed a month of rent, and the rent is H I G H. 

I love my apartment beyond words, I never want to leave and I feel so at home in this building and in my place. I have worked hard to keep it nice with my own money, painting, repairing what I can, and doing cosmetic improvements by myself. The family who owns this place are some rich people who live in Germany and have nothing to do with taking care of anything here. I‚Äôm just really scared and frustrated right now.

3) Those ‚Äúworried-well‚Äù folk jamming up the ED all have to get seen by law. So they have to change into new clean protective-wear to talk to them. They wind up giving them Tylenol (which costs them like $300) and sending them home. Now, they‚Äôve just wasted a set of clean protective-wear. The reason we‚Äôre in such a dire shortage of protective equipment for hospital staff is because these worried people come and need to be seen. STAY HOME UNLESS YOU HAVE SHORTNESS OF BREATH.

4) ELI5 - the virus causes your lungs to work badly so no matter how fast or deep you breathe, you‚Äôre not getting enough oxygen.

5) They‚Äôre trying to do everything to avoid intubating people and putting them on a ventilator for two reasons. 

Reason #1 - Massive shortage of ventilators. His hospital (a huge one in the NYC area) has only 20ish ventilators left unused right now. They normally have over 100 available in the various ICUs (medical ICU, surgical ICU, etc.)

Reason #2 - (This is the part that shook me.) At his hospital, every patient that has been intubated and placed on a ventilator for COVID has not been extubated. That means they‚Äôre either still on the ventilator or they died. To be perfectly clear, at his hospital, at the time of this posting, there is a 0% recovery rate once they‚Äôre on the ventilator. If they don‚Äôt die, they are still currently on the ventilator. No one has come off the machine.

He mentioned that they just had to intubate a man because his blood oxygen level was getting dangerously low and not rebounding. They were doing everything they could to avoid venting him knowing that no one has come off the ventilator yet. The man was lucid and made a phone call to his wife to tell her what was happening. According to the math, it was possibly the last time he would talk to her.

6) Though most of the people in the COVID pit aren‚Äôt in life threatening condition, he said it‚Äôs become terrifying hearing all the announcements for ‚Äúrapid response‚Äù or ‚Äúanesthesia stat‚Äù (to intubate) to the COVID floor.

7) Staffing is very messed up right now. All internal medicine doctors are working on COVID. So the MICU is being run by surgeons, since there are no elective surgeries. And the medical floors are being run by anyone possible. He said they currently have 4th year psychiatry residents running the medical floor. Those psych residents, while important, haven‚Äôt really practiced any internal medicine in probably 4 years. 

8) He‚Äôs overworked, overtired, overstressed, frustrated with the public, frustrated with his co-workers, and he hasn‚Äôt eaten a normal meal in a few weeks. It‚Äôs grueling but they know they‚Äôre what is keeping people alive and have to keep pushing on.

He‚Äôs supposed to go on vacation in 2 weeks. That‚Äôs not going to happen.

Tell your community to stay away from the hospitals unless you are having shortness of breath. They can‚Äôt test you right now unless you‚Äôre bad enough to be admitted. It doesn‚Äôt matter if there are confirmed cases in your house, just assume you have it and quarantine. If you‚Äôre sick enough to think about going to the hospital, treat yourself as if you know you have COVID and follow all quarantine protocols.

If you‚Äôre hoarding masks, bring them to the local hospital. Give them to the medical staff. He‚Äôs been wearing the same N95 mask for a week (they place a paper surgical mask over the N95 and then throw out the paper masks but they‚Äôre running out of those as well.)",nyc,"Just had a sobering conversation with my brother, who is a doctor here in NYC (Emergency Medicine.)"

8644,pixelcraftables,1584788809,fmdduh,Nan,"I live in northern Italy right in the epicenter (Lombardy) of the coronavirus outbreak. We have been put under quarantine for roughly 2 weeks now and were encouraged to stay apart even before that. Our government left exceptions for us, including grocery shopping, exercising outdoors, some factories, etc.

It wasn't enough.

Yesterday our govt. Ordered all parks, natural sites and gas stations (except for highways) to close. One region is now limiting grocery shopping.

People get bored under quarantine. They start to find excuses to go to the supermarket every day, or to pick up jogging every day. The go and visit their family every day just because they 'can't stand staying at home'. And as a result the daily spread of the virus has actually been **increasing** in the past two days despite the quarantine. Over 90k people have been fined or arrested now for violating the rules and I still see people occasionally walking outside my home at times like nothing is happening.

This virus spreads crazy easily. A lot of people here still don't seem to realise that despite us living with it for the past month. Despite all the social media movements, government informational programs, all the measures taken by the police and our dear hospital workers, our number of positive cases still goes up higher and higher each day, with our previous assumption of a peak in daily cases being shifted constantly further and further down the calendar.

Now that New York State has stopped non essential work, but stopped just shy of shelter in place, it is absolutely essential that **everyone stays home** as much as possible. Even if you have the **choice** of going out, that **doesn't mean you should**. It should be as minimal as possible and only when absolutely vital taking the precautions necessary.

You will get bored yes. You will miss your loved ones and friends. But it's our social responsibility to stay at home. At this time we must teach others (in particular children) that this isn't just a vacation to play at the park, or just time off, but it's our duty.

It's going to be a rough few months, socially and financially and even more so mentally. There is going to be a lot of hurt and pain but everyone must pull through here.

I hope your government provides the financial infrastructure as soon as possible so that people who are out of work or own a small business or get sick in this unprecedented crisis will be ok, because that is truly who it is going to hit the hardest.

I've been to NY twice, travelling from NYC to Albany and to Rochester, it's a lovely place and want it's people to be as well as possible. So please. **Unless it's absolutely vital, stay at home**, don't make the same mistakes we did.

Sending all our love from Italy. We are all in this together.

8719,GlueGuns--Cool,1584810254,fmi6wm,Nan,"Hey all. My partner and I have been exposed a few times over to people who have tested positive. No symptoms (yet), starting to freak out a bit. Were both in our 30s and healthy and on 100% lockdown at this point.

My question is: what is the point of getting tested? We were thinking about it, but it really wouldn't change our behavior right now. We have a few masks and gloves for when going outside is an absolute necessity. And, of course, we'll go to the hospital if symptoms get bad enough. Also, if we're negative, going to a hospital seems like a bad idea because we might be exposed, and if we're positive, we don't want to venture out to get tested because we might expose others.

TLDR: For young healthy people (even if you DO have symptoms), what is the purpose of testing?

You just gotta do it before you‚Äôre completely out of clothes. So, now.

I‚Äôm not giving you a video because this isn't nearly hard enough to need visual aids. It‚Äôs not hard, you just gotta do it. **You fucking got this.\***  
Now, while you could kill yourself trying to pretend you‚Äôre a commercial washing machine and shake the everloving fuck out your clothes for 45 minutes, I'd suggest that you chill the fuck out. The secret here is **WATER + SOAP + TIME:**

1. **CHOOSE:** Pick the clothes you want to wash and put them in your bathtub. Only choose as much stuff as you have the capacity to dry! **THIS IS IMPORTANT**\-- you're not helping yourself by converting your bag of dry dirty clothes into a bag of wet mildewy clothes. My apartment has some towel hangers and a shower curtain rod, so I can dry about 20 things at a time, therefore I wash about 20 things at a time.
2. **PREWASH**: Turn on the water.  Hot/cold, I don‚Äôt care, just put enough of it in there to soak your clothes.  Mash it all down it there so it‚Äôs all wet, turn off the water and come back later. Like 10 minutes is fine but whatever, your clothes will wait for you.
3. **WASH**: If your water looks dirty from prewash, drain it and refill it. Add your soap, kneel down and grab chunks of your clothes and push them around in the water. If there are stains or other bits of crap to deal with, focus on that now.  **Don't stomp around** on your clothes like how you think wine is made, the last thing we need right now is you going to the ER because you slipped in the soapy water.
4. **LEAVE**:  Yeah just leave your clothes alone in the soapy water. Come back later.
5. **WASH A LITTLE MORE AND DRAIN:** Push it all around a little more because it‚Äôs been sitting in the soapy water, then drain the water. 
6. **RINSE:**  Add fresh cold water. Push your clothes around in the fresh cold water to get the soap and the last of the dirt out. Drain and repeat at least once, but stop whenever you‚Äôre tired of dealing with this. If you‚Äôd rather, you can blast your stuff with your showerhead.
7. **DRY**: Hang up your stuff to dry.  As you pick each thing out of your tub, squeeze the water out of it with your hands as best you can.  If you‚Äôve got a fan or a window or something to help with air flow, use that.\*\*
8. **PUT IT AWAY**: So that other people can use the damn bathroom again.  Let it dry overnight or whatever but put it away before you want to take another shower or else you‚Äôll just piss yourself off.

**Fucking good job.** You did your laundry.  You also just saved yourself like $10-20 too. I normally wash all my shit every two weeks or so at a laundromat, but now I do a small load every other day in the bathtub after everybody in my house has had their morning showers.  And don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm some life-hacker trying to laundry-shame you; I have kids and the laundry never fuckin' stops.  


\*The bar is really low here.  Dispel any notion that washing machines are magical germ-killing machines. [They‚Äôre not](http://www.dranniesexperiments.com/laundry-product-testing), they just shake your clothes around with some soapy water for a while. You can do that.

**I have just tested positive for Covid-19.I AM OK!**

# About a month ago my entire home(husband and two teen daughters) got an odd bug - Low grade fever, headaches, sore throat, body aches, ears ringing and a dry cough. It cleared up quickly. Seasonal I thought? but it felt unusual/different...

# Two weeks later, March 15th, I woke up with all those same symptoms but super intense body aches,and 102.4 fever. I figured maybe I got the flu or..Corona?üò¨

# I had had cocktails the evening prior,and smoked a few cigarettes. figured I had jacked my immune system from having a fun night with friends. I called a doctor/friend to ask if I could get the Covid-19 test on 3/16. He said NO,I didn‚Äôt meet the criteria.I hadn‚Äôt recently traveled out of the country &amp; I hadn't been with someone who had actually tested positive. I found this kind of a CRAZY criteria for a NY‚Äôer as I had taken the subway, gone to the theater, the grocery store, the pharmacy, hair salon, etc. I was the Mom who was trying to prepare the home and get supplies &amp; bleach wipes, dry goods. extra food etc.

# Because we have Italian family in Italy and we follow the news closely, my biggest panic was why were they not closing schools in NYC &amp; forbidding movement outside the home without permission, like China and all of Europe?

# Prospect Park yesterday, i hear was jumpin‚Äô!

# A friend told me that CityMD/Urgent Care in my neighborhood had test kits,which appealed to me as I wanted to stay away from the hospital. I went on 3/17. First I was tested for the flu-which was negative. Then they tested me for Covid-19.

# I was sent home and told to quarantine myself until I had results,which would take 3-7 days (in S.Korea it takes two hours)

# Well..today is day 5 and I just found out. I'm hoping I‚Äôve been through the worst of it already. Its very ‚Äúmorphy‚Äù. One day I feel crappy and the next I‚Äôm normal. Today my lungs are heavy, but I‚Äôm tough.

# I can breathe, and I‚Äôm going to heal here, in my own home! My family is under quarantine for 14 days. They have no symptoms. I  think we all had it possibly already? Who knows.

# Anyhow, stay home people! Protect yourselves &amp; your loved ones. Build up your immune systems. Good Luck &amp; God Bless us all!

He has also been rude and unprofessional, telling me that I do not understand the threats of the virus, and that he will just show people quickly 2 or 3 times a week and they won't touch anything. I have a congenital cardiovascular disease and am considered high risk, so it was in my best interest to get out of the city for the time being while possible since my company is currently not operating. I briefly considered letting him come in to take a video, as I am not currently in NYC, and he pushed for it, but I quickly changed my mind because this all just seems so crazy that he's trying to force me into this during a state of emergency and non-essential business shut down.

Across the country these past several days, you have come to our stores to buy the technology and household necessities that are so valuable at a time like this. We remain determined to continue to serve you and are announcing today a new way of making our stores accessible while even further enhancing customer and employee safety. 

In our stores 

Beginning Sunday, March 22, we will offer contactless curbside service at all locations across the country where state or local laws allow. Rather than ask you to come into our stores, any items you order on BestBuy.com or the Best Buy app will be delivered to your car curbside. If, for any reason, you didn't order the product in advance and the product is in stock in the store, one of our employees will be more than happy to go get it in the store and sell it to you while you remain in your car. This service also extends to returns and exchanges, the period for which has been extended on most products so that you have more time. Only employees will be allowed in the store, but we are determined to serve you as fully as we can. Unfortunately, we are temporarily unable to continue our product trade-in and recycling services. 

For those who want to continue shopping with us online or on the app, we will, of course, still get you what you want. 

In your home 

As you know, Best Buy works in millions of customer homes each year, and we have long been proud of the services we provide. Because of the increased concern for you, your families and our employees, we have made the decision to suspend currently scheduled installations, haul-aways or repairs for large items like refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers and TVs. 

Beginning Monday, March 23, we will no longer deliver these large products into your home and will, instead, offer free doorstep delivery. This means we will take the item as close as we possibly can to the front door of your home without bringing it inside. We know that this change will be inconvenient, and we are truly sorry. It was made with our employees' and your best interests at heart. If you have an order scheduled for installation in the next 30 days, please expect an email or text from Best Buy about your delivery options. 

Employees 

Speaking of our employees, everyone working right now is doing so on a voluntary basis, and all hourly employees who volunteer are receiving a temporary pay increase. Additionally, anyone feeling sick is told to stay home, and they will be paid for that time. Finally, anyone exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19 is also told to stay home, with pay, and we are paying employees who may need to stay home to care for their children. 

All of us at Best Buy are grateful that so many states and localities believe we are an essential business, allowing us to continue to serve you when you need it most. We thank you for your patience and loyalty and look forward to continuing to provide you with the technology and home essentials you require to stay connected and work and learn from home.

Cuomo gave 45 days as the rough estimate before cases start peaking. I'm worried about what happens after, as the cases start dropping and weather gets warmer. Gig workers and business owners start thinking about making money. Young people start thinking about beaches, bars, and parties. Families start thinking about reconnecting with everyone they've shut away from for weeks. Shareholders start prodding executives to open the doors and push that stock value. 

People will be people and crave that return to normalcy. Once the restrictions ease or even before it will become a city wide celebration as people cram together to kiss, embrace, and share a drink in boisterous gatherings and heartfelt soirees.

Hi Reddit! I've been scrolling the subreddit and it all seems to be bad news (I should know, I'm Italian...)

I don't know if ads are welcome on here. I hope I am doing something that is at least a bit interesting and cool, and that might make somebody's day a tad better.

Together with my gf, we designed a deck of cards that is currently on Kickstarter \[a crowdfunding website: you produce if you hit your funding goal, otherwise money is returned\]. The deck is themed around NYC in the 20s: Jazz, mobs, cops, and a lot of art deco. I am leaving a couple of pictures down. For those of you who know about this stuff, it is printed on Bee stock by USPCC.

Again, hoping I did not do anything illegal or unwelcomed. Take this as a little homage to your city! If you're into vintage staff, hopefully you will enjoy watching some of the pics below :)

Are bars allowed to sell giftcards or let people pay in advanced for tabs? 

It seems like one of the big issues is bars/restaurants needing cash asap (to pay rent, pay staff, etc.) and I figured one thing that might help is bar regulars paying for future tabs now during the coronavirus shutdown and they can just use those funds when the bar reopens. Basically just like buying a giftcard, but you can sort out how you want to do it (keep a list, send an email, etc.). Could take payments over Venmo, phone or whatever and have like a google sheet where the bar has the name of the person and the amount prepaid publicly viewable so people can keep track of their prepaid tab over time, but not editable by anyone but the bar (could assign people numbers instead of names if privacy is an issue).

I could see one counterpoint being that this just pushes the problem to a later point: what will happen while the regulars aren‚Äôt spending money when the bar reopens and they‚Äôre just using their prepaid tabs? I would think that wouldn‚Äôt be so much of an issue because when the bar reopens, the random tourists/people who don‚Äôt usually come into the bar anyways (and probably wouldn‚Äôt donate to a GoFundMe for a place they don‚Äôt regularly go to) would offset the fact that the regulars are just getting drinks off their prepaid tabs for a few weeks.

Not sure about other people, but there are a few spots I know I go to regularly enough that I‚Äôd be more than happy to give them more $$$ upfront right now and just charge my future drinks to that tab (and yes I‚Äôve already donated to GoFundMe‚Äôs for these places regardless). Just figured this might be a way to get people to put down a bit more cash up front than they‚Äôd be willing to just donate which seems to be the important thing for bars right now. Not trying to be greedy or try to get something from a place when they‚Äôre down, just thought it might keep some money coming in to businesses that are getting hit hard rn.

Figured this might be one more way for people who are lucky enough to be able to keep their jobs, work from home, and continue getting paid to spend their money at the places that they would be spending their money at anyways if the city wasn‚Äôt shutdown. Seems like anything that can be done to help out the places that make this city what it is and to help the people who make those places what they are is really important right now if one is able to.",nyc,A thought that might help bars/restaurants during the shutdown

It's not enough to just allow a freeze on mortgages, and a freeze on evictions. After 3 months, will I owe that much back rent? I have no current income coming in. It seems like officials will take no time at all in declaring building owners their mortgage freezes, and yet the rest of us have to sweat it out til crunch time.

He's just really run down. Fever, chills, really achy, congested, the works. He didn't cough on the phone at all. I don't believe that anyone gave him any medication. He also had to change sheets yesterday and he said that the effort he had to use knocked him out.

One of his other roommates has been coughing up a lung, not wearing a mask and hasn't been tested. No fever but....

I also told him I had friends who tested positive already so he didn't feel so hopeless and alone. He's really sensitive about the fact that he has it, I can tell. I think a lot of queer people are really sensitive about testing positive for anything after AIDS. You feel like you did something wrong

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, I won't be evicted for 90 days, but then i'll owe back rent, and it will make no difference. I may as well move somewhere cheaper during this uncertain period, and reassess when this is all over. Rather than be paying NYC rents to be cooped up in my apartment for the next 90 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Those of who know me know id never do this if there was any other way. But the scales just aren't balanced anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

It simply does not make financial sense for to spend another minute in NYC. It does not make health sense for me to spend another minute in NYC, I have to think about the bigger picture here, and every second I spend here I am putting my health at risk, and I am losing money very rapidly compared to if I lived anywhere else in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a serious health risk, and not even just from the virus, if you get hurt, your SOL, cause the hospitals are packed to the brim. Not to mention, you're at greater risk of getting the virus in a hospital.

So: we live in a shared building in Brooklyn.  Neighbor is a couple, husband is an Uber driver and they have two young kids.  Since school‚Äôs been out they‚Äôve been hanging in the lobby and letting the kids play out there constantly.

Yesterday an FDNY ambulance arrived and they took the husband away and told the Mom to self quarantine 

Since then she‚Äôs been continuing to let the kids play in the lobby, touching everyone‚Äôs door knobs, touching the mailboxes, rubbing hands on the front door etc, and they‚Äôve had their front door (next to the mailboxes, 10ft from our door) propped open all day so the kids can play.

Super says he‚Äôs been Cloroxing everything every 72 hours and that‚Äôs all he can do, and building manager says talk to the super 

Scared we‚Äôre going to catch it but don‚Äôt know what to do - is there a number we can call?  Neighbors are very hostile, dont speak very good English and when we asked them nicely to keep the noise down one day earlier in the year they turned aggressive and started causing us shit, and the super seems scared of the husband after previous altercations with him

Of course cloth face masks do not offer the same protection as N95 masks, but they are still useful. Many hospitals, along with Governor Cuomo, have issued calls for private companies and individuals to start producing their own. There was even an article about different fashion companies contributing to the effort in [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/style/coronavirus-masks-dov-charney-christian-siriano.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage](today's NYTimes). Hopefully the private sector can supply thousands of handmade, washable, reusable masks by the end of the week.

In the spirit of DIY I found a good pattern for a mask and made a step-by-step visual guide to sewing one. It took me less than fifteen minutes from cutting to finished mask. If you have a sewing machine and know how to sew a straight line you can do this. Tightly woven fabrics that can withstand repeated hot water washing are ideal...I repurposed my retired Japanese kimono (RIP).

You can see the pattern and instructions here:

- It is okay to treat patients while being Covid19 Positive, ‚Äúbut being asymptomatic enough to work‚Äù. Their reasoning when questioned on the call was that it‚Äôs safe and proven they are not contagious to who they are treating. (Not everyone on the call will be treating Covid patients ).

- Being told that they will be giving non N95 Masks and asks to bring then home in a ziplock bag and sanitizing it before bringing it back to work the next day. 

- Not to speak to the Press under any condition. 

- Promised that the hospital has sufficient medical supplies, when it is known internally amongst staff that they do not. 

- Scarves and bandanas are sufficient substitutes for medical masks. 

While none of these items are illegal , I feel compelled to speak up about how management is putting their staff and the people they service at risk. 

It‚Äôs one thing to say, hey we are all it a tough situation, but you need to work with us for now. It‚Äôs another to just blatantly lie to their medical staff about the personal risk they will be exposed to. In addition to the patients.  

To further my disdain, it was brought to my attention that some of the staff suffer from documented mild asthma, which put those individuals at a serious risk. 

While I do not expect anything to come from this post, I do ask for any ideas about what I can do to bring to light this morally shallow behavior.

Why are there not signs on the streets, advertising trucks, signs at grocery stores and bodegas - where many congregate stating that we need to stay home?  Why are there not city (or NYPD) cars driving around with microphones announcing these risks and precautions in Spanish / Creole?  


The NYPD has alienated many of the already marginalized populations, and now when they could be used to spread knowledge, we are seeing the fall out of the poor treatment and distrust that permeates our city.

If you want to freeze or cancel your membership, you should write a short letter including the date, your name, address, and address of the club you frequented, and send it to the following address:

&gt; New York Sports Club

&gt; c/o Town Sports International Holdings, Inc.

&gt; Again, please note that both freezes and cancellations are subject to fees and potentially other conditions.  Those fees and conditions are disclosed in your membership agreement.  If you do not have your membership agreement I unfortunately do not have any way of obtaining it for you.

&gt; Once you have written the letter retain a copy for your records (a clear and legible picture on your phone should be fine) and make a note of the date you mailed it.  You may also wish to contact your bank to discuss your options regarding termination of recurring payments.

In case it's unclear with the bold, we've looked up the language of the order and it does not include management, so her company actively knows their employees are not considered non-essential and are altering language of the order to appear compliant. 

Pretty fucked up and we're all worried about her putting herself and others in danger. She has flagged this to her manager and co-workers and basically been told tough shit. Unfortunately, if she continues to flag it internally, there's a good chance they'll simply let her go.

Jones, who lives in Chelsea, was picked up shortly after the incident and charged with grand larceny as a hate crime and aggravated harassment.

He faced a Brooklyn Criminal Court judge on Saturday and was **released without bail.**

The victim was unharmed, according to police.

The racially charged attack comes amidst a wave of coronavirus-related hate crimes throughout the city and nation as residents struggle to cope with the outbreak of the disease.

I still have no damn idea in what I want to major in. I don't even have any passion and I need to chose a good major and not any shitty major.

I don't qualify for financial aid. I am forced to take out more student loans to continue college and move on. I don't know what to major in because I need a job that pays me over 90k or more to live in NYC. I don't have friends or anybody to talk to about this. This is messed up.

Prior to this being confirmed, the jobsite was shutdown for 2 days last week for a ""deep clean"" and re-opened, business as usual, even knowing that someone may have been compromised. This has occurred on 3 of our jobsites so far. I'm sure many more around the city are being handled the same way. Guess what, 5 people in my company have fallen ill, 3 of them in the hospital. This is cruel and unjust for everyone across the industry. I fear for myself but moreso for my elderly parents and the people I may come across on my way to work. My boss cannot close the company down because we are contractually obligated to keep these jobsites manned. 

I ask again, what must WE do to close these jobsites down? You see Cuomo up there on the big screen going on about how he's making the ""right decisions."" Tell this coward to jump out of bed with real estate developers and do what's actually right for the health and well being of our city's people. What must we do?",nyc,Update: What the f*** is it going to take to shut down construction sites?

1) everyone gets infected

2) vaccine gets developed

3) complete travel ban


Let's analyze these options. 

Option 1 can happen in two ways. Fast or slow. Fast is out of the question as it'd result in millions of deaths, perhaps even 8 million. There aren't enough hospitals to take care of 200 million patients in a month. So only slow option is left. Which according to some estimates will take 2 years. 


Option 2 is vaccination. 12 months left. But that it is still too long for economy.

Option 3, truly the only option. Do complete 100% military style lockdown for 1 month. In fact have hazmat suits deliver medicines and groceries, rationed to houses.  Meanwhile also completely ban travel outside of the country, sea/air/land...everything. In 1 month sick people will be cured and not be contagious. There is no point in having 14 days, 1 month or 2 month quarantine. It will only one infected person to come in the country and restart the cycle. Rendering all the work useless.

We need to accept reality and act swiftly. If USA as a whole can't do that then at least as a state or city we need completely adopt option 3.

Inmates are asking to be tested and aren't getting tested; they're crowded multiple to a room with 1 toilet for every 29 people.

This is unacceptable. Cuomo and DeBlasio have ignored this for weeks, civil rights activists have been screaming at them and they've. done. nothing.

Please, tell everyone this is happening. Tell your family, your friends, your fucking twitter timeline that these people, most of whom are being held on low-level offenses or non-criminal parole violations, are going to die in droves if we don't get them out right now.",nyc,"Of the 5294 inmates in Rikers, only 75 have been released.

9329,CrazyCraisinAbraisin,1585061096,fo69fj,Nan,"So I decided I want to limit the number of trips to the supermarket and decided to order out to add a bit more spacing between trips.  I've ordered twice now and they were totally different experiences.

Order #1 was through UberEats.  I know they charge high fees to restaurants but I like the no contact/drop off at door exchange and the ability to tip from the app.  Also, they seem to be high on restaurant and delivery awareness on minimizing risk.  The restaurant I ordered from packaged everything very well and each plastic container also came sealed in thin plastic bag.  The delivery bag itself was tied up at the top to ensure minimal exposure or spillage.  

Order #2 was from a local joint not using any 3rd party for delivery.  The packaging was typical pre-corona packaging, only with consideration for content spillage.  They offered credit card purchasing and tipping but wanted me to sign upon delivery.  I told them to just forge my name and drop off at the door.  The delivery guy dropped it off but rang the doorbell first.  I had to wipe the buzzer with a Lysol wipe afterwards.  

These are only two cases so far but drastically shows how the local guy who I want to support isn't as tech savvy (their business is tiny and the owners are old) as those using 3rd party delivery apps.  Nor does it seem they are taking the necessary safety precautions.  To be safe, I'm only going with 3rd party deliveries b/c we can handle the drop-off and payment and communication much better through them and I know that delivery app companies are promoting safety measures throughout the system (even though compliance can't be 100% assured).",nyc,Food Delivery Experience so far (2 cases)

I've posted my website to reddit in the past, but this COVID-19 thing got me to make a version specifically for this sub. You can get real-time wait times for emergency rooms, pediatric emergency rooms, urgent care centers, and convenience care clinics (as available) at the following link:

[https://www.erticker.com/n](https://www.erticker.com/nova)yc

In general, the ERs are doing okay because people are mostly going only if needed. Please follow the guidelines I got from a health care website (Inova):

As always, if you develop symptoms of a respiratory infection, you should:

* Seek advice from your regular healthcare provider to determine if a medical evaluation is needed or consult your local health department.
* If you feel it is an emergency and you cannot wait, please contact your provider‚Äôs office, emergency room, or urgent care center before your arrival for instructions regarding accessing the facility. If calling 911, inform the operator of your COVID-19 concern.
* Self-isolate and limit contact with others.
* Practice ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù by avoiding mass gatherings and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet) from others when possible.

Everyone please stay safe!

NYC should diversify commute modes.  Mopeds and motor scooters is a option already tested by time in some Asian cities including Taipei and Saigon. They are private in nature so no pooling. They save road space compared to cars. They are very affordable, basic models cost $500 and less. They emit 1/2-1/3 CO2 to cars per distance traveled. 

&amp;#x200B;

In order to support mopeds and motor scooters, we need to:

My father is in his early 60s and works for a major NYC hospital's maintenance and sanitation department. His supervisor told him that under Coumo and De Blasio's guidelines he doesn't need to use a face mask while he works. I've done some research but I can't find anything directly mentioning sanitation departments, only nurses and doctors. Is there any truth to this? 

 Ever since the beginning of the outbreak his supervisor has been downplaying the severity of the virus and even telling him that since he had his flu shot he is immune. The supervisor sends him and his co-workers into confirmed COVID-19 patient rooms for them to sanitize and clean with out protection. My father used to wear a mark but up until last week his supervisor directly forbid it so gloves is all that he has left. His supervisor has mentioned that it has also to do with the shortage of masks to doctors and nurses but he is responsible for sanitizing those same rooms, why doesn't he get the same protection? He is in rooms that routinely have blood and other bodily fluids left in them. 

I'm extremely worried because he is in his 60s, has worked in this hospital for 25+ years and is looking to retire soon. He has been working directly in areas with confirm cases with nothing but gloves. Thankfully, he hasn't shown any symptoms (I know it can also be asymptomatic) but I am scared for his health and my mom who lives with him as they are in the age bracket that is at risk.

So please, is there any government website with specific guidelines towards hospital workers who aren't doctors or nurses that he can bring up to HR or to his ignorant superiors? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",nyc,"My father works a major NYC hospital, he's been told that he can't use a face mask, is this true?"

9393,DontWannaLeaveNYC,1585078972,fobn23,Nan," I've been with my GF for almost 4 years. We live separately because she takes care of her sick non English speaking father (I don't speak Spanish so I have no idea what he says when he talks to me) in Brooklyn. She also has a 20 year old daughter who is currently home from school. I live in downtown Manhattan.

I have been locked by myself in my apartment for the last week. I work from home and have enough food in the freezer and fridge to last me 1-2 months. While staring at the same walls, TV, ceiling, etc can be a lot, I am ok being alone. I am a nerd at heart and am not a social butterfly that needs to be around people all the time. I'm eating and drinking what i want to and watching what I want.

Meanwhile, my GF and her family hate staying in the same cramped apartment and are afraid of what is happening here in NYC, so they want to get a house in Florida and drive down there tomorrow at the latest. They want me to reserve a house and do this with them immediately. Literally every conversation over the phone with her and her daughter are about why we need to leave NYC and how great it would be to have a house in Florida (maybe even one with a private pool).

There are a couple reasons I don't want to do this.

1.) I have food for myself for the next 1-2 months. If I leave my home, I cannot fit this in the car and will need to buy a thousand dollars of food for us for the next 1-2 months. I am not sure stores are even allowing bulk purchases in Florida.

2.) I would have to pay for everything for this trip and stay. My GF and her family lost their jobs and have no savings. Meanwhile, I currently make very good money and can afford the trip but who knows if i will have a job next week. The cost of the house will be $5,000 plus food of $1,000 plus supplies. I can do this for 1-2 months but 3 months will put a huge dent in my savings.

3.) We would have to drive there and it will take 18+ hours. My GF said she would drive half and I would drive half. But the longest I've even been in a car trip was 6 hours. I can't imagine an 18 hour non stop drive with 4 people in the car (plus a return trip will be needed once it is safe to come back).

4.) I am not sure that leaving NYC is safe. Sure there are millions of people here, but who's to say Florida is safer? While I have food, water, and power here in my apartment, what happens if it hits Florida harder? What happens if the groceries there run out of food? What happens if we lose power?  NY is testing more people, quarantining more, and run by people who actually seem to understand the situation.  The Florida governor... not so much.

5.) I am good staying by myself. No one is eating my food but me, so it's not like I get up in the morning and open the cabinet to see all the food is gone because someone had the munchies at 2am. I think this is just me being selfish though. I dunno.

The only reasons to do this:

A.) I would be with my GF and her family. I really do love my GF and her daughter (the daughter really cares about me). I think by me not doing this to be with them, they feel that I am abandoning them.

B.) Maybe going to Florida would be safer? It's less crowded and if we get enough food there, we can stay indoors for weeks at a time.

C.) Being in warm weather and having a pool wouldn't suck.

The ones who live with others seem to value their alone time even more now that they're stuck in one spot with their roommates, significant others children. The ones by themselves now haven't seen anyone they care about for weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even imagine what it's like to be stuck with a significant other and potentially worrying about your relationship on top of everything else. Same thing with wanting to escape your roommate. But you can't fucking imagine how heinous it is to not be in contact with another human being for an indefinite amount of time because you could die. 

&amp;#x200B;

For whatever reason, and I could certainly be unique in this, I have friends who I haven't talked to in weeks who aren't answering my phone calls that would never do this before a quarantine. Either that or people who don't respond to texts.

&amp;#x200B;

Guess what, the remedy for this is unbelievably easy. Send a ""how are you text"" every other day or so to your closer friends. If they send one to you, ask them how they're doing. Maybe, and I know this is crazy, but maybe give someone a call every now and then. It's your duty as an American citizen and AS A FRIEND to get through a crisis together and to seek out the people who might be hurting and put in a minuscule amount of effort to make sure they're ok.

&amp;#x200B;

In the coming weeks/months, mental health will be more and more of an issue. If I could regularly talk to my friends, I'd be ok to stay in the NY area, but this level of isolation is unsustainable.

Shout out from Europe. Today the president of my country increased the level of measures taken to combat the spread of COVID19 and instituted a lockdown. Between 22:00 (10pm) and 06:00 (6am) no one is allowed outside under penalty of law (minor exceptions applicable).   


Tonight has been by far the most quiet night I have ever spent in my city. You can only hear some distant dogs barking. No cars, no traffic, no squabbles.

While Queens is the second most populous borough, and you would expect it to have a high number of cases, it is also one of the boroughs with the least amount of hospitals and hospital beds. There are only 9 hospitals in Queens, compared to 15 in Brooklyn and 20 in Manhattan. Further, there are just 1.66 hospital beds per 1,000 residents, while Brooklyn has 2.18 beds per 1000 residents and Manhattan has 5.67/1000.

What this means is that the hospital system in Queens is close to reaching capacity. Our hospitals are running out of ventilators, running out of beds. Entire floors are being turned into COVID floors, ICUs are packed, ERs are overwhelmed. Our healthcare workers are overwhelmed and tensions are high. 

This may all seem dramatic on my part, but it is happening and we need help. All of the hospitals need help lest we become like Italy and have to start rationing. We need for people to not only care about and donate supplies to the big hospitals in Brooklyn and Manhattan, we are the epicenter of this crisis in New York City!

It doesn't help that the hardest hit community is Corona (ironic, Coronavirus in Corona). This is in general an immigrant population, many don't speak English and are impoverished. They live packed in small apartments, sometimes multigenerations in 1 apartment. They are economically disadvantaged so that they have to work, and they continue to go to work, thus the virus continues to spread. These are your delivery drivers, your back of the house restaurant workers, your cleaning ladies and your nannies. They continue to work and spreading the virus throughout the city and within themselves because they are ""essential workers"" and cannot stay home. Due to these circumstances, the virus is going to continue to spread in this community and our hospitals will reach full capacity, and very soon. 

Again, I apologize for being dramatic and somewhat rambling. But I am mad and I am scared and I am overwhelmed. Every day I am personally admitting at least 10 patients, every day I have had to intubate relatively young and healthy individuals, every day we have more nurses and doctors getting sick. And I fear the day that I will have to choose between whom to use our last ventilator on.

Like most of you, I've been reading a lot of the coronavirus threads in here, and I think there are some things we, as a community, need to get straight when it comes to testing.

A few weeks ago, testing was absolutely critical, because we were trying to contain the virus. When this was 12 people in Rochester, it felt like something we could maybe contain without shutdown if we deployed a bunch of tests and quarantined the necessary people. Those days are over.

The virus has spread out of control in this city. That is a fact. We all know that the ""confirmed cases"" number is virtually irrelevant right now if we're trying to get the real number of cases out there. This virus has shown to be extremely contagious, and the numbers we're seeing are the tip of the iceberg. While testing is, obviously, still important for various reasons, its function has shifted significantly away from attempted containment.

I've been seeing a lot of frustration in this subreddit around not being able to get tested for coronavirus. Under normal circumstances, this would be a healthy impulse: you're worried you might have an illness, you get tested. But these aren't normal circumstances. Our medical resources are already severely limited.

You have symptoms, and you're worried you might be infected. Consider the possibilities:

1. **You're positive.** If your symptoms are mild, you go home and quarantine (which you should be doing anyway). If your symptoms are severe, you're admitted to the hospital. Either way, there's the potential of you exposing others to corona on the way to the hospital, in the hospital, etc.
2. **You're negative.** If your symptoms are mild, you go home and quarantine (which you should be doing anyway). If your symptoms are severe, you're admitted to the hospital. Either way, there's the potential of you exposing yourself to corona on the way to the hospital, in the hospital, etc.

**Of course, there are extenuating circumstances.** And if you're in those circumstances, you already know them. One that comes to mind is people working on ""essential services,"" like healthcare workers, city infrastructure, etc. Another is people who are particularly at risk.

**But if you're working from home and are self-quarantined, do not seek out testing if you're experiencing mild or moderate symptoms.** For you, the protocol is as it always is: if you're sick, stay home and see how your symptoms develop. If you need a hospital, go to a hospital.

Here are some facts:

1. **Our medical system is already being strained, and every one of us that goes in seeking testing piles on more strain.** Let's please save medical resources (including personnel, PPE, and tests) for people who are in serious condition.
2. **If you're young and otherwise healthy, the chances are fairly good that this virus will present similarly to a bad or unusual cold or the flu.** This is a fact. Let me qualify here: this disease is much much more serious than the flu, and yes, young, healthy people are getting sick and dying from it. But those are very rare cases. It's very easy to focus on those cases, and, in as much as they motivate people to stay home, that's a good thing. But to the point where they cause panic and undue strain on our medical infrastructure, they hurt us.

I'm going to propose something: **assume you are positive for COVID-19**. Go ahead, say it: ""I have coronavirus."" It's okay. Say it. How does it feel? See, you don't need a test. Maybe you have a fever and a cough. Quarantine yourself and, if it gets bad, go to a hospital. Maybe you feel totally fine. Quarantine yourself, and if you develop severe symptoms, go to a hospital. There is no harm in operating under the assumption that you carry this virus. Please get comfortable with that idea.

Also, this is not just me saying this: the hospitals and city and New York has been putting this message out.

\---

A little firsthand experience: my partner and I have both had close contact with people who have tested positive for COVID-19. We started developing symptoms. We got scared, and the impulse was to go and get tested (I definitely get it!), but were advised by multiple sources not to seek out testing for the reasons outlined above. Regardless: we're operating under the assumption that we have corona. WE HAVE CORONAVIRUS.

The noise is absolutely obnoxious. It sounds like they are literally drilling into the walls that lead into the apartment and shaking the entire building. People are supposed to somehow stay their tiny apartments and entertain themselves for weeks now, but how is one to do that while the drilling is louder than television, and literally shakes the apartment? It's not even possible to sleep during the work.

Why are dozens of construction workers still gathering? Why is the city allowing them to work while everyone is home if they don't allow them to work at night or over weekends? I don't think that it's reasonable to ask people to stay at home for entire days while they are being subjected to this.

I can't stress this enough, please do not call 911 unless you are having a life threatening emergency. If you have a fever and are congested, self isolate at home, have someone bring you some fever reducing medication, and rest. 

Immediate changes have been made to 911 EMS operations in NYC. If you call 911, understand that you will NOT have a choice of which hospital you will go to. You will have to be transported to the nearest hospital to your location. So if Brookdale, a notoriously overcrowded and overstrained hospital, is the closest ER, you will be transported there. If you refuse to be transported to the closest hospital, the crews will have you sign a document, and you will then have to figure out where you want to go yourself. 

Going by ambulance does not guarantee you will be seen any faster. ALL hospitals are dealing with the influx of potential and confirmed COVID patients. If your symptoms are considered mild, you will be ""moved to the back of the line"", and critical patients will be dealt with first. So again, calling an ambulance to ""skip the line"" isn't going to work.

We are still seeing an exponential growth in these cases, so continue to stay at home if you are not an essential worker, and do symptom checks daily, including temperature checks if you have an access to a thermometer. Our EMS folks are continuing to work hard with the limited resources they have available.

So I, as well as probably a lot of people, need to move to a new apartment on April 1. With the way things have been progressing with this coronavirus, NYC is now the epicenter of the pandemic in the US and I am concerned stricter shuttering and regulations will be put in place, perhaps somehow barring us from leaving home. I‚Äôve been trying to search on the internet for more information about shelter-in-place and what those orders typically entail.

I know Cuomo has implemented a NYS on Pause policy which is slightly less stringent than a full shelter in place policy, but so much can change in a week as we have seen. I am relying on renting a car like Zipcar and I am primarily worried about two things: not being able to get this rental car because these companies might be told to shut down, and having a stricter policy put into place that might prevent me from moving or leaving my current residence even though my lease is up on April 1. 

Is anyone familiar with these type of policies and can give me more info on whether this is just over-worrying or if these are valid concerns? Some countries in Europe, like Italy, seem to have implemented extremely strict measures, but for things like necessities (I view my situation as a necessity since it is a roof over my head), I hope people have been still able to do them. I just hope I can get a rental car, because there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd be able to move without one.",nyc,Moving during coronavirus pandemic

In Korea, you cannot enter a place of business without a mask. They offer hand sanitizer at every door. Gov't institutions take your temp before you enter their building as well.

While most in the Asian community has jumped on board. I still see people of other ethnicities like Latinos and Blacks still not wearing masks. I also saw two elderly Caucasian men without a mask in the post office two days ago. Like WHY?? They obviously know they're in a high-risk group.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT DOES THE SURVEY CONSIST OF?** 

We are asking you for: 

\- Your ZIP Code

\- Your Age (Optional)

\- Your Gender &amp; Ethnicity (Optional) 

\- Any symptoms you're experiencing (even if you're not having any).

**ZIP CODE**

*The primary reason we're collecting this information is to map the spread of COVID-19 in NYC, Your ZIP code will help us place you on that map.* 

**AGE (Optional)**

*Early research shows that different age groups experience different levels of risk in the event they contract the virus--your age will help us understand the level of risk associated with certain geographic areas, as well as provide a basis for comparing the effect of age on the number and severity of symptoms.*

**GENDER + ETHNICITY (Optional)**

*Telling us your gender or ethnicity will help us determine whether particular demographics are more at risk than others, which is key for understanding the ways in which the virus spreads and the which groups and areas are likely to need the most support.*

**SYMPTOMS**

*This one is pretty straightforward, by collecting symptoms, we'll be able to determine which symptoms are most common, and which ones appear in rarer cases, information which can be used by health professionals to assess the severity of a specific COVID-19 case.*

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?** 

**One of the scarcest, but most important resources for first-responders and crisis-management professionals during pandemics is data--particularly location data. By collecting responses from you all about your symptoms and combining that with your ZIP code, we can identify hotspots and track progression of the virus over time in New York City.** 

**This information is vital to ensure our city stays safe and takes the right steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.**

**WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH OUR DATA?**

**All the information we collect is completely anonymous.** Our data will be made publicly available on a daily basis in the form of a heatmap of NYC split up by area code, and the underlying data will be also available by request to anyone who wants it. 

**SHOULD I FILL OUT THE SURVEY IF I AM NOT FEELING SICK?** 

**YES!!!** Even if we collected all the information from everyone who was feeling ill in NYC, we wouldn't have anything to benchmark or compare it against. If you are **healthy,** we want to know about it, and if your condition **changes** we want to know about that too. 

**HOW MANY TIMES SHOULD I FILL OUT THE SURVEY?** 

**You should fill out the survey no more than once a day.** If you only fill it out once--that's fine, but if you're willing to fill it out once a day, it would help us keep track of how symptoms change over time, a vital piece of information for understanding the spread of the disease. 

&amp;#x200B;

**ABOUT COVIDMAP NYC**

COVIDMAP is a group of NYC-based data professionals, who are constantly looking to use data to solve new problems. In this case, we noticed there was a lack of local-level data available for professionals who are working to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 Virus and mitigate risk, as well as treat those who are already infected. 

Collecting this data and making it available to both professionals who need it, as well as the general public, is key to helping curtail the spread of COVID-19 in major metropolitan areas and across the country.

If you live in a different city or state, and want to get this process set up there, please feel free to reach out to us via email.

9715,PeoplesRevolution,1585186246,fp2o3f,Nan,"About a month ago the directors of my hospital came to floor and met with all the staff on my unit and told us that we were going to be first unit in the hospital where COVID-19 cases came. They would try to keep cases all together on my unit to keep the virus from spreading. I remember the first cases we received the government was not ready and gave us pushback when we requested testing. Then they agreed and it took days and days to get the results. I remember thinking about what kind of impact this would have on the hospital and the city if cases were confirmed. I was scared. Since then every day has been worse than the last. During normal times it is difficult working in a hospital; seeing so many people who are sick and dying and trying to help my patients and their families. But I have never seen anything like this in my life. We are now seeing waves of people coming into the hospital with COVID-19. The disease is brutal and contagious. I‚Äôve heard more Codes over the loud speaker like ‚ÄúRapid Response‚Äù and ‚ÄúRespiratory STAT‚Äù in the last week then I can count. This virus is making the hospital and the healthcare system scream. We are facing shortages of masks and ventilators and protective gowns and scrubs and sanitary wipes and hospital beds. Because of the shortages we are rationing PPE and It is putting us as healthcare workers at great risk. I was deeply saddened today to hear that some close friends and coworkers in the hospital have tested positive. I worry about my safety and my coworkers safety. Especially the Nurses and CNAs and Physician Assistants and Doctors on my team who I joke with and help me get through the day. I worry about my patients who I am working with who look so scared having to look death in the eye and fight this battle and I wish I could help them more. I worry everyday going to work. My job as a Social Worker in the hospital is to be the Discharge Planner. My job is to assess patients and families and their needs coordinate everything related to safely discharging a patient from the hospital. This includes connecting a patient with homecare, dialysis, nursing facilities, shelters, arranging transport, working with families and insurances and agencies. This has gotten increasingly difficult as homecare agencies and nursing facilities do not want to take patients with COVID-19 and my families that I work with are scared to take their  loved ones home. It is creating a situation where others in crisis may be unable to get a bed in the hospital and may be stuck in the ER. So please do not come to the ER unless your symptoms are becoming unmanageable. Try telehealth or urgent care otherwise. Please stay indoors and respect this quarantine. Please reach out to me if you can donate Masks (particularly N95s), disinfectant wipes, or other PPE. Please be safe and wash your hands.",nyc,Message from a NYC Hospital Worker

Not a New Yorker here but been checking in on this sub regularly since late Feb to get some ""on the ground"" perspective on ground zero and see how y'all are doing as this ramps up.  It's already really sad, and so frustrating that so many people and governments have been so bone headed almost the entire time.



Anyway, if you had been relying on a gym to stay fit, and since it's unreasonable to own a ""real"" weight set when living in cramped quarters, I'd just like to suggest looking into dynamic/variable dumbbells.  I know Bowflex makes some, probably there are other competitors out there too.  Not trying to plug any company here, just trying to make them easier to find.  Imagine weights with many plates which add up to 50 lbs, but you can spin a dial down to any number below 50 and when you lift them, that poundage comes out on the bell and the other plates you don't need for that weight stay on the ground, allowing you full customization.  HUGE space saver (and cost saver too, if you need like 4 or 5 different weights for your routine).

i have been living in USA for 2 years and i never had situation like this: this evening my e-bike  was stolen which was the only source of making money in such hard time‚Ä¶ The bike was AVENTON LEVEL i bought it month ago as i lost my main job due to COVID-19. So  I would like to know what to do in this situation. I called police, they came, made report, watched cameras but told to wait but im not sure they find it. Maybe somebody had the same situation or start to find money for new one‚Ä¶ My wife is in maternity leave now and im really devastated what to do.  As this bike is a new brand and if you see any ads about selling this bike in New York City PLEASE LET ME KNOW. 

I was waiting pick up delivery in Burger King on Kings Highway and Nostrand ave, Brooklyn  around 9:30 pm, so there was no place to chain it and i looked rear wheel to my my frame. I had an alarm BUT the battery died( There was lights and cameras there so i had no idea somebody can take it. Officer told a guy just took it and carried it but its hard to see face‚Ä¶. it happens  3/25/2020. Maybe somebody was in this area and saw this guy. also can yo tell me place except craiglist where he can sell it. I hope to find it‚Ä¶ 

So don‚Äôt make my mistakes and don‚Äôt chain bike like this. I hope Karma reaches him because steal something in this time is disgusting. The bike is new i even didn‚Äôt make any pics if it so i attach photo from website. 

Im not sure in what topic i should post it, i wanna post it in 3 topics if its possible.

‚ÄúThe plan is going to pilot closing streets in New York City,‚Äù Cuomo said in an Albany press briefing. ‚ÄúBecause we have much less traffic ‚Ä¶ [we have] open streets. People want to go out and get some air.‚Äù

Cuomo offered no additional details about the test run, which he first called for on Sunday morning ‚Äî and which de Blasio rolled out more than 48 hours later on Tuesday afternoon.

Up to two streets per borough will be closed to vehicular traffic starting Thursday, Hizzoner said, though he was mum on which stretches would be shuttered.

The delay in implementing the plan was on the part of the reticent de Blasio administration, a source told The Post.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not making it easy,‚Äù said the insider.

The hope is that offering New Yorkers additional space to shake off their self-isolation blues would keep them from congregating in city parks, in order to maintain social distancing, which appears to be working to drive down the rate of coronavirus-related hospitalizations.

Basically, I'm assuming that all the reported data is underreported other than reported deaths numbers. Then, I'm using some assumptions about infection fatality rates (as opposed to reported case fatality rates) and growth rates to infer where we are and where we're going. I think you have to assume the 3/22 near-shutdown in NYS is working, but that we won't see that in the reported data yet (e.g., you don't die for \~3 weeks and people who got infected on 3/21 probably aren't even feeling symptoms yet, so positive test results will peak later). **Some specific conclusions: daily new infections (actual, not reported) have already peaked, reported deaths and positive test results won't peak for \~2 and \~1 weeks, respectively, and probably \~1.5 million New Yorkers have contracted SARS-ncov-2 and that won't exceed \~2 million.**

As of last Friday you can apply in full for CASH ASSISTANCE and SNAP BENEFITS (fka Food Stamps) via HRA online or the HRA App, you no longer have to go in-person to an HRA center to apply! The interview portion of the application process will be conducted via phone.

What does this mean? You can receive CASH and FOOD (in the form of credit) if you qualify! These are benefit programs paid for by your taxes, provided for by your government, for you and your family‚Äôs benefit!

I encourage you to apply, as long as you meet the means-tested requirements which include but are not limited to: 1) NYC Residency 2) Citizenship (OR being in a Mixed Status family, meaning at least 1 person in the family is a citizen; or a handful of other qualified non-citizens such as refugees), 3) Earning below the income limit which is based on various factors including family composition.

More good news, HRA is avoiding any adverse actions (sanctions, case closures etc) against clients who fail to attend appointments, and they are generally reducing barriers to receiving benefits (such as suspending requirements for all Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents). The benefits are admittedly small, but they can help, and it has never been easier to apply.

So I work as a server and was laid off with most people in my industry on the 15th. 

I tried for 4 days to submit my online form for unemployment. Finally, it went through. I immediately received a message saying I have to call them personally to confirm things. 

It's been 5 days of calling every 10 minutes, and it's either A)""We are experiencing many callers, try again tomorrow"" or B) the phone is completely disconnected.

There is no hold. I'm starting to get worried as I need to collect my unemployment rather soon as scrape week to week. 

One small thing I did notice. When I tried to fill out the forms right when I became unemployed, I was able to get through a few pages of questions before the site kept crashing. One was, were did you work last? And they had three of my previous employers listed, and I would click one. Though the time I was able to go all the way through the form, it no longer had that option. I had to physically write in the FEIN. Would this make a difference? Can I try to fill out the form online again, or would that just screw up my timeline to get benefits? I'm wondering if there was some glitch that made me have to call.",nyc,Help with unemployment from a server.

Nurses are [wearing garbage bags and dying](https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/worker-at-nyc-hospital-where-nurses-wear-trash-bags-as-protection-dies-from-coronavirus/), doctors are making masks out of coffee filters, the CDC has recommended [bandanas](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html). We're making face shields for our staff out of Styrofoam, lamination paper, and elastic bands in order to preserve the longevity of scarce N95s, which some staff are expected to wear for days in a row. That is, when they have them at all.

Students and residents all over the city are banding together. We've established a service which will connect selfless donors DIRECTLY to doctors in desperate need. We're volunteering our time, it is of absolutely no cost to donor nor doctor. We are prepared to do this service, healthcare workers are prepared to keep fighting this war, but we NEED your voice. We NEED those who have Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) available to donate to become aware that we are standing by ready to take it from there.

Word of the organization is reaching media outlets \[[1](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavrirus-medical-staff-beg-for-masks-social-media)\]\[[2](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-nyu-coronavirus-fund-raising-20200326-pnsrwyxoojgwnbsviqo37gt73q-story.html)\], and that will surely spread the word, but frankly I'd rather put my trust directly in new yorkers. If you know of ANYONE, be it individual or company, that you have even a suspicion may have spare PPE I plead that you reach out to them. It can, and will, save lives. Now more than ever we are aware of the impact we have on each other, let's do some good with it.

All that needs be done, is to direct any potential donors to the following website, and we'll do the rest:

9953,pp2568,1585268674,fpn23a,Nan,"Hey y'all, I need your advice.

It‚Äôs looking like my grandparents have coronavirus. My grandma woke up with a fever today and my grandpa is really tired and having some difficulty breathing (it may be his pre-existing lung condition). We learned today that one of their home aids has another patient who recently tested positive. My aunt ordered home-tests that will hopefully come soon. 

My family and I are trying to think of the best action. Right now we are leaning toward keeping them at home. We are worried about sending them to the hospital since they would need to be there alone and (1) they don't speak any English, (2) they would be frightened, and (3) my grandma suffers from Huntington's disease and requires a lot of care. On paper, their likelihood of survival does not seem great since both are \~80, have some pre-existing conditions, and NYC's hospitals are pretty much at capacity. Also worried that once they test positive, their other home aids will not be able to come take care of them.

It's tough to think straight right now, so any advice would be super helpful. Random questions I have right now (plus any other advice would be super appreciated)

* If we do keep them at home, what should the plan be? One person is assigned to be their caretaker and spends some time there every day but is otherwise quarantined? At what point do we go to the hospital, if at all?
* What kind of supplies is useful ? I know people have said tylenol is helpful-- anything else you recommend?
* Do you know of any in-house palliative services for patients suffering from COVID19?

With all of that being said, I think Coronavirus has exposed that America still has slaves. No we don't have slaves because you aren't white. We have slaves in the form of workers and it really encompasses everybody. It's a form of class slavery. 

When this Coronavirus issue first started popping up everybody was like wtf. The first thing that went through anybody who is sensible and currently works mind is... ""if this gets worst how the fuck am I going to pay the bills? Am I going to be laid off for not wanting to go to work? Fired?""

Then many white collar workers breathed a sigh of relief. Most of them can work from home which is great. I'm not hating. That's great. I'll be in that camp in a couple months when I'm done with my degree this semester hopefully. 

But literally everybody else, from retail workers to construction people to the gig economy were just royally screwed. 

I mean the people I saw delivering my food looked absolutely depressed man. Especially the ones without masks. Who knows if they even have a underlying health condition? They don't have cash saved up in case of a rainy day yet, they can't work from home, they don't have sick leave... what are they to do?

If my housing situation is tied to your ability to pay your mortgage, what happens if a large unexpected maintenance issue comes up that impedes your ability to pay the mortgage? If you don't have the ability to cover your _investment_ at a loss for at least a couple of months, you should accept the fact that you overextended yourself and failed your _investment_. Not being able to pay your mortgage without the renter paying rent is also _your failure_.",nyc,"With the amount of landlords whining about not being able to afford their mortgage, renters should ask for credit and income checks now too"

When I contacted my super, he was able to find the problem. A light on the heater that indicates it is working is not on, and when he goes to reset the heater nothing happens.

The problem is, he‚Äôs contacted 5 people he knows and no one will come because of the virus. This is understandable, but I can‚Äôt go without hot water for the duration of the covid-19 crisis for obvious reasons.

I hope everyone is doing well during all this.  The reason for this post is that I'm searching for a fabrication shop in the NYC area which can facilitate building Intubation boxes to help protect healthcare workers against Coronavirus (COVID-19).  The website can be found here:  [https://intubationbox.com/](https://intubationbox.com/).  


The Intubation boxes are made out of acrylic and cost approximately $200 each.  We are doing a donation drive in Arizona, and will be sending Intubation Boxes to Arizona hospitals.    


But this is where I need some help.  We would like to send some Intubation Boxes to NYC hospitals, however, it costs a fair amount to ship them.  What I'm hoping to find is a fabrication shop in NYC that we could send money to, and that shop would then build these Intubation Boxes and have them delivered to NYC hospitals.  


If you have a fabrication shop that could build these, or, know someone who does, please let me know.  Also, the Intubation Box is open source and the design is freely accessable on the website.

Gary Vura has been wiping down counters and cooking for himself in his Carnegie Hill apartment since his wife and daughters decamped for his sister-in-law‚Äôs house in Concord, Massachusetts.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to use the vacuum cleaner yet, but that should happen,‚Äù said Vura, a managing director at Guggenheim Securities. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably doing more of that than I used to. It feels fine.‚Äù

He‚Äôs working on a laptop at the dining room table. Watching the markets ‚Äúfills the lack of sports void,‚Äù he said. So far he‚Äôs made pork roast in the slow cooker, as well as meatballs and shrimp parm.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no issue getting an elevator,‚Äù Vura said. ‚ÄúAnd I can see a lot of boxes are stacked up downstairs, so people clearly aren‚Äôt here to accept them, and the floors are pretty empty. The gym is closed, the doormen are still working.‚Äù

Welcome to the world of those who didn‚Äôt go to the Hamptons, Connecticut or Florida to avoid the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit New York City hard. They chose to stay on the Upper East Side, watching their buildings clear out, stores close and doormen don gloves. Some want to be near hospitals. One couple‚Äôs second home in Long Island is under construction. Others don‚Äôt have the option of another place to go.

Now they‚Äôre living in a ghost town, devoid of $100 blowouts and tourists crowding the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Real estate activity has slowed to a trickle. Open houses are canceled, and showings of multimillion-dollar apartments -- when they even happen -- are done virtually. The Valentino boutique has emptied its shelves and racks, while some other high-end stores are boarded-up. Frank E. Campbell says it can webcast a funeral service, and will try to procure flowers as best it can, but there haven‚Äôt been requests.

Only Central Park has a sense of bustle and the few businesses open are food markets, restaurants for take-out and delivery, pharmacies and dry cleaners.

William Poll, a specialty food store on Lexington Avenue that turns 100 next year, is testing a new truffle souffle it plans to roll out in about a month, said owner Stanley Poll.

Orders by the dozens and half-dozens are coming in for frozen dinners like chicken pot pie and coq au vin, from locals and customers around the country.

‚ÄúThe chicken curry, in two weeks we had to make three batches, a batch is 60 dishes,‚Äù Poll said from the store‚Äôs second-floor office. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been hectic to say the least.‚Äù

The store moved to its current location in 1958, when Poll was in college. Now 81, he‚Äôs been going to work every day by taxi.

‚ÄúWhen I go home at night, 6:30 or so, you just fly down Lexington, you can literally count the number of cars on your hands,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFirst Avenue, you have to be very careful crossing the avenue, now you can literally waltz across the avenue and do a dance in the middle.‚Äù

At Jeeves New York on East 65th Street, its laundering and dry cleaning business is down 77% as clients have fled to homes in Pound Ridge, New York, and Captiva Island, Florida. Still, the store picked up 10 bags of bed sheets Monday it normally wouldn‚Äôt have.

‚ÄúBecause their house staff isn‚Äôt coming in, they don‚Äôt know what to do with their sheets,‚Äù said owner Jerry Pozniak.

The service, which includes quarantining the laundry for 24 hours, isn‚Äôt cheap: $42 a sheet, $85 for a duvet cover and as much as $16 for pillow cases. On Wednesday, he started offering a 20% discount.

‚ÄúIt is exorbitant, but the types of sheets that we‚Äôre getting -- you‚Äôre looking at $3,000-$4,000 for set,‚Äù Pozniak said. ‚ÄúA lot of places do it on automated machinery. We‚Äôre using hand irons.‚Äù

Four of Juice Press‚Äôs Upper East Side stores are open. It started a grocery delivery business, selling kale chips and avocados, though its hottest item at the moment is its $8 Ginger Fireball, billed as an immunity booster.

‚ÄúWe sold 25,000 to 30,000 bottles since the crisis began,‚Äù Chief Executive Officer Michael Karsch said. The company bought a six-month supply of Peruvian ginger a few weeks ago and has been able to avoid raising the price, even as the cost of ginger has doubled since, he said.

One person swilling the stuff was Mark Mullett. He lives in the East 60s with his husband who works in finance. They have a home in Bridgehampton, but decided to stick it out in the city.
‚ÄúWe can walk to the grocery store, it‚Äôs right around the corner,‚Äù said Mullett, co-founder of Obe Fitness, an at-home exercise platform. ‚ÄúAll of our working materials are here.‚Äù

He‚Äôs rediscovered Central Park. ‚ÄúI saw one woman with a cane,‚Äù Mullett said. ‚ÄúShe put a sign on it that said, ‚ÄòStay socially distant,‚Äô with a smiley face. She was walking around holding it out.‚Äù
On his way to the park, he passes the boutiques on Madison Avenue. Some still have elaborate displays. Others have been entirely cleared out. The RealReal storefront was boarded up as of Wednesday.

Matthew Bauer, president of the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District, said he hadn‚Äôt heard any concerns about looting. Foot traffic to the park and residences above many of the stores help keep the neighborhood safe, he said. The improvement district workers who clean the newspaper boxes and meters are still on duty, and the local police precinct is still doing patrols.

Marianne Rosenberg, who runs the gallery begun by her family in 1878 in Paris, said the exhibit she opened in early March is still up. She puts on her security system, just as she would any other day.
‚ÄúRight now,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúpeople have other things to do than go around and steal from art galleries.‚Äù

March 27, 2020, 5:14 PM EDT

Rhode Island police began stopping cars with New York plates Friday. On Saturday, the National Guard will help them conduct house-to-house searches to find people who traveled from New York and demand 14 days of self-quarantine.

‚ÄúRight now we have a pinpointed risk,‚Äù Governor Gina Raimondo said. ‚ÄúThat risk is called New York City.‚Äù

New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., on Friday reporting a total of 44,000 cases.

Rhode Island has just over 200, and it has begun an aggressive campaign to keep the virus out and New Yorkers contained, over objections from civil liberties advocates.

Raimondo, a Democrat, said she had consulted lawyers and said while she couldn‚Äôt close the border, she felt confident she could enforce a quarantine.

Seaside Retreat

Many New Yorkers have summer houses in Rhode Island, especially in tony Newport, and the governor said the authorities would be checking there.

‚ÄúYesterday I announced and today I reiterated: Anyone coming to Rhode Island in any way from New York must be quarantined,‚Äù the governor said. ‚ÄúBy order. Will be enforced. Enforceable by law.‚Äù

Raimondo signed an executive order Thursday that applies to anyone who has been in New York during the past two weeks and through at least April 25. It doesn‚Äôt apply to public health, public safety, or health-care workers.

National Guard members will be stationed at the T.F. Green airport, Amtrak train stations and at bus stops. The citizen-soldiers will be following up with people at local residences. The maximum penalty for not complying: a fine of $500 and 90 days in prison.

The local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union blasted the new rules, objecting to the collection of motorists‚Äô contact information in particular.

‚ÄúWhile the Governor may have the power to suspend some state laws and regulations to address this medical emergency, she cannot suspend the Constitution,‚Äù Rhode Island ACLU executive director Steven Brown said in a statement. ‚ÄúUnder the Fourth Amendment, having a New York state license plate simply does not, and cannot, constitute ‚Äòprobable cause‚Äô to allow police to stop a car and interrogate the driver, no matter how laudable the goal of the stop may be.‚Äù

Police Stops
Just before 1 p.m. Friday, state police were set up on Interstate 95 northbound, at the rest stop closest to the Connecticut border. A mile or two before that, motorists could see signs ordering all New York passenger vehicles to pull over at the rest stop.

One trooper could be seen there, checking license plates as cars went by. At the stop itself, a number of officers were assembled around a tent, ready to question vehicle occupants.

But uptown (Harlem/Washington Heights) people are still out, running, playing basketball, and enjoying themselves.   


I conducted some interviews (practicing the 6ft spacing rule) and asked: How long should the shutdown last? Similar to the federal government, it's hard to get a straight answer. I doubt that small businesses and economically disadvantaged folks can handle it for much longer, but I know that half steps won't yield any lasting solutions.

I've been trying to secure N95 masks for family and friends that are health care workers on eBay. One thing that I realized was that some US sellers were selling expired masks. There were also Chinese sellers selling fake 3M products. I think the fake ones are still somewhat effective, but not as effective as authentic masks.

I tried to verify the lot numbers in the 3m masks and they didn't come up in the database. I also looked at packaging and copyright was dated back to 8, 9, even 11 years ago. Some masks and gas filters are thinner than the original US versions, which obviously raises suspicions. Luckily, eBay had refunded my money for most of the purchases.

I did read an article that said that even expired masks were better than surgical masks if they were kept in a cool atmosphere for a long time, so they can still have some benefit.

With that said, there. Medical workers should put in an extra filtration layer when using donated N95 masks without original packaging. Adding static material behind the masks like the Swiffer dry cloths may be helpful.

Its bullshit that most of the working class just got laid off but landlords expect rent to be paid. The stimulus checks will be a pass through to landlords and won't support the working class.

I believe young people (under 30) should threaten to rally in front of the mayors house (6ft apart) unless April rent is canceled for NYC.

Despite what you hear about young people dying from the coronavirus it is still statistically incredibly rare. Such a rally would be a logistical nightmare for the nypd to deal with, but what would be even worse is if people of all ages, desperate for money and out of work, start stealing and committing crimes to get their basic needs met. (The proverbial ""when the poor shall have nothing more to eat, they will eat the rich"").

Even just a threat of a rally will be taken very seriously by the city and the state, that enough might  make them cave to our demands.

Usually there are 3-10 orders available to drivers, with each one saying how much InstaCart will pay and how much the tip will be. Obviously, drivers will filter out the low paying ones. InstaCart‚Äôs pay structure is similar to that of servers: without tips, they earn below minimum wage. So, understandably, drivers are not eager to accept orders that tip low/don‚Äôt tip. Besides, a significant amount of InstaCart drivers just recently signed up after getting laid off, and they‚Äôre only doing it out of desperation (why else would someone risk it for a low paying job). So not tipping is also pretty unappreciative (we‚Äôre not talking about a small delivery‚Äîthey literally spend 1-3 hours shopping for you).

The point of this post is not to guilt you into tipping. It‚Äôs to point out the reality that if you don‚Äôt tip, you‚Äôre gonna have a much harder time finding a driver who will accept your order. For example, if your order looks something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/OqfhMjL) you‚Äôll be waiting a long time until someone accepts it. If it looks like [this ](https://imgur.com/a/jgrnaI5), however, chances are it‚Äôll be accepted in seconds. And that‚Äôs perfectly understandable. Grocery shopping in unfamiliar stores with 50% of the items out of stock (thus having to find a replacement and another replacement if the replacement is out of stock) takes a lot longer than you may think, and the only way to earn minimum wage is to accept to better paying orders, which almost always include a decent tip.",nyc,Note to those using InstaCart

He is from the muslim brotherhood group who are marked as terrorist organization here.

He is agitating against our country and I don't know what to do since I'm not american or living in the states so i don't know how to report him to the american authorities.

This is not to say you should move your appointment if you need to be examined. Telehealth is best for patients who just need to speak to their doctor, go over results, medication changes, etc. 

Please, just ask. Sometimes the receptionists forget, or nobody got the chance to call and tell the patient bc their appointment was booked months before this pandemic. 

We can work with you! We understand sometimes you have to come in, like for infusions. However, we offer not just telehealth, but also over the phone appointments. And a lot of other offices do too. Some offices even set up drive through shots and labs. 

I am scared. Your healthcare providers are scared. They don‚Äôt want to be interacting with a lot of people, but it‚Äôs their job. So please make it easier on all of us and just call and ask. Reducing density also applies to offices. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs impossible to follow the 6 ft apart rule in an office. So, be proactive. 

The number of in-person patients we have IS very much reduced, but that‚Äôs because people keep canceling due to fear of coronavirus, which is smart. But sometimes you really need to speak to your dr, and that‚Äôs where telehealth comes in. Also, utilize your patient portals, please. If you don‚Äôt already have it set up, do that. Most of you are at home anyway, and it takes only a couple minutes. 

I will continue to reach out to patients on Monday. But to do that I have to come into the office, where I get panic attacks several times a day because I myself have preexisting conditions and take the train. Our nurses have pre existing conditions. Our doctors, lab techs, secretaries, IT, etc. Many of us use public transit

WE need to work together to stop this. So please, do your part too, and ask. If you have an upcoming appointment, I beg you to please pick up the phone and call. If you have a patient portal, send a message to dr or staff. Please. 

We are short staffed so I, someone with no administrative experience, is now helping do administrative duties. I am going to try my hardest to convert all in person appointments than can be converted, to telehealth. This will help protect everyone. Stay safe out there and remember there are always things you can do to reduce your risk. 

On a side note: I‚Äôve heard 7 ambulances today, one for my own building, in the span of 7 hours. I live near Elmhurst hospital. They are now sending ambulances from LIJ forest hills. Please, we have got to work together. I beg you all. Wash your hands, try not to go out unless absolutely necessary, and if you think your job can be done from home ASK your boss. Beg them if you have to. I even know people who stopped showing up and insisted they work from home. We gotta get people away from each other. Thanks for reading.

What are the signs I should look out for?

This girl I‚Äôve been hanging a lot with had taken a few years off from teaching (but subbing throughout), and around January told me that she intended to interview and return to teaching full time come September. But every time I ask her about it now -she doesn‚Äôt give me a straight answer if she applied or interviewed or  if she has been offered a contact to return to BOE

I know that things are crazy and everything is up in the air, but I would really like to know if she actually interviewed before all this covid happened, and if she was offered a contract or not. Either she has a contract or she does not right? Or have they not yet offered contracts for this coming September yet? 

Any ideas how I can find out? Or when BOE would have sent offers?

I didn‚Äôt finish my coffee yet so if this isn‚Äôt making total sense just let me know!

Mercato's documentation refers to online cancellation, but they appear to have removed the option from the settings during the COVID response and instead require cancellation by emailing them. I sent 6 emails over the past 10 days with no response and called with no answer. 

Yesterday, they charged my credit card for $96 (full year of their service) despite my nonstop attempts to cancel. I filed a dispute with AmEx and have no doubt that I'll get my money back since I have the email/ticket received emails from Mercato showing I asked to cancel a half dozen times, but hopefully this can save one of you from this headache.

10599,kickit,1585499148,fr8ici,Nan,"Hey all, I‚Äôve seen a couple threads around here where multiple commenters have talked about illnesses they had in late January &amp; February that might have been covid. I also came down at the start of February, and I‚Äôve been wondering more about it in the past week. I am by no means a medical expert, and this thread is not meant to be a definitive case or anything. Instead, it‚Äôs a jumping off point for discussion, as I‚Äôm legitimately curious to know more here. I titled my post as a question for a reason. I‚Äôm most interested in hearing other people‚Äôs experiences and thoughts on the February bug, especially regarding how likely we think it may have been coronavirus.

Before we go further, here‚Äôs a few articles that have guided my thinking in the past week: 

* [The Atlantic: How the Coronavirus Became an American Catastrophe](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-are-sick-lost-february/608521/)
* [WaPo: How US coronavirus testing stalled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/16/cdc-who-coronavirus-tests/)
* [NYT: How a Failure to Test Blinded the US to Covid-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html)
* [WaPo: Three months into the pandemic, here‚Äôs how likely the coronavirus is to infect people
](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/three-months-into-the-pandemic-here-is-what-we-know-about-the-coronavirus/2020/03/28/6646f502-6eab-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html)
* [WaPo: New Orleans fears Mardis Gras fueled coronavirus outbreak as cases spike](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-new-orleans-mardi-gras/2020/03/26/8c8e23c8-6fbb-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html)

So for a long time I‚Äôve assumed that the bug I had at the start of Feb were not due to the coronavirus. My symptoms included soreness and tiredness, some coughing (not that bad), a sore throat, and I lost my voice. Symptoms lasted about a week total. I normally don‚Äôt get very sick, but this one hit me harder than anything has in years. Which I found surprising, because I had my flu shot back in November.

For a few reasons, I‚Äôve assumed for a long time that what I had was not the coronavirus. The #1 reason at the time was that when I got sick, there were no confirmed cases in NYC and no documented community-based transmission anywhere in the country. As time has gone on, I‚Äôve added to that that to my knowledge, no one that I interacted with around that time got sick.

For those reasons, I‚Äôve dismissed the notion that what I had back then was coronavirus. But lately, I‚Äôm not so sure.

The first reason (that coronavirus hadn‚Äôt spread yet) is looking pretty dubious at this point. Although the virus wasn‚Äôt detected in NYC until early March, they also weren‚Äôt testing much. Only 500 tests total were run in the US by mid-February, and the CDC very strongly discouraged running tests to identify community-based transmission.

Because there was so little testing, there‚Äôs a lot we don‚Äôt know here. But it appears the virus was silently spreading throughout the month of February. It rapidly spread undetected in Seattle, and was likely circulated at Mardis Gras and elsewhere. Per one virologist in the Atlantic article above, there may have been an estimated 8000 coronavirus cases in the US by the end of February, compared to the CDC‚Äôs 268 confirmed cases.

My second reason I‚Äôm less sure about. When I was sick in early February, I assumed that I did not have the coronavirus and took no protective measures (that sounds really bad now, I know. if I had known then what I know now, I would have acted very differently. Instead I was acting on the govt/media line that ‚Äúthere are no cases in New York and no community-transmitted cases anywhere in the US‚Äù). Based on everything I‚Äôve been hearing, I would assume that everyone I spent time with would be sick by now! But thinking on it a bit further, I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the case.

So far, scientists estimate that the average person with coronavirus spreads it to around 2.4 other people. This is without any measures like social distancing to contain the virus. That‚Äôs over the full lifespan of the virus: up to 14 days without symptoms, and potentially multiple weeks after that until someone recovers or dies. That seems to be what makes the virus so transmissable ‚Äì it works slowly, and anyone could spread it without even knowing they have it.

So if I did have the virus, it‚Äôs likely that in the 4-6 weeks that the virus was active in my system, around 2-3 people I interacted with (or even just rode in a subway care with) would have contracted the virus. Doesn‚Äôt feel good, but not much anyone can do now about what happened in February. So it‚Äôs not the case that everyone you interact with will get the virus. And the fact that none of my friends got the virus doesn‚Äôt rule out the possibility that I had the coronavirus.

THAT SAID you still need to take as many protective measures as possible. Don‚Äôt take any of this as my saying the virus is not so transmissable as to be incredibly deadly. Even over 4 weeks, 2.4 people is enough to produce the exponential curve that is already overloading our hospitals and will kill millions if left unchecked. STAY THE FUCK INSIDE.

To be honest, I still don‚Äôt know one way or the other whether I had the coronavirus. Two months ago, I thought it was impossible. Two weeks ago, I thought it was unlikely. At this point, who knows? Anyways, I‚Äôm very interested to hear what other people‚Äôs experiences have been, as I‚Äôve seen several people on here already talking about the bug they had in Feb. Do you think it was or wasn‚Äôt coronavirus?

As a closing note, I have to say this has made me overwhelmingly angry at our government and our media. Looking back, by Feb 1st there were known knowns about the coronavirus (experts already knew it was extremely dangerous and transmissable, and we had already seen it ravage Wuhan) as well as known unknowns (we weren‚Äôt testing, so completely possible the coronavirus was spreading in the US). If what I had seen from the government and media had reflected those things which were known at the time, I (and many others) would have acted completely differently. But neither the government or the media posed coronavirus as a serious threat to Americans until late February. I have a pretty low opinion of both at this point, but nonetheless it‚Äôs infuriating to see this happen.",nyc,The February bug ‚Äì was it the coronavirus?

Work is giving me anxiety too because I work somewhere where it‚Äôs hard to prove you do work so our boss is being pretty critical and I feel like I‚Äôm having to work more than I usually do which is meh. I feel blessed to have a job rn of course but maybe others who are working from home are experiencing weird pressure here as well?

Anyway, this might be pointless to some but I hope it‚Äôs not. If you resonate with this, I‚Äôd love to hear about your experiences. We can all hash this shit out together. What has been giving you anxiety? What helps you cope?

Hope you‚Äôre all safe and sound :)",nyc,Coping with anxiety during these times

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

The 30 story building across from me, a wall of black windows last night, totally deserted, now seems people are not hiding in the dark. Lights are back.

The constant sounds of ambulances sirens heading to New York Hospital 24/7 are slowing down.

Cuomo is here. We feel good about that. Just make him President already. 

As he explained to our NYS Health Exec of NYS, don‚Äôt bullshit people, the truth is 1000‚Äôs of New Yorkers will die. It‚Äôs just going to happen, be prepared for it.

Honesty is a miracle. It is almost magic. It just makes us feel better. We really hate that unknown.

Cuomo had a ""talk"" with the Governor of Rhode Island and Donald (AKA What the fuck are you people prosposing? Cut this shit out.) They crumbled super fast on that walling in of New Yorkers.

That 7 PM cheer for all our health care workers in the thick of it all is growing. AMAZING!

New Yorkers may not beat each other death over a roll of toilet paper. We‚Äôre starting to feel that.

The Instacart workers (bravest people on the planet) said, ""you continue to fuck us over, we are walking away from you. We will shut you down."" The CEO there seems to have got the word. They‚Äôll be protected.

\&gt; (CNN Business) As some Instacart workers prepare to strike Monday, the company is making more updates in a bid to appease them.

We‚Äôre still not Social Distancing, almost zero outside my window. But that‚Äôs OK, it‚Äôs kind of an intelligence test. They‚Äôll get sick. Nothing I can do about. 

But this may ""nudge"" people in the right direction.  
\&gt; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been warned and warned and warned again,"" he reportedly added,  stating that fines would be issued in increments of $250, up to $500 for violations of social distancing guidelines.

Overall? 

I can stop scaring the shit out of people. I think that YOU got the message. This is not a game, and thousands of people will (not may, will) die in the USA as Tony told us today. And millions will get COVID-19. It's just going to happen.

It's really hard to get people away from their iPhones, as we all know. But ""maybe"" a few people did reflect on this? 

.And I ALWAYS use (as close as possible anyway) rock-solid data. You can not argue with numbers. You just can't. 

There was a method to my madness. Sometimes you have to hit people over to the head with a baseball bat for them to just open their eyes to see. Not sure why, it must be a human thing. 

But we will make it. Of course we will.

Payback from Mother Nature? Let's stop fucking with her. Those CO2 levels really pissed her off. Maybe we'll learn something from this, but doubtful. She warned us. It was Corona, next time it could be a variant of Ebola. And that kills 90%. Treat mother right. And she'll reply in kind.

It‚Äôs going to be tough, but in the end, it‚Äôs like NYC, if you can survive this town, you can survive anything.

And the virus will crumble. It can't survive the will of the people of NYC, it should know that now. 

OK, now downvote me to hell, but maybe I'll pick up an upvote or two. And PS, if you don't like what you see, just block me. It's super easy. 

Otherwise, have an awesome night!

PS: And HIGHLY suggest check-in with Dr. Campbell every day, and learn some science at the same time. He's pretty cool.

A trio of hate-spewing teens blamed an Asian woman for coronavirus as they attacked her on board a city bus in The Bronx, police said Sunday.

The three girls approached the 51-year-old victim on the bus near Ogden Avenue and West 166th Street, screaming a series of anti-Asian slurs around 3 p.m. Saturday when one of the 15-year-olds hit the Asian woman in the head with an umbrella, cops said.

‚ÄúYou caused coronavirus b‚Äî-h!‚Äù one of the hateful kids shouted.

The three girls, whose names were not released because they are underage, were each slapped with a slew of charges, including hate crime assault and aggravated harassment, police said.

COLUMBUS, Ohio ‚Äì The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Columbus-based Battelle‚Äôs system that can decontaminate thousands of masks a day, according to a statement from the company.

Battelle told 10TV on Sunday night that the approval is for the use of the technology at ‚Äúfull capacity.‚Äù


According to a press release sent Sunday night from Battelle, the company‚Äôs CCDS Critical Care Decontamination System is now operating at Battelle‚Äôs West Jefferson, Ohio, facility.

The facility is capable of decontaminating up to 80,000 respirator masks per system each day using concentrated, vapor phase hydrogen peroxide.

According to a Sunday night statement from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine's office, Battelle intends to send one machine to New York City and one to Stony Brook, New York. Machines will also be dispatched to the state of Washington.

Earlier Sunday, the FDA only approved limited use of the technology at 10,000 surgical masks in the state a day, which was met by criticism from DeWine.

In a press conference on Sunday, DeWine said President Donald Trump assured him that the approval would be handled quickly.

According to Battelle, the respirator masks are exposed to the validated concentration level for 2.5 hours to decontaminate biological contaminates, including COVID-19. The system can decontaminate the same respirator mask up to 20 times without degrading the mask‚Äôs performance.

‚ÄúI want to thank the FDA team for their professionalism and help in authorizing the use of our technology at this critical moment for our nation,‚Äù said Lou Von Thaer, President and CEO of Battelle in a statement. ‚ÄúEverybody who has worked on this project shares the same goal of protecting first responders and healthcare workers who are at the front lines of the pandemic.‚Äù

""I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and Dr. Hahn of the FDA for approving the use of this life-saving technology that Battelle has developed,"" said DeWine in a statement. ""This will not only help Ohio's healthcare workers on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, but Battelle will also be helping health care workers in hot spots throughout the country including New York and Washington state.""

10TV has reached out to the FDA for comment.

10798,Orpheus86,1585573583,frqg3e,Nan,"I‚Äôm in a situation where I recently finalized my divorce after a very contentious two-year battle in which my wife decided to secretly file divorce and tried to get full 100% legal custody of the children and give me 4 nights/ month only with them. It was a ridiculous idea  that never would have passed in court yet she refused to negotiate, cost me a fortune, and ultimately settled on my reasonable terms on the day before trial. Money is no issue for her and she files ridiculous emergency orders for no reason and has even been criticized by judge for this

She has always felt like mothers should have the ultimate say and father‚Äôs are more of a backup to be consulted with and never wants to take my thoughts or concerns for the children seriously. I am a competent professional in healthcare (away from patient care) and have always taken care of the kids well and competently. 

Anyway we are in a situation where I was able to get the time with the children so that I have them 10 nights a month, all my income goes to alimony and child support, and we live just 5 blocks from each other and the school too, so handoffs are super easy and convenient 

After this big battle to get reasonable time with the kids, she now tells me that she wants to drive back to her parents home on the west coast and wants me to give her an answer by tomorrow as her friend has a car and will be driving back to her home state in a few days. She says that her parents have a huge home, and a backyard, and they live in a gated community where kids can run around outside. Versus living in NYC in a somewhat small but well to do condo. She is asking that I give them permission to leave, and that she will do distance learning for school from the west coast, that I‚Äôll continue to pay 3k child support, and that she can‚Äôt give me a timeframe when the kids might return to NYC. ‚ÄúWhen things get better.‚Äù Knowing her this would be 4 to 6 months away. My lawyer says that leaving New York either means traveling or relocation, and if you do not get a date of return it‚Äôs not considered traveling

During the divorce she refused to put a relocation clause in our settlement and I finally got the judge to include it so that it says that she‚Äôs required to stay in the New York City area unless I give permission

I want to do what‚Äôs best for the kids. How I understand it, Kids have very low risk of getting ill with this virus. They are kept indoors at all times except for when we do the handoffs twice a week, and even that is just a five block walk. I could understand her anxiety and her wish to be close to her parents, but I have a hard time grappling with not seeing my children for 4 to 6 months, especially after battling my ex for so long to get any equitable amount of time to begin with. I believe strongly that both parents are equally important to children‚Äôs development and both should have equal decision making, and the kids have a right to have access to both parents

As usual she‚Äôs strong arming me and saying that I need to let her know within the next day. For all I know she‚Äôs libel to file an emergency motion saying that NY is an epicenter and it‚Äôs in kids interest to leave. On the flipside, I‚Äôve been following the news in her home state, in her home state is a conservative state that is ranked among the worst in testing and treating coronavirus. And in fact her county is in a shelter in place, and her parents are two elderly people in their 70s

I can I want to do what‚Äôs right for the kids, but I don‚Äôt see the risk for them being very different between the two states, and I think them being away from one parent for six months at a young age will be detrimental. I‚Äôm trying to keep my ego out of it, but my ex‚Äôs 2 year assault on trying to get full time and full decision making of the kids makes me very wary. Plus she can‚Äôt give me a definitive return date or even try to doesn‚Äôt feel right.

1) Report any incidents of price gouging. Once you find the business on the app's map, you can create a new report where you upload a photo of the price tag and write a description of what the price normally looks like.

2) See a map of reports on businesses in your area. Each time someone makes a new report, you will see that report on your map. If you tap on the report, you can see what the person's issues are.

3) Mark reports as urgent. Whenever you view a report, you can also mark the report as urgent by clicking a button on the app. Once you click the button, the app will generate a report of the post and PriceMark will try to compile those reports to send to local authorities.

4) Business owners also have something to gain. At times, they have to increase prices because their suppliers are increasing prices. If this happens, businesses can make their own report and let customers know of their situation.

Please let me know your thoughts on this app: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pricemark/id1504030749](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pricemark/id1504030749)!",nyc,Price gouging app

They may not block airborne transmission, but they do cut down on droplets containing virus particles, and everyone spits a bit when they talk.  Plus, it's allergy season now, and if you can block allergens, you can keep people who are silent carriers from sneezing.

This means that if everyone wore masks in public, transmission would go down by about half, if not 3/4.  Everyone should be encouraged to wear a mask when out in public in NYC -- if everyone did, even if they went outside, we could lift social distancing measures earlier and avoid Italian or Chinese-style lockdowns.

Spread the word.  Chalk it on the sidewalks.  Write it on your windows.  Repeat on other subreddits. Hashtag on social media.  #masks4all.  Not just for healthcare employees and first responders -- if everyone wears a mask, then we're protecting them from transmission as well!

At present, you are an opted-in member of the NYC Rental Network. Therefore, starting April 1, 2020, you will be responsible for all expenses related to the rental listings you advertise on StreetEasy and the NYC Rental Network.

Here is what will change for you as an opted-in member of the NYC Rental Network:

Starting April 1, each listing you advertise on StreetEasy will be charged the daily rate, and you will be responsible for paying those charges at the end of each month.

If you have active StreetEasy listings as of April 1, you will automatically be charged the daily rate for those listings until you stop advertising them.

StreetEasy has granted a temporary 50% concession on the daily listing rate. Through April 30, you will be charged only $3 per day, per listing. On May 1, unless you are notified otherwise, the daily fee of $6 per listing will resume.

Options we can offer you at this time: 
If you would like to keep your listings in front of the largest audience of New York home shoppers, no action is required. You will receive a billing statement at the end of each month.

If you do not wish to continue advertising your listings on StreetEasy at this time, please de-list them via the My Listings page at StreetEasy.com.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, we've begun looking for new apartments but it seems like we'll have a hard time finding any soon because of the lockdown and even if we do, we likely won't have a vehicle or moving company to help us. And, I've been laid off so budget is also a bit of an issue and if I can push back our move, that would be better.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just wondering, with all the bills and orders that have been passed or are being considered, what can we do? Are we able to stay on past our lease without being evicted? Do we still need to pay rent? If so, is it the same amount we have been paying under our lease or can the landlord change it? Do we need to discuss this with them? Do they have the right to say we need to leave since we already said so a couple months ago?

I‚Äôve seen many people show interest in ways to currently help others during this time, especially those doctors and nurses working countless hours &amp; often without the necessary PPE. Without having to leave your home, consider ordering food for delivery to the various units at some of the local hospitals.
 
I know many nurses around the city and they‚Äôre always so grateful whenever patient‚Äôs families order food to give thanks for caring for their loved ones way before this COVID-19 stuff. This is a great opportunity to give thanks to those nurses and doctors across the city in a very easy way.
 
On Saturday, I ordered $200 of Levain bakery cookies and sent them to the Covid care unit at NY Presbyterian on the East Side. I called up the general number on the website and asked the operator which units were primarily covering Covid patients. When placing the order, just note the delivery floor/unit.

If you don‚Äôt have much to give at the moment, perhaps team up with a few friends to split the cost.

And don‚Äôt forget to tip generously, since these delivery guys are entering ground zero!",nyc,Consider ordering some food to the COVID units for Doctors &amp; Nurses at your local hospital to give thanks!

People here who have been encouraging going out solitarily as long as they follow social distancing are part of the problem.

10978,jae34,1585613181,fs2et1,Nan,"&gt;BROOKLYN (WABC) -- A Brooklyn man was arrested Monday for allegedly coughing on FBI agents and telling them he had coronavirus after they confronted him over his supposed hoarding and sale of medical equipment.

The suspect lied to authorities about his accumulation and sale of surgical masks, medical gowns and other medical supplies, according to the United States Department of Justice.

Baruch Feldheim, 43, was charged by complaint with assaulting a federal officer and with making false statements to law enforcement.

The assault charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine, while the false statements charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:

Feldheim allegedly sold certain designated materials, including N95 respirators, to doctors and nurses at inflated prices.

In one instance, on March 18, 2020, a doctor in New Jersey contacted Feldheim via a WhatsApp chat group labeled ""Virus2020!"" Feldheim agreed to sell to the doctor approximately 1,000 N95 masks and other assorted materials for $12,000, an approximately 700 percent markup from the normal price charged for those materials.

Feldheim directed the doctor to an auto repair shop in Irvington, New Jersey, to pick up the order. According to the doctor, the repair shop contained enough materials, including hand sanitizers, Clorox wipes, chemical cleaning supply agents, and surgical supplies, to outfit an entire hospital.

Feldheim later told the doctor that he had been forced to move all of those supplies from Irvington to another location.

On March 23, 2020, Feldheim allegedly offered to sell a nurse a quantity of surgical gowns and directed the nurse to his residence in Brooklyn. Feldheim also received, on March 25, 2020, a shipment from Canada containing approximately eight pallets of medical facemasks.

On March 27, 2020, FBI agents observed an empty box of N95 masks outside of Feldheim's residence.

On March 29, 2020, FBI agents witnessed multiple instances during which individuals approached Feldheim's residence and walked away with boxes or bags that appeared to contain medical supplies. On that date, FBI agents approached Feldheim outside of his residence.

After identifying themselves as FBI agents, they told Feldheim that they wanted to stay a distance away from him given concerns over the spread of Coronavirus. When the agents were within four to five feet of him, Feldheim allegedly coughed in their direction without covering his mouth.

The agents then told him that they were looking for certain PPE materials and that they had information that Feldheim was in possession of large quantities of such materials. At that point, Feldheim told the FBI agents that that he had the Coronavirus.

Feldheim then made false statements to the FBI agents regarding his possession and sale of personal protective equipment and other materials. He falsely told the agents, among other things, that he worked for a company that bought and sold personal protective equipment and other materials and that he never took physical custody of the materials.

Feldheim further falsely stated that he did not possess large quantities of personal protective equipment materials and that he never sold them directly to individuals.",nyc,"Brooklyn man arrested after coughing on FBI agents, claiming he had COVID-19"

Around 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM today, my friend took a short (SOCIALLY DISTANCED) walk to get some fresh air out of their apartment. They walked by Herbert Von King Park and found an black dog tied to a pole by the Cultural Art Center there. The dog was tied with no means of freedom and out of normal sight lines. 

They brought him to the 79th Precinct on Thompkins Ave. Officers scanned his chip and then gave them the address to the local shelter, ""Animal Care Centers of NYC - Brooklyn."" They were instructed that they could drop him off there or keep him. They brought him home and immediately gave him a bath. 

Dog appears to be a black border collie mix of some kind of medium size. Not a puppy but not an old dog based off his looks. He's black all over except a white patch on his chest that leads up to the bottom of his jaw. He has a chain collar, no tags (see pictures below). He seems trained, responds to basic commands.

Besides dropping off the dog at the shelter, we're seeking some advice and help in regards to what else we can do given the current situation we're all in.

A decent one bedroom apartment could still be had in Manhattan for $1000.

You could pass an actual butcher on his way to work on Gansevoort. 

The average age of a bartender was 50, not 25. Drinks did not have sprinkles. 

There were way more food options at 4am.

More and more homeless people have taken to sleeping in train stations and on trains since the world went into lockdown. In the early morning, trains that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be overly crowded appear as packed as normal, because homeless people sleep across seats in multiple cars.

It‚Äôs sad, it‚Äôs dangerous, and it‚Äôs scary. For people deemed essential to the city workforce, we‚Äôre crowded on top of each other while making our ways to where we need to be. Homeless people looking for a place to rest now lie for hours in crowded areas...which is a good way for them to become infected with Coronavirus, and for those already infected to spread the virus.

This morning, around 0500 and on the downtown 4 train from Grand Central, I walked past two awkwardly full cars of straphangers and sleeping homeless people to find a car that was only somewhat awkwardly full. By the time I reached my stop, one of the sleeping people appeared to have collapsed from where he was on the seat to the floor. I told a conductor, because in the best of times, collapsing is not a good thing.

I repeat: the situation in the subway is sad, dangerous, and scary. Our mayor has a sordid history of pretending there isn‚Äôt a homeless problem in this city. But there is. We know there is. As much as he‚Äôs touting the MTA‚Äôs ability to get essential workers where they need to be as a great service to the city‚Äîand it is‚Äîsomewhere along the way to ensuring the city‚Äôs workforce is able to work, the city forgot or purposely ignored the least fortunate among us...and now is the absolute worst time to be so shortsighted, let alone inhumane.",nyc,Growing homeless problem in the subway

We hope you and your family are staying healthy and doing well.¬†

I am reaching out to address the concerns members have expressed regarding membership dues. I want to reassure you that, as previously promised, we will issue credits to your accounts and address all membership-related concerns once our gyms are operating.

As of last Sunday, President Trump extended the national ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù to April 30th. We want to ensure that we do all we can in order to keep our members healthy during this time. Therefore, as of April 1st, we will begin to offer a free, premium, exercise streaming service to all our members via the Plankk app.¬† The app includes more than 30 live classes per week including HIIT, Strength, Sculpt and Yoga classes. In addition, the app will allow us to feature your favorite trainers in streaming sessions.

In addition, we will be upgrading all members that stay active during the corona crisis closure to Passport- Elite memberships through the end of 2020, a value of $600-$700. This means unlimited access to all club locations including our luxury Elite brands at your current membership rate!¬† Members will be able to access more than 150 clubs when the economy reopens and we all get back to business.

The Town Sports team is working hard to navigate uncharted territory while we continue to plan for what may be a challenging future. We have made some extremely difficult decisions, but they are decisions that should ultimately benefit the Town Sports family, our members and our gyms.

We are working diligently behind the scenes to ensure we‚Äôre ready to accommodate our amazing staff and members when we reopen. It is our promise to you, that you‚Äôll be welcomed back with a spectacular club experience. This promise, this goal, and our dedication to you and our staff inspires us to keep moving forward.

I have spoken to many of you personally over the past few weeks and want to thank you for your support and understanding.¬† We are looking forward to the day our doors open again and excited to see you back in the gym.

Until that time, be well, stay strong and be safe.¬†

Sincerely,

Patrick Walsh

At time of writing it‚Äôs day 16 of quarantine and we‚Äôve had minimal exposure to the outside world leaving only for groceries, laundry and outdoor exercise (doing our best to keep 6‚Äô apart from others). 

My wife is starting to feel sick. She‚Äôs got a scratchy throat, beginnings of a cough (wet more than dry) and dizziness - no fever as of yet. We are discussing how we could possibly, and if it‚Äôs worth it, to try to quarantine her in one of the bedrooms separate from our daughter and I. 

Question 1: is it worth it? We‚Äôve been living together as a family in a tiny apartment without leaving for two weeks. If she has Covid, there‚Äôs no way we don‚Äôt all have Covid. And even if we didn‚Äôt, the chances of preventing us from getting it seem next to nil. My instinct says we should just live as normal and hope for the best but I might be way off. There‚Äôs the question regarding what I‚Äôll call ‚Äúreintroduction.‚Äù If we‚Äôve all been exposed and my daughter and I were just asymptomatic, are we putting ourselves at risk when we re-expose ourselves over and over or is the threat passed? 

Question 2: if it is worth trying to do a Quaran-ception where we have a quarantine within a quarantine, how do I pull that off? She can live in the bedroom and I can sleep in the living room I suppose. I can bring meals in and leave them inside the door? I can take all my clothes out of the room before we start, maybe?

A quick look at social media responses to that offer make it clear that these are overwhelmingly unwanted perks. Customers want their accounts frozen. They want to not be charged for gyms they cannot use.

That's bad enough, but TSI's March 20th [filing with the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1281774/000128177420000013/a10k-123119.htm#sAFA05E64E6D09C5A4996463F442606F8) shows that they are concerned about solvency. 

So, call me cynical, but it seems that TSI is hoping to take in money from members, who can't use their memberships, in the hopes of mitigating financial damage in the event of their collapse. So, these offers of perks and sorting things out later would simply be insincere, and solely for the purpose of buying time.

I loved my gym and the people who worked there. I contributed to a GoFundMe to raise money to help all the staff that had all been let go. After years of membership, I had nothing bad to say about the gym. 

Patrick Walsh should be ashamed about his handling of this crisis. At best, it's totally sloppy. At worst, it's utterly unethical.

According to an [article by Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/news/nysc-hit-class-action-lawsuit-over-membership-fees-during-shutdown), there's a class action underway. That's certainly one way to get NYSC/TSI's attention. In a Tweet, a rep from Wigdor Law firm, which is pursuing the class action, said he could be reached at [contact@wigdorlaw.com](mailto:contact@wigdorlaw.com)

But a class action won't do much for us if TSI takes all our money at midnight then chooses to go belly up shortly afterward.

 The city that never sleeps has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Amid the outbreak and rising death toll numbers, New York City Governor Andrew Cuomo asked volunteers to help create N95 masks and other protective equipment. Although Broadway is shut down, people within the industry are offering their help.

Javier Munoz of Broadway‚Äôs *Hamilton* felt the need to organize and mobilize following Cuomo‚Äôs remarks. He spearheaded the Broadway Relief Project, which united Broadway seamstresses, actors, and others in the community to help create 10 million surgical gowns to give to hospitals across the city. Already, the project gathered 600 volunteers. Munoz told [***The Advocate***](https://www.advocate.com/theater/2020/3/28/how-broadway-actors-are-helping-end-covid-19-pandemic) that he got on calls and found people who were ready to participate in the project.

The customer's list should have 4 columns -  product, quantity, ripeness and substitute if product/ripeness not available.  Customers could be asked to put the list in a see through envelop that is disinfected each time.  After the shopping list is given to the worker, the customer leaves and does not come back until the order is fulfilled or they receive a text.

NEW YORK DAILY NEWS | MAR 31, 2020 | 1:09 PM

A crook broke through the ceiling of a Bronx supermarket and stole $5,000 cash, the employees‚Äô payroll checks and a handgun, police said Tuesday.

The burglar bashed a hole into the roof of the Bruckner Blvd. grocery store near Logan Ave. in Schuylerville sometime after closing at 8:30 p.m. on Sunday, officials said.

When the store opened for business at 7 a.m. Monday, workers found a hole in the roof and the store‚Äôs security cameras damaged.

The thief managed to enter the store‚Äôs office, crack open the safe and grabbed the cash, payroll checks and a Glock 26 handgun, officials said.

Sunday‚Äôs break-in is very similar to a burglary in Melrose on March 18, where someone broke into the Real Prospect Supermarket on Prospect Ave. and nabbed $300,000 in cash from an office safe.

11219,harvestbent,1585699144,fsog2k,Nan,"My wife and I moved to a new neighborhood yesterday (Queens to Brooklyn). We had no way of knowing when we signed our new lease some 30 days ago that all this would happen. In retrospect, it was a horrible time to move, but we're in our new place now. What's done is done.

So, I'm stepping out into the new neighborhood as infrequently as possible, but we needed some groceries. Most people in the new neighborhood are really respectful of each other. It's been an overall great experience. On the street, people have either kept to themselves or interacted sympathetically in this crazy time.

Except for this one fucking idiot teenage or early twenties girl (pardon the language, but it seems appropriate). I'm walking home from the grocery store. She's clearly not yielding as I move further and further away from her. In fact, she's mirroring me. I stop in my tracks, turn my body 90 degrees and wave her through as if I were opening a door for her kindly. 

She walks up to me, starts cursing at me and coughs in my face as open mouthed as possible, twice. Mind you, I'm wearing a surgical mask and gloves.

It's clear that she doesn't think she's sick, but how could she know? At this point, I'm shocked and starting to get angry, but what good would escalating the situation do -- get her CLOSER to me? I couldn't help but say ""COME ON!"" (as in 'WTF is wrong with you?') while shaking my head. So I keep walking. Her friend pulls her away trying to deescalate. 

I'm home now, and I've taken all of the normal precautions of the time.

How does she know I am not immunocompromised? I'm not. She doesn't care.

How would she know if she's carrying? She probably doesn't (unless she *definitely* knows).

If she's doing this to me, she's probably doing it to every stranger she crosses including vulnerable people.

At what point are actions like this assault? I found myself wanting to respond with violence, and that's not my nature.

I hate that she gave me this impression of our new neighborhood 24 hours after moving in. I hate that she probably just wanted to take away someone's power, because she feels helpless. I hate that I'm trying to justify her actions.

I'm just so angry right now.

Can someone point me toward some COVID-related mental health resources? I'm usually pretty chill.

Thank you all for listening. And if you need someone to listen to your experience, please feel free to share.",nyc,I'm kind of shook right now.

11222,rclimb,1585700114,fsopd3,Nan,"I‚Äôve tried almost every delivery option there is and in my option this was the best for most fresh, fast, and cheapest for bulk orders. They do free next day delivery and everything we ordered we actually received. 

https://www.baldorfood.com/

Baldor is a restaurant wholesaler who is now delivering to households. You get a great discount on bulk (bigger than Costco bulk). We ordered and it came the next day. We got a ton more food than we would‚Äôve gotten for the same price as the grocery store. They work with local farms and businesses around the area so you‚Äôd also be supporting local businesses. They have both organic and non organic food. 

There is no place to tip on the website. I‚Äôm guessing this is bc they normally ONLY deliver to restaurants as customers and restaurants don‚Äôt tip. However, you can give them cash (probably in a plastic bag to not get any potential germs on it). 

I think it‚Äôs great bc you don‚Äôt have to leave your apartment and so you won‚Äôt risk getting sick or getting someone else sick to go to the grocery store. The more people who stay in the better. It is less risky to have a delivery truck come to your building than to walk outside and go to the grocery store, for everyone that you could‚Äôve been in contact with. 

There‚Äôs also no limit to what you want to buy, so you can go nuts with 10 lbs of beef or 10 cartons of eggs if you truly want, as this food used to go to restaurants and is now trying to find a home. But your fridge is only so big and others need to order too, so keep that in mind so please keep that in mind and don‚Äôt hoard everything! 

Downsides: $250 min per order, I‚Äôm guessing because they‚Äôre used to large orders and to keep their business afloat they cannot deliver small orders bc they‚Äôd lose money. I know this is quite a bit for some people, but maybe you can coordinate with people in your building or roommates to split a order? 

Some items are in TOO much bulk. Ie you have to buy 150 cookies at a time, but there are plenty of staples you can buy in reasonable quantities (1/2 gal milk, normal sized berry boxes, meat in 5lb, but you can freeze it at least, 1 carton of eggs, 1 bunch of bananas, etc) 

The meat we got is fresh, not frozen, but for bulk items it comes in one large box or bag. If you don‚Äôt have ziplock or freezer burn bags, I‚Äôd recommend getting some. You can always wash the plastic bags later to reuse! 

Other grocery delivery I‚Äôve tried: 
Whole Foods - hard to get a slot, and when you do, it seems only 1/3 of your order makes it. Also much more expensive than buying in bulk. 

AmazonFresh - same

Instacart - prices are marked up maybe 30% in the app. Plus you are replacing yourself with a shopper who could be getting corona or spreading it. Instacart does not provide ppe. 

Freshgogo - 10+ day wait 

Hmart- 10+ day wait 

Bj -  can‚Äôt find delivery slot

Costco - on instacart unfortunately

I haven‚Äôt had a great relationship with my parents for the last decade plus. It‚Äôs been rocky and a bit abusive. I‚Äôve only started to slowly return back trust and get back to a steady state with them.

The problem is that now I‚Äôm honestly truly nervous about them. They live in green point, I live in Jersey(Hoboken). Both my parents are diabetic and have multiple health issues.

I‚Äôm not sure what I can do at this point and the anxiety is killing me. Looking at all the statistics and things not improving is giving me more stress. I was thinking of taking them and moving them somewhere else like PA or CT but I don‚Äôt know if that will do anything.

11268,WhichEdge,1585715865,fssrcy,Nan,"Someone recently did a fantastic post about marketing and how China is purposely not reporting both number of true infections/fatalities and how bad it is in a general sense in Wuhan and larger Hubei province because they want the media to focus on places like Italy, Spain, and the US.

This allows them to disappear off the world stage and avoid responsibility and media attention for the massive amount of suffering, death, and financial loss of so many.

I have never been much of a conspiracy person but the sad reality that there is more than a fair share of evidence about the lab in Wuhan and COVID-19 is damning enough.

On top of that Wuhan, the wet markets, and over all China have been a problem when it comes to Viruses for quite some time.

After this is all over and the amount of sheer death and misery this has brought I hope it is never forgotten that China is responsible.

The people are amazing and I think victims as much as many in this but the government and the system in China is disgraceful and should have to pay for what they have done to the world and its citizens.

If you disagree wait till someone you know gets sick or passes away. This virus is beyond horrific.

&gt; Dear Valued Member,
 
We hope you and your family are staying healthy and doing well. 
 
I am reaching out to address the concerns members have expressed regarding membership dues. I want to reassure you that, as previously promised, we will issue credits to your accounts and address all membership-related concerns once our gyms are operating.
 
As of last Sunday, President Trump extended the national ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù to April 30th. We want to ensure that we do all we can in order to keep our members healthy during this time. Therefore, as of April 1st, we will begin to offer a free, premium, exercise streaming service to all our members via the Plankk app.  The app includes more than 30 live classes per week including HIIT, Strength, Sculpt and Yoga classes. In addition, the app will allow us to feature your favorite trainers in streaming sessions.
 
In addition, we will be upgrading all members that stay active during the corona crisis closure to Passport- Elite memberships through the end of 2020, a value of $600-$700. This means unlimited access to all club locations including our luxury Elite brands at your current membership rate!  Members will be able to access more than 150 clubs when the economy reopens and we all get back to business.
 
If you want to pass up this opportunity to be upgraded, please reach out to MemberHelp@tsiclubs.com where a Customer Service Representative will freeze your membership. 
 
The Town Sports team is working hard to navigate uncharted territory while we continue to plan for what may be a challenging future. We have made some extremely difficult decisions, but they are decisions that should ultimately benefit the Town Sports family, our members and our gyms.
 
We are working diligently behind the scenes to ensure we‚Äôre ready to accommodate our amazing staff and members when we reopen. It is our promise to you, that you‚Äôll be welcomed back with a spectacular club experience. This promise, this goal, and our dedication to you and our staff inspires us to keep moving forward.
 
I have spoken to many of you personally over the past few weeks and want to thank you for your support and understanding.  We are looking forward to the day our doors open again and excited to see you back in the gym.
 
Until that time, be well, stay strong and be safe. 
 
Sincerely,
Patrick Walsh

I've been posting around a bit but things are getting desperate and I can't do more without your help. My name is Fernando and I work with a non-profit group called MasksNow that is in talks with the CDC to set standards for reusable fabric masks. Once CDC gives their seal approval these will be the gold standard for fabric masks that offer protection to healthcare workers, patients, and the average person. We've been making huge strides but we need some help. If you have a connection or want to donate please reach out.  


**The Plan:**

Machines will cut all the pieces needed to make masks from rolls of fabric. These parts will be mass produced and ready-to-sew kits will be packaged. These kits will be given to thousands of volunteers who are donating time to sew. Everything is provided for them. No cutting, no guessing, just a quick run through the machine.

&amp;#x200B;

**What we need:**

1. A commercial fabric cutter in NYC or surrounding areas. This can be a plotter with blade attachment or someone with die-cutting equipment that wants to donate time and use of the machine. If you have a connection in this area please reach out. We have someone in Oregon helping us but transit time kills production. We need one in NYC.
2. Funding. I link the GoFundMe if asked to do so. We need money for materials and shipping and machinery expenses. I've personally raised about $400 so far but it won't be enough to cover the operational costs. Anything you can spare would be fantastic.

Feel free to ask me any questions about any part of this operation. I'll answer as completely as I can.",nyc,"I'm helping a team of thousands mass produce reusable fabric masks. We're working with the CDC but we need your help locating materials, manufacturers, and donations. AMA"

Surgical masks are used for several different purposes, including the following:

* Placed on sick people to limit the spread of infectious respiratory secretions to others.
* Worn by healthcare providers to prevent accidental contamination of patients' wounds by the organisms normally present in mucus and saliva.
* Worn by workers to protect themselves from splashes or sprays of blood or bodily fluids; they may also keep contaminated fingers/hands away from the mouth and nose.

Surgical masks are not designed or certified to prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants. These particles are not visible to the naked eye but may still be capable of causing infection. Surgical masks are not designed to seal tightly against the user's face. During inhalation, much of the potentially contaminated air can pass through gaps between the face and the surgical mask and not be pulled through the filter material of the mask. Their ability to filter small particles varies significantly based upon the type of material used to make the surgical mask, so they cannot be relied upon to protect workers against airborne infectious agents. Only surgical masks that are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be legally marketed in the United States have been tested for their ability to resist blood and body fluids.

If you want to buy something - BUY Respirators, they must be NIOSH-certified, selected, and used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program, (see OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.134, or[ www.osha.gov/SLTC/respiratoryprotection/index.html](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/respiratoryprotection/index.html)). It is important to medically evaluate workers to ensure that they can perform work tasks while wearing a respirator. For many workers, medical evaluation may be accomplished by having a physician or other licensed healthcare provider review a respiratory questionnaire completed by the worker (found in Appendix C of OSHA's Respiratory Protection standard, 29 CFR 1910.134) to determine if the worker can be medically cleared to use a respirator. Employers who have never before needed to consider a respiratory protection plan should note that it can take time to choose an appropriate respirator to provide to workers; arrange for a qualified trainer; and provide training, fit testing and medical evaluation for their workers. If employers wait until an influenza pandemic occurs, they may be unable to implement an adequate respiratory protection program in a timely manner.  
I bought myself [here](http://ffp3mask.store/reddit), you can find elsewhere.

Buy and wear respirators, not masks!",nyc,Seriously people –æf NYC - STOP BUYING SURGICAL MASKS!

We had an apartment scheduled for rental on March 28th, however it is no longer safe to travel. My dad is getting spinal revision surgery (which is now canceled) and needed a place to recover for 1.5 months. We signed a contract and paid a large amount of money (8000$) for the stay, however the lady is not budging on giving us even a credit for a future stay. We are now out of all that money that could have been put towards supporting our family now that my father is no longer working. The contract does not say a single thing about there being a no cancellation or refund policy, however after signing and paying, she is saying there are no refunds. Is there a city level law that states we are not entitled to cancel? I tried looking it up but I cannot find anything. It is not feasible to travel to NYC from Florida, as they can not only get sick, but may not also have a place to stay after the lease is up, or potential restrictions on travel in the future.

11370,JustAnotherWanker69,1585763537,ft4v21,Nan,"They said the apex is within 7-21 days (predicted on March 28) 

The furthest from that day would be April 18, schools are supposed to open two days after that. Very unlikely if the apex is 28 days from now

The only time I think schools will open would be if the apex is 7 days from March 28th. Then that means 2 weeks of reductions that would give time for officials to open schools by early May or late April

If it's not 7 days from now, then definitely the schools will not open at all this year or perhaps in June. I don't think any testing would happen though. In my opinion, they should cancel all standardized testing indefinitely for this year

Obviously now, the job offer never came and my old company is on freeze until this whole situation blows over. My benefits are set to expire in 3-4 weeks and I'm wondering what exactly the rules are for extension. 

I've heard that unemployment extensions in NYS can only be activated in times of crisis. Is this not a crisis with unemployment levels at a record high?

Thrill to the glory and the horror of one fateful catering event!!  


Trapped! For as long as I can remember, I've always had this feeling. Suffocated. Smothered. Sometimes, it's all I can do to not jump out of my skin - and catering can really magnify this condition.  
There are several people, however, by the sheer nature of their OWN manic energy, can trigger this mania in me. Chris Hiljak is one of those people.  
Horrifyingly enough, me and him are bartending, together, on the same bar. Grave mistake by the captain for pairing us together. GRAVE.  
Anyway, we're doing this event at The Astoria Museum of Moving Images for the coolest catering company I've ever worked for - Jaded Waiters. We're working the bar, me and Hiljak - and we are getting HAMMERED, man. On the specialty cocktail of the night. Vodka infused with peach herbal tea, or something like that. Not long after - we are OUT OF CONTROL. Madness. Cracking up at everything - in the zone.  
""Man - I just wanna go f\*\*\*in' WILD, man - go down to the Amazon jungle with, like, like - a freakin' bone in my nose - and shoot poison darts at white people!!  
""UUMMMBBAAGGGA! UUMMBBAAAGGGAAA!!!  
Suddenly, Hiljak grabs a straw from the bar, peels off the paper on it, rolls it into a spitball - and SHOOTS it out into the crowd!! The PRESTIGIOUS crowd. Big museum donors.  
UUUMMMBBBAAAAGGGGAAA!!! UUUMMBBBAAAAGGGAAA!!! He cries out in wild abandon.  
I quickly follow his lead, shouting the UUUMMMBBBAAAGGAAA!! mantra. Each hit met with gales of laughter. This must go on for, like five minutes. Seriously. Finally, Hiljak sets his sights on the HEAD client.  
Gets ready...aims...FIRES!  
At this very instant, the captain, Mark Goetz, strides into the room. JUST in time to witness the ensuing horror. POOF!  
Now - it's as if everything morphs into a kind of bizarre slow motion...his eyes light up in disbelief and desperation. He sprints toward us - the trajectory of the spitball headed directly towards the client's neck!  
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  
It's like that scene from 'The Bodyguard' where Kevin Costner dives to block the bullet headed towards Whitney Houston onstage at the Oscars.  
The spitball finds the client's neck - everything quickly returns to the real life pace. Incredibly, the client doesn't suspect us. Mark Goetz, all color drained from his face, turns to us - incredulous.

The story of one forlorn waiter's adventure as he is thrust onto the busiest station on Wednesday matinee day - the busiest day of the week in a fancy NYC kosher restaurant!  
November 17th, 1990 - a day that will live in infamy. Unbelievable! I've never seen it happen before or since...I'm talking about 'The Projectile Chilli Incident'.  
Before I started catering I worked at a few restaurants. There was one in particular that was really horrible. The Great American Health Bar. A kosher restaurant on 57th Street in New York. Now, at this place I LITERALLY make no money. I'm not kidding. I was living at my parent's house in New Jersey - and commuting to The Great American everyday (curiously, there were no actual Americans working there). I worked upstairs for the lunch shift, in the back right station - the ABSOLUTE worst station. I would serve MAYBE three or four customers for the one hour the place was minorly busy - and then I would go back home! So, actually I was just paying for my bus fare to go back and forth! (Don't judge me - my mind had snapped shortly before that) Anyway, there is this diminutive and ancient manager-cashier there named Joseph, who makes it his life's work to torment me as much as humanly possible. This guy speaks NO English - and was probably herding yak on some mountain in Kazakhastan a few months ago - before he somehow struck oil. Or something. Like Jed Clampett from - The Beverly Hillbillies. Now he was the cashier/manager at The Great American in New York City. In any case, there was this one Wednesday (Wednesday was the busy Broadway matinee day) and in an IMPROBABLE and highly unlikely chain of events, like, three people call out sick - and I somehow inherit the busiest station - THE PLATFORM!!  
Everybody stampedes in at EXACTLY the same time because they have to hurry to see The Phantom Of The Opera, or whatever is big on Broadway then.  
So, they're all clamoring for their food, lest they be late for the show, and I am scurrying like a rodent, trying to keep up. I burst out of the kitchen with, like, FIVE plates on my arms, as I to try to appease the savage beasts, and put down one of the plates - a plate of chili - on the platform railing. I turn around to serve out the other plates - when, SUDDENLY, I hear  
tormented screams of agony! Somehow, the chili - the scolding hot chili -had dropped to the floor - and splatters all over EVERYBODY on the platform! EVERYBODY - incredibly enough! I mean, it could have qualified for a national disaster. One poor lady was standing up, shaking her hands and crying - in a state of shock - miraculously, it had hit her in EVERY possible - place - on top of her head, her white pantyhose - even inside her SHOES!! Another gentleman just stares in a state of shock - as the chili has permeated his very expensive London Fog trenchcoat! Others just sit in stunned silence, some crying, some suffering burns from the errant chili! A horrific scene - if there ever was one! Soon, coming back to life, they clamored for redemption - at least in the form of compensation for their dry cleaning bills! The roar grows louder - and Joseph, speaking NO English, fearing for his very life - and thoroughly befuddled - points at me: ""Jo-Jo pays!!"" What?! I don't even make any money here! This must be like, at least, $2000 dollars in dry cleaning bills - I would have to work for years - for free. An indentured servant!  
The next morning I call up the restaurant, and claim I  
somehow had broken my leg last night. I never work for The Great American again",nyc,PROJECTILE CHILI

Joseph. In an industry where it actually might be a law that there MUST be at least one asshole manager per restaurant - Joseph is the one who irritated me the most. If we will harken back to yesteryear - or at least two weeks ago to my previous blog - 'The Projectile Chili Incident' - I shall further expound on Satan-like existence of Joseph, cashier/manager at The Great American Health Bar.  
Joseph was the ancient, diminutive immigrant from, like, the distant mountains of Kazakastahn, somewhere, who had been herding yak only a short while before he came to New York. My suspicion is that he somehow struck oil while shooting for food, a la Jed Clampett from 'The Beverley Hillbillies', loaded up the truck and moved to The Big City.  
First of all, Joseph was barely five feet tall - TOPS - and had only one suit - a monstrously oversized blue pinstripe deal that he probably grabbed off the rack in The Garment District without even trying it on. And he wore it EVERYDAY.  
The only joy of his life seemed to be counting the money in the cash register OVER and OVER again - particularly the coins. The expression on his face registered one of true bliss. He had this sinister laugh - which reminded me of the dog, MUTLEY, from the Saturday morning cartoon- 'Dick Dastardly'. You just KNOW that he had, like, this secret dungeon room in the bowels of his house in some obscure part of Queens, where he descended the stone wall steps with an oil lantern, pushed a button where a bookshelf turned around, and there was his ancient room. A damp, dark room where he had converted all his wealth into gold coins and kept in metal boxes, which he counted over and over again for hours with an abacus, and wearing a monocle, even though he knew EXACTLY how much he had. The only other time I saw him THAT ecstatic was when he was throwing me under the bus - usually trying to make me pay for broken plates and cups - and also directing the scant flow of arriving customers to ANY station other than mine. That Mutley snicker at the obvious torment apparent on MY face gave him great joy.  
There MUST be a way to get back at him somehow,I plotted in my fevered mind ( this was right in the middle of my first mind-snap in 1990). Then, THERE it was! Right in front of my nose!! Aha! He would always wear these 'dress shoes' with the hideous pinstriped suit when he arrived at The Great American, but would almost immediately change into more 'comfortable' shoes to stand behind the register all day. I observed where he left the said shoes (in the back closet). HERE was my chance! I would then put eggs in each of his shoes right before I left the restaurant, and snicker on the way out. I would often hear from some of the other waiters, how, perplexed, he would later grumble that somebody had put eggs in his shoes - and that his socks were ruined! I must have done this for a week or so, before he would finally look inside his shoes before putting them on. HAHAHAHAHA!! THAT was my greatest joy!",nyc,RESTAURANT MANAGERS WHO HAVE TORMENTED ME

It seems that I am only liable for the security deposit (one month's rent) if I break the sublease, but I would be seriously screwing over the person who I'm subletting from. The thing is, I don't want to keep paying rent for this place I'm not living in, and I don't see myself returning to the city before June. I don't want to keep burning money. I just graduated and have loans to pay off. Should I just bail and lose the deposit?

11498,thebeepboopbeep,1585803574,ftg9vj,Nan,"I'm somewhat naive to what's outside of Manhattan. I know my way around Brooklyn and Queens a bit. Moved to NYC 2.5 years ago, have lived in Manhattan, my job has had significant travel, don't own a car... You probably get the picture or have seen this before. I basically don't leave the city unless it's a trip somewhere out of state or international. We owned a car when we first got here, drove outside the city a handful of times for a dog park up in New Rochelle, but eventually sold the car because we hardly used it. 

I've been toying with wanting to buy a co-op here, but the down-payment hurdle is a major obstacle. Recently, I've had an idea to keep renting in the city and perhaps get some type of cabin or a weekend getaway type of place. I believe anything out east (i.e., Hamptons) is beyond our budget. Wondering what options might exist upstate (or, um, north?) maybe 1-2 hours away. 

I've never been to the Catskills or really anywhere upstate so I don't know anything about it. I was even thinking an Airstream trailer could be nice if I could find some type of year-round campground to park it. Thought about a tiny-home but seems like insurance and resale are potential deal breakers, just seems like a bad investment. I'd be open to a lake-house or cabin as long as it's small and nice. 

My main thing is I don't want to leave Manhattan to go spend time in some weird neighborhood. Not sure if that concern makes sense and I don't want to sound insulting. But you know, I don't want to buy some cabin in a low-rent place where I can't relax; ideally want to avoid redneck vibe etc. New York real estate seems ultra confusing and not having a car doesn't help. Hoping for some suggestions here. Are there any weekend getaway friendly places or RV parks to setup a permanent spot? I've even considered buying a boat and keeping it docked in Jersey but the whole boat thing seems like a hassle and not really what I want.",nyc,"Weekend getaway real estate outside the city?

I liked Cuomo for a few days but then I realized how backwards these proposals were;  He decided to cut medicaid because spending was out of control while a trillion dollar stimulus package had been made on top of the bailouts for corporations in past years.  As well as rent and mortgage cancellations not being established that will leave alot of people losing their homes in 3 months ( same thing happened in the 08 recession).

Im curious if anyone has taken a look at this situation and seen it as an opportunity to demand basic health care, UBI, and rent cancellations. I mean we are all at home got the internet and can organize to demand better pay for essential workers, rent cancellations, medical insurance for all, and alot of other basic necessities we need when all of this is over. 

And as a last thought I thinkthese $1200 aren't going to do shit when this over there's always a catch to these things",nyc,Anyone have thoughts on these article's relating how the governor is handling the rent and medicaid issue?

Looking at the percent of negative tests, it looks like some of the city's wealthier areas have more people testing negative, as many as 65-70 percent. That is, more people who live around Central Park on down or close to Manhattan are getting tested and receiving negative results compared to other parts of the city.

Also, the city released a map of positive cases by zip code. But the map uses a quantile-esque classification method, which doesn't really highlight outliers. Here is an equal interval map showing positive test results by zip-code per 1,000 residents.

Normally, I like to mulch the trees on my block when spring is rolling in. [Trees love mulch](https://blog.davey.com/2017/04/should-i-mulch-around-trees-or-not-yes-and-here-s-why/). And trees provide us with lots of benefits. Also, a freshly mulched block of trees and be a aesthetically pleasing and a bit of a morale booster in these doom and gloom times. 

Now, the problem is that I obviously don‚Äôt want to increase the spread of coronavirus, and I want to do my best to abide by the shelter place/PAUSE mandate that we are living under. 

Having said that, mulching would be exercise for me, and there would be no reason that I would come within 6 feet of someone the entire time I‚Äôm doing it. The only additional exposure that would be involved is me going to the local hardware store to buy the mulch. That is an additional transaction that could encourage viral transmission, there‚Äôs no other way to slice it. But it would also support a local business.

So I‚Äôm torn. Selfishly, I want to mulch because I enjoy it. It also gives back to the trees and the community. But I don‚Äôt want to do it if the additional risk of increasing spread outweighs the benefits.

Hoping to get some unbiased advice on my situation. Here‚Äôs the background:

I‚Äôve been quarantined with my GF since March 6th, which is also the night she had contact with up to 7 positive patients at an event. She started feeling symptoms about a week later, around the 15th. She had all the typical symptoms. Lost smell/taste, trouble breathing, gunky lungs etc. her fever peeked at 102.8 on or around the 19th. We couldn‚Äôt get her tested because she didn‚Äôt require hospitalization. We assume that she had it, and that her roommate and I have it but are asymptotic. She is feeling better, no fever in a few days. Still some shortness of breath and hacking up gunk from her lungs.

She‚Äôs been begging to leave before she got sick.  She called the doctor today, who by his conservative estimate says by next Wednesday she won‚Äôt be infectious. Her parents are mid 50‚Äôs, live in Rhode Island, and don‚Äôt have any preexisting conditions. They plan to drive down to NYC, pick her up, and drive 5 hours back to Rhode Island. She‚Äôll be a quarantined on a different floor from her parents in Rhode Island.

She wants me to go with her. I told her I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs socially responsible for either of us to leave. She‚Äôs going with or without me. Is it safe for her parents ?",nyc,My recovering girlfriend want to leave NYC for her parents place in Rhode Island

**Takeaways:**

1) Basically, you have to apply online for regular unemployment first, even if you don't have a w2 job. To get the Pandemic (freelancer) insurance, you have to be denied regular unemployment first. There is currently no way to apply for pandemic ins online at the moment. It's a waiting game right now. But first things first, make a claim for regular UI. The day you apply corresponds to your last name.

2) You can apply if you work both w2 and 1099. If you're w2 income makes you eligible for regular UI, you cannot get the pandemic insurance. Everyone who is eligible for either type will get the $600 bonus and there is nothing extra you have to do for this. It's unclear what they will need or how they're calculating your benefit right now for pandemic.

3) They know the phones are a mess and there's no solution right now.

1. The lease states the rental term to be one year yet the beginning and ending dates listed right below it is 08/01/2019 to 08/31/2020, making it 13 months in total. Since I do not want to live there for an extra month, I called the agency for a clarification - she told me that we should follow the listed numerical date as it has more power over the listed term. I wonder if this is a bluff from her end or actually accurate.

2. Almost a year ago when we first signed the lease, the agency had made a mistake so we had to go back and sign it again. My roommate did sign the updated version but I never did because my building manager eventually forgot about it. So it turns out I actually never signed the revised, correct lease. Until a month ago, we finally got a copy of the lease (the manager has been extremely unresponsive), where we discovered they switched out the wrong page from the old, signed contract and simply replaced it with a corrected, updated page that I never signed. Now I wonder if that is legal of them to do so.

It would really be a great help if someone can offer some advices - I can not afford hiring a lawyer or paying for a consultation, so I‚Äôm hoping someone out here would happen to stumble upon this post and share some insights.

I hope you are all staying safe and healthy out there, have a good day!",nyc,My lease has some contradictions and I am not sure what is legally right

This is what happens when two people's chemistry goes horribly wrong!!  
It was a bad pairing. A terrible pairing. In fact, it may have been the WORST pairing in the history of catering.  
The captain for the fateful event is Hiram Shalefsky - widely known in the catering industry to be a most reasonable man. Some would even describe him as ""fair but firm"".  
But, alas, it was not to be his day.  
Nothing in the day could have possibly foreshadowed such a terrifying calamity. A picture perfect mid June day, the charter bus taking us to the event on Long Island had arrived with plenty of time to spare, there were no MIA's among the catering crew, a truly harmonious group ( and multi-ethnic at that!) if there ever was one - there was genuine comraderie here. Everybody that is - except for two people.  
The first omen of trouble, however, arrived in the form of horrendous beachgoer weekend traffic - rendering us almost two hours late for the event at CW Post! A flurry of desperate activity followed, as miraculously, the courageous group of waiters banded together and set up 50 tables only minutes before the scheduled start of the event!  
Valiantly battling the ticking clock, Hiram Shalefsy nimbly made his way down the roster of waiters - mentally noting the particular strengths of each individual - until he had paired up all the waiters for the 50 tables. ALMOST all the waiters, that is. There were still two names left, names which Hiram Shalefsky had hoped to avoid. And they were for the last two tables - 49 and 50 - the tables the absolute furthest from the kitchen for serve-out!  
Oh no!  
The names were - Jethro Fury, a blond, hulking good ole boy from deep in the heart of Alabama, known as much for his mercurial temper as for his love for possum hunting.  
The other - Prince LeVonne, a muscular and extremely angry black militant, who everyone thought was also gay - except, oddly enough, himself.  
There were only moments left before the commencement of the party - an alumni fundraiser at CW Post, a predominantly Catholic crowd whose main tenet was - God, country and family.  
It didn't take long before the griping, muttering and fireworks began between the two. Then, one of them dropped a plate on the floor - we don't know exactly which one it was, but this exchange immediately followed:  
Jethro: ""That's it! Get this boy outta here! I'm doing all the work here...""  
Prince: ""Oh yeah, cracker? I'll kick your mo'f\*\*\*ing hillbilly ass all the way back to Appalachia, or wherever it is you rednecks come from...""  
Jethro: ""Boy, I'll hunt your darkie ass down outside and shoot you like it's coon season...""  
And so it went....each trip back and forth to the kitchen a new adventure in hatred.  
Hiram Shalefsky tried to intervene, but, really there was not much he could do. He had the entire weight of running the event as smoothly as possible fall on his shoulders.  
Meanwhile, the owner of our company, Gwendlyn LaFarge, sat in the kitchen knitting - a scene comparable to Nero fiddling while Rome burned.  
It was a day that would go down in the annals of catering history",nyc,A MOST UNFORTUNATE PAIRING

The White House late Thursday released a two-page letter Trump sent Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

Schumer spent more than a week negotiating with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on a $2 trillion emergency relief package that Trump signed into law on Friday.

Moving is not an option due to finances and their need for a preferably senior-friendly, disability-friendly building that includes elevators and safety rails equipped inside, which no other establishment that we have searched for meets.

So their popcorn ceiling which is in every room flakes constantly in tiny particles and accumulates as paint dust. Constantly, in a matter of hours after fully vacuuming the place. Everything is covered in a white film. My main concern is that they've been inhaling this for the past several years, and we've tested and found it right at the border for acceptable lead levels in NYC (but these levels don't account for the fact that they're breathing it in at this rate). I can honestly say that my place in nearly a year of no vacuuming (need to find an arthritis-friendly vac which mine isn't) looks less dusty than their place would within a week of vacuuming. The dust is annoying but I'm worried about the effects of breathing this shit in every day for 80 plus people with health conditions. The bathroom is the worst and they've had big pieces of flaked paint fall on their head while showering.

Their management office is known to be so vicious that they don't dare ask for anything that isn't critical.  As a matter of principle, they bully people when doing their annual inspections, check every closet and cupboard, interrogate etc. and they will retaliate until you're evicted for something or you can't stand life there anymore. This is a known fact to residents living there. My relatives do not want to contact management and they are begging me not to make the remainder of their lives worse by forcing them into a high-conflict living situation, but this doesn't solve the problem. I actually had a run-in a few week ago with one of the building supers who started yelling/cursing at me for wearing a mask which he took to assume that I had the virus. My relatives were horrified to hear about it, fearing this will result in some kind of retaliatory movements against them down the line.

I've tried contacting various organizations for tenants aid for various other violations or ridiculous qol issues here that are worse than this, never received a response. I assume that's it's owned by the Jewish Metropolitan Authority and not a private landlord or NYCHA and nobody can do anything with them. Trish doesn't seem interested which is too bad.

I'm not a home improvement person having never owned a home. But I'm thinking of some kind of lead-binding paint to cover the ceiling with, and I've seen this on Amazon, problem is I haven't seen an option that's totally transparent so I'm worried about inspection noticing that.

Will anyone please suggest anything that can be done for this situation? Preferably nothing that puts us directly in the line of fire if complaining to another org, I really don't want to do that to people whose hearts don't take conflict.",nyc,"How do I handle all this thick, flaking ceiling paint?"

It wasn‚Äôt too long ago that 30 year old Joe Montaperto was a rising young comic on the New York City circuit - performing with the likes of John Stewart and John Leguizamo. Now, he sits in his childhood bedroom of his parent‚Äôs New Jersey home, babbling endlessly to his ever-present Napoleon statue at three in the morning. The only time he laughs these days is watching reruns of the old 60s TV series - Lost In Space. And he‚Äôs afraid of napkins.  


Desperate to find meaning in his life, his decade long journey leads him to a lengthy and rigorous stint at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, and a tumultuous, yet undeniably exciting relationship with a spiritual bipolar woman.  


When she later dumps him for a heroin-addicted jazz musician, he returns to the world of catering, wandering the city streets brokenhearted and aimless. During his strolls, he becomes increasingly appalled by the proliferation of Starbucks, and driven by outrage, decides to become a social activist. He creates a one-man show as his form of political protest (Four Degrees of Disconnection), and is surprised by the successful reception. It seems he is back on the road to stardom.  


Until 9/11.  
Will he ever overcome his fear of napkins? More importantly - will he ever get out of catering alive?

Hi guys! We're two students from upstate New York. We initially made this website ([whatsinstock.github.io](https://whatsinstock.github.io/)) to help out our parents find the nearby groceries while people were starting to hoard items.

We gradually saw that the situation in NYC was getting worse and worse and we decided to focus on providing full coverage to the NYC region, because it looks like this might help you guys a good amount!

The website shows, on a map, the inventories of different items that are commonly out of stock during the pandemic, like eggs, milk, hand sanitizers, face masks, and toilet paper at CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Target.

Feel free to try it out and give us some feedback!

* What other items do you guys think would be helpful to be added?
* What do you guys think about the interface? 
* Are there any features you'd like us to build? 
* How accurate is the data?
* Would you guys want to see any other stores in particular?

I noticed at city subreddits that 90% of the mugshots of crime post are Black identified people even though White and Black ID'd people commit crimes like burglary and robbery at around the same amounts.

I know Black people commit some crimes at a more disproportionate rate but the amount committed comes out to about the same so 50% of the mugshot post would be White people but they aren't. 

Like these numbers from [2011](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table-43)  Burglary: White 151,934  Black 72,244

White people committed more burglaries in part because they a higher population number but again the post would be around 50%. I believe this is an intentional tactic to stigmatize and induce fear/hate.

this may seem like a stupid 1st world issue, but i plan(ed) on moving to New York for college in the next few months and because i'm going to be a poor college student, on Google Maps, i made two lists. 1. cheap (mostly 24hr) places to eat, and 2. places to work so i could pay rent bc i'm most likely not living on campus. these would be places that i would probably frequent and a lot of them are in Chinatown actually :(

as most (if you haven't been living under a rock) of you know, this pandemic is and will continue to take an absolute toll on our business; and unfortunately, some of them just won't be able to survive. i would just like to again, give my condolences to anyone who is affected by a business closure or related. 

i made this post just to mini vent about how horribly sad i'll be because honestly, the New York that i pictured living during my college years probably won't be the same New York that arrive to. places that i expected to enjoy 50 dumplings for $3 may not be there, places that i expected to try brand new things may not be open either.

Like many thousands of New Yorkers my job was shuttered and I was laid off due to covid-19. I managed to apply for unemployment and I received a letter in the mail last week saying I had been denied. Although I worked 4-5 shifts per week, my hours got cut if it was slow (I worked in the service industry) so unfortunately I was about $300 shy of making the cut. I read about the CARE act passed on the 27th and researched it to the best of my ability online, but there is little information on how it expands possibilities for part timers such as myself to qualify for unemployment. Pretty much the only information I could find was that it opens up the qualifications to those who do not traditionally qualify for unemployment. Every time I clicked a sign up link for PUA (instilled by the CARE act) on the Dep of labor website I‚Äôm taken to the page where I‚Äôm supposed to sign up for unemployment, which I already got denied for. 

So my question is this, does anybody know specifically who qualifies and how one applies to receive PUA? Is my application for unemployment the same as my application for PUA? Does anyone know anything specific about how to receive PUA at all? 

Thank you so much for reading this, good luck and stay safe everyone!",nyc,The CARE act and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)

If you file in April they will look at Oct-Dec 2019 + Jan-March 2020. I was employed September 2019 - March 2020 so that means I need to wait until April to file, right?

I know that that's the case under normal circumstances and maybe I should have filed right away but I thought if I did that and the same rules still apply then that would just create additional complications which I would have to sort out with the unemployment office.

The Department of Labor website says if your last name begins with G-N file on a Tuesday (and my last name is in that range). I guess that means I need to wait until Tuesday April 7th to file or should I file right away since there is such a high volume?",nyc,Unemployment: Should I wait to file or should I file right now?

I traveled with family during the holidays last year (end of December) so I flew via JFK overseas to Puerto Rico. I had been feeling a little sick, but once I landed there I was hit by a ""flu-like"" illness for two days. It's not strange for me to get sick at this time, but it felt different. I specifically was not used to the sudden fever, body soreness, dry cough, basically the symptoms for COVID-19. At this time, I just thought I had a bad flu.

My question is if anybody else experienced symptoms relating to COVID-19 before it was officially announced in China/anywhere else. I'm assuming that China wasn't forthcoming with their information and it's entirely possible for me to have caught it at JFK or just around Queens. If I speak to the various Asian people I know from Asia, they were aware about an illness like this going around since November.

Wanna report price gouging? Social distancing violations? Non-essential construction? Shit heel landlords trying to illegally evict you despite the suspension? If it‚Äôs in the five boroughs we can address it. 

When it comes to unemployment, all we can do is read off some information that says what day you should file, tell you that there‚Äôs website and phone line issues and to keep calling, and either direct you to the website or transfer you to the line that everyone in the state is trying to call. That‚Äôs it. I can‚Äôt do anything else besides that. I don‚Äôt have any other phone numbers you can try to reach someone in unemployment.

11985,Gurgle_Tea,1586003543,fusxpq,Nan,"Since 2017, I was working in San Diego. My family is in Italy, where I was born and raised.

Last November, I got it out of work and I was hit by a car. I survived a craniotomy, I spent three days in a coma and I was intubated for ten. 

In December, I was moved to Denver, where I gradually became more aware, I graduated from needing someone to shower me to do it by myself, from relying on a wheelchair to walking independently, from being unable to draw a frigging clock to score the highest ever recorded in cognitive tests. 

Finally, I was discharged last February. My family flew back to the States to help with the transition their broken son. My ex girlfriend, who had been close to me since the accident, offered me her apartment to stay, in New York. And so, I moved to the City.  My family and I spent a week exploring the city, guided by my ex, and I had the chance to grow closer to all of them. Eventually, my parents left on Valentine's day. 

Since then, I have lived with her and I kept improving at a surprising rate. I even started to send work applications. Then Italy shut down due to the pandemic. And then New York was hit. Fortunately, we all are well, and cope with isolation. 

Frankly, pandemic sucks for everyone. It has been even harder for me: I survived a desperate time in my life, my ex's became my new home, NYC my new city, and now the world is collapsing in front of me, when normalcy started to be no more a distant dream.

Despite all, I keep my spirit up, and so should you. I embody some of the worst life can throw at you, and some of the best qualities humans have: resilience, tenacity, courage and hope. If you ever need an example of how strong we are, please think of a guy who nearly died alone and now is taking back his life. It will be tough, and long, but we will come out of this.

Anyone have an idea of how the rental market is being impacted so far by Covid-19? I've browsed Streeteasy and prices seem to be unchanged from a couple months ago, though there seem to be fewer listings. I would guess that's in large part due to uncertainty and people not wanting to move out or list a new place right now, and landlords making some concessions to existing tenants so they don't have empty units.

My lease is up in July, I'm currently in a 2br with a roommate but was going to move to a 1br when it ends. July looks like an optimistic projection of when things will get back to some semblance of normalcy (I'm personally pessimistic about this timeline). But I'm a little nervous about how this will play out, I don't want to sign a new lease on this same unit but don't know if it will be possible to move to a new place if the lockdown persists into the summer.

TLDR:The best-performing design was constructed of two layers of high-quality, heavyweight ‚Äúquilter‚Äôs cotton‚Äù with a thread count of 180 or more, and those with especially tight weave and thicker thread such as batiks.

Sources say the robbers entered an adjoining ABC Training Center through the roof.

The burglars then made a hole in the wall to enter the jewelry store through a closet.

The thieves were able to steal $1.3 million in jewelry from the store safe, police sources said.

When COVID-19 came we re-purposed our clunky beta app to show New Yorkers testing centers, free meal sites, where to find supplies and where not to look, human stories in isolation and things like that. 

The way it works is people upload a photo or video, our tech verifies the time and location, and we drop pins on our map and show the shots on our feed if they're legit (see below). So it's like people who are already outside taking an extra second to literally show their communities what's happening.

This seemed so obvious before but now we're legit a bit lost... What do folks want to see and know about, what would be helpful? If we could ask our active users to focus on something - what would it be? What would YOU want to see and know about?

I am a NYC based photojournalist and have been covering the pandemic for nearly a month now having started in the early days in New Rochelle.

I understand a lot of healthcare workers have decided for the safety of their families to isolate from each other. Either by living in the garage, their cars, or in a sealed section of the house.

Since my wife and I have taken the same measure, she is stayed a few hours out of the city and has been for a month now, I would like to tell the story of any frontline healthcare workers or first responders. This is a story close to my heart and I can share that element of the struggle during these stressful times.

If you are or know anyone who fits that description I would love to speak to you, I am more than happy for that to happen off the record in the first instance. I work with several major national and international publications and look forward to highlighting this additional struggle of front line workers.

I am obviously more than happy to verify in any way possible too.

\-----  
Meet Reno and Vegas...together, they are known as the ""The Gamblers. These 1 year old, brother sister twins have waited almost a year for a family to fall in love with them. What would take so long for two beautiful cats like this? Simply put, they are shy when they meet you. That's all. Are they difficult cats? Do they have health issues? Absolutely NOT. They are simply shy at first - and therefore do not shine in the normal meet-and-greet of the standard adoption process. Some cats just need a little more time to get to know you. But if you take the time to get to know them, they will reward you with a lifetime of friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

[Reno hanging out in bed](https://preview.redd.it/yii3yi8ju1r41.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5985411190ec1ab67a7ddc43cbc1d808f202bfe)

They are a very bonded pair and their foster mom LOVES then - but of course all kittens deserve a home of their own. Vegas (the boy) is an absolute cuddle bug purrrrrr boy. He likes to flop his full body in your lap and head butt you and tell you what a great human friend you are. Cuddles and treats are his two favorite things besides Reno. Reno (the girl) is a little shy, but she is also a great cat. She will sit with you, enjoy treat time, lay on the bed with you and be a great friend. She just isn't a full on lap cat. Don't worry, Vegas cuddles enough for the both of them. It's the best of both worlds really, and they are PURRFECT as co-workers during work-from-home quarantine!

&amp;#x200B;

[Vegas being cuddle boi](https://preview.redd.it/ii5010qmu1r41.jpg?width=604&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=020459a5d4e5511d07b1befa9154e2fd52650b2a)

They like to chirp and trill at each other (and you) as they have developed their own secret twin language. They are easy going, funny, adorable, have absolutely NO bad habits and are just all around amazing cats. They are vaccinated, spayed/neutered, FIV/FELV negative and healthy and happy. They get along with all the resident cats, and the other kittens that have come through and got adopted over the months they have been in foster. There's not a grumpy bone in these floofy twins.

We are so sad that they have gone so long without a home of their own. They haven't been tested with dogs, so we don't know how they will be. But we suspect they would be great with a calm pooch. For this pair, we'd be open to a foster to adopt situation. That way you can spend a month with them, and realize how great they are and then make your final decision on adoption. We can do a virtual meet and greet at first so you can see the purrr boy and sweet girl in action.

&amp;#x200B;

These are two kitties that just need time to show you how great they are. And we're sure that eventually the right pet parent will step up and take a chance on the Gamblers.

I'm pretty freaked out right now. We live in UES. This morning a homeless man stood outside our apartment door and rang our door bell and knocked. We think someone buzzed him in thinking it was a delivery (we live in a walk up no doorman so at the will of everyone in the building in terms of randos being buzzed in). 

The guy said his name, that he was homeless and asked if I had any food or money for him through the door. I said ‚Äúno not today, man‚Äù and he left our door and started knocking on our neighbors‚Äô doors and the floors above us. I'm an idiot and didn't call the cops but wish I had (do they respond to this thing quickly? He obviously was trespassing/ loitering). 

I reported to my super and management asking for better security and to remind us tenants to check who is ringing to get buzzed in before actually doing it. 

This really freaked me out. Anyone experiencing this lately? Guy looked pretty normal, was wearing a mask for covid and possibly a backpack but I can‚Äôt remember absolutely on the backpack. Didn‚Äôt want him to try our door so that‚Äôs why I asked what he wanted (did not open the door) vs not answering at all. I‚Äôm freaked out he‚Äôll try coming back.

UPDATE: We‚Äôve surpassed our goal and are at $26K as of April 5! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to all who contributed and helped spread the word! üôèüôèüôè More updates coming soon!

The masks are here! üí™üò∑üí™ As you likely have heard, medical professionals on the front lines in NYC desperately need personal protective equipment. Doctors, nurses, and staff have been improvising at times with ski masks, swim goggles, bandannas, and garbage bags. They've been reusing disposable items over and over.

Since Pearl River Mart's been importing from China for almost 50 years, we've been working our sources to find the N95 and KN95 masks that hospitals are looking for. Our network of contacts is robust, efficient, and trustworthy. We now have immediate access to a limited supply of KN95s manufactured by an FDA-certified facility and can obtain more.

We‚Äôll be donating an initial batch of masks to Elmhurst Hospital ‚Äî one of the hardest hit in the city ‚Äî this weekend DIRECTLY to ICU and ER staff via a friend who is a doctor there. She says the hospital is severely rationing supplies and will be running out in about a week. We‚Äôd love to buy as many KN95s from our source as possible but will need some help. Any donation would be greatly appreciated! We‚Äôll keep the supply going for as long as we can ‚Äî directly to our brave doctors, nurses, and front-line staff.

Visit the link in our bio for more details. No donation is too small. Thank you for considering!

Man you people...as Benjamin Franklin said, **those who would trade their freedom for security deserve neither and will eventually lose both**.  Hell, I'm surprised we didn't do this lock-down for the first peanut/gluten/milk/egg/soy/shellfish allergen sufferers....

I believe in the quarantine but Jesus the sheer hysteria you folks feel is appropriate is plain off-the-wall cray-cray...**IT'S A VIRUS AND IT'S PROBABLY BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS (the AIDS virus appears to have first infected someone back in 1959 or something)** and guess what, viruses are a part of life, they might even predate life itself (if you agree that viruses are not actually alive \[but are more like the ""missing link"" precursors to life\]) insofar as the all plants and animals that have ever lived and do still live have what appears to be viral DNA in literally every single cell...some forty to fifty-seven percent of the human body is not actually human at all but composed of all kinds of microorganisms (and that's just on the inside; outside, every inch is covered in billions of other microorganisms literally all the fuckin' time)....

**I read this sub for info but it's devolved mostly to a bitch-fest among sanctimonious scolds jealous of others, masking their own fears as high-minded civic responsibility.**  I'm an essential worker, I work in a warehouse dealing in communications equipment (routers, etc.), I handle shit from all over the country on a daily basis, often have to work inches apart from others several times throughout the day, no masks no gloves no sanitizers and you know what?  That's fuckin' life.  I'd have expected better in 2020 but at least it's not, say, 1492 or something...it's just cRaZY how people are losing their shit over this -- I actually have to laugh and do laugh at people all the time who give me the evil eye for not going along with their new state-sponsored religion of *Panic*...just today I got the evil masked eye from some dog-walkers in the park for being unmasked and smiling while listening to my portable Bluetooth speaker (""Turn Turn Turn"" by the Byrds was on, appropriately enough I thought)....

It's really mass hysteria and quite funny that people are freaking out over this.  I laughed at that crazy woman once 'cause she was giving the evil eye while I stifled an innocent cough (throat simply felt extremely dry at the moment; I swallow air while biking like how whales filter water while swimming I guess and it has an effect sometimes).

I try to put in massive amounts of groceries/sodas/cleaning products etc at a time and keep well stocked (note these aren't for toilet paper)--stuff that I can store/put in freezer/fridge so I don't have to order daily.

Here is the issue:    Literally thing are not coming.     I put ""DO NOT SUBSTITUTE"" Now because the substitutions were so random (not things I even liked at all) so literally nothing is coming.     Some of the stores are showing no deliveries for many days or not allowing you to specify--meaning it could get plopped in the lobby in the middle of the night so I can't order anything that needs refrigeration at this point.       

I had an order in from Key Foods today that I placed 4 days ago for a major shop/stock up totally over $300 (this doesn't even include the fees tip).     The 2 bags I left were put in the lobby.   Literally the other stuff didn't come at all.    Then, there was stuff I was charged for (stuff that says ""No substitution"" on my form--it was RUNG UP but never arrived.       So, I was over-charged and also most of this order did not come including ginger ale bottles/cans which they claim were out.    Almost every item was out.

But it is precisely because of these flaws that NYC became the city with the highest number of infections and deaths in the US. Thousands have died and many more will do so as well. Can‚Äôt we just make our city a little cleaner?

Subway trains on the A and E lines were delayed for several minutes Saturday when someone took a snooze on a Manhattan track, authorities said.

The unidentified man lounged with his eyes closed at the West Fourth Street station in Greenwich Village at about 2:30 p.m. and refused to get up.

12329,s3co2,1586163317,fvvbz4,Nan,"Omar Sattar, 33, a Muslim FDNY firefighter, tested positive for the coronavirus nine days after three Hasidic teens in Borough Park deliberately sneezed on him, according to a letter cited by the NY Post (Muslim firefighter gets coronavirus after Hasidic teen allegedly sneezed into his face).

The letter, sent by Lt. Kasey Koslowski of Engine Co. 282 to Thomas Richardson, the Fire Department‚Äôs Chief of Operations, relates that while the firefighters were responding to a call at 47th Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway, Sattar was approached by ‚Äúthree Hasidic Jewish teens‚Äù who ‚Äútaunted him and asked him if he was afraid of the coronavirus.‚Äù Then, ‚Äúafter repeated attempts to keep distance from the boys, one of them sneezed into his face and they ran off,‚Äù Koslowski wrote.

We don‚Äôt know of a recording of the event in question, but we are very much aware of this video of an Israeli Haredi teen using the same MO.

[Video]

According to the Lieutenant, four days after the ‚Äúunusual occurrence‚Äù Sattar began to experience flu symptoms and on March 27 his test came back positive.

‚ÄúAlthough we will not be able to tell if this positive COVID-19 test result is a direct outcome of the previous incident, what we do know is the continued lack of disregard by the citizens of Borough Park for the state of emergency policy,‚Äù Koslowski complained to the FDNY COO.

FDNY spokesperson Jim Long refused to comment on the NY Post report, but confirmed that as of Saturday, 426 FDNY personnel, firefighters, EMS, and civilian staff, have been infected with the coronavirus.

There‚Äôs an additional wrinkle to this story: Omar Sattar is the celebrated son of Ahmed Abel Sattar, who is serving a 24 year prison sentence for a 2005 plan of violent attacks on New York City Jews. In November 2017, Omar Sattar was hailed as one of 279 graduating firefighters in a class that also included the son of a firefighter who died at Ground Zero on 9/11.

At the time, the NY Post quoted Sattar, who said: ‚ÄúI respect FDNY members and I am humbled to have this opportunity to be a part of this incredible Department. The FDNY is a family that always supports each other and now I am living it. It means the world to me to be here.‚Äù

Former Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind told the Post the Haredi youths‚Äô behavior was ‚Äúsick and outrageous.‚Äù Noting that they were a minority in the Haredi community, Hikind nevertheless wondered ‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with these people?‚Äù

&gt; If you're not retired and not immunocompromised chances are you have a bad week of flu.

&gt; And if you've got kids, you've probably been exposed already.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/fn3soa/cuomo_calls_out_all_the_crowding_at_parks_in_nyc/fl8ouwb/?context=3)

So where are we today?



 | 2020-03-22 (per sstwweif)  | 2020-04-06 | ratio
---|---|---|---
Tested | 61000 | 140599 [3] | 2.3
Tested positive | 15000 | 72181 [1] | 4.8
Fraction tested positive | 0.24 | 0.51 | 2.1
Hospitalized | 2000 | 14205 [2] | 7.1
Dead | 400 | 2472 [2] | 6.1

sstweif's claim at the time was that if you're not old or at risk then you shouldn't be concerned and even if you do get infected it won't be that bad. I refer to [4] which illustrates how this virus is actually an extremely serious problem for everyone regardless of your personal level of risk:

* ICU beds available: **718** (this is effectively a fixed number in the short-term)
* ICU beds needed at peak (Apr 8, 2020): **3934-11493 (!!!)**

I interpret this as: even if you're healthy and young, on the small chance that you do get critically sick from the virus (which is more likely the less precautious you are), you are almost certainly not going to get the ICU treatment you need (aka you are going to die).

Second:

* All beds available: **13010** (also fixed in the short-term)
* All beds needed at peak: **14462-45025 (!!!!)**

I interpret this second set of numbers to mean: we need to avoid placing any unnecessary additional load on the NYC hospital system because it is already over capacity. If you get infected and need to be hospitalized due to your own avoidable negligence, you are a selfish waste of space, squatting on scarce resources that are needed both by genuine coronavirus patients (e.g., essential workers who cannot self-isolate) and the already existing normal volume of hospital patients (I'm thinking accident victims, heart attacks, etc.). Moreover, if you get infected you probably won't get to stay in a hospital at all (although at this point you probably don't want to).

In [2] I see that the hospitalization rate for inhabitants of NYC under the age of 45 is roughly 70/100K [*]. According to [5], 67% of NYC is under the age of 45 so that's about 0.67 * 8.6M = 5.8M people --&gt; 4060 covid-19 hospitalizations are of people under the age of 45. Even if a small percentage of these cases were avoidable, say 10%, that's 400 additional people needlessly taking up hospital resources. I think it's completely untenable to suggest that in any circumstance it's fine to burden medical workers with a few hundred people to treat for no good reason whatsoever.

Chinatown grocers had not seen the crowds or hoarding reported in Chinese media of Brooklyn supermarkets and Costco buying frenzies. In fact, up until last week, our local shops remained well stocked. Now, though, meat and vegetable aisles are sparse, and the past several days brought long lines of elderly waiting to enter stores that enforce a social distancing policy of limiting the number of customers.

Area supermarkets have worked tirelessly to restock shelves but supply is sporadic and limited. There is likely a shortage of workers at wholesalers and drivers to deliver goods to our markets.

While food supplies are plentiful the processing and delivery chain has shown vulnerability resulting in skyrocketing prices at the retail and wholesale levels. Many farms depend on migrant workers who are now afraid to work because of COVID-19, crops on New jersey farms remain unharvested and plowed over for the next planting while the few farms that remain functional can not meet the demand.¬†No surprise that basics we took for granted, such as eggs, tripled in price at the wholesale level. Blame the lack of truck drivers bringing them into the city.

As this crisis drags on, the problem can only worsen without government stepping in.

First of all i feel a bit guilty posting this question now when our city is in the middle of pandemic, but since i sit at home and can't work i decided it's good time to work on naturalization application:

I am filling application for N-400 form and part of it is to disclose all violations i ever made.

All in all from my memory i have:

\- 4-6 traffic tickets

\- 3-4 criminal court summonses (ticket by NYPD) minor things like riding bicycle on curb, etc.

For 1 of them i missed the court date which resulted in warrant and i was arrested for couple of hours, until i saw judge and was released with ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal), 6 months later case was dismissed.

\- 2 tickets by park rangers

All were timely paid or dismissed, but i don't have records, no i remember dates. What's the best way to obtain this history?

Most were done more than 5 years ago, and i did disclose arrest when applying to green card, so i don't think that it will be an issue, but i want to make sure that i disclose all other violations even if they are minor.",nyc,Advise on getting traffic and criminal violation history.
