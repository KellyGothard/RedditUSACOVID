My girlfriend and I are looking for a new construction 4 bed 2 bath house in a safe part of the city with a yard. Max budget is 250k, but obviously we prefer less. I am open to renting before buying for $500 a month tops, but there must be some outdoor space for my fourteen German Shephards to run around. This is non-negotiable.

Also wondering about parking. Do I have to change my plates over to get a permit if parking on the street? I really don't want to. I drive an F350 wide body (thing is WICKED lol already feel like I'm at home) and heard Beacon Hill is a dope neighborhood. Would I have any trouble parking it there?

13,isforlovers,1577803257,ei3nk2,Nan,"I'm being considered for a position within my company in their Boston Office. I currently work as an office manager in Buffalo, NY and this position would be a career shift that I have been searching for for a long time, and one that I do not believe will ever exist in Buffalo. 

I currently make $55k in Buffalo, my fiance makes about the same and we live in a 3 bedroom apartment for $875 total (Don't worry, I already know this is an amazing deal and will 100% not be the case anywhere near the Boston area or any other city honestly, we are just stupid lucky). I also have no loans (paid them off) and we'll go down to one car if we move. 

I grew up in RI, so a move to Boston would be closer to my family, i'd be close to a lot of childhood friends and I have a lot of friends in the city already. 

I did a COL adjustment and it said about $84k to have the same quality of life here, I ran that number by my family/friends who are more familiar with salaries in the Boston area and they said it was pretty average. Considering I would be kind of entry level in my position, when I chatted with HR yesterday I said $75-80k for my salary requirements and was essentially shut down saying it was too high. I'm still talking to people in the group, however, now i'm worried that I may have priced myself out of the position. 

I admit I have a pretty cushy life here on my salary, I save a ton, am able to go on multiple mini trips a year, go out for drinks/dinner every weekend, save for my wedding etc., and I've gotten used to that, but we also know some of that will have to be scaled back in order to live in a bigger city. 

Keeping in mind that I would be living with my fiance (he'll also be searching for a job as a chemist) and we split everything evenly, and that I know our rent will probably have to be at least 2.5X higher than what we are currently paying, what salary do you think would be the minimum I should take to make it worth it? 

I want to be prepared with a decent number for negotiations if they offer me the position.",boston,"Potential Boston Job Offer - Move from Buffalo, NY - What Salary is worth it?"

Here's some context and description of why we need this legal battle and what it entails: 


&gt;We estimate that there are about 9000 Medicaid circumcisions a year in Massachusetts. The State Medicaid office pays for these elective, non-therapeutic male infant circumcisions as an administrative policy decision. However, the pertinent federal and state regulations require that all Medicaid paid services shall be medically necessary.

&gt;According to Massachusetts law, State officials can be sued to have the court order them to comply with the law. The Circumcision Resource Center is preparing to bring this lawsuit against Massachusetts Medicaid for violating regulations requiring medical necessity. This particular kind of case has not been filed before.

&gt;Obviously, the facts are on our side.

&gt;¬∑         By definition, an elective, non-therapeutic service cannot be medically necessary.

&gt;¬∑         Even if the ""potential medical benefits"" claimed by circumcision advocates were true, they do not satisfy the regulation requirements for medically necessity. 

&gt;¬∑         No organization in the world recommends elective, non-therapeutic male infant circumcision. If it is not recommended, it cannot be medically necessary. 

&gt;¬∑         The large majority of the world avoids circumcision unless it is rarely medically necessary or rarely elected by an adult. Aside from these two factors, a dozen international medical organizations have policies opposing circumcision.

&gt;Since most other state Medicaid offices also violate regulation requirements for medical necessity, this legal case has great potential to make a significant difference in the practice of circumcision in the U.S. and protect millions of future males from this sexually and psychologically harmful practice!  

&gt;(For basic facts about circumcision see https://circumcision.org/male-circumcision-information-summary/ and other links on https://circumcision.org.)

&gt;Please contribute what you can to help us pay attorney fees and other costs for this historic challenge to Medicaid circumcision! Donations are tax-deductible.

I know that there are a few reasons for it such as money/people being used to clear snow instead of sweep streets and that it‚Äôs silly to sweep streets when there is snow blocking the way.   But here is my proposal:

1). When there is no snow on the ground, street sweeping should take place.   This will pick up trash and will help with the rodent issues that we‚Äôre all experiencing across the city.  

2) When there is snow on the ground, the city will plow the side of the street and clear out all the snow that just sits there between parked cars.   They won‚Äôt necessarily remove the snow, but by moving it into a single pile, it will open up more parking area.  

3). If it is snowing or has recently snowed, street cleaning will be on hold because we all know what a nightmare parking during that time would be.  

Benefits:
1) less trash/cleaner street. 
2) clear out snow from sides of street and open up parking. 
3) reduce the tendency of people to think that they own a space/ use a space saver because they shoveled it a week ago.  
4) stop people from parking a car and taking up a space and never shoveling it out.  
5) help open up side streets by clearing the snow to make it safer for drivers and pedestrians.

I was walking to work in Longwood and saw 6 consecutive Uber/Lyft cars on Longwood Ave waiting to turn into the Boston Children's Hospital main entrance. Because there was a construction truck blocking the intersection, the passengers in all of the cars emptied. They were likely all staff working at the hospital (they had hospital badges, were wearing scrubs, one had her white coat on etc.). Before Uber and Lyft existed, and offered dirt cheap private car service, I suspect several of these people would have taken public transportation into work. But since Uber/Lyft are so affordable (it is a $7 shared ride for me to get into Longwood from Jamaica Plain), the temptation is too great to resist.

Look. I hated taxis before. I also hate how unreliable the MBTA can be.

I'm from overseas so I don't have a lot of experience. But I'm living in Boston for a few months and during that time I want to visit New York. Now I've looked up some bus prices and found one which had good prices and a schedule that I liked. It's the bus company Flixbus. I know them from Europe and there they have been quite reliable but I don't know their reputation here in America. 

I was wondering if anyone has had experience with them before. Especially the pickup place here in Boston. On their website, they are rather vague about the location but this is what they're saying:  ""90 Traveler StreetBoston, MA 02118  Pickup area is located within a LAZ parking lot. Enter the lot on NE corner of Traveler and Albany St. Pickup area is located along the first row of parking spaces as cars pull into the lot. The area will have a FlixBus ""wait here"" sign. ""

I  believe this is in South end(?) and google maps is showing it to be under a highway or something. It's a ten-minute walk (again google maps) from the red line T station Broadway that I would have to walk do at 6 in the morning and 11 at night when I get back. Do you guys think that would be safe? (context, 18 year old female)   


So yeah I hope anyone can help me with this. I really have no experience with it and since I haven't been in Boston for long I don't really have a network to ask so my friend suggested you guys. Also, if anyone has other recommendations for better bus companies please let me know as well thanks!",boston,Opinion on the Flixbus from Boston to NYC?

I saw Hemway at Midway Cafe recently in JP and they had a unique alt/indie rock style that was right up my alley.

Their latest song on bandcamp: [https://hemway.bandcamp.com/track/camera](https://hemway.bandcamp.com/track/camera) That one is on the quieter side, they have a lot of harder hitting songs and pop-ish songs too, but they're all very original and melodic and never just the standard boring 4-chord power chord structure.

When you screams ""no motor on path"" at a rider, it doesn't make them want to stop riding there. It just make them think of you as an asshole and do it more often to spite you. You are literally just hurting your cause. And you end up having an unnecessary negative altercation.

Real change happens with systemic changes.

629,sashap123,1578902324,eo174c,Nan,"Hello all,

A couple weeks back I got a speeding ticket in Westin MA, right outside of Waltham. The story is that my gf left her phone in my car, and I only realized it on the way back home.

Since she has a little card pouch thing on her phone and her school ID was in it, she had no way of contacting me nor any way of getting back into her building. Since it was also around 2am on a Sunday there was slim chance of her being able to tailgate someone into her building. So naturally I was very concerned and rushed back to get her her phone and ID. It was also freezing that night (December) so I was naturally pretty worried about her since it had been about 15-20 minutes since I dropped her off at this point.

I was hauling on a little 25mph road when I caught a glimpse of a black Explorer and then I realized I was toast. 58 in a 25.

I was very respectful to the officer, did the whole ‚Äòdrop the windows, keys on the dash, lights on, hands on the wheel procedure‚Äô and he was appropriately courteous back. He gave me the minimum fee apparently ($105 instead of like $300+), but he was also like ‚ÄúSorry man but you were still going way too fast.‚Äù 

The interaction with him I played it off as very surprised that I was going so fast (which isn‚Äôt a lie I really didn‚Äôt know I was going that fast). I want to try my best to get this ticket off my record since I have had my own insurance policy only since September with a car and two motorcycles residing in the city of Boston and the rate is already pretty steep. As far as I know my record *should* be clean‚ÄîI got a speeding ticket in VA while overtaking a semi, but was able to get it dismissed by the judge after going community service and taking a class.

I already submitted the request to talk with a court magistrate. While I didn‚Äôt openly admit to speeding, it‚Äôs fairly indisputable that I was going over the speed limit since the officer and I were the only ones on this little road. If I tell the story, and am apologetic while also implying that I wasn‚Äôt aware that I was hauling that much, do you guys think I have a shot of getting it cleared? Also would a dismissed ticket still show up on my record?

Thanks a lot guys, looking forward for the tips",boston,HELP ON HOW TO CONVINCE COURT MAGISTRATE TO DISMISS TICKET

I have a Business Administration degree from a SUNY. I have been working for about 6 months in my job where I help people with disabilities prepare for work, find work, and keep work. The employment specialist role I'm in has a lot of transferable skills and tasks that I hope will help me find a HR job, preferably in recruitment. 

A place of interest that my girlfriend eventually wants to move to is Boston, but I am looking to make a move now to further my own life and take the next step for me.¬† I would be willing to take a more basic job soon and spend the months following searching for a job with better pay, that more aligns with my career goals listed above.

 Let's say I found a campus recruitment position in Boston, that paid $20/hr Full-Time...how could I make ends meet in Boston? Assuming I could be within 30-40 minutes of the city, what would I be looking at for rent? When I search rent costs I see 1000-3000$/month...how can any young person afford this? Keep in mind if I were to be taking a job paying $20/hr, I would be making roughly $3200 BEFORE taxes and monthly expenses. Monthly I owe car insurance, I have a car payment, I have student loan expenses, health insurance, grocery expenses, gas expenses, small personal expenses (being able to go on dates sometimes would be nice), and misc expenses. Also, I do have a dog, but I do suppose if it was a huge inconvenience I could leave her with my parents for a while until I had a better financial situation to fund a dog aka dog food (she is only 10lbs tho so not too much). 

How do young people do it? How would I make this move? How should I evaluate the job market and my potential? I do not know the exact cost of my student loans because they do not kick in until late March, but I expect, unless I refinance them prior, I could be looking at upwards of $1000/month towards student loans. My car payment and insurance total about $300/month. Health insurance costs would depend on my work, but my current plan costs me about $100/month. My current employee taxes are about 20% of my current gross income, which for $3200/month would be around $640/month. I will probably spend around $200/month on food and $150/month on dates/going out. I currently spend ~$100/month on gas and spend $10/month for Subscriptions (spotify and xbox). Im not 100% sure but let's just argue dog food could be $25/month I'm sure I missed some basic expenses, but here I would guess I will have nearly $2525 in expenses....if I'm only making $3200/month, how would I survive? I'd have roughly $675 left over for rent....how would I be able to live in Boston on that? 

Should I reconsider my options or is it part of the grind to live poor until I find a job that could pay like $4500-$5000/month instead of only $3200. Would a smart plan be to take any job I could around $3200/month and then make the move and then take months and try to find a better job directly in my career path? 

Any real advice wpuld be appreciated. If anyone wants to DM me their stories or personal path, please do! I can also send my current resume over DM. Also, for anyone who can relate or who is looking into similar things in Boston, DM me and I would be open to connecting on LinkedIn!

I'm trying to convert my RI license to a MA Real ID. According to the website, (https://www.mass.gov/how-to/transfer-your-out-of-state-drivers-license-to-massachusetts):

&gt; If your license is active or is expired for less than 1 year, a written and road test is not required.

My RI license expired about 6 months ago, but when I go to file my application online, I get to the end and a fee of $35 is tacked on for the Class D Road Test Fee. The fees all add up to $115 which is the price listed for the Out of State conversion, and I don't mind paying, but I also have no access to a car and (like most people) don't want to do a road test if I don't have to. The fees also say it's just an estimate, so maybe once I finish the conversion in-person at the RMV, the $35 does not apply?

Does anyone have experience with this, and did you have to complete a road test even if it plainly says it's not required?

And also, my original birth certificate was laminated when I was born, and according to their website, ""Please note that we cannot accept laminated documents"" -- so I would need a new birth certificate ordered?

There are two bedrooms available in a 4 bedroom condo. Two full baths, nice kitchen with dishwasher, large back deck that overlooks a community garden (no access, but sure beats neighbors). 
 Washer and dryer in basement, no charge. Great location two blocks from Mass Ave. and red line. 5 minutes from Target, 15 from whole foods and trader Joe's. Right in between MIT and Harvard. Walk to Kendall Square.  One of the rooms is open now and the other will be open February 1st.   
I'm a guy who works in Kendall sq. I have a dog and unfortunately can't allow any other pets. She is super friendly.  The other roommate is a also a working professional. We enjoy socializing together, but also respect each other's privacy.

*This would be a short term sublet ending April 31st*

My lease ends on April 31st and I am not renewing it.  You would have the option to take over the lease which could be discussed at a later date.  

Shoot me an email with a little about yourself and we can go from there.

Most of the immigrants during this period were poor, unskilled laborers from rural backgrounds who settled in the slums of the North End, the South Cove, and Fort Hill. Many were not only destitute but weakened by typhus contracted on the coffin ships that had brought them. To contain the health risk, a quarantine hospital and almshouse were built on Deer Island, where hundreds of immigrants died and were buried in unmarked graves. To make matters worse, a cholera epidemic swept through Boston in 1849. The North End poor, living in crowded, unsanitary conditions on the waterfront, were the hardest hit; over 500 Irish were killed. Boston health inspectors described a typical Irish slum as ""a perfect hive of human beings, without comforts and mostly without common necessaries; in many cases huddled together like brutes, without regard to age or sex or sense of decency.""

The Boston Irish Famine Memorial is a memorial park located on a plaza between Washington Street and School Street in Boston, Massachusetts. The park contains two groups of statues to contrast an Irish family suffering during the Great Famine of 1845‚Äì1852 with a prosperous family that had emigrated to America. Funded by a trust led by Boston businessman Thomas Flatley, the park was opened in 1998. It has received contrasting reviews and has since been called ""the most mocked and reviled public sculpture in Boston"".",boston,Example post with images

898,TheGoldCrow,1579291162,eq5jcm,Nan,"Hoping to spark some lively discussion about a hilarious landmark. Apparently in Jamaica Pond there is a bench that is U-shaped(????!!!). 

It was installed in 2006 by Matthew Hincman.

&gt;The curious bench is u-shaped, having no discernible front side; only two backs. Hincman himself calls it a ‚Äúguerrilla‚Äù piece of public art, which he first snuck into a row of benches without, shall we say, official Parks Department approval. According to Hincman, after he installed the bench: ‚ÄúIt took the City of Boston approximately one week to discover that the bench was there, and then another four days to figure out it wasn‚Äôt a City approved project.‚Äù So it was removed with a slap on the wrist, but not without the admiration of the City Parks Director.

The bench has since been reinstalled. 

Does anyone want to talk about the bench? Has anyone ever tried to sit on it??? Sound off in the comments below!

Boston is one of my favorite American cities. Call me biased, but it‚Äôs truly a fantastic city. There‚Äôs so many feelings and emotions and pictures that Boston evokes and I was wondering what other think they boil down to in a musical sense. I‚Äôm always listening to music and listening to music while walking through a city such as Boston adds a whole other level to the experience. 

The most obvious answer here is Dropkick Murphy‚Äôs (I‚Äôm not hating on them, I really like their music) so unless you really feel the urge to put them here, please refrain from giving them as an answer. If you are putting it as an answer, I‚Äôd recommend adding another band/artist to capture a different side of Boston.

I was able to take a picture today that did not include any of the dwellers (I actually due respect privacy of everyone), and have fallen on hard times myself, so I know I am threading a fine needle.

I did make the mistake of trying to get a closer view by walking there myself from Mass Ave, but I upon seeing a hypodermic I quickly retreated.  I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE PEOPLE DO NOT VENTURE HERE

So i'm hoping it wouldn't be an issue with me leaving my car for most of the 12 hours at the city point parking area. by the lagoon - there are no signs, so I assume if there are no signs there should be no problem? Thanks for any help./info on this. it will only be two days i'd need to park there. The other days I can park elsewhere",boston,Pahhkin at City point - South Boston? - Thurs/Fri?

2. If so, where would you suggests to go and have my tire replaced? And can I keep the old one, since they are kinda new and was of pretty good quality?

3. I have been suggested to look at changing my window wash and refill with winter mix, and also looking at changing my window blades. Are they necessary? If so where could I go in town to have them replaced?

A home in my neighborhood recently was condemned. I'm not sure what prompted the initial 911 call but it ended with this older man being removed from his home. The only two people we ever saw there were the older guy and an older woman. We never even saw her leave when the emergency vehicles were here and the town was hanging up the signs. 

It seems like they haven't had the means to repair the house in many years. We've not seen any family stop by or anything. He left their outdoor cat (I've seen him once in the last few days and there's some tracks leading up to some food we left out) because I doubt he had any other choice. 

From anything I've found online, it seems like he's got 90 days to get it up to code (this house needs extensive repairs) or the town seizes it and it becomes theirs entirely. 

Does anyone have any kind of advice for this situation? Resources seem low and it's breaking my heart. Its clear they didn't put off repairs because they didn't feel like it.

So all I ask you tonight is this. Let us look at each other here in the Garden and back at home, and pledge that no matter what any other community might do, we in Boston will honor Dr. King in peace.""

From Mayor Kevin White's lips to the city of Boston's ears, these were the words that kicked off James Brown's concert at the Boston Garden on April 5, 1968. The electrifying performance came less than 24 hours after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and is credited with playing an integral role in keeping the peace in surrounding communities that night. At one point during the concert, Brown saw Boston policemen forcefully pushing back a handful of young, male fans that were trying to climb onto the stage. Sensing potential escalation, he urged the cops to back away from the stage so he could address the crowd: ""Wait a minute, wait a minute now WAIT!‚Äù Brown said. ""Step down, now, be a gentleman‚Ä¶ Now I asked the police to step back, because I think I can get some respect from my own people."" Order was restored and the good kind of history was made.

I think 98% of people on here will agree that college = expensive

I was lucky enough to learn from my brothers mistakes (dropping $30k for the first year to find out ""it wasn't right"" for him) and my parents basically saying they didn't have the money for me to make the same mistake.  Still paid a pretty penny, but could have fared much worse and did graduate in 4 years, with a low of 9 credits a freshman semester, and 21 credits a junior semester, so definitely some ups and down.

&amp;#x200B;

**Should our high school Juniors and Seniors be obligated to take an economics/math class, 100% dedicated to:** [Student Loan Debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/20/3-people-with-student-debt-open-up-about-their-budgets.html) (link), perhaps once/week for 1 semester?   As well as teaching them such things that taking 3 AP classes can earn them perhaps 9 credits that can be applied to their 120 minimum?  Or the savings that can be achieved by squeezing out 1 or 2 credit hours per year.

This is perplexing to me: below is a quote from the link above (and in full below)

*Whitstone has a bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degree in English from Abilene Christian University in Texas. Those two diplomas left her with more than $100,000 in student debt.*

*She started but never finished a PhD program, in part because her existing student loans weighed on her. ‚ÄúOne semester, I wasn‚Äôt able to finish paying for the costs, so I couldn‚Äôt register for future classes,‚Äù she said.*

*Today, she holds multiple part-time jobs, and often works on weekends. She‚Äôs a writing tutor, SAT instructor and author. In all, she made around $35,000 last year.*

*Because she‚Äôs on a repayment plan that caps her bill at a share of her income, she pays less than $200 a month toward her student debt. That also means she has two decades of payments ahead of her.*

Even at $190/month (x 12 months x 20 years) = $45,600 : (I am ignoring the interest aspect of it for this )

Question:  If loans like this are NOT paid back in full, (and I agree that many people that go into public service will not earn private sector salaries), does this take money away from future/aspiring students?

Question: Would these loan repayments if paid in full go into the budget to cover such things as funding social security, medicare, healthcare, bridges/roads, and dare I say it ""the military"", and yes, I suppose I should throw in ""tax cuts"", since it is fair game.

Question: Do students that go into extremely high cost universities/colleges (I say **extreme** since I think they are all high, but there is a big difference between UMASS and BU) increase the demand and thus increase the cost of colleges/universities for other students?

1308,TheLamestUsername,1579776181,esrebn,Nan,"As you all know some changes have been made. I do not want to dwell on the past events, but I feel we should clear the air on a few things. Some major decisions were made regarding how the subreddit should be managed without notifying the rest of the mod team, and without giving the entire community a chance to discuss it. That was a mistake, and that shall not be repeated.The events that took place after that included some unfortunate things, including a lot of hate mail and bad behavior. I am still combing through the wreckage (bans and shadowbans).  u/avamore, u/-doughboy, &amp; u/massiswicked have decided that, for the sake of moving past the drama, they will not be rejoining the modteam at this time. We all want the transition to be positive and civil.

##Addition to the Mod Team##
I want to welcome u/imomushi8 to the team. u/imomushi8 had offered the r/boston mods a spot in r/bostonma if things here failed, and I greatly appreciated the effort that she made in managing the sub, and the way she spoke to the community. She comes with moderation experience and actively moderates 7 other subs including r/physics. She is also very active in this sub and [you may recognize some of her past posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/cknlbf/four_seasons_of_george_oc/).

##How the Mod Team will Operate##

I do not believe in the concept of a head mod. I count as one vote. All of the major decisions will be discussed within the group. All of the mods are encouraged to present ideas to the team for discussion, and take on any projects. When a mod proposes a project to the team, the rest of the team should offer their opinions, advice, and help so that we can move forward on it. Mods have complete autonomy on making the day to day decisions like comment removals and bans. It is not practical to wait for every mod to have a voice on these decisions. Each mod is responsible for their decisions. If a mod issues a ban or removes a post/comment, they are responsible for replying to any questions posed in modmail. If the other mods feel that it should be discussed then that can be done internally in modmail.

##Expectations Regarding Behavior##

Hostility rules have been stretched in the past few days and that ends today. If you cannot discuss things in a civil manner then this is not the sub for you. We do not go after opinions, we go after people who are hostile or attempt to pick fights.

##Engaging the Community##

I want this to be a subreddit that is driven by the users. We will listen to requests and ideas. The key is that the users also have to help make these projects successful. If you want a weekly events thread, then you should also be willing to contribute to that thread. Feel like creating a banner? You are welcome to post your proposal. People often say they want good content, but that content has to come from the users. This sub will only be as good as the contributions made by the users. Don't be a bystander, be a participant.

The floor is open for any comments and ideas. Topics can include:

* pictures

* a weekly events post 

* daily discussion posts

* having banner themes for seasons and special events like St Patrick‚Äôs Day, Marathon, Opening Day, Pride Parade, etc

* any other general ideas",boston,[META] The State of the Sub

1422,PleasureMePrivates,1579980559,etvaiv,Nan,"Seen these discussed here, thought I'd ask.

So I'm enrolled in Eversource for my electric bill, things have been going great.

So I got a call today from a man who at first claimed to be from Eversource, knew my name and address right off the bat somehow. But then I got a little skeptical when he said the reason he was calling was to ""offer a 50 dollar discount plus 100"".

I know for a fact that Eversource would never call and do that since I got hit with the same scam a couple years ago, which ended up being a third party company that made my bill higher, which luckily I cancelled right away. And then I talked to Eversource and they claimed they'd never do that.

So fast forward to today. I start asking the guy questions, he gets aggressive and guilt-trips me for not wanting the discount, I hang up. He IMMEDIATELY calls be back (different number) and demands to know why I hung up. I let him ramble on with a little longer and he eventually says ""I will transfer you to the verification services, all you have to do is say yes, don't hang up"".

I obviously won't do that but decide to listen and see where it goes, and sure enough, the voice says ""welcome to IndraEnergy"".

At that point it's clear and hang up immediately.

Almost instantaneously I get a call AGAIN (!!) asking ""why you hung up!?"" I keep trying to tell him to stop calling me and he says ""wait, listen to me"" and goes on repeating the same thing and I eventually lose and and tell him to FUCK OFF. Then I get another person saying ""we offer you a discount and you say fuck off"" and then I ask her nicely to stop calling me.

I know this was a scam because of several reasons. Aside from the name IndraEnergy ad knowing this isn't a thing Eversource does, all the numbers they called me on were encrypted fake numbers belonging to other people.

Only concern I have is, how do they have my information? Can they do anything? Which is why I'm inclined to report this. I've NEVER had a scammer aggressively blow up my phone after hanging up on them.",boston,"Just got harassed by ""Indra Energy"" scammer to the point of literally having to tell them to fuck off.

The 2020 edition marks the festivals 45th anniversary as the longest running genre fest in America. The first nine days consist of a traditional film festival. Whether they be features, shorts, webisodes, workshops, parties or a new Hollywood film, Boston SciFi emphasizes emerging directors with distinct visions from around the globe.

Opening the festival is Eva Green and Matt Dillion starring in PROXIMA directed by Alice Winocur. A young mother‚Äôs day job is interfering with her daughter‚Äôs well-being. She is an astronaut training for a year long stint in the International Space Station. This premiere engagement is ‚Äúa significant, ambitious and entirely impressive film by a dazzling young French director in full command of her ship.‚Äù

The Festival concludes with The Original Binge View, The Marathon (a.k.a., ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòThon‚Äù), a 24-hour orgiastic motion picture endurance test. Imagine 750 close friends (maybe) sitting in a vintage movie theatre straining eyeballs and tush muscles watching everything from classics, soon to be classics and the occasional schlock disaster. That's THE MARATHON. It starts at noon on the 16th and ends at noon on President‚Äôs Day. Think you can handle it?

1475,Ms_Cats_Meow,1580136308,euot3r,MBTA/Transit,"Over the past three months, I've had four Charlie Cards just stop working. None were expired or damaged and they all had money on them. When I tapped them they just didn't register. Two of the times I had used the card, but 10-15 later when I went to transfer or add mone they no longer worked.

I called the T a couple of times and got two explanations that don't make a lot of sense:

1. They're switching to a new system and some cards might not work. I know they're moving toward cashless fares, but if that was causing issues it seems like it would be a more widespread problem, right?
2. My phone is demagnetizing them. Except, nothing changed about how I store my Charlie Card. I've always either had it in a cardholder in my bag (where my phone sometimes lives) or in my pocket (where my phone also sometimes lives) and I've never had issues before. In fact, I used to keep it in one of those plastic sleeves you stick on your phone and had no issues.

I'm pretty young and healthy-looking, but I have a fun suite of chronic illnesses that make it difficult for me to stand at times. I get very dizzy/lightheaded and my legs fatigue if I'm sufficiently tired.

As such there are times when I genuinely need a seat on public transit, but I don't exactly match the profile (not old, not pregnant, no wheelchair, etc.). I do own a wheelchair and crutches but I'm in physical therapy and don't use them, since getting exercise is the best way for me to stay afloat day to day.

Is there a way I can communicate that I actually need a seat and am not just an inconsiderate asshole? I get asked to stand up a lot and get lots of dirty looks, and honestly I don't blame people. I try not to sit in general unless I absolutely need to, and especially not in a disabled/priority seat (if that's the only type available, I try to avoid it unless it feels like an emergency).

I thought it would be helpful to start an updated thread as a lot can change in 4 years. As comments are left I'll link to the original post, separated by neighborhood and/or town. I'll use /u/cpxh's comment format on the previous thread since that worked well and helped keep things organized.


&gt;Format looks like this:


* **Town and neighborhood** - Ex. Somerville - Davis sq.


* **Rent** What do you pay/ what is normal, and what is your place like. 2 bed 2 bath? 5 bed 1 bath? Amenities included?


* **Attractions** Restaurants, bars, museums, etc. What's within walking distance?


* **Nightlife** Is everything closed by 9 pm? Or are there tons of bars and clubs open until 2am?


* **Community** Is it safe, is it clean, is it a young crowd or an older crowd, do people smash windows because you steal their space saver?


* **Access to the T** Which lines? Including busses?


* **Anything else you want to say about your area**

I recently moved to Boston from NYC.¬† I've seen a couple dentists here, both of whom have told me that I need to have a large number of fillings.¬† When I got a second opinion from my long-time dentist back home, however, he said that he'd been watching those teeth for a long time, and the decay was not growing and didn't need to be filled.¬† At least not yet.

I don't think that the dentists I've seen here have been dishonest.¬† Rather, I think they're more cautious and proactive than my dentist back home, who is particularly reluctant to prescribe dental work unless he's certain that I couldn't get away without it.¬† That treatment philosophy seems to have served me well for the last 10 years or so.

I kept asking my building management and finally I have one more option to choose from besides Comcast. I‚Äôm not going to list reasons why I wanted to switch from Comcast, you all know lol 

Anyway, since they are rolling into more buildings, I thought I‚Äôd share my opinion: 
-When I signed up, I got first 2 months for free. 
-It really does cost $50/month, including all equipment and all fees
-I was able to get an installation appointment using their app, so I didn‚Äôt have to call (introverts, rejoice!) 
- Their tech came in on time &amp; was extremely quick. He was also able to answer all questions I had and even ram me through their app
- So far I consistently have ~200mbps download AND upload speeds

Things to know: 

- If you have a termination fee, Starry will cover up to $200 (I think)
- If you currently have Comcast or other provider, depending on how it is set up, you will either be able to keep both running while you test Starry out or you‚Äôll have to drill a new hole or turn off your old provider. I had to go with the last option and I put my Comcast account on hold while I still test Starry (it also costs $8 per month..like what?). The reason I did not terminate it right away is because I have a very old bundle with HBO and I did not want to lose it and because I live in a pretty old building and I was told Starry can get a little bit glitchy. Although I have not noticed any issues. 
- I have heard that in a case of bad weather Starry can get disconnected for a short period of time. I have not experienced that and I do not think that‚Äôs an any different experience if you have something else. 

Also, if you plan to sign up, you get 2 months free (as I mentioned) and if you [use my link](https://starry.com/r/m8gql7), we both get an additional month for free",boston,I recently switched to Starry from Xfinity and so far it has been great!

A bit of a strange but just trying to be cautious.

Some prefix to all of this. Last night I went to the gym for around 1 hour, then my girlfriend &amp; I came home. I didn't eat breakfast and we proceeded to drink Merlot (red wine) &amp; snack on cheese while watching Netflix. Finally, we had really intense &amp; hard sex which I feel completely drained all of my energy. It genuinely did.

This morning I woke up feeling a slight fever, slight sore throat, shortness of breath (I had to breathe very slowly) and my whole body was (and is) aching. I figured this was all just a lack of nutrients, calories and protein. So I cooked myself ~1.5lb of chicken, ate it along with my lemonade. It helped a ton. Then I ate this huge Boston donut which strangely helped me feel better. Took a 1:30 hour nap and now I feel immensely better but still feel all the symptoms albeit at a much lower level.

I'm planning on going to CVS later tonight for some fever medicine, taking a really hot shower and some other stuff. It feels like I'm getting better, but I wanted to get everyone's thoughts?

1832,Keundt,1580715349,ey3ig5,Politics,"Hello Boston. I live in Atlantic Canada, or Cape Breton Island to be more specific. I created this map to ask what everyone thinks about it. I have no idea if New Englanders even want a new country, but Canada is currently in a national unity crisis and I thought that Atlantic Canada would be better off in a union with New England.

Even within AC, there are lots of problems. Locally, Nova Scotia politicians are exploiting Cape Breton's fiscal weakness in order to grow federal transfers to the province (that are then disproportionately spent in Halifax), which is a major political problem here. I don't expect anyone in Boston to care, but a recent poll suggested that a majority of Cape Bretoners wish to self-govern as a separate province from Nova Scotia. But no one else in Canada is even aware of what happens in Nova Scotia, much less want more provinces, and it would take a constitutional amendment to add more.

And on the other side of Ontario, since most of federal funding comes from tax revenues from Western Canada, many are angry that their taxes are being exploited for Quebec's and Halifax's benefit, and that less is being invested in the region than is going to Ottawa, despite recent economic decline.

So Wexit grows stronger every week, and it's totally possible that Alberta and Saskatchewan hold plebiscites this year on a question of secession. Cape Breton's municipalities have elections this year, and a plebiscite on self-governance is already a debate topic since nearly two dozen potential candidates have already pledged to support it.

If Wexit succeeds in this decade (unlikely though), and Western Canada separates from Canada, Ontario and Quebec would hold a super majority of the votes in the House of Commons, and could hold Atlantic Canada hostage on every bill for the rest of the union. Which makes leaving Canada that much more important for AC in a post-Wexit reality.

I assume Atlantic Canadians would hate and feel embarrassed to become American, and would be afraid to lose their health care, so an american state would be off the table. And AC's economy isn't strong enough to be its own country.

Atlantic Canada would be in a pickle post-Wexit, so that's why I'm asking everyone how you would like to see a New England and Maritime union, plus Newfoundland &amp; Labrador and upstate New York. The map says Greater New England, but Idk what else to call it.

Of course, I got a little creative with the borders. Since places like PEI and CB are too small in population to be states, a country like this would require its constitution to allow states to seek federal approval to break themselves up into provinces (for the sake of federal voting mechanisms, like for example one senate vote per province, versus two senate votes per non-provincial state, etc). So Atlantic Canada would have six provinces, with Labrador being a state territory. New Brunswick's English majority communities become their own province, while the French and bilingual communities become one too. CB and NS break up.

I figured that since AC would break up into provinces, so should MA and upstate NY due to their population in comparison to the rest of this country. The Boston area becomes East Massachusetts, while West Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bay become provinces too. Idk if people agree with my border suggestions, if MA would even break up into provinces in this scenario, but you can discuss in the comments. As for NY, instead of provinces, I broke it up into three states, with one of them (North Country) merging with its neighbors in Ontario (Prince Edward to Cornwall).

Before i moved in, she told me that everything will be included and i only need to pay 1100 dollars per month. I think it is indeed a reasonable price. And since its not renting from a agent or real estate and the landlord just living downstair with us, there is no deposit fee or anything. However, one day i was talking to my roommate, and she accidentally told me that the rent is 2000 dollars in total.  But she has all her stuff in the living room and all her stuff in the kitchen and her bedroom is also bigger than mine. My bedroom is way smaller than hers, but i am paying more than her. Originally i thought, may be because the utility and internet are really expensive, however, its not really the case, i asked her, and she told me the internet is 45 per month, and the heat is about 45, i didnt really ask how much is the utility bill, but all together should be around 150 ish. So the total rent should be about 2150. Although i lived in a smaller bedroom, she is letting me pay more than i should pay. Its winter right now, but there is no AC during the summer. So the heat bill will definitely drop once the weather warms up. It is unfair to let me pay 1100 compared with hers. Am I overreacting? I have a decent relationship with her, and she is willing to drive me together to gocery shop and letting me use her pans etc. i just hope the rent can distribute a bit more fair since i am still a student and really dont have much. Should I mention this to her? Or am I overreacting? How should i handle this?

Thus, my question is how much of a headache this will be to fix. I see there is an option to appeal my eligibility but that seems to involve hiring an attorney, which I obviously can not afford.

Sorry if I seem clueless but I‚Äôm truly overwhelmed by this situation. I have not called yet because I‚Äôm aware of how grueling the customer service line can be, so I‚Äôm asking for advice before I go down that rabbit hole.

You can imagine my excitement when I was hired to work for an organization in Cambridge. It had taken so long to find a job from out-of-state as a someone who lacked a tech or engineering background, so I was thrilled, and ready to start work later this month.

That is a week ago. They decided to rescind the offer in favor of going with someone local. I get the sense that they opened the position up again, and found someone they didn‚Äôt have to wait for.

I really don‚Äôt get it, and while I didn‚Äôt actually know these people, my feelings are hurt. I was going to pay my own relocation costs as they didn‚Äôt have the budget for it. 

I just...IDK. I am so frustrated and angry, but I also have to keep pushing. It‚Äôs probably for the best, but it still sucks.

Around 4:00 p.m. today by Mass Ave. and Boylston (by the Berklee Performance Center), I was walking from class to class when I was approached by a man claiming to have had his car towed and booted (Red Flag #1). I consider myself the kind of guy who usually doesn't fall for these kind of scams, but he seemed legitimately desperate and said he'd give collateral (drivers licence, contact info) before paying me back. Long story short, I essentially get strong armed in going to an ATM and giving him $240 (I know, I'm an idiot). His story started to get more and more implausible (he said he was unmarried despite wearing a wedding band, said the towed car was a blue Audi when his car keys were for a Chevrolet). At this point, I firmly ask for my money back, he obviously gets evasive, and eventually, after following him, he pulls a knife out and tells me to ""get the fuck back"", which I did.

I got a few intimidating phone calls after the fact (I imagine to try to keep me from talking to the police/get me to give him more money), but I am thankfully safe. 

The alias he was using is Tony Smith, and he said he was a butcher from Taunton. Talking to the police after, a known con artist has used this name for awhile, but hasn't been active in the area for a few years. So just a heads up, don't be like me, and keep an eye out.

There isn‚Äôt really a happy medium situation, especially because the commuter rail is so expensive compared to the regular T. I also do NOT want to have to drive from Providence to Boston...eek traffic.

Idk if this is even the right subreddit for this but I‚Äôm really just feeling so conflicted.

My landlord was informed and she filled out a basic application to be kept on file and she was added to the lease. In addition I had a Roomate agreement specifying important ‚Äúrules‚Äù of the lease that must be followed (smoking, noise, visitors...it‚Äôs an old building those three things in excess are what people complain about in the building) in their agreement it is specific about how rent is paid. Our lease just specifies the rent $1495 due on the first but it doesn‚Äôt break down who pays which portion. In the Roomate agreement it specifies we each are to pay $747.50 by the first of each month. However she‚Äôs now 9 days late and has given every story under the sun why she doesn‚Äôt have rent yet. (Banks held her checks til the 6th, then she didn‚Äôt get her paycheck, then bank wouldn‚Äôt let her Venmo bc it came up as fraud etc) the landlord gave her an additional month to pay her last month deposit so she‚Äôs now behind $1495. I paid the deposit bc originally she said her checks would be cleared by 2/6/20 and we have until 2/7 to pay and the deposit was needed by 2/1. So now she owes me $747.50 plus utilities and the landlord she owes $747.50 to. I was able to get her to send me $375 but now she‚Äôs not communicating at all. What are my options here? If I‚Äôm paying both rents then I‚Äôll just not have a Roomate.... and my landlord is saying it‚Äôs a issue between us not her or management and that rent need to be in by 2/14 or else they‚Äôll start eviction!

Basically the title - I'm a (local) college student who will graduate in May and looking to move somewhere in Boston directly after. I have a couple questions to this end: 

1. I've heard conflicting things about what you need to move into an apartment in Boston-- ranging from just first and last month's rent, all the way to first, last, security, and broker fees, and everything in between. So I'm curious to hear from all of you what you've found is generally required to move into an apartment. I'm aware that the answer to this question might vary by neighborhood, but let's say I'm not looking at anything fancy-- probably Allston, Longwood area, or Somerville. Let's also assume that I'm open to having a few roommates (if that would change any of the upfront move-in costs).
2. Further, I'm currently in a situation where my job won't start until mid-June. Is it possible to sign a lease in May or June? I've heard from many people that most leases don't start until August or September around here. Could one find a lease that begins in early summer, or is subletting a place until I can sign a lease in early Fall the best bet? 

Again, totally not looking for super precise answers, just trying to get some general advice. And like I said, if this is the wrong place, feel free to tell me to fuck off. Thanks in advance.",boston,Graduating soon and looking to get some rough estimates for move-in costs in Boston. Any advice?

I‚Äôve talked to him about it multiple times and he‚Äôs somewhat responsive but does it again the following week as if I never asked him to stop before.

I‚Äôve done everything I was advised to: contact my landlord (who sent him a warning letter), talk to him politely, talk to him sternly, leave a polite note in his door... The only thing I haven‚Äôt done yet is calling the police, because being a foreigner woman I‚Äôm frankly quite scared of American cops. Also, I‚Äôm on a J1 visa (and I assume he is too), so I‚Äôd rather not get the police involved.

We're new to the Boston area so would appreciate any guidance about this situation. 

*Context:* We moved into an apartment with a 12-month lease at the beginning of this past September. This is an entirely new apartment that was literally still under construction until the day we moved in. The first couple months, we had a ton of issues with almost every appliance or utility not working (up to 2 months), and it felt like they were not prioritizing supporting us (we kept having to follow up about these issues). After a while in November (2 months later), everything was thankfully finally fixed. 

A couple days ago, we got a notice, which stated:
1. The rent will be increasing for our next lease period.
2. We have until end of this month to sign the lease for the next year (a full *6 months* before our lease ends).
3. If we do not, they will put the apartment on the market and, if we want to sign the lease afterwards, then we need to pay a brokers fee equivalent to a months rent.

Having moved from another state, this seems incredibly wrong to me. Could I get some *guidance* on the following :
- Is this legal? In particular, the brokers fee for not signing a lease 6 months before my next lease would even start.
- Given how many issues I had with the apartment to start, do I have any leverage to push back?
- Any other guidance or advice?

Thank you in advance for your help!

I've lived in Boston for 5 years now and I am in the process of packing up my bags and heading off to hike the Pacific Crest Trail next month! Of course, in true Boston fashion, my landlord has decided to be an *absolute fuck* about me leaving early. I wanted to field my current situation and see if anyone here could offer assistance in this unnecessarily stressful time.

Like most people in this city, I live with roommates whom I deeply care for and have solid relationships with. Since I am leaving at the end of this month, I need to find a sub-letter to cover my portion of the rent. When I explained that I wanted a sub-letter application from my landlord (something I know that they do as that is how I entered the lease less than a year ago) they quickly responded with an update that they plan on selling the property. Now this adds a serious wrinkle on top of the hassle that is finding a sub-letter, as they now have the right to evict all tenants within 90 days of the sale if the buying party elects to do so. 

Luckily I managed to find someone that was willing to accept under those conditions and move in on March 1, but after nearly 3 weeks of trying to get the subletting application from the landlord they ended up backing out of their verbal agreement because of the complete lack of communication.

We are under the impression that the landlord is trying to capitalize on the situation to force the other tenants out, in turn having a faster sale. She offered us the ability to break the lease with no penalty on March 1st and while she also offered the opportunity to sublet, it seems like its a facade as we have not heard anything from her when the sub-letter tried to initiate the transfer of a lease.

Is this legal? This feels like a de facto eviction, which honestly takes Boston-housing-shittiness to a new height. I wanted to see if anyone else has dealt with this problem before and if they have any advice on how to proceed. I am in a stupid huge time crunch and I want to help my roommates out but it seems that the system is built against me hand my hands are effectively tied behind my back.

To add some fuel to the ""fuck landlords fire"" this is the same landlord that has delayed fixing a shattered window in our kitchen since before Thanksgiving. So yeah, we're out for blood if at all possible.",boston,Advice on Dealing with a Tenuous Landlord

‚ÄúOfficers arrived at the 450 Washington St. department store at 3:43 p.m. to find a group of unruly youths damaging property there, police said.

As officers escorted the youths out of the store, one of them knocked merchandise off a shelf and shattered about $1,000 worth of perfume bottles, police said. She was later released to a parent and will have to appear in Boston Juvenile Court, police said.


Police were called to the store‚Äôs basement several minutes later. About 15 youths, the same group who had been asked to leave earlier, were lingering near the escalators. Some of them had ripped furniture open with knives and left burn holes from marijuana in their fabric, police said.

The youths once again left the building ‚Äî but not for long. At 4:45 p.m., they went back to the Macy‚Äôs and caused more trouble, police said.

Officers found between eight and 10 youths standing in one of the doorways, pulling ski masks over their heads, police said. One of them pulled a stun gun and mace out of a backpack, police said.

Officers immediately detained the group and recovered the weapons, police said.

One of the youths, a 15-year-old boy from Mattapan, was arrested and charged with delinquency by reason of dangerous weapons unlawfully carried (stun gun), police said. He was to be arraigned in Boston Juvenile Court‚Äù

I work from home 100% of the time and a key for me neighborhood-wise is that I can walk most places I need to go (shops, cafes, gyms, pharmacy). With having a med condition that prevents me from driving, super walk-accessible neighborhoods give me a sense of freedom and comfort.

Realtor said things are about to pop off in the neighborhood and they'll be tons of new restaurants and stores in 2 years. She also talked about suffolk downs and what that will bring to the neighborhood. But bf is planning to buy in the next 3-4 months.

Is it going to be hard in Eagle Hill to be a professional pedestrian? We drove around a lot last night and the commercial space in that neighborhood wouldn't work for my needs. The realtor lives in Eastie and did say it was walk-friendly but when I asked her if she ever walks around she said 'no hunny, I always drive'.

BF is kind of basing this decision on me and I don't want to screw over an investment opportunity for him. But I know what a high quality of life for me requires. For reference I live in Union Square now and it's an ideal situation.

A friend revealed that it was his birthday in a few days so we decided that we should celebrate and get something, and we looked up a bakery that wasn't too far from the convention center that they normally had the convention at. I'm not even sure what the neighborhood was that we went to, but I believe the Uber Driver took us. Anyway the bad part is that we were drunk at the time. It was open late and there were student there studying.

There were a shitload of baked goods available that were all just sitting out on display to take, and there was also a little bar to order different drinks from, then there were some tables to sit at. It was such a chill and awesome place, and the tiny cakes we got were amazing. It was unlike any bakery I've ever gone to and epitomized the coolness of a big city.

This is for people who self-pay (not those who get the auto card via work). Anyone here try it out? Does it work?  Specifically, is the card not only paid for the new month, does it work on buses without you having to go to a fare-vending machine at a major station to activate the card?

Currently I pay for each month line, then have to go to Forest Hills to touch the card to the fare vending machine so that the card is activated to actually use. Auto-pay might be worth it for me if it doesn't require me to go to a major station.

It was closing time and the restaurant said they would reach out tomorrow if someone calls them, but I'm hoping this was a simple (?) mix up and this wasn't a planned switch around with a fake jacket? It's just bizarre just by the difference in jacket lengths.

We do suspect that it's someone who is still in college or grad school based on the fact that a first or last name is on a sticker.

2483,BKNorton3,1581793564,f4dyyn,Nan,"It's likely that most everyone on this subreddit has never heard of parkrun (spelled with one word, all lowercase).  The first parkrun was started in 2004 at Bushy Park in London, England as a free time trial 5k.  Since then, it has expanded across the UK and now has events all around the world.  Each parkrun occurs weekly at 9am on Saturdays, runs in a local park, and is completely free.  As every event is free, parkrun is run by volunteers who set-up, marshal on the course, perform timekeeping functions, and participate as tail-walkers to ensure everyone finishes (and no participant ever finishes in last place).  The parkruns are ""runs, not races"" and everyone of every ability is welcome to participate.  It's common to have incredibly fast runners running on the parkrun course at the same time as those who are only just getting their first steps onto finishing a 5k.  After each parkrun, those who want to socialize over a coffee or pastry can usually meet at a local cafe.  Each parkrun is meant to build a community, so this post-run meetup is great for getting to meet new people.

One of the great things about parkrun is its accessibility.  It doesn't matter what your ability level is; you can participate in parkrun by running, walking, or volunteering.  Going to parkrun builds a healthy habit of getting out and being social and active.  How social and how active you want to be is entirely up to you.  Volunteering is particularly welcome as every event needs volunteers to ensure that the parkrun can happen each and every week.

The Boston area started their first parkrun nearly two years ago at the Pinebank Promontory of Jamaica Pond (check out https://www.parkrun.us/jamaicapond/).  All you need to do to participate is perform the one-time registration online (for FREE, see https://www.parkrun.us/register/) and print out your personal barcode which is good for any parkrun anywhere in the world.  This barcode is what is used to track your times from every parkrun that you participate in.  After every parkrun, you'll receive an email with your result and can see how your run matches those that you've done in the past.  

If the Jamaica Pond parkrun is a little too far away, be aware that a second Boston-area parkrun is starting on March 21st at Danehy Park in Cambridge.  Not far from the Red Line at both Alewife and Porter Square, this parkrun is currently going through the test run phase. The Danehy Park parkrun will have unofficial test runs every week leading up to the official launch on March 21st.  More details are available on the Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/danehyparkparkrun/) and the official parkrun website should be available soon.

If parkrun sounds at all interesting to you, please feel free to register and attend!  Volunteers are welcoming and very happy to talk about the course.  Don't forget to bring your barcode with you so that your official results can be sent to you (Danehy Park will be official on March 21st, which is the first week where you will need your barcode there).

In DC, most dating happens online these days, but it's much more casual than I'm looking for. I like meeting people organically, and most of the intramural clubs I've joined in DC are full of married folks.   Any suggestions on how I could meet people, for both friendship and dating? I know Meetup is normally a go-to suggestion, so any tips on ones that are especially good for people trying to make new friends? 

From what I've read, while the male-to-female ratio in Boston is a bit more in favor of the men, it seems like it's a bit more authentic, less vain, and less power/profession hungry, if that makes sense.

Basic story, I'm moving back to the Boston area in the next month or so after landing a job in Wellesley.

The office is a twenty minute walk from the Eliot station on the D line, and I've been wondering where I should be aiming to live, and how a car might play into that.

I'm looking to sublet until June, when I'll move in with some college friends. Does anyone have any experience commuting out to Wellesley from neighborhoods on the D line? Or would it make more sense to try to live further out and just drive? Since this is a pretty temporary situation, I'm not too concerned about living in a super exciting area; mainly just focused on getting established.

I'm a Quincy taxpayer and my response to this is: NO. I do not want my tax money going to fight this bridge. 

Why?

1) Our taxpayer dollars could be spent on making the roads and traffic better. This is a huge issue in Quincy and the whole ""let's build condos on every scrap of land we can find"" is making it worse by the day.

2) It's immoral. Why are we letting a small neighborhood hold up a project that could help with homelessness and addiction recovery for the Greater Boston Area? Listen, Squantum, you do not live in Duxbury. You do not live in Cohasset. You live in Quincy.

3) How on God's green earth does Quincy think it can win this fight with Boston? Let's make a deal for road maintenance. Let's work with Boston to minimize noise and traffic. It doesn't even go through Squantum. It skirts the edge of the precious little neighborhood of privilege on a causeway.

A maddening quote from the article

&gt; But Quincy officials, who have vowed to do all they can to fight the project, say the Squantum neighborhood has significantly improved since the original bridge was torn down

Here's the catch people of Squantum, you lived there when the first bridge was there. You will live there when the second bridge is there. Maybe it hurts your feelings to hear that but it's true. That bridge is going to get built whether you like it or not. 

I have written to Quincy City Council and have gotten radio silence. I'm going to try to make appointments to visit some City Councilors and talk but it's frustrating. I already know what their responses will be. 

I'm writing in the Boston subreddit because I want people to know that some people in Quincy do support building the bridge.",boston,"Quincy has spent $400,000 fighting the Long Island Bridge. Says it will spend $200,000/year for as long as it takes."

I've been checking Somerville's job postings at the city and have noticed this position posted for a while now: [Director of Veteran's Affairs](https://www.somervillema.gov/residents/job-postings/director-veterans-services). 

I thought I'd spread the word as it seems like a solid job opportunity for a veteran - and only requires that you are an honorably discharged veteran with an MA driver's license. Pay range is: $80,000+ salary + benefits of being a public employee (paid time off, sick leave, vacation, health insurance, etc.)

2671,bjd2385,1582144296,f6gvay,Nan,"It's been a long two weeks without my vehicle after Parking Enforcement towed my car, a Chevy Trax AWD.

I retrieved my vehicle from their lot as soon as I could, taking most of the day off from work. However, that evening, while I was driving to my girlfriend's house, I noticed during sharp left and right turns that my entire vehicle vibrated, like there was a tire (or two) that were not rotating properly across the pavement, or being dragged.

Checking my vehicle in with my Chevy dealership, technicians at first could not determine where the vibrations were coming from. Chevy Trax's built in certain years have a recall out for lower arm mount welds. The technicians started by replacing these, figuring they could have been damaged or bent during the tow down I-90. It did not resolve the issue.

They next determined that the vibrations were likely coming from the rear differential clutch. They had to order these parts, which took a couple days to arrive.

I asked the dealership what this clutch replacement would have cost had it not been covered under warranty, and he cited \~$1200. 

There are multiple people who have been in my car who would assert that these vibrations were not present prior to the tow, which leads me to believe that it was not towed with the rear wheels on a dolly, but rather picked up as-is and pulled down I-90. Driving into their lot to retrieve my vehicle, I only saw small white tow trucks and no dollies, as well as no flat bed tow trucks.

I wanted to reach out to others with AWD vehicles and ask if you've been improperly towed. I don't think I have a lawsuit here, but I would be incredibly inclined to consult a lawyer had I paid anything out of pocket to resolve an issue this costly that was introduced by improper handling and negligence on behalf of the towing company Parking Enforcement uses.",boston,How many of you have had your AWD vehicle towed improperly by Parking Enforcement?

I am trying to find best basketball court (indoor) near me. I live in Burlington and it seems like these two choices are my best options (don't know about LA fitness). I've never been in BSC or YMCA, so I don't know the skill levels and crowd levels (also cleanness and management of the court) of them. Here are my preference:

 \- I am a beginner without much physical tool. Never learned how to play basketball, only played few pick up games during college year (I am 30).

\- I HATE try hard/aggressive/non-friendly people. I excluded LA fitness because I heard people are good at basketball, and they tend to be aggressive.

\- I prefer practicing alone usually, so less people are better.

\- I will be playing either in the morning (8-10) or night (9-10).

Although YMCA is more expensive, I am thinking about joining for half a year since I can play outdoor when it is warmer. With annual fee, the price is almost same for me.

If there is any recommendation, please let me know! Appreciate all the reply.",boston,BSC (woburn) vs YMCA (lexington) for basketball

Currently I live in a quiet area and am looking to move someplace that has more going on, as I am a single guy with no kids. Now, Ive taken several drives along the I-495 beltway to check out the towns/cities and Ive noticed a...pattern: most of them look like they were bombed by the Germans in WWII. Are most of the cities outside of the immediate Boston metropolitan area so, ahem, shitty? 

Now, I grew up in NY and lived in several states before coming here, so I am not some sheltered rich kid who never left my gated community. I feel like these cities are so worn down and people mostly live in them to commute to work. I think the term for that is a bedroom city. I've lived in other towns and cities which don't have the best reputation, but after spending time there they really have a nice charm. Syracuse in particular stands out - I really liked it there. It seems like the cities I'm referring too are soulless by comparison. Perhaps I am being presumptuous, but I've been here for several months and have yet to find an area that I want to move too. 

I have considered moving closer to Boston, such as Medford or Cambridge, but the rent is so high relative to what you get, it just doesn't seem worth it unless you get a roommate or have a S/O also making decent money. I also considered going as far north as Manchester, which would make my commute about an hour one way, but rent is much more reasonable. 

Is this how it is here in Boston? Get roommates and live like a rat in a cage, live in a shithole alone, live in a decent place but dont save money, or drive an hour each way to live reasonably?

He's a grown man but as a certified Greg expert I can say he's not the brightest, but I wasnt worried about him until my coworker started telling me about how dangerous the neighborhood is. This same coworker is an avid Alex Jones fan/conspiracy theorist so there's a good chance he's embellishing (or just plain doesn't know what he's talking about). Still, Greg will be living alone in a first floor apartment, likes to go for runs alone at night with earbuds in, and has other numerous habits that I'm concerned could draw the attention of crime enthusiasts.

So I recently started playing basketball again after three years. I am a beginner, who can make few jump shots, lay ups, but doesn't have much physical tools. I don't like playing too hard, and don't like to play with people who play too aggressively/try-hard. I also prefer groups with around my skill level. I don't wish to play with people who can dunk or who will leave me open and go for help defense all the time because they know I am bad.

I have a church group who plays once in two weeks, but I am looking for another basketball group that I can join. I prefer indoor, and don't mind paying for renting a court for the games. I live in Burlington, so I would prefer around my area (\~20min drive). Cambridge would be little far and hard to park, so that would be my limit. 

If you guys are in any basketball group that fits my description, please let me know if you want me to join. I don't want to feel committed, so casual weekly game would be the best for me. I am 5'8'' Asian (Korean).

Thanks!",boston,Does anyone know basketball group for beginner in Greater Boston area?
3058,koifishkid,1582815611,fadan6,Nan,"Message to backers via Kickstarter today:

&gt;I have some news to share that comes with mixed emotions. Simply put - I won‚Äôt be opening the Landsmith brick and mortar cafe. ¬†Due to unexpected rising build-out costs that became insurmountable (up into the high 6 figures), the debt burden would have been unsustainable for the business to carry. This has been a difficult and painful decision, but it just didn‚Äôt make sense to move forward. I plan on sharing this in a more public venue, but wanted to send a personal message to you as you have been so supportive of this project and of me. I can‚Äôt express how much I appreciate that support.  
&gt;  
&gt;The money that I had raised both from the Kickstarter and my own personal investment went to the initial startup costs ‚Äì most of which I had to pay before the build out, and all of which can‚Äôt be recouped:  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Rent (including security)  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Legal fees  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Accountant Fees  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Food Certifications  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Insurance Costs  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Architectural design costs  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Kickstarter Rewards  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Engineering fees  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Permitting (health department, liquor license application, etc.)  
&gt;  
&gt;o ¬†¬†Marketing (website, etc.)  
&gt;  
&gt;I understand that some of you won‚Äôt be able to redeem rewards like coffee cards and workshops, for that I am very sorry. ¬†We tried to include a tangible item with each coffee/workshop reward - we are so sorry for not being able to fully fulfill the rewards at the this time.  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs been disappointing to me that the shop won‚Äôt be opening, but Landsmith is very much still alive. ¬†As many small businesses experience, I am going to have to pivot to a new plan and bring Landsmith to life in a different iteration.  
&gt;  
&gt;As I reassess and realign on what Landsmith means and what I want it to be, I plan to take it back to the place it started ‚Äì nature, being in the outdoors, and connecting with community. Over the past 6 months, I‚Äôve held coffee in the woods meetups, camping overnights, bike packing trips, trail-running groups, and more. I want to continue to do those types of organized events and am even considering expanding to different parts of the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the next couple of months, I‚Äôm going to be sharing news and updates as they come in through social media. I want to be intentional about the next steps as I believe in the values and mission of Landsmith, and am still so excited for the potential Landsmith and the community have together.  
&gt;  
&gt;I understand that some of you won‚Äôt be able to redeem gifts like coffee cards and workshops, for that I am very sorry.¬† We tried to include a tangible item with each coffee/workshop reward - we are so sorry for not being able to fully fulfill the rewards at the this time. However, to try and make it right, I will be at Idle Hands Brewery in Malden, MA handing out either a Landsmith sweatshirt or tote bag to those of you who did not get to redeem your coffee card or workshop. Sizing and quantities are limited, so it will be on a first come, first serve basis. I look forward to seeing you and celebrating this project, and talking about what the future holds for Landsmith! I've included a link [here](https://emails.kickstarter.com/mps2/c/GAE/6TYCAA/t.2zm/ecGM-9MPTza5DsrZlaX0RQ/h4/DlndGaO5uZHYaMBii-2B3BW4UMHbYPUipYIK6nJRfe0Zt011HHTeph2zL-2BCi4iFJ886L3MNZovc9YWh1sSgQ1wgHe1u7KlVTSPLp0mkk3DpUBRqhkvHFK7lG-2F8QewdI-2BxmCXfxuSRxOws9866JTeuVPU9FTHVuVdYywT9xVnoh1EwDK9TrFXgAA-2BP-2Fa-2F1-2BY9olkrPyYQ2PA-2FZCiqU12SpNyud-2FwAreZp-2F2h58ReLpgwg892Evmu0PDuuIiJ9jX0gTb/6k0K) for you to register for free - it would be extraordinarily helpful!  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for being so supportive. In small business, these situations are the things you know may be a possibility but you take the risk because you believe so strongly in what you‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm looking at this as an opportunity to grow Landsmith in an even more meaningful way. Thanks for being there for the ride.

I like do something memorable on Leap Year, and this year I made a spur of the moment decision to rent a car and drive south to find weather warm enough to spend the day at the beach.  I met a guy from Charleston, SC last night and he convinced me to check the area out.

But here's the thing.  I had a buddy that was going to come with me, but he had to bail.  Now I'm left with the choice of either abandoning the adventure or driving for 30ish hours by myself.  So I'm turning to reddit in the hope of finding someone foolhardy enough to join me.

The plan is to leave Boston tonight around 7pm, get down to Charleston tomorrow around noon, stay at the beach for a few hours, and get some dinner. We'd leave Charleston in the evening Saturday and arrive back in Boston on Sunday.

The car is paid for, and I can cover gas costs as well. I just need someone to split the driving. Who's with me?",boston,Last Minute Leap Year Road Trip - Adventurers Wanted

3105,LeafStain,1582893267,fau1hp,Nan,"So it‚Äôs common knowledge that Boston buildings aren‚Äôt very tall, partly due to the surprisingly limiting location of Logan as well as a population which is apparently more against height than most other American cities.  but after doing some traveling lately, our buildings are laughably small and seems like a suspiciously easy solution to people not wanting skyscrapers, yet I guess people don‚Äôt want 6 story buildings either.  

A row of 5 story houses is leaving the equivalent of skyscrapers‚Äô worth of space that could easily be made up them if 7-8 story buildings which wouldn‚Äôt interfere with aviation as well as not drawing the ire of those that hate any buildings (may be wrong about this, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if new buildings being two stories taller than normal causes heart attacks through the city)


There are parts of Washington Street where I seriously question why some developers wouldn‚Äôt want to rebuild on certain lots to go a little bit higher, because the relative lack of height for that part of the street looks so lit of place, like someone put small city building planning in one of the busiest, most expensive parts in the country. 


Im not talking like Newbury Street where the quaintness of the architecture is part of the draw, just random streets throughout downtown and other areas which feel as if they‚Äôre being disservice‚Äôs by ardently sticking by very small buildings",boston,Does Boston have an inordinate proportion of ‚Äúshorter‚Äù buildings (4-5 stories)

I‚Äôve recently landed a job in Cambridge near the Draper laboratory on Tech Sq. As you know, the parking situation is hideously atrocious, and for logistical reasons I am forced to drive in from Framingham 5 days a week.

Now here is my ask. The only lot I‚Äôm aware of that‚Äôs close enough to walk it in freezing cold / boiling heat /w all equipment in tow is 30/day. I‚Äôm looking for anything within a (max) 1 mile radius to Draper whose discount offsets the trek on foot.

So my thinking is, perhaps you‚Äôve an extra space /with your apartment, or know a small business that wouldn‚Äôt mind making a bit of under the table supplemental income, or yer just feeling generous and want to share a super secret spot with this ol boy.

Whatever the case, it‚Äôs looking more and more likely that without finding a cheaper alternative, it won‚Äôt be worth keeping this (dream) job. Any and all help, advice, and / or charity would be very much appreciated. 

Finally, no I don‚Äôt like asking a bunch of strangers for help with life shit a grown ass man should figure on his own, but I‚Äôve been laid off twice in as many years with the last time nearly costing my family‚Äôs house.

They took all of the change in the front cup holder, went through almost every bag, and from one of them took a case holding a Nintendo Switch and 14 games, as well as a pink portable usb charger. 

We filed a report at the garage itself and with the Police, and were able to get the serial number to them on Friday, but the garage apparently only has 2 cameras, and none pointed at cars. 

I‚Äôm so mad at our decision to even go to the aquarium before our hotel, but we got there too early for check-in and decided to kill time. I‚Äôm mad at not thinking to throw it in my purse, which I normally do- but it was buried in luggage, and out of sight out of mind. 

Insurance will only cover after a deductible of $1000 is met. That‚Äôs roughly the cost to replace everything, so it would be a wash. 

We called around to some local GameStop‚Äôs and pawn shops, who all told us the same- they would not take a description of what was stolen, and even if they had the description, would not call the police to follow up, the police would have to call them. 

We are not local, and had to head home today. We have no way of checking stores. I‚Äôm feeling very helpless right now. 

They did not take the cord, and no dock was with it, so I‚Äôm mostly confident that GameStop did not take it. Beyond that, I don‚Äôt know. 

The Switch is the plain grey/black, but has Skyrim decals on the joycons and back of the system. It was in a fabric black case with a Zelda design on it, and contained 14 games. 

I would love to see all of that returned, but it‚Äôs the switch I care about the most. It was a gift, and one of the two accounts on there did not have Nintendo Online, so no cloud backup. 

I know it‚Äôs a long shot, but if anyone sees anything matching that description, please contact me ASAP. I don‚Äôt know what else to do.",boston,Stolen Switch

3320,Justice_learner2019,1583242892,fcupu7,History,"I have been studying the history of Boston lately, and I know at the end of the 1980s, the public housing projects in Boston became desegregated. As a result of this, people of color would be moving into the Irish Bunker Hill and Old Colony Projects. 

I have read that many of the white people in these two projects were not very welcoming of the people of color, that there was a lot of racial violence, and that the white people drew racist graffiti on the walls of the projects, and even wrote ""KKK."" Here is the link to the article with this information- [https://www.justice.gov/crt/housing-and-civil-enforcement-cases-documents-187](https://www.justice.gov/crt/housing-and-civil-enforcement-cases-documents-187) 

I understand that some of the Irish Americans in these projects may have been racist due to the effects of poverty and not getting a good education. But, my question is, in the process of desegregating the projects, did anyone ever try to use history to create a sense of solidarity between the Irish people and the people of color? 

What I mean by this is in the 1990s, I believe there was a fairly large number of people in Charlestown and South Boston who were sympathetic to the Provisional IRA. In the North of Ireland, Irish Catholics were systematically discriminated against and treated like second class citizens under the British occupation, which is largely why the PIRA engaged in an armed struggle to force the British occupation forces to end their apartheid regime in the North of Ireland. 

So, did any powerful people in Boston communicate to the Irish Americans in these two projects that Irish Catholics were treated like second-class citizens in the North of Ireland just as people of color had been treated like second-class citizens under the Jim Crow laws? Also, did anyone tell them the KKK targeted Irish Catholics too, not just people of color? 

I am of Irish descent and I'm not trying to judge here. I had grandparents who were of Irish descent and who lived in a poor urban Irish area in another part of the United States, and were pretty racist. I wish they had made the connection too. 

I feel if the similarity between the groups had been communicated in a more thorough way, the transition could have been easier.",boston,Question about Bunker Hill Projects and Old Colony Projects in 1990s

Tonight, a guy with \~15 past or pending indecent assault or exposure charges fixed on me as his target on the C train to Cleveland Circle, around 6pm. It is unnerving to have a person literally follow you everywhere you move on the train and even get out when you try to transfer to a different car and get on that one too. It is demeaning and annoying and angering to have him touching himself and you on a packed train when you're just trying to get home and watch election results and you actually had a really fucking good day up to that point. 

There are a few people I want to thank for noticing what was going on and doing everything they could to help me while I stood there shaking and frozen.

* The first guy that noticed, kept an eye on the situation and eventually told the driver and then told the police what he saw
* The girl my age who kept making space for me away from the guy and asking if I was okay, asked if I wanted her to come with me to talk to the police, and was a general badass
* The guy who gave me his seat when he saw what was going on and stood between me and the creep, and also silently motioned with his head to show the police where the creep was, like we were in an awesome movie

I'm sure there were other people who helped, so thanks to everyone. If I delayed you on your way to vote or on your way to anywhere, my apologies. To the people who were annoyed by the lack of detail they gave you about the delay, sorry for that too.

3367,stephlampkins,1583310420,fda2a7,Nan,"I‚Äôve been living in NYC metro for the past year so moving to Boston is going to be downsizing for me. Being somewhere densely populated isn‚Äôt a concern. It‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs job that maybe might relocate us and it‚Äôll be a substantial bump in pay, probably putting us collectively over $100k/yr. we‚Äôve been scraping by on about half of that out here and it‚Äôs really hard so nothing is going to make me feel truly broke. 

I‚Äôve been to Boston once and the city and T seemed fairly easy to navigate but I didn‚Äôt get too deep into it. 

Here are my questions and concerns:

The job would be in Westborough, so we‚Äôve been advised to live around Cambridge or Somerville if we want to be close to Boston proper. How walkable is it around there? We only have one car right now. Should we get a second one?

I‚Äôm a fledgling standup comedian. I know the scene is decent out there, but will it be hard to get to mics in the city from Cambridge? Does anyone know how friendly the scene is to women?

I have mild mobility issues. I walk without assistance but a lot of stairs can be problematic. How accessible is the city and the T? I get through the NYC MTA alright most of the time but some stops are hard for me due to lack of accessibility. 

We both have shitty credit scores right now (the last year and a half have been rocky financially). Are guarantors a common thing when signing a lease out there?

What‚Äôs the best way to find an apartment out there? Am I able to find something on my own or should I hire an agent? We‚Äôre probably trying to stay around $2k/mo until we get really established out there and work on our credit scores. 

How much does it suck to hate The Patriots? I‚Äôm a Colts fan and my husband is a Giants fan so there‚Äôs a lot of... feelings... 

What about hating the Red Sox? I‚Äôve developed a lot of NYC feelings. Can I get by just like casually being okay with the Celtics? (Larry Byrd, Brad Stevens, Gordon Hayward)

Where are the good beaches? Are any of them public? I spent my summer weekends around Coney Island or Brighton Beach last year and I‚Äôd like to keep doing that.",boston,I might get relocated to Boston and I have a lot of dumb questions

It's really not.

Yes we've got world-class researchers and whatnot, but when it comes to voting for actual change we don't do it.

We're ranked 48th in the country for our infrastructure. And we've got a housing crisis. Yet while there's so many literary scholars talking about ways to solve the transit crisis or housing crisis, when these topics are brought up and voted for, everyone turns NIMBY and votes against progress.

At this point places like Amherst and Northampton are more progressive. They've got a free bus system, numerous bike lanes, and a farmers market that occur all year long. 

And to top it off, last night most people voted for a centrist democrat candidate. Because why think outside the box, if we can just decide to give up and cater to the media narrative post South Carolina.

Honestly, this city is a bunch of rich people pretending to care about social issues when in reality we only care about ""counting down our years until retirement"". And this is coming someone who's lived here for 27 years.",boston,Change my View: Boston pretends to be progressive &amp; innovative when it's not.

3383,tigertops,1583346602,fdhd4r,Nan,"I am currently taking a class called Advanced Photography and as part of my semester long project I have to photograph people and locations within the thematic areas of pleasure. The title of my project is ""The Pursuit of Pleasure"" and I am hoping to photograph people as they seek pleasure. 

We live in a society driven by pleasure and most of us spend our days seeking pleasure. I have always thought of pleasure as being different from happiness. While most people see pleasure as having to do with positive inner experiences, I believe that it comes from outside stimuli. Humans quickly adapt to the level of pleasure a stimuli provides, and over time we need more and more of that stimuli to fill our hunger for pleasure. I want my photographs to capture people and their interaction with these stimuli in their quest for pleasure. 

Our craving for pleasure through stimuli often leads us towards deviant activities that allows us to experience a surge of adrenaline or a similar sensation. My work will primarily deal with activities that are considered deviant according to the norms of society. I am hoping to capture concepts and ideas that are normally considered to be taboos. I have a few different concepts that I am working on at the moment to show how people interact with pleasure. I have taken some photos of people in house parties enjoying recreational drugs and alcohol, as well as photos of people getting tattoos and piercings.

I am hoping to capture more of the same as well as build on some of the other concepts that I have. If you or anyone you know in and around Greater Boston is throwing any house parties or engage in activities that can be considered deviant and wouldn't mind being photographed, please let me know!

I am open to suggestions and can discuss more if you need further information.",boston,Looking for some help with photography project on pleasure!

3392,luckydork,1583355652,fdjo78,Nan,"I am looking to get my own place sometime in the next year or so, and want to make sure I am making the right choice. I've lived in Cambridge for several years now and it's been pretty perfect. I love the access to everything and the fact that it doesn't feel cramped or dirty. The real estate market here is insane but not prohibitive. I value the commute and neighborhood quite a bit, and I am willing to pay more for that (within reason). Also, the lower Cambridge taxes make prices slightly more palatable. I am car-free would not move anywhere that's not within walking distance to the T. 

However, I can't help but notice that places like Somerville (on the Orange or Red Line) might be a better bang for buck without compromising the neighborhood too much. For example, East Somerville is on its way to being fully flipped / gentrified in a couple of years, but I am not sure if I'd still miss being in center of everything like in Cambridge.  
JP also seems like a great deal: there's a lot of green space (which Cambridge doesn't really have), and prices are still relatively lower. I am worried it will feel too much like the suburbs -- does anyone living there get that vibe, or is the atmosphere closer to Cambridge? Also, how isolated/far from the city does JP feel? On paper it's actually slightly closer to Downtown than, let's say, Davis Square.

Are there any people who've bought in any of these places? I've walked around JP/East Somerville but I don't think that is very representative of living there every day. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",boston,Where to buy: Cambridge vs Somerville vs JP

I've also looked at reviews for businesses in the area and a few have comments about the area being shady and used needles being littered around. I was planning to go to a convention at the Hynes with 4 other guys and most nights we would be walking from the Prudential along Huntington Ave and Mass Ave (about a mile walk) between 11pm-1am. We might also consider using the bus or an Uber if it's safer. 

I'm having some second thoughts since I'd rather not be mugged, but at the same time I'd be in a group of 5 people so I don't really know if I'm being overparanoid or not. Also if I cancel my stay about $300 of it is nonrefundable. So Bostonians of Reddit, what do you think I should do?",boston,Is the area around Harrison Ave and Mass Ave dangerous?

I was a young man back then, my faith in the voice on the PA yet to be shaken by the iron-clad incompetence of the MBTA. An apathetic but honest announcement not two weeks into August that the Forge Park line would soon be out on weekends until November. Smart-track, or some other vague waste of tax dollars cooked up by the chimpanzee enclosure of MBTA management. Such as any other MBTA ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù, I understood that this was not destined to finish on schedule or improve the rail in any way...

What I didn‚Äôt expect was the traditional moving of the completion goalpost to extend through December, January, February, and very likely March with hardly any end in sight. For the increased fare of an already ludicrously overpriced ticket, two days of every week have become near useless. I know, I know, there is a bus. I could hop right on Peter Pan‚Äôs supple shoulders and ride to Readville. But oh what of the ride back? There is no good reason to go into Boston from this desolate suburban corner of the world on a Saturday night if not for drinking. The last ride back was already boarding before midnight, a full hour before our deep Puritan roots decide nightlife should die young and early. And now another stop, another deadline to miss and be forsaken to drunk dialing family or taking the most expensive Uber of your life.

I miss the Forge Park weekend line like I miss my ex. You let me down, you weren‚Äôt always there for me; but dammit we had some fun times together on that midnight express. And on a late weekend night when the drinks are flowing, I wish you‚Äôd take me back.

We were both used to a 45 minute commute before relocating so don't mind commuting up to an hour but ideally would be less. 

We are at that stage where we have outgrown the college town hitting the bars every night mentality but still enjoy an occasional night out to grab drinks. We are looking for somewhere that has a bit of a town feel - places we can go to grab a drink, hang with friends, grab a coffee, go out to eat etc that are ideally within walking distance. Ideally somewhere with other young professionals in the area as well. We are looking to adopt a dog so dog friendly areas are a plus as well. We would like somewhere relatively close to either the T or commuter rail so that we can get into the city when we want to. Looking for around $2500 + utilities for 2 bedroom/1 bedroom with den, we both have vehicles so ease of parking may also be a factor to consider. 

Right now we have been considering places in waltham, watertown, newton, brookline, brighton, and JP. Looking for any comments/suggestions/thoughts on the neighborhoods we are considering, any other areas you may suggest, and any tips on specific areas within the neighborhoods.

No words to those in the ER about risk. No signs letting people know precautions. I know this isn‚Äôt new and everyone knows but the total lack of acknowledgement is astonishing.

All the while my wife is writhing in pain and the nurse keeps giving us run arounds about why we can‚Äôt get an antibiotic because she‚Äôs in the hallway(morphine is fine tho).

What, specifically, constitutes a *facade gable*? It doesn't seem to be a commonly used term, because googling it doesn't bring very much up. I tried looking at houses on Lewis Street and the streets off of Union, and I can't exactly tell what is meant by this, just because there are too many houses with different types of gables and dormers around to be sure.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety and panic by arming you with knowledge, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from outbreak zones such as Seattle, Australia, and the LA area. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now ready yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**Context:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its exponential spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted in China through stringent measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are now over [100,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep. That means there is likely silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186). 

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

#**Important:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets** (coughing/sneezing/breathing). But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and be mindful of everything you touch in public (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source2 ](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.**

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)--especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world and has [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients. [Toronto Star soberly warns hospitals can‚Äôt cope if coronavirus outbreak worsens in Canada: March 6th.](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/03/06/hospitals-warn-they-cant-cope-if-coronavirus-outbreak-worsens-in-canada.html)

* A surgeon working in the heart of Italy's outbreak gives a harrowing testimony and urges everyone to heed the warning that it can easily overwhelm hospitals ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ffa2tf/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/fjx5tc8/) / [Original](https://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/20_marzo_07/coronavirus-bergamo-medico-humanitas-facebook-situazione-drammatica-altro-che-normale-influenza-4fdf6866-6088-11ea-8d61-438e0a276fc4.shtml)).

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

#**Psychology:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and make an effort to listen to your local health authorities. 

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper).  The public needs you to be clear, informative, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. 

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**Risk Reduction:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* Practice social distancing.

* Do not touch your face.

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). 

* Carry disinfectant with you.

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. 

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* If you have extra face masks, consider donating some to senior care facilities and hospitals, as there is a global shortage and they will desperately need them in the coming months. Masks in the right hands is to your benefit, as they slow the spread. Hoarded masks are actually detrimental to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitaizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Always remember the top three: Disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**Typical symptoms:**

(All direct from [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf))

People with COVID-19 generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days). As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases [in China], typical signs and symptoms include:

* Fever (87.9%)

* Dry cough (67.7%)

* Fatigue (38.1%)

* Sputum production (33.4%) (a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract)

* Shortness of breath (18.6%)

* Sore throat (13.9%)

* Headache (13.6%)

* Joint pain (14.8%)

* Chills (11.4%)

* Nausea or vomiting (5.0%)

* Nasal congestion (4.8%)

* Diarrhea (3.7%)

* Hemoptysis (0.9%) (coughing up of blood or blood-stained mucus from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs)

* Conjunctival congestion (0.8%) 

[Here is what those symptoms look like on a visual timeline, in Fahrenheit](https://i.imgur.com/BBOfWA5.jpg). 

[Here it is in Celcius](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452-f1).

#**Comorbidities:**

Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include those who meet *any* of the following conditions:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart, lung or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* People with weakened respiratory system due to [smoking/vaping](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure""**

Source: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html)

What does it mean for you if you fall into this bracket? A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) explains.

#**Mortality rate:**

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0 as of now
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%).

#**Additionals:**

* It's still far too early to know for sure, but the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is estimated to be 0.94% (0.37%‚Äì2.9% with a 95% CI) ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Though [here](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/coronavirus-mortality-rate-lower-than-we-think.html) is a recent Slate piece that mentions a CFR between 0.2 to 0.4. South Korea, after doing 140,000 tests, reports a CFR of 0.6% ([source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-tested-140-000-031000719.html))

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, as SARS-like virus can have long-term consequences: ""Long-term bone and lung consequences associated with hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome: says a [15-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-020-0084-5)"". And then there's the potential of suffering. The following is an example of a healthy 25-year-old nonsmoker who felt like he was going to suffocate [from the virus](https://news.sky.com/story/fighting-coronavirus-one-of-the-first-british-sufferers-describes-his-ordeal-11950631).

* The virus is of zoonotic origin, sharing 99% DNA with the coronavirus that infects pangolins ([source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138764153.htm)).

* During a black swan event, knowledge is power, and taking proper precautions now will minimize risk exposure for you and your loved ones.

Why I created this post:

I'm a volunteer who's put countless hours into this document. Why? I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal--that and I've been following Covid-19 closely since mid January.

Now COVID-19 is upon my doorstep too. 

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it helped you. 
Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

Mods of communities are invited to link this post from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/femw1n/psa_regarding_covid19/), where I keep it updated regularly.

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA.

3805,Zashiony,1583883254,fgng50,COVID-19,"&gt;To all Students, Faculty, and Staff:


 

&gt;In light of the continuing global impact and community transmission of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)‚Äîand in accordance with public health recommendations‚Äîwe are writing again to share important updates designed to protect the Northeastern community, while maintaining continuity of education and research.

 

&gt;Travel

 

&gt;To safeguard the health and wellbeing of the university community, we will suspend all non-essential university-sponsored travel‚Äîboth international and domestic. In select cases where in-person participation remains vital, decisions to approve air travel will be determined by one of the university‚Äôs six senior vice presidents, with input from Northeastern‚Äôs Global Safety and Security Assessment Committee. 

 

&gt;Faculty and staff with questions about this change should consult with their supervisor; students should contact WeCare: wecare@northeastern.edu.

 

&gt;Large Gatherings

 

&gt;Effective immediately, and consistent with recommendations of the CDC and other public health authorities, large gatherings on Northeastern campuses will be limited to essential events only‚Äîsubject to the approval of the Senior Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Approved events will be limited to 50 percent of available seating capacity to comply with appropriate social distancing guidance. In cases where compliance with social distancing recommendations is impractical, events will be rescheduled. Whenever possible, all non-essential large events will move to virtual format.

 

&gt;Dialogues of Civilization

 

&gt;The university will work to reprogram all planned Summer I Dialogue of Civilization global experiences, moving program locations in some instances and offering them virtually in others. In cases where faculty members leading programs determine doing so is impractical, affected students will be refunded all associated fees. The Global Experience Office will be in touch to discuss options available to students. A decision about Summer II Dialogues will be forthcoming in the coming weeks. 

 

&gt;Flexibility for Employees

 

&gt;We realize that some faculty and staff have concerns about exposure to the virus at work and the risk of disease transmission. To that end, we want to reiterate that if you are sick, or think you are sick, please stay at home. Do not go to class, and do not go to work, and please contact your medical care provider. In addition, the CDC has identified several high-risk groups: 

 

&gt;People 60 years of age or older;
&gt;People with underlying health conditions including heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, &gt;cancer, or diabetes;
&gt;People who have weakened immune systems; and 
&gt;People who are pregnant.
 

&gt;Faculty and staff who are considered high risk will be able to work remotely. Anyone with questions about their ability to work remotely should consult with their supervisor and the Senior HR business partner assigned to their college or department.

 

&gt;We continue to be guided in our decision-making by the recommendations of public health authorities, and we remain poised to respond quickly to changing circumstances as they become warranted. We encourage you to check the university‚Äôs COVID-19 website for the latest updates and changes to university programs.",boston,"Email from NU Chancellor.

üì∑Amid fears of coronavirus, UMass officials are expected to announce Wednesday that the system will be moving to online education.JONATHAN WIGGS/GLOBE STAFF

University of Massachusetts President Martin Meehan will announce on Wednesday that the system will move to virtual classes and instruct students not to return to campus after spring

break, according to sources close to the administration.

All five campuses of the state‚Äôs public university, which includes nearly 75,000 undergraduate and graduate students, will stop offering in-person instruction.

The UMass system will join other Massachusetts universities, including Harvard, MIT, Tufts, Emerson College, Amherst College, and Smith College in trying to essentially shutdown campus life to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Students at the system‚Äôs Lowell and Dartmouth campuses are currently on spring break and will be told not to return to the campus, the source said. Virtual classes will begin for them next week.

The Amherst and Boston campuses are going on spring break next week, and online classes will begin for them the week after.

UMass Medical School in Worcester will begin online instruction later this week, according to the source.",boston,5-campus UMass System will move to online education during Coronavirus outbreak
3866,Zashiony,1583943556,fgzprj,COVID-19,"Per the president:

To all members of the Northeastern Community: 
 
Like everyone on our campuses and around the world, I have been closely following the latest news about the spread of the coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. It is truly an anxious time for all of humanity. 
 
Last week, we announced our decision to transition to online and remote learning at our Seattle and San Francisco Bay Area campuses. These decisions were made in accordance with the best public health guidance and based on the troubling circumstances in those regions. 
 
Today I am announcing that, beginning tomorrow morning, we will move to online and remote instruction on our Boston campus, the university‚Äôs largest and most complex operation. We arrived at this decision carefully and thoughtfully, not precipitously. We are seeking to preserve the essence of a Northeastern education‚Äîincluding current co-op placements‚Äîwhile also taking prudent steps to reduce the risk of infection within our community.
 
In addition to the guidance of public health authorities, some of the world‚Äôs leading experts on infectious disease spread are members of the Northeastern faculty. Even as the world has relentlessly sought their wisdom, these faculty members have been indispensable in shaping the university‚Äôs response to this unprecedented outbreak.
 
Over the past week, I have heard from many members of our community‚Äîstudents, parents, faculty, staff, alumni, and others. Not surprisingly, you have expressed every possible viewpoint on the idea of moving to online education. In the end, this decision was‚Äîand had to be‚Äîbased on science, facts, and real circumstances. I am confident that this is the right decision for our university.
 
Let me be clear: as of today, we have no evidence that COVID-19 has infected a member of the Northeastern community. Nevertheless, we must focus on prevention, not just containment. We owe it to each other‚Äîand everyone in the Northeastern family and beyond‚Äîto take all practical steps to minimize the risk of infection and community transmission. We thank you for all of your support and understanding during this challenging time.
 
As we move to online instruction, we are not asking students in Northeastern residence halls to move out. While students may elect to do so, we are committed to maintaining continuity of campus life for those who elect to stay.
 
As outlined in prior messages to the community, we are maintaining the university‚Äôs current staffing levels, except for faculty and staff who are in groups deemed to be high-risk. All of the university‚Äôs messages‚Äîincluding FAQs and other resources‚Äîcan be found at our dedicated COVID-19 website. 
 
Additional updates will be forthcoming from the university‚Äôs COVID-19 task force. This group of professionals‚Äîfrom all facets of the university‚Äîhas worked tirelessly for the past several weeks preparing for and executing measures to protect public health and preserve our mission. As part of this undertaking, our deans and faculty have been actively preparing for the move to online instruction and are prepared to make this change tomorrow. I thank the members of the task force for all they have done so far, and for all that they will do going forward.
 
In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to join together to support one another. Ultimately, the solution to all of society‚Äôs challenges‚Äîbe they intolerance, climate change or infectious disease‚Äîis the learning and discovery of new knowledge. We are well positioned to take on this challenge. 
 
Sincerely,
Joseph E. Aoun

Dear Members of the Brandeis Community,

As we continue to  monitor the coronavirus COVID-19, I am writing to provide an update on  the steps the university is taking to help mitigate the impact of the  virus on our community, the most vulnerable among us, and beyond.

As we try to get  our arms around all the complexities of amending operations on campus, I  am grateful to see the values of care and compassion in full force  throughout Brandeis ‚Äì from students, faculty, and staff.¬†Each, in their  own way, has shown a willingness to assist the administration think  through the many consequences of changing how we teach and learn, how we  work, and how we look out for all members of the community.¬†I am most  appreciative of the work done in recent days by the university‚Äôs  COVID-19 working group, led by Provost Lisa Lynch and Executive Vice  President for Finance and Administration Stew Uretsky.¬†The group has  engaged local public health leaders and state officials to inform their  own daily discussions and policy recommendations to help reduce the  effects of the virus on our community.

COVID-19 presents  the Brandeis community with an unprecedented challenge due to daily  changes in guidance from state and federal authorities and the lack of  knowledge of the virus.¬†It is clear, however, that we must take steps to  help limit the spread of the coronavirus by reducing our density of  population on campus.¬†Doing so will reduce the risk of the spread of  virus within the community, especially among those most  vulnerable.¬†While we are not aware of any cases of COVID-19 among  Brandeis students, staff, or faculty at this time, the university is  taking additional safety steps because of the rapid spread of the virus  in Massachusetts and Governor Charlie Baker‚Äôs declaration of emergency  for the Commonwealth last evening.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Some classes are already being taught on-line.¬† By  Monday March 16, all Brandeis classes with more than 100 students will  move online.¬†The last day of in-person instruction for all classes,  regardless of size, will be March 20.¬†The Passover and Spring Recess  dates will be shifted to March 23-25, April 9-10, and April 15-16.**
* **All undergraduates living in on-campus housing are  asked not to return to campus after March 25 and may begin moving out  of their housing earlier should they wish to do so.**¬†We will  allow some undergraduates, on a case-by-case basis, to remain on campus  in the residence halls but they will need permission from the Department  of Community Living.¬†Examples of students for whom exceptions would be  made include international students, those with ongoing on-campus jobs,  those who do not have a home to go to where they would be able to  continue their online classes, or for whom going home is not an option.  The Department of Community Living will provide more details on this  process in the coming days.
* When the March 23-25 portion of Spring Recess ends, all  undergraduate and graduate classes will move online for the remainder of  the academic semester.¬†The deans of each of our schools will provide  more guidance and information in the coming days with respect to  transitioning to all online courses and other academic concerns.
* Students currently in study abroad programs should continue in their programs until otherwise notified.
* Faculty will make accommodations for students who leave  campus prior to March 21 including for exams.¬† Class attendance and  participation policies will be revised to indicate that students‚Äô grades  will not be penalized due to the need to accommodate health needs, a  student departure from campus before March 21, or the move of all  academic work online.
* The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) will support this transition to online classes. Please visit the [CTL Teaching Continuity page](https://www.brandeis.edu/teaching/teaching-continuity.html) for information about teaching and learning online.
* All student counseling and support services including the  chaplaincies and Hiatt Career Center will continue to operate, although  these departments may shift the way in which they deliver their  services.
* Guidance for athletic events and competitions will be forthcoming, based on policy coordination with the UAA and the NCAA.
* **Information on refunds for housing and meal plans will also be forthcoming in a separate communication.**
* **Events or meetings with more than** **20**  **attendees, on-campus or off-campus, must be postponed, cancelled or  ‚Äúvirtualized.‚Äù¬†Organizers of events or meetings with fewer than 20  people should consider postponing and/or using remote technology  instead.**
* Information on Commencement will be provided at a later date.

While in-person  instruction will be suspended as of the end of the academic day on  Friday, March 20, the university will otherwise remain open for normal  operations until further notice.¬†Faculty and staff will have access to  their offices, labs, and studio spaces, and all members of the community  will have access to library services (in-person and online).¬†In  addition to Dining Services applying increased safety measures related  to the coronavirus, dining facilities will remain available, but on a  modified basis.

Our university  administration and the deans of the academic units will be working with  faculty, researchers, and staff to draw on telework to help reduce risk  from exposure. I ask that all units begin planning now for working  remotely and experimenting with flexible work arrangements, should that  become necessary. This would include testing technical remote work  capabilities and implementing flexible remote work options. I also  request members of the community to increase social distancing by  limiting in-person meetings and avoiding close contact.

This is a  stressful time for everyone at Brandeis. It is also understandable for  our students, especially, to feel disappointment at this time. As  Brandeisians, we enjoy being on campus to teach and learn together and  to share the friendship, support, and particular rituals that make the  Brandeis experience special.¬†

We should take  comfort, however, in knowing that the character and strength of  Brandeisians and Brandeis will help us through this period as they have  in the past.¬†Throughout the university‚Äôs relatively short history, our  students, faculty, and staff have met major challenges and succeeded by  being innovative and collaborative; I have no doubt that we will do so  yet again. I know that our faculty will meet the challenge of switching  mid-semester to virtual teaching while continuing to provide an  excellent and rigorous learning experience for their students. I know  that our staff will keep the university operating at the highest level  possible to lessen the disruption that is sure to come in ways we cannot  foresee. And I know that our students will apply themselves to their  learning just as vigorously as they have done prior to COVID-19 and  remain a supportive network for one another during this time.

We will continue to send updates regularly on these and any future steps.¬†Please refer to [our website regarding our response to COVID-19](https://www.brandeis.edu/health/coronavirus/index.html?feature) for up-to-date information and a list of frequently asked questions.¬† You can also direct questions to [covid-19@brandeis.edu](mailto:covid-19@brandeis.edu).¬†For assistance in coping with any stress you are experiencing, please review the resources available to you on the [Brandeis Counseling Center website. ](https://www.brandeis.edu/counseling/) 

I appreciate  everyone‚Äôs patience and willingness to follow the changes in operations  we have set forth, to stay true to our founding values, and to continue  building a stronger Brandeis for the future.

Sincerely,",boston,Brandeis is going online too.

As a proactive precaution, we are closing the College, both the Charlestown and Chelsea campuses and all classes at satellite and instructional centers will be canceled.  This is effective Thursday, March 12 until Monday, March 16.  
On or before March 16, we will provide an update once we know more information.

My wife says that I am one of the most indecisive people she has ever met. When grocery store cashiers ask me ""paper or plastic bags?"" I get stumped. Yes, I know this is a problem.

We have reached a point in which we are tired of paying my landlord's mortgage. I have been renting in Jamaica Plain for the past 5 years and love the area and want to stay here. These absurdly low 30-year mortgage rates lately have kicked my ass into gear and we've been looking at condos for about 2 months now.

Two condos that just got listed look really good to me and are in our price range. It sounds ridiculous, but I honestly would be swayed by this sub's opinion on which one they would go with.

Long version:

I was laid off from Wayfair on 2/13. I've been job hunting and am collecting unemployment in the meantime. I received notice I had to attend a [RESEA](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/reemployment-services-and-eligibility-assessment-resea) by 3/20, so I signed up for the first available one. They cancelled it morning of. I was given the option to go today or next week.

I've been emailing the program and called the program director this morning to see if I can attend remotely. He stated I had to attend in person and suggested I wear a mask. He said I'd be in a room with 20-30 people. I live in Central so I would have to go to the Alewife or downtown office. I would also have to take the T to get there.

I have severe asthma, I've already had pneumonia 5 times in my life and I'm only 30. I'm considered high risk for the normal viruses; I've been hospitalized in the past for severe flu and strep infections. For me to attend this seminar is person seems very unwise.

Given the state of emergency in our state I don't understand how this is still required to be done in person. Even my onsite interviews have been switching to remote. I've reached out to the program director, our governor, my state rep, and my senator. So far only the senators office was interested.

I'm not against fulfilling this program but I don't want to risk my health for it. Is there anyone else I can bring this up to?",boston,State gov requires I attend an in person seminar within the next week.

A family member took an international trip and came back two weeks ago. Over the last week, she has gotten incredibly sick‚Äînot to the point of hospitalization, but she has a high fever, bad cough, and some pain when breathing. We called around to local hospitals to see what to do, and the general consensus was to call the Department of Public Health to find out how to get tested. Before she had symptoms, she came in contact with a LOT of people. Immunocompromised family, the general public that she works with, infants. She feels absolutely terrible about the possibility that she may have it and could have gotten people inadvertently sick.

So we called the DPH. Apparently they are not testing unless you have come back from an international trip from a high-risk area, are hospitalized with it, or have direct contact with a confirmed case. So even if it‚Äôs highly suspected, they told me they are not testing. She‚Äôs voluntarily self-quarantining but that‚Äôs not even mandatory because she hasn‚Äôt been tested. She‚Äôs reached out to people she knows that she‚Äôs been in contact with just to alert them, but because she can‚Äôt get tested, some of them aren‚Äôt self-quarantining because it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed.

Earlier today you received a message announcing the MFA‚Äôs intent to remain open while we closely monitor the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. Due to the rapidly changing situation, the Museum has now decided to close tonight, March 12, at 6 pm and remain closed for up to 30 days. During this time, all Museum events are cancelled or postponed. This decision was made in consultation with other Boston-area museums and sister institutions across the US as a response to ensure the health and safety of our staff and volunteers, visitors, and community.

Given the evolving nature of the outbreak, we will carefully reassess the situation in the coming weeks and share updates as they become available. Please continue to check our website for new information. We appreciate your support and look forward to reopening when it is safe for the public, staff, and volunteers.

With this in mind, we are reaching out because we recently learned that two individuals who were part of a small group that visited select areas of our Equinox Sports Club Boston on Thursday, March 5th (8 days ago) between 2-3PM have since tested positive for COVID-19. The individuals were asymptomatic at the time of their visit, but we are notifying you out of an abundance of caution since you visited the club that afternoon.

We have been taking extra steps over the past few weeks to keep our community safe, including disinfecting all club areas with an EPA-approved solution three times each day. We also gave our Equinox Sports Club Boston an additional deep cleaning since being made aware of this occurrence.

As this highly dynamic situation evolves, we will continue monitoring and adapting our approach to serve the best interests of our community. In the meantime, please continue to follow these best practices to help keep yourself and others healthy:
Stay home and contact your health care provider if you feel sick or show symptoms.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Please also refer to the following resources for the latest updates: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

From member of the Stanford hospital board. This is their feedback for now on Corona virus: 

The new Coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days. How can one know if he/she is infected? By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late. Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning. Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection. In critical time, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air. 

Serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases: Everyone should ensure your mouth &amp; throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs. That's very dangerous. 

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - CORONAVIRUS 
1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold 
2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose. 
3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature above around 27 C / 80 F degrees.
4. If someone sneezes with it, it can travel about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 
5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a anti-bacterial soap. 
6. On fabric, it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it. 
7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. 
8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, or touch your nose or mouth unwittingly 
9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice. 
10. Can't emphasis enough - drink plenty of water! 

THE SYMPTOMS 
1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3-4 days 
2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5-6 days further. 
3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. 
4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate medical attention.

Subject: What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic
 
Dear Colleagues, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.
 
The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.
 
Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:
 
1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.
 
2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.
 
3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.
 
4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.
 
5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.
 
6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.
 
7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!
 
What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:
 
1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.
 
       Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.
 
2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.
 
3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.
 
4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.
 
I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.",boston,This was shared with me and it‚Äôs the most informative thing I‚Äôve seen yet.

4171,ThePremiumOrange,1584129201,fi5o4c,COVID-19,"I made a comment about this on a different thread but I felt like it had to be said in a more open forum. Baker and Walsh are not being strict enough with social restrictions. Every single expert is saying we are far too lax about this and the time to act is now, before things get worse, instead of in reaction to things getting worse. That‚Äôs what Baker and Walsh are doing. They are unable to step up and make the tough call for fear the pubic disapproval and how it‚Äôll affect their re-election campaigns down the road. 

The government has a god damn responsibility to its citizens, especially when many of them hang on the govts every word. ‚ÄúOh they said only gatherings of 250+ are bad, so 150 or 100 is okay... the govt has loads of experts at their disposal, why would they only say 250+ if 100 wasn‚Äôt safe?‚Äù  There are tons of people like this out there, who are trusting you to make the call. SO MAKE THE HARD CALL! Stop thinking about your stupid re-elections and how the public might hate you for cancelling their event or inconveniencing their social life for a few weeks. Groups of 20/30 or more should be banned and the rest still discouraged from grouping up unless absolutely necessary. Schools need to be closed (children are the least aware of the severity of what‚Äôs happening and it‚Äôs impossible for one teacher to supervise everyone to make sure they all wash their hands properly... especially young ones). Many kids aren‚Äôt even coming into school despite the lack of closing and teachers are outright not showing up either.  Not to mention schools are an incredibly easy place for the virus to spread among people and then back to those people respective homes all across the state. 

Every expert is saying we need to make social sacrifices and the govt needs to mandate those if there‚Äôs any chance of it happening. You can‚Äôt just tell people to be courteous and careful, not everyone knows to what extent they need to do that (and some don‚Äôt give a damn or think everyone is overreacting and don‚Äôt follow common courtesy). Baker and Walsh need to stop making loose reactionary restrictions and start making strict precautionary ones.

No one in our house is sick, that I'm aware of...No one should have to worry about a required absence from work, especially if they are hourly employees or  don't have benefits. I'd say we can realistically watch 3 kids on top of our own if needed, depending on ages.

4217,oneiljenn,1584149926,fiavft,Coronavirus,"I heard a sad story earlier today about an 80 year old couple in NH waiting outside of a grocery store, but were too timid to go inside. A young woman noticed the couple had been sitting in their car for a while (they were in the car when she went into the store and were still sitting there when she ran out), so she knocked on their window to ask if they needed help.  They went on to explain they needed groceries and some supplies, but were too nervous to go in because of the overwhelming crowds and their health. The woman offered to go grocery shopping for them so they didn't need to enter the store at all and it inspired me to want to do the same.

It's good to take measures and be prepared, it's not good to give into fear and panic.

1. Wipe down phones, tablets, door knobs, light switches, counters, and any other heavily touched surfaces

2. Remove items that you purchase or have delivered to you from their boxes with gloves and dispose of the boxes as soon as possible

3. Wear disposable gloves when you go to the grocery store, on public transit, and in any public areas where you will be touching things that have been touched by others. If you don't have disposable gloves use a pair of winter gloves and wash them

4. Wear a mask if you go out anywhere in public if there's even a remote chance you might be sick to protect others

5. Purchase enough water, food, medications and any other items you think you will need for yourself and your family members for 2-3 weeks. do your best to leave some supplies for others, use your best discretion. Buy only what you think you will need, but definitely get what you think you will need. Purchase items online if possible and if you can wait for them to arrive. 

6. Limit your visits to public places where you will come into contact with others (including stores) to the greatest extent possible. 

7. Try to stay at least 3-5 feet (more if possible) from others in public areas

8. Wash or wipe down reusable grocery bags and throw out any plastic bags you had items in as soon as possible

9. Wash hands as soon as possible if you are touching uncleaned surfaces which includes food packaging and other items handled or touched by others recently. Avoid touching your face as much as possible. 

10. If you run out of disinfecting wipes or don't have any you can mix 1 cup of beach with 1 gallon of water to make a disinfectant. You can also make hand sanitizer if you don't have any by mixing 1/4 cup of aloe Vera gel with 3/4 cup of rubbing alcohol. 

11. If someone around you is coughing or sneezing without covering their mouth move as far away from them as you can. 

12. Take any other measures you feel are necessary to protect your health and your family's health. This includes not going to work or telecommuting if possible, cancelling vacations to some areas, and limiting other activities. 

All of these measures should be taken as much as possible, although if you can't afford or can't find a certain item or can't complete a certain task it's okay. People are going to help each other.

These are just rumors I am hearing from friends with parents who work in the government. If I am breaking any sub rules, please let me know and I will remove this post ASAP.     
I am hearing that Logan will probably shut down on Sunday. I have a friend whose dad works in the CDC who suggested so and she is scrambling out of here tomorrow night. Additionally, I have heard that MIT is offering students $500 each to leave if they have not already, and suggesting to leave at the latest by Sunday.    
I also work for the city of Boston and received an email from Mayor Walsh that city employees are forbidden from interstate and international travel. (I can provide documentation as needed)

As mods, we have been playing this by ear and doing our best to consolidate things as needed. Now that we have had more time to see how things are going, I wanted to lay down some simple posting guidelines for everyone.

#The following types of posts belong in the daily chat threads:

* Anything about working from home.

* Do you think ______ will be canceled?

* Should I still travel to Boston?

Any posts regarding those items will be removed, and people will be told to post them in the daily chat thread.

#Some other reminders:

* Please check if something has already been posted. While we do prefer the post be from a non-paywall site, if there is already a post on the topic from a paywall site, we ask you to place any links to non-paywall sites in that thread.

* Memes are not allowed as posts.

* Petitions and surveys are not allowed.

* This sub is not your personal soapbox. Self posts that really belong as a comment in an existing thread will be removed. 

* Needless hostility and insults are not allowed.There is a fine line between snarky and hostile, stay on the snarky side.

#Fearmongering will not be tolerated.

Please refrain from making posts and comments regarding unsubstantiated rumors, particularly ones regarding larger actions and policy changes related to the handling of COVID-19. There are plenty of subs that allow reckless posts, this is not one of them. Posting such rumors is a bannable offense, and we have added a reporting category for it. Please understand that this community consists of a wide range of people who are all trying to figure out what to do next. Some people have small children, elderly relatives that we take care of, and threads with rampant speculation and wild rumors is just going to add to already existing stress and panic. They do nobody any good. 

When this global pandemic is over, I hope that we can look back at how we as a sub behaved in a positive manner. When people look back at the marathon, they always talk about the false accusations. They never mention the random acts of pizza, and other nice things that people in this sub did. Please try to do your best to help others and use this sub as a place where positive efforts can be started.

Thank you.",boston,r/Boston COVID-19 Posting Guidelines

They claim this is to protect patient privacy, however they have proven it's a subjective policy. When there was a Measles outbreak for example they identified a person's town of residence, workplace, and a complete timeline of their lives including the exact timeframe and date they went to public places. They also publicly identified the very first Covid-19 case in Massachusetts as being a Boston resident. What possible ""patient privacy"" information can one gleam from just saying what town the patient lives in? 

Does anyone else feel like this is putting people at risk and causing more panic? Like, I live in Bristol County for example, and MassDPH just confirmed the first positive case. Now everyone from Mansfield to Fairhaven is freaking out. 

Counties are so useless for geographic descriptors in Massachusetts. Look at places like Middlesex County -- could be Hopkinton, could be Cambridge. HUGE difference.

To our valued customers: 

As we continue to prioritize the safety and wellbeing of our customers and associates and do our very best to meet customers' shopping needs, we want to provide you with a few important updates regarding our store hours and Stop &amp; Shop Delivery &amp; Pickup. 

All Stop &amp; Shop store locations remain open and while we - like all retailers - are experiencing some shortages, we are doing everything possible to get products to our stores and to restock the shelves in every community. We greatly appreciate your patience and understanding as our teams continue to work hard to do so. 

The following are some key updates we‚Äôd like you to know about: 

Updated Store Hours
In order to allow more time for our associates to unload deliveries, stock shelves, and better serve you throughout the day, we are adjusting our hours to 7:30a.m.-8:00p.m. at most stores beginning Monday, March 16, until further notice. (There may be some exceptions. Please visit your local store location for details. New hours will also be posted on our website Monday.) 

Pickup Services Temporarily Suspended 
As a result of unprecedented demand as well as product shortages in some areas, we have temporarily suspended our online pickup service until further notice. Our store associates will instead focus on stocking product and other key priorities that will better meet the needs of all customers at this time. The service will be made available again once product availability increases. 

Delays with Home Delivery 
We recognize that online shoppers may be experiencing delays on our website as well as with our delivery times. This is again due to extremely high demand, and our teams are working incredibly hard to ensure the site is running smoothly so that you can continue to receive orders when you need them. 

Stop &amp; Shop is continuing to maintain high levels of hygiene and sanitation in its stores and online operations. We're also taking additional measures during this time, which include wiping down checkout areas including the belts and pin pads with disinfectant even more frequently. We will continue to follow guidance from the CDC to help keep our customers and associates safe. 

Our deepest thanks for continuing to support us, and we will continue to provide timely updates on our services and hours in the coming weeks",boston,Stop N Shop Adjusting Store Hours (7:30 AM-8 PM) At Most Stores Starting Monday

Lots of trees and houses. It's quite a different feel from Boston city. This place that I found is \~$2k/mo for a 900 sq ft 2-bedroom, which means with a roommate I'd be paying \~$1k.

1) Didn't go on roof. Observed roof/chimney/gutters from ground using binoculars. Weather was not an issue but he doesn't go on roofs with ladders as a universal policy. 

2) Didn't check wall insulation. Explained that even if you take off outlet cover, could be deceiving because some homes have insulation around outlets (to prevent drafts) but it's not a good indicator of wall insulation in general. How common is use of thermal imaging camera to check insulation? 

3) Sewer line had replacement clean out plug (indicating past issues with sewer line). My understanding is that scoping the lateral to inspect sewer line typically requires plumber. Even feasible if waiving contingency given timing?

There shouldn't have been lines, but it's incredibly easy to look at a situation from the outside and cast judgment. 


These people have families. They have bills to pay. With the exception of one bar, they did absolutely nothing wrong legally. The same people complaining about the lack of ""social distancing"" are the very same ones snapping pictures of shoulder to shoulder crowds in grocery stores every morning. But for some reason those lines and crowds are OK? 


The general public seems so massively uninformed and prepared to buy into every rumor they hear that they ate this article up without a second thought and it's incredibly sad and unfortunate that these businesses, and the people who rely on them to make a living, are now out of work today after already seeing a massive downturn in income over the last couple weeks.",boston,About That CBS Article

The disgusting conditions at the SCHOOL should require a shutdown. This is a dental SCHOOL, not a medical facility. These dentists are NOT equipped to handle this. The tents they have put up outside the facility are a joke and they're exposing faculty, staff, students, and residents to the virus needlessly. This is nothing more than a cash-grab by dental SCHOOL administrators taking advantage of the crisis because Harvard and Tufts have ceased operations in order to protect students, faculty, and staff.

To make things worse, they don't plan on cancelling a senior citizen discount sale tomorrow. Due to our location the elderly have very easy access to the store and we will definitely have way more than 25 people in the building. The majority of them are going to be 55+

Infectious diseases like Corona depend on people to transfer it to each other in order to survive. It‚Äôs especially contagious because people can be carriers while still asymptomatic, and some infected never show symptoms. And if a person lives a normal, social lifestyle while they have the bug, they will spread it far and wide, and then those people will spread it to more people, and...you get the idea.

Right now we can stop the spread before it gets started with some simple methods, like social distancing (keep a minimum of 6 feet from other people), eschewing social locations like bars, restaurants, and gyms, plus if possible work from home.

Good luck everyone. Stay healthy!",boston,A few words about stemming Covid-19

BOSTON -- Utilities are giving energy consumers a break on their outstanding electric and natural gas bills in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

National Grid over the weekend told customers it is suspending bill-related collections, and will not shut off service due to non-payment, until the end of April.

""We recognize that certain customers may experience financial difficulty as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, whether they or a family member fall ill, are required to quarantine, or because their income is otherwise affected,"" the company said. ""We hope to alleviate our affected customers‚Äô concerns about their electricity and gas service during this time.""

National Grid provides electric service to about 1.2 million customers and gas to about 830,000 in Massachusetts, including tens of thousands North of Boston.

Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, which serves about 330,000 gas customers in the state, is also giving ratepayers a break on outstanding bills. The company told customers over the weekend that it is suspending late payment charges until May 1 and offering flexible payment plans for those who impacted by the virus outbreak.

Eversource Energy, which serves about 1.4 million customers in the state, is also pledging to lessen the financial hardships on customers affected by work disruptions.

In a statement, Eversource spokesman Reid Lamberty said the company is ""voluntarily suspending residential customer disconnections indefinitely and continue(s) working with business customers who contact us about possible adjustments to their monthly bill.""

""We've been closely monitoring COVID-19 and working to proactively address the concerns of our employees and customers, while ensuring that we continue to provide the safe, reliable gas and electric service that customers need,"" Lamberty said.

All of the companies said regular billing for electric and gas service will continue, but customers won't be shut off for not paying.

Utility workers who visit a home or business to respond to a service request will be asking if the people inside are sick or have traveled to infected regions. The companies are asking customers who are quarantined or sick who request service or report a natural gas leak or other emergency, to advise them about the conditions inside the household.

""We do not anticipate any service disruption to our customers at this time,"" National Grid said in its statement. ""We have implemented additional measures that will allow us to safely continue providing essential services to you.""

While the companies said the actions are voluntary, they've been under pressure to stop bill collections under an emergency declaration signed last week by Gov. Charlie Baker.

The state Department of Public Utilities already prohibits utilities from disconnecting residential electric and natural gas service from Nov. 15 to March 15. The agency sent letters to utility executives last week explaining that the moratorium should remain in place until Baker's emergency declaration is lifted.

In his letter, DPU chairman Matthew Nelson noted the need to remind consumers of the ""importance of making payments during the moratorium to avoid the accumulation of large arrearages.""

DPU also asked utilities to take ""all reasonable steps"" to allow payment accommodations ""before any shutoffs to commercial or industrial customers for non-payment"" of their bills.

Why can't we repave the roads during this time?

So people were there, but it was not crazy busy. There were announcements every five minutes or so giving an update on latest status - saying the store has not plans to close, normal operating hours, shop to your needs not to excess, limit of 4 for many items including milk, TP, etc. They were also regularly giving updates on when certain shipments (such as paper goods) were coming in. A truck with TP and paper towels came in while I'm halfway through shopping - people were grabbing it from the pallets faster than clerks could stock the shelves. The PA systems kept repeating limit of 4 for TP will be enforced at checkout. Later on at checkout I saw two shoppers have TP or paper towels removed from their order because they were over the limit of 4. Hand sanitizer was being distributed to cashiers/baggers every few minutes.

As far as stock of goods - milk was low, as I said paper goods were coming in but getting grabbed litteraly as soon as they came in, fresh meats were pretty much all sold out, soap was gone, pasta and pasta sauce nearly all gone, frozen veggies all gone, produce section was ok overall. Checkout line was not bad (10 minute wait). The Market Basket employees looked stressed and overworked but also very professional and hard working.

I've been there. I've thrown underwear away in public bathrooms. I think we can all be honest and say that we've trusted a fart that let us down. 

But in all seriousness, asshole hygiene is important. And I don't think we need to buy $400 of shitpaper to maintain a base level of sanitary comfort. We are Americans. We can poo in the loo and walk away cholera free (well SF idfk you do your thing).

The supply lines will not be cut off. Essential personnel will still be able to work and that includes the dudes that make the shitpaper, the dudes that package and ship the shitpaper, the dudes that sell the shitpaper, etc. 

HOWEVER, I would like you to take a moment to consider-- if not now then when they come back in stock because smart people bought them all-- purchasing a bidet.

For whatever reason these things never took off in the US. We like to think we are so much cleaner than other countries because we don't shit in the street or hack and spit everywhere. But our asses are dirty. And mass buying TP is stupid.

There are simple, &lt;$100 devices that exist and are extremely easy to install with just a single wrench (my bidet came with plastic wrenches but I used my own adjustable wrench). They can be had on amazon or other retailers but for some reason places like Home Depot and Lowes don't seem to stock them or advertise them well. 

Buy. A. Fucking. Bidet.

It will change the way you shit. 

It will reduce the amount of toilet paper you use. 

It feels nice.

If we get anything out of this crazy shit, I hope for two things:

1. That we mature as a nation and start wearing masks when we are sick to prevent the transmission of illness

2. We buy and install Japanese style toilets to reduce the amount of shitpaper we need.",boston,Let no ass go uniwiped

The landlord has refused to disclose which building the resident resides and has not expressed any intention to investigate whether this resident had used the leasing office or mail boxes within the last two weeks.

My landlord lives in Texas (moved there in the last year....didn't tell me or give me new address, etc.) and is a jerk about following MA housing code laws. I let several (fairly major) things go in the first year because I wanted to renew my lease for this year. But during this year I (knowing that I was not renewing) I made him fix things. When I say ""made him"" basically sent him the proper documentation on how heat was not up code and there was a ceiling leak issue right over my bed that they didn't fix for 9 months and finally threatened to without rent. So we don't have the best relationship although I have always just asked him to follow MA laws. My lease ends at the end of May and right now he has last month (May) and security deposit. I am thinking of emailing the landlord and saying use the security deposit for April rent and you already have May's rent. I know it's not technically ""legal"", but with everything going on and courts basically being closed, I don't want to end up in a situation where this guy doesn't return my security deposit and I have to take him to court.

tl;dr: I need to find a way to get 2 facemasks that I have in Boston to my grandparents in Florida. PM me if willing/able to help!

My grandparents are flying back from Florida to Boston on Saturday. We delayed their flight for a week so that the N95 facemasks from cambridge mask co that we ordered for them could arrive at their place on time, after multiple delays. I honestly thought I was overpreparing and ordered them over a month ago, on amazon prime with 2 day shipping...also ordered 2 for myself and spouse. We recieved ours several days ago, their shipment however has now been indefinitely delayed...the irony is not lost on me. 

My grandfather, whom I love dearly is extremely frail (though too proud and brave to admit it) and would likely not survive if he where to fall ill. Staying there is a non-option, there is no family in the state. And even if that was the safest option (though rates of infection and Florida's response lead me to believe otherwise) the stubborn man would absolutely refuse, and fly home regardless. 

THIS IS WHERE YOUR HELP COMES IN! Please PM me if flying tomorrow and willing to help. 

I am hoping to find someone willing to deliver the facemasks we received, located in boston to my grandparents in florida so that they can safely fly home on Saturday. If you happen to be flying from Logan to Ft.lauderdale tomorrow and wouldn't mind making a pitstop in Hollywood, I would be willing to reimburse any reasonably requested price for helping! 

PS am willing to meet at Logan tomorrow at any time and place that is convenient for you. I will open the facemask containers and show you the masks (so no fears of anything sketchy) and will then box them up. They live in a gated apartment building. Package can be dropped off at front desk and they will make sure my grandparents receive it.

Dear Members of the Harvard Community,
¬†
Since the announcement last week that we would move to online instruction and ask students to leave campus, one of the questions I have been asked most frequently is, ‚ÄúWhat about commencement?‚Äù
¬†
I love commencement. I love seeing our community come together to celebrate the academic accomplishments of our remarkable students. I love seeing their families brimming with pride as they participate in a ceremony that is almost as old as the University itself. I love watching members of our reunion classes enjoy one another‚Äôs company in spaces old and new, reminding all of us of the power of what Emerson called ‚Äúthe long winding train‚Äù of Harvard graduates.
¬†
So it is with an especially heavy heart that I write to inform you that our 369th Commencement Exercises, which would have taken place on Thursday, May 28, must be postponed. Given the advice we are receiving from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other public health officials, and our own faculty, who are among the world‚Äôs leaders in infectious disease, epidemiology, and virology, it is difficult to imagine how we could safely hold such a large gathering this spring. We recognize that people need to start making plans soon, so we thought it best to provide guidance now.¬†
¬†
No virtual gathering can possibly match the splendor of our usual festivities, but we will come together online on Thursday, May 28, to award degrees so that everyone will graduate as expected. Each School at Harvard will also host its own special online event and afterwards deliver diplomas through the mail. We plan to host an in-person celebration sometime later, once we know it is safe to bring people together again. By then, we will be eager not just to celebrate our graduating students, but also to recognize and acknowledge the sacrifices that so many have made to ensure the well-being of our community. We intend for this ceremony to have all of the pomp, circumstance, and tradition that is typical of a Harvard commencement‚Äîwith as many of the traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement as possible.
¬†
While commencement is a happy occasion for all of us, it has special meaning to the members of the Harvard College Class of 2020. We recognize that delaying the ceremony may impose new burdens on some of our undergraduates. We will endeavor in our planning to enable as many students as possible to return to campus to be awarded their first degrees in the company of their friends and classmates.¬†We are also exploring opportunities to bring reunion classes together in the future. At this point, we don‚Äôt know when, but we will be in touch as soon as we have information to share.¬†
¬†
I wish we could give a firm date for this celebration now, but I ask for your patience. Everything about this year seems to be turning out unusual. When we do hold commencement for the Harvard Class of 2020, I sincerely hope it will also be unusual, but only because it will be among the most joyous commencements in the history of the University.
¬†
Sincerely,
Larry

They also do not have enough negative pressures rooms to accommodate these patients, thus putting the entire medical staff at risk. The increase of patients are expected to increase rapidly very soon. 

If we can‚Äôt protect the people who treat and care those infected then this pandemic is going to get even worse. 

If you or anyone in an industry (construction, maintenance, etc) has masks and gowns that can be donated, please do! The state and the hospital are failing to protect those on the front line. 

Also if anyone knows who we can write to to push get our nurses with the proper PPE please let me know. We all need to help out.",boston,Our Nurses and Medical Staff Need Help

5117,QuirkySquirrelHumper,1584843855,fms5za,COVID-19,"I've worked my regular schedule with my regular days off and I've seen the traffic diminish. My commute is much shorter and I skip getting my morning and afternoon coffee. During the day I skip my lunch to avoid the crowd in the cafeteria and I pass on the coffee truck that shows up like clockwork. My family and friends work from home, for the most part. My kids are out of school. I go to work every day, and I don't like it more than usual. 

I'm not a health care professional or a first responder. I'm not a politician or in the military. I am a public servant, and I am classified as an essential employee. 

I wake up every day and drive into work and on the way in I think of all the normal hazards I deal with. There are plenty already. My normal job is unusually dangerous and I don't really want to talk about what I do,  so I'm not going to. But, regardless of the dangers, I go in every day and earn my pay and help the Commonwealth function. I take pride in what I do and so do my coworkers. Most public servants take great pride in what they do (believe it or not).

Lately, especially over the past few weeks, I've had a new hazard to deal with. That hazard is coronavirus. Obviously I'm not the only person coping with the virus, and I really appreciate all the other people that go to work every day to keep our society functioning despite the eminent health risks this new virus presents to us all. 

I'd love to stay home.. I'd love to crawl under a rock and stay there for a year.. But, I don't have that option. I have the obligation and responsibility of being an essential employee.

If you're reading this and you're staying home, thank you. If you're an employer whose already sent their employees home, thank you. If you don't have the option of staying home, thank you. But if you're still working, making people work, or out of your house because you have the day off, please reconsider your choices. I know there are nonessential businesses making their employees work and people still socializing despite the governor's recommendation. I know that the coffee shops don't need to be open, offices should be closed, and people should be home.

Like I said, I don't really have the choice. There aren't many people that could do my job and, unfortunately for me, people depend on what I do. I don't want to get sick, I don't want to feel like my lungs are full of glass, I don't want to suffocate in a hospital bed alone and away from my family, and I don't want to be the reason my family suffers those fates because I brought a silent killer into our home.

If you can stay home, please do. There are plenty of ways to die in this life. Don't be the reason I do.  Don't be the person who kills their neighbor. Stay home, because some of us can't.",boston,"Please stay home if you can, because I can't"

I can‚Äôt afford to eat out for every meal. If anyone has suggestions for a grocery store that is relatively well stocked please let me know (I have a car, don‚Äôt mind driving).

5242,OnetoOneClean,1584975744,fnldp5,Housing/Real Estate,"I am looking to have a discussion about the current rent situation in the Boston area. I am curious what people suggest and looking for some insight as I navigate the next few months.

My lease is up on May 31st and the landlord is trying to get me to sign a lease now. They want to increase my rent from $2,300 to $2,800 a month. I am not going to do that- nor do I have any idea if I will even be able to move. 

The people living on the 2nd floor both got laid off last week and are also paying 2300 but I doubt they will be able to cover the rent on the 1st. They all but told me they are not going to pay rent this month and would likely be moving home to New Hampshire as soon as they can.

I am not advocating screwing my landlord I fully intend to pay him what I owe him until May 31st. After that I am going to offer him $1,300 a month for a year lease on the grounds that unemployment is about to be sky high and I suspect the rental market is going to crash as a result of COVID-19. I might even be offering to over pay him at $1,300 a month given the current situation.

*What does everyone see in their crystal ball?* Where should I estimate rent as a percentage of what it currently is? I am fully aware that they might not cover their mortgage but that is their fault. You shouldn't have bought a second home or a rental home if you couldn't afford it outright. They are the ones that took the risk to reap the rewards and now they have to accept the loss in my opinion. 

If they tell me no I already changed all the security codes on my doors, I do not intend to let them enter my apartment under any circumstance to show my unit in the event that  they do not agree to my offer on April 1st. Also given the current situation on June 1st if I cannot move due to the virus and they reject my offer I will only pay what my offer is until this is all over. 

I know there are some landlords on this form and while I feel for you tough shit you contributed to the housing crisis and you should have saved some of these ridiculous rents you were all charging.

 * What % of my current rent should I offer (do not suggest keeping it the same or  raising it-- It is certainly going WAY WAY down.

 * Is there any wording that I should suggest be in a lease agreement that might be mutually beneficial in the event I do sign an agreement?

 * Is anyone else going to refuse to allow strangers into their units while the virus is a thing?",boston,Rent -- What should it be now and what to do?

I‚Äôm in desperate need to live alone, and I‚Äôd like to take the step to find a studio apartment. Specific questions:

1) How do I find a studio apartment? Where do I look? Do I just find apartment buildings and call the brokers?
2) How much does a studio typically cost per month in  ... I don‚Äôt know ... Quincy? Cheapest places for studios that are on the red line. Maybe Alewife but I expect that to be pricier. (I work in Cambridge). 
3) What do I need to secure this type of lease? Proof of income (what is the threshold to be successful)?

Big Dan 1990-2020

*Boston****:*** Metaphorically speaking, the first deaths that occurred in Boston that were attributed to the Coronavirus were the Chinese restaurants. As the virus pulsed through China and across the headlines, people simply stopped going out for Chinese food. The calculation, tinged with racism and ignorance was easy to make and generally unspoken. Everyone was just so woke now, so filled with *Instagram-*formulated ideas on how to behave (and how to look while you behaved) that the consensus arose quietly. The hive-mind buzzed gently, like a muted phone and then a decision was reached. Soon afterwards, one by one, the restaurants closed.

Later, as the virus morphed and waffled through different demographics, base and uninformed crowd-sourced wisdom like this would seem quaint and almost deliberately innocent. It would be a small thing, a simple paragraph in a larger recollection of what happened. Indeed, it would soon be forgotten because not long afterward, all the restaurants and bars in the city would be closed. 

This, of course, after a rowdy (virus spreading) surge of self-confidence that saw the bars fill with shorthaired banking and finance bros who had been sent out into the world and been asked to work from home. They crashed the bars like the waves generated from a storm. Freed of their lanyards and corporate IDs, they mutated into drunken mobs that migrated across the city in Ubers followed by their lithe, short-skirted cohort of equally vapid girlfriends. Groups met in the South End, then torpedoed under the highway wastelands to Southie where they fought each other and puked on the hoods of cars before returning to their well-appointed cubby holes that smelled of dried semen, weed, and unwashed gym clothes. At midnight, almost on cue, after many drinks, all the young women started smoking cigarettes. Yellow boxes of American Spirits emerged from tiny purses and were passed around until everyone had one. It felt so good. 

To be fair, it wasn‚Äôt just one segment of the population that let loose. College students ran amok as well. Blessed by youth and ignorance, they too, busted out with wild house parties, college drinking dramas, and heated, albeit stunningly quick hook-ups. Stumbling clusters of kids roamed neighborhoods like Alston and Harvard Square, mainly behaving themselves but totally incoherent. In Cambridge, everyone, it seemed, ended up standing outside of Clover at 3 am. baptized by tahini sauce stains and the early rumblings in their guts caused by the slop that Clover served. This was hollowed ground, stood upon by generations of club-goers and drunks. In the late 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs every punk band in the universe roared through the Middle East and TT the Bears. Further up Mass. Ave. a youthfully exuberant Bruce Springsteen sweated it up at the Harvard Square Theatre, and so did the Clash. Now, it was just asymptomatic kids, nice kids, spreading the virus like crop dusting mutants.

Then the children started dying. At first it was thought that the virus didn‚Äôt infect children and most of the collected data supported the notion. In neighborhoods around the city, high-end strollers were abandoned curbside, often stuffed with plastic bags filled with children‚Äôs clothes and toys. Sobbing could be heard echoing out the windows of elegant brownstones and makeshift graves were dug in parks and even backyards. 

Women, it was mostly women, devastated and distraught, threw themselves off of buildings and parking garages. They often left their homes without saying anything to their equally distressed husbands, wives, boyfriends, or girlfriends. They simply left, trudging toward the heights of the closest unlocked building. High above them, Air Force One circled through the air corridors that once served Logan Airport. No one had seen the President in weeks and he was presumed dead. The rumors were that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were aboard the plane with their children. No one knew for sure.

On the straight run of Boylston St., where the Marathon finished, teenagers were racing fire trucks, busses, and police cars up the street from Mass Ave. to the Common. Then returning to the starting line via Newbury St. and doing it again. The exhaust of the busses and fire trucks covered up the stench of the Green Line burial ground, where thousands of people had been entombed in the stations and tunnels. The burial was the last official act of the city of Boston before it went dark. A local wit on the Cambridge City Council prevented the same thing from happening in the stations and tunnels of the Red Line by complaining that over time, commuters had suffered enough in those wretched tunnels and to condemn someone to eternity there was just unfair. Instead the dead were trucked to mile wide pit that was dug on the Cambridge Municipal Golf Course where a mass burial was officiated over by the still energetic (and apparently healthy) Elizabeth Warren. 

By all accounts, and these were now anecdotal, doctors, nurses and health care professionals had performed admirably. They had stayed on, caring for patients with a dwindling supply of equipment and medicine until it became impossible to carry on. The level of professionalism they exhibited was unimpeachable. Mass General was the epicenter of this effort until a Saudi Prince, seeking special care for his children, helicopter crashed into the main building while trying to land on the heliport. 

The ensuing fire engulfed the building quickly. Things might have ended differently but like during Katrina, Boston Police and Fire Department employees had long since stopped coming to work. Their heroism was limited to forming armed militias in Roslindale and West Roxbuxy and drinking looted beer and eating potato chips at checkpoints that the virus simply ignored. 

There were rumors that the Chinese Navy with attached troop transports was seen off the coast of Provincetown. It was like that Pixies album where Kim Deal speaks between songs, there were rumors that Trump was in Russia, thee were rumors that this or that pop star was dead. There were rumors that monkeys had overrun entire cities in Thailand. There were rumors‚Ä¶ 

On the now sporadic, remnant Internet, a gossip site had sprung up called ‚Äú*The Radish!‚Äù* It trafficked in stories that on their face were absurd but the writing was clever and the stories quickly spread, like their viral cousin, the Corona Virus. There were rumors that the site was run by Harvard students operating out of the Hasty Pudding Building in Harvard Square. Now that everything, including life itself, was canceled, *The Radish!* wondered aloud: Has Cancel Culture Gone Too Far? Seemingly, it had.

Big Dan 1990-2020 woke up with a headache. It wasn‚Äôt because he was sick, yet, but rather because he‚Äôd slept on a cot and somehow twisted his neck while sleeping. He walked across his studio and went to the window. Trash migrated up and down the street as the wind blew back and forth. Looking down the street, he could see the Cathedral on Washington St. Someone had climbed the spire and attached a big black pirate flag on top of it. The Skull and Bones slapped in the morning breeze above what seemed like a deserted neighborhood. Foodies, the neighborhood grocery store had been closed for weeks as had Southern Proper, a restaurant a block away that had the good sense to fold before the virus hit. Inside Foodies, people from the projects across the street had cleared the shelves out and helped Mrs. Baker, a pediatric nurse who worked at Boston Medical Center, set up an ad-hoc nursery and clinic in the store. Over two long days, people had wheeled small children and babies down Harrison Ave. to the former grocery store. They also moved, at Mrs. Baker‚Äôs direction, any equipment or supplies that she thought could be used. 

Big Dan 1990-2020 often saw Mrs. Baker striding purposefully across the wide streets followed by several women that assisted her and several men carrying assault rifles. Seeing groups like this was unusual in other parts of the city but because of bank red-lining, general segregationist policies, and the isolation of the black and brown communities in Boston, many people in the projects didn‚Äôt have the virus. They were, so to speak, social-distanced before it became an actual thing, unless of course, you were dealing with a cop or someone working retail. But that was yesterday and today is a bitch.

Today, Big Dan 1990-2020 was heading over to the food pantry, also run by Mrs. Baker and her associates. It was set up each morning in the playground across from the Cathedral. The pantry was supplied by a group of local kids that called themselves Da Pony Xpress. They had a fleet of U Haul vans that they used to go out and find anything that Mrs. Baker might need or find useful. The rules were simple; never take anything from anyone. Only take what you find first and then, take all of it. The kids were industrious and hard working. They filled the vans almost every day, first with the smoke from dispensary blunts that they had liberated by the thousands, and then with anything that they could find. Big Dan 1990-2020 had become a regular on the morning line and his presence passed without comment or hard looks. In return he brought along anything that he scavenged and thought that people might find useful. 

Just before things reached the tipping point, a group of Medford cops went on a robbery spree. This is back when the supermarkets were printing money before the well went dry. Who is to say what is brazen anymore, but in a brazenly stupid act, using police cars and not bothering to hide their faces, they robbed an armored car at the Somerville Market Basket. Several people were killed and wounded and for a shitty second this was news. If any of this was funny, you‚Äôd have to ask yourself, how did they manage to even escape the crowded Market Basket parking lot?

The robbery reminded long-time observers of when, in simpler times, Larry Bird was holding court at the Scotch &amp; Sirloin on North Washington St. in the North End, trying his best to get laid and knuckle-headed crews from Charlestown roamed the city looking for that big, final score, whether it was a bank job or armored car robbery. During one bloody fiasco, a wounded Charleston lad fell out of a getaway car and was apprehended by the police. They asked him what crew he was with and he responded that he‚Äôd like to help, he really would, but everyone was wearing masks during the robbery and he couldn‚Äôt identify any of them. Even the cops laughed.

Mrs. Baker told people, people who had grinded all their lives to pay their bills, sometimes working two or three jobs while handing kids off to relatives that money wasn‚Äôt shit anymore. It wasn‚Äôt part of the equation. It no longer mattered what was in your pocket. There was a bigger, more thoughtful aspect to her approach but she never dumped it over people‚Äôs heads. It was the daily immersion of watching her work and organize, that slowly won people over. That Mrs. Baker was a former world-class sprinter back when she was a teenager in Jamaica and that she still maintained the muscled armature of a professional athlete didn‚Äôt hurt either. Even in her early 60s, Mrs. Baker stilled look like she could run past it all. 

Big Dan 1990-2020 passed the time on line thinking about what he‚Äôd do with the rest of his day. His former life as an artist had come apart in stages. First people stopped going to galleries and museums, then shows were canceled. Then the galleries and museums closed. He‚Äôs lost track of what happened next and in the grand scheme of things it didn‚Äôt matter. The septic art world, like everything else had been washed away. At the very least, he‚Äôd been poor and living off the grid to start with. The disruption in comfort and routine wasn‚Äôt an issue. In fact, things didn‚Äôt feel that different at all. 

He‚Äôd found a way in to the library on Boylston St. and he go once a day, filling his knapsack with books. Dan 1990-2020 was an avid reader and by now his studio was overflowing with books. It was one way to pass the time. Luckily, the electricity was still on in his building, meaning the evenings were pleasant enough. He could read, or perhaps make work, but that was harder because art existed in the context of other things; things that were present even if they were unrelated. Now there wasn‚Äôt much to hang your hat on. Ideas were slipperier, harder to nail down. And of course, there was the bigger question, why bother? 

The city he‚Äôd lived in since college was gone, not gone, totally, but gone. The people he knew (he didn‚Äôt really have friends) were dead or moved out into the countryside around the city. The reality was he actually didn‚Äôt know what was next but that uncertainty provided an odd sort of contentment. One night, after spending the time drinking beer, he took a pencil and writing directly on the wall of his studio he made a list of sorts:

*Maybe I could learn to drive now*

*Maybe I could meet a girl from the projects*

*Why me*

*Don‚Äôt be selfish*

*Is Obama alive???*

*What about fishing*

*Organize my books*

*Find more art supplies*

*Talk more*

*Show an interest in people*

*Everything isn‚Äôt transactional*

*Yes it is*

This was the beginning of May, winter was over and what passed for spring, which wasn‚Äôt much different than winter finally collapsed into warm temperatures and sun-filled skies. The days were longer and Dan 1990-2020 was often out on his bike exploring the city. These excursions, with deliberate, familiar routes, allowed him to maintain a sense of what was happening in the city and the cities surrounding Boston. The esplanade was clear of people and using the bike path he could roam across the river into Cambridge and Somerville. From the midpoint of the Longfellow Bridge, he could look back at the burned scar of land stretching from the Liberty Hotel, past the buildings that comprised Mass General Hospital, and even further down Cambridge St. All the buildings were burned out from the fires that had raged for at least two weeks. Behind it all, Beacon Hill literally rose from the ashes. 

On the Cambridge side of the river, in Kendall Square, was where the pandemic was unleashed on Boston. It was the epicenter of infection. It was also the epicenter of the bio-medical, biotech, and pharmaceutical industries in the region. Before the virus hit, it was an area under constant construction, with developers and MIT racing to fill every square inch of unoccupied ground with office towers, housing, and street-facing retail spaces. Like the Seaport, it never seemed to jell into what anyone might consider a neighborhood. The buildings were bland and the people who worked down there blander still. At night, except for a few bars, the area emptied out.

Dan 1990-2020 liked going to Aceituna, with its three vertical spits of meats that turned slowly as long lines of customers snaked around the restaurant at lunch- time. Despite all the people there, the lines moved quickly and the people who worked there expedited things as fast as possible. There was in warmer weather, tables set up outside, and sometimes, wild turkeys joined the crowds. It wasn‚Äôt a bad spot to have lunch, and the spicy chicken sandwich, wrapped in pita bread was among the best in the city.

Now, of course, there was nothing. Dig Dan 1990-2020 sailed down off the bridge and turned onto a side street that opened up to a large plaza (read: undeveloped land). He noticed a singe kayak lying on its side, blowing around like a large water bottle. The hard plastic grated across the concrete making a ripping sound. This was a place he associated with summer, a place to come off the river path and take a break and have something to eat. What it was now was hard to explain. 

He biked over the plaza and stopped in front of Aceituna. Everything looked normal except for the fact that no one was around. He could see the vertical spits in the restaurant were still there behind the counter. Outside, the ice rink that they put up in the winter was still there because the virus had interrupted the seasonal changeover to a seating area. He pulled a book from his backpack and settled down on the warm ground, with his head resting on the bicycle seat and began to read:

*‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThis was the beginning of May, yet the weather was temperate, variable, and cool enough, and people had still some hopes. That which encouraged them was that the city was healthy: the whole ninety-seven parishes buried but fifty-four, and we began to hope that, as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town, it might go no farther; and the rather, because the next week, which was from the 9th of May to the 16th, there died but three, of which not one within the whole city or liberties; and St Andrew‚Äôs buried but fifteen, which was very low. ‚ÄòTis true St Giles‚Äôs buried two-and-thirty, but still, as there was but one of the plague, people began to be easy. The whole bill also was very low, for the week before the bill was but 347, and the week above mentioned but 343. We continued in these hopes for a few days, but it was but for a few, for the people were no more to be deceived thus; they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way, and that many died of it every day. So that now all our extenuations abated, and it was no more to be concealed; nay, it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement‚Ä¶.*

The book, without a cover, was written by Daniel Defoe, it was a chronicle of the plague years in London. Academics debated many things about the book but little of the factual information Defoe provided was ever really disputed. Many thought the book was based on notes that Defoe‚Äôs uncle kept, others wondered if were merely a historical novel (but perhaps, the first of its kind). Big Dan 1990-2020 liked it because he could read it chronologically, matching month by month, the spread and thrust of death and utter disruption that he witnessed and mostly, hid from.

Ironically, books like this were slightly in vogue before things really changed. But they were read as stories that featured other people suffering and dying. The thought never crossed anyone‚Äôs mind how real they were and how accurately they echoed across time. 

Scam artists and evangelical pastors hawked cures, politicians called the virus a hoax before dying in a pink foamy mist. The President was fully lost, railing against his opponents on Twitter, stumbling through press briefings, and privately, for hours and hours, just sitting and cursing at the television. Soon, he just disappeared, the tweets stopped, and the White House claimed he was busy managing the crisis. The country sighed in relief but by then it was too late. Too much time had been wasted. Despite the ancient, hard-won wisdom, that stretched back to the very beginning of human existence that if there is a place where people are sick, don‚Äôt go there and if you are all ready there, don‚Äôt leave; people just continued to do what they normally did. And the virus spread and mutated, just as viruses normally do.

We got news that there will finally be a charter flight taking Ecuadorians back for $600 each (baggage included), but we're not sure when that will happen and what one can do if they can't afford it. She's staying with me, but some people are stuck in hotels in New York, some are now sleeping in churches, etc. Basically people came with a vacation budget and are now having to indefinitely sustain living in the U.S., pay $600 to return home, and are at risk of paying medical bills without insurance. It doesn't end there. After going back, they have to pay for the mandatory quarantine ""hotel"" (even though it's rumored to be at a military base, so the government owns it) and food during that time.

""If you have a few minutes, I put together (in one take, by myself üò¨, so forgive the raw factor) a short video with a status update on Boloco. As I say in the video, we've left it all on the field. We've done everything we know how to keep our restaurants open, our people with paychecks, our customers safe and well-fed. Without a strong surge of support today, and in every day that follows, we'll need to follow the path of many other restaurants and close all but 1 (possibly 2) restaurant and pause 90% of our operations with uncertainty as to if or when we can re-open. We are prepared for that, and at peace with it, but I thought it couldn't hurt (maybe it will!) to share a personal message, just in case it makes a difference.

More importantly, at least for today, we are delivering food üöó all over Greater Boston and the Upper Valley in NH/VT for FREE. The 3rd party delivery companies have dropped delivery fees to customers, as well, so if you have a favorite, feel free to use them.

As many of you also know, last week we dropped prices to $5 focusing on a significantly streamlined menu focused on ""Feeding the Frontline"" featuring our limited-time-only Warrior One Burrito &amp; Bowl.Ôªø

So you can either order direct from us at our website, by calling us direct at the number below, or through your favorite 3rd party delivery company.

Big Dan 1990-2020

*Boston****:*** Metaphorically speaking, the first deaths that occurred in Boston that were attributed to the Coronavirus were the Chinese restaurants. As the virus pulsed through China and across the headlines, people simply stopped going out for Chinese food. The calculation, tinged with racism and ignorance was easy to make and generally unspoken. Everyone was just so woke now, so filled with *Instagram-*formulated ideas on how to behave (and how to look while you behaved) that the consensus arose quietly. The hive-mind buzzed gently, like a muted phone and then a decision was reached. Soon afterwards, one by one, the restaurants closed.

Later, as the virus morphed and waffled through different demographics, base and uninformed crowd-sourced wisdom like this would seem quaint and almost deliberately innocent. It would be a small thing, a simple paragraph in a larger recollection of what happened. Indeed, it would soon be forgotten because not long afterward, all the restaurants and bars in the city would be closed. 

This, of course, after a rowdy (virus spreading) surge of self-confidence that saw the bars fill with shorthaired banking and finance bros who had been sent out into the world and been asked to work from home. They crashed the bars like the waves generated from a storm. Freed of their lanyards and corporate IDs, they mutated into drunken mobs that migrated across the city in Ubers followed by their lithe, short-skirted cohort of equally vapid girlfriends. Groups met in the South End, then torpedoed under the highway wastelands to Southie where they fought each other and puked on the hoods of cars before returning to their well-appointed cubby holes that smelled of dried semen, weed, and unwashed gym clothes. At midnight, almost on cue, after many drinks, all the young women started smoking cigarettes. Yellow boxes of American Spirits emerged from tiny purses and were passed around until everyone had one. It felt so good. 

To be fair, it wasn‚Äôt just one segment of the population that let loose. College students ran amok as well. Blessed by youth and ignorance, they too, busted out with wild house parties, college drinking dramas, and heated, albeit stunningly quick hook-ups (thanks guys!). Stumbling clusters of kids roamed neighborhoods like Alston and Harvard Square, mainly behaving themselves but totally incoherent. 

In Cambridge, everyone, it seemed, ended up standing outside of Clover in Central Square at 3 am. baptized by tahini sauce stains and the early rumblings in their guts caused by the high-minded slop that Clover served. This was hollowed ground, stood upon by generations of club-goers and drunks. In the late 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs every punk band in the universe roared through the Middle East and TT the Bears. Further up Mass. Ave. a youthfully exuberant Bruce Springsteen sweated it up at the Harvard Square Theatre, and so did the Clash. Now, it was just asymptomatic kids, nice kids, spreading the virus like crop dusting mutants. 

These localized vignettes played out across the country. There was the utter lunacy of spring break and the spectacle of college students gathering on beaches and bars. States that had few cases of the virus now had to contend with droves of the newly infected. Christian universities, prompted by the President‚Äôs advice, decided not to close and the President himself declared the country open for business. Soon afterward Congress could no longer function because members were either sick or dead. The chaos was so great that Mike Pence, now dressing like an elderly Freddy Mercury, in tight-fitting, vintage, Coca Cola tee-shirts and skinny jeans was left behind on a fact-finding trip his office took to Texas. Luckily, the trip was to Austin, not Katy, where a morbidly obese Roger Clemons careened around on an ATV emblazoned with Red Sox decals shooting at anyone that even approached his compound.

Back in Boston, like everywhere else, the children started dying. At first it was thought that the virus didn‚Äôt infect children and most of the collected data supported the notion. In neighborhoods around the city, high-end strollers were abandoned curbside, often stuffed with plastic bags filled with children‚Äôs clothes and toys. Sobbing could be heard echoing out the windows of elegant brownstones and makeshift graves were dug in parks and even backyards. 

Women, it was mostly women, devastated and distraught, threw themselves off of buildings and parking garages. They often left their homes without saying anything to their equally distressed husbands, wives, boyfriends, or girlfriends. They simply left, trudging toward the heights of the closest unlocked building. High above them, Air Force One circled through the air corridors that once served Logan Airport. No one had seen the President in weeks and he was presumed dead. The rumors were that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were aboard the plane with their children. No one knew for sure.

On the straight run of Boylston St., where the Marathon finished, teenagers were racing fire trucks, buses, and police cars up the street from Mass Ave. to the Common. Then returning to the starting line via Newbury St. and doing it again. The exhaust of the buses and fire trucks covered up the stench of the Green Line burial ground, where thousands of people had been entombed in the stations and tunnels. The burial was the last official act of the city of Boston before it went dark. A local wit on the Cambridge City Council prevented the same thing from happening in the stations and tunnels of the Red Line by complaining that over time, commuters had suffered enough in those wretched tunnels and to condemn someone to eternity there was just unfair. Instead the dead were trucked to mile wide pit that was dug on the Cambridge Municipal Golf Course where a mass burial was officiated over by the still energetic (and apparently healthy) Elizabeth Warren. 

By all accounts, and these were now anecdotal, doctors, nurses and health care professionals had performed admirably. They had stayed on, caring for patients with a dwindling supply of equipment and medicine until it became impossible to carry on. The level of professionalism they exhibited was unimpeachable. Mass General was the epicenter of this effort until a Saudi Prince, seeking special care for his children, helicopter crashed into the main building while trying to land on the heliport. 

The ensuing fire engulfed the building quickly. Things might have ended differently but like during Katrina, Boston Police and Fire Department employees had long since stopped coming to work. Their heroism was limited to forming armed militias in Roslindale and West Roxbuxy and drinking looted beer and eating potato chips at checkpoints that the virus simply ignored. 

There were rumors that the Chinese Navy with attached troop transports was seen off the coast of Provincetown. It was like that Pixies album where Kim Deal speaks between songs, there were rumors that Trump was in Russia, thee were rumors that this or that pop star was dead. There were rumors that monkeys had overrun entire cities in Thailand. There were rumors‚Ä¶ 

On the now sporadic, remnant Internet, a gossip site had sprung up called ‚Äú*The Radish!‚Äù* It trafficked in stories that on their face were absurd but the writing was clever and the stories quickly spread, like their viral cousin, the Corona Virus. There were rumors that the site was run by Harvard students operating out of the Hasty Pudding Building in Harvard Square. Now that everything, including life itself, was canceled, *The Radish!* wondered aloud: Has Cancel Culture Gone Too Far? Seemingly, it had.

Big Dan 1990-2020 woke up with a headache. It wasn‚Äôt because he was sick, yet, but rather because he‚Äôd slept on a cot and somehow twisted his neck while sleeping. He walked across his studio and went to the window. Trash migrated up and down the street as the wind blew back and forth. Looking down the street, he could see the Cathedral on Washington St. Someone had climbed the spire and attached a big black pirate flag on top of it. The Skull and Bones slapped in the morning breeze above what seemed like a deserted neighborhood. Foodies, the neighborhood grocery store had been closed for weeks as had Southern Proper, a restaurant a block away that had the good sense to fold before the virus hit. Inside Foodies, people from the projects across the street had cleared the shelves out and helped Mrs. Baker, a pediatric nurse who worked at Boston Medical Center, set up an ad-hoc nursery and clinic in the store. Over two long days, people had wheeled small children and babies down Harrison Ave. to the former grocery store. They also moved, at Mrs. Baker‚Äôs direction, any equipment or supplies that she thought could be used. 

Big Dan 1990-2020 often saw Mrs. Baker striding purposefully across the wide streets followed by several women that assisted her and several men carrying assault rifles. Seeing groups like this was unusual in other parts of the city but because of bank red-lining, general segregationist policies, and the isolation of the black and brown communities in Boston, many people in the projects didn‚Äôt have the virus. They were, so to speak, social-distanced before it became an actual thing, unless of course, you were dealing with a cop or someone working retail. But that was yesterday and today is a bitch.

Today, Big Dan 1990-2020 was heading over to the food pantry, also run by Mrs. Baker and her associates. It was set up each morning in the playground across from the Cathedral. The pantry was supplied by a group of local kids that called themselves The Pony Xpress. They had a fleet of U Haul vans that they used to go out and find anything that Mrs. Baker might need or find useful. The rules were simple; never take anything from anyone. Only take what you find first and then, take all of it. The kids were industrious and hard working. They filled the vans almost every day, first with the smoke from dispensary blunts that they had liberated by the thousands, and then with anything that they could find. Big Dan 1990-2020 had become a regular on the morning line and his presence passed without comment or hard looks. In return he brought along anything that he scavenged and thought that people might find useful. 

Just before things reached the tipping point, a group of Medford cops went on a robbery spree. This is back when the supermarkets were printing money before the well went dry. Who is to say what is brazen anymore, but in a brazenly stupid act, using police cars and not bothering to hide their faces, they robbed an armored car at the Somerville Market Basket. Several people were killed and wounded and for a shitty second this was news. If any of this was funny, you‚Äôd have to ask yourself, how did they manage to even escape the crowded Market Basket parking lot?

Soon afterwards, most of them were dead because the surface contamination by the virus had covered the money they stole and having a ‚Äúmake it rain‚Äù party after the robbery, duly recorded for a private Face Book group, certainly didn‚Äôt help matters.

The robbery reminded long-time observers of when, in simpler times, Larry Bird was holding court at the Scotch &amp; Sirloin on North Washington St. in the North End, trying his gawky (and sometimes belligerent) best to get laid and knuckle-headed crews from Charlestown roamed the city looking for that big, final score, whether it was a bank job or armored car robbery. During one bloody fiasco, a wounded Charleston lad fell out of a getaway car and was apprehended by the police. They asked him what crew he was with and he responded that he‚Äôd like to help, he really would, but everyone was wearing masks during the robbery and he couldn‚Äôt identify any of them. Even the cops laughed.

Mrs. Baker told people, people who had grinded all their lives to pay their bills, sometimes working two or three jobs while handing kids off to relatives that money wasn‚Äôt shit anymore. It wasn‚Äôt part of the equation. It no longer mattered what was in your pocket. There was a bigger, more thoughtful aspect to her approach but she never dumped it over people‚Äôs heads. It was the daily immersion of watching her work and organize, that slowly won people over. That Mrs. Baker was a former world-class sprinter back when she was a teenager in Jamaica and that she still maintained the muscled armature of a professional athlete didn‚Äôt hurt either. Even in her early 60s, Mrs. Baker stilled look like she could run past it all. 

Big Dan 1990-2020 passed the time on line thinking about what he‚Äôd do with the rest of his day. His former life as an artist had come apart in stages. First people stopped going to galleries and museums, then shows were canceled. Then the galleries and museums closed. He‚Äôs lost track of what happened next and in the grand scheme of things it didn‚Äôt matter. The septic, self-promoting art world, like everything else had been washed away. At the very least, he‚Äôd been poor and living off the grid to start with. The disruption in comfort and routine wasn‚Äôt an issue. In fact, things didn‚Äôt feel that different at all. 

He‚Äôd found a way in to the library on Boylston St. and he go once a day, filling his knapsack with books. Dan 1990-2020 was an avid reader and by now his studio was overflowing with books. It was one way to pass the time. Luckily, the electricity was still on in his building, meaning the evenings were pleasant enough. He could read, or perhaps make work, but that was harder because art existed in the context of other things; things that were present even if they were unrelated. Now there wasn‚Äôt much to hang your hat on. Ideas were slipperier, harder to nail down. And of course, there was the bigger question, why bother? 

The city he‚Äôd lived in since college was gone, not gone, totally, but gone. The people he knew (he didn‚Äôt really have friends) were dead or moved out into the countryside around the city. The reality was he actually didn‚Äôt know what was next but that uncertainty provided an odd sort of contentment. One night, after spending the time drinking beer, he took a pencil and writing directly on the wall of his studio he made a list of sorts:

*Maybe I could learn to drive now*

*Maybe I could meet a girl from the projects*

*Why me*

*Don‚Äôt be selfish*

*Is Obama alive???*

*What about fishing*

*Organize my books*

*Find more art supplies*

*Talk more*

*Show an interest in people*

*Everything isn‚Äôt transactional*

*Yes it is*

This was the beginning of May, winter was over and what passed for spring, which wasn‚Äôt much different than winter finally collapsed into warm temperatures and sun-filled skies. The days were longer and Dan 1990-2020 was often out on his bike exploring the city. These excursions, with deliberate, familiar routes, allowed him to maintain a sense of what was happening in the city and the cities surrounding Boston. The esplanade was clear of people and using the bike path he could roam across the river into Cambridge and Somerville. From the midpoint of the Longfellow Bridge, he could look back at the burned scar of land stretching from the Liberty Hotel, past the buildings that comprised Mass General Hospital, and even further down Cambridge St. All the buildings were burned out from the fires that had raged for at least two weeks. Behind it all, Beacon Hill literally rose from the ashes. 

On the Cambridge side of the river, in Kendall Square, was where the pandemic was unleashed on Boston. It was the epicenter of infection. It was also the epicenter of the bio-medical, biotech, and pharmaceutical industries in the region. Before the virus hit, it was an area under constant construction, with developers and MIT racing to fill every square inch of unoccupied ground with office towers, housing, and street-facing retail spaces. Like the Seaport, it never seemed to jell into what anyone might consider a neighborhood. The buildings were bland and the people who worked down there blander still. At night, except for a few bars, the area emptied out.

Dan 1990-2020 used to like going to Aceituna, with its three vertical spits of meats that turned slowly as long lines of customers snaked around the restaurant at lunch- time. Despite all the people there, the lines moved quickly and the people who worked there expedited things as fast as possible. There was in warmer weather, tables set up outside, and sometimes, wild turkeys joined the crowds. It wasn‚Äôt a bad spot to have lunch, and the spicy chicken sandwich, wrapped in pita bread was among the best in the city.

Now, of course, there was nothing. Dig Dan 1990-2020 sailed down off the bridge and turned onto a side street that opened up to a large plaza (read: undeveloped land). He noticed a singe kayak lying on its side, blowing around like a large water bottle. The hard plastic grated across the concrete making a ripping sound. This was a place he associated with summer, a place to come off the river path and take a break and have something to eat. What it was now was hard to explain. 

He biked over the plaza and stopped in front of Aceituna. Everything looked normal except for the fact that no one was around. He could see the vertical spits in the restaurant were still there behind the counter. Outside, the ice rink that they put up in the winter was still there because the virus had interrupted the seasonal changeover to a seating area. He pulled a book from his backpack and settled down on the warm ground, with his head resting on the bicycle seat and began to read:

*‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThis was the beginning of May, yet the weather was temperate, variable, and cool enough, and people had still some hopes. That which encouraged them was that the city was healthy: the whole ninety-seven parishes buried but fifty-four, and we began to hope that, as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town, it might go no farther; and the rather, because the next week, which was from the 9th of May to the 16th, there died but three, of which not one within the whole city or liberties; and St Andrew‚Äôs buried but fifteen, which was very low. ‚ÄòTis true St Giles‚Äôs buried two-and-thirty, but still, as there was but one of the plague, people began to be easy. The whole bill also was very low, for the week before the bill was but 347, and the week above mentioned but 343. We continued in these hopes for a few days, but it was but for a few, for the people were no more to be deceived thus; they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way, and that many died of it every day. So that now all our extenuations abated, and it was no more to be concealed; nay, it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement‚Ä¶.*

The book, without a cover, was written by Daniel Defoe, it was a chronicle of the plague years in London. Academics debated many things about the book but little of the factual information Defoe provided was ever really disputed. Many thought the book was based on notes that Defoe‚Äôs uncle kept, others wondered if were merely a historical novel (but perhaps, the first of its kind). Big Dan 1990-2020 liked it because he could read it chronologically, matching month by month, the spread and thrust of death and utter disruption that he witnessed and mostly, hid from.

Ironically, books like this were slightly in vogue before things really changed. But they were read as stories that featured other people suffering and dying. The thought never crossed anyone‚Äôs mind how real they were and how accurately they echoed across time. 

Scam artists and evangelical pastors hawked cures, politicians called the virus a hoax before dying in a pink foamy mist. The President was fully lost, railing against his opponents on Twitter, stumbling through press briefings, and privately, for hours and hours, just sitting and cursing at the television. Soon, he just disappeared, the tweets stopped, and the White House claimed he was busy managing the crisis behind the scenes. The country sighed in relief but by then it was too late. Too much time had been wasted. Despite the ancient, hard-won wisdom, that stretched back to the very beginning of human existence that if there is a place where people are sick, don‚Äôt go there and if you are all ready there, don‚Äôt leave; people just continued to do what they normally did. And the virus spread and mutated, just as viruses normally do.

*To be continued‚Ä¶.*",boston,Big Dan 1990-2020

I am a firefighter and member of The Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts (PFFM). We currently do not have administrative sick time/injury coverage for COVID-19 unless the contact can be tied to a specific patient. Due to the asymptomatic nature of this virus, I ask that you contact your local leadership and ask that any worker whose job it is to assist in this pandemic have presumptive coverage during this time. It could be trivially easy to have another asymptomatic member of my crew come to work, infect the other members and subsequently have that trucks crew on personal sick time for weeks potentially going unpaid if not enough sick time was stored. Also, indirect contact with people who are infected such as a deliveryman who left the virus on the surface of a box that was subsequently picked up by a member.

Many new firefighters have little to no sick time accrued, and fellow helpers in other fields do not have large amounts of sick time to stay sidelined for 2 weeks necessarily. 

Over the past few days we have seen a spike in local cases along with firefighters becoming ill. We had to fight to get presumptive cancer coverage and I would hate for this to be another tough fight.

I am going to ask, in writing, that my landlord use the security deposit for April's rent. Which technically would leave the landlord with no security deposit.

Why am I thinking about doing this? Well, I have lived in the apartment for 2 years; so I renewed my lease after the 1st year. She has violated so many landlord laws and the only time I have gotten repairs to major issues was by threatening to withhold rent. And I followed the letter of the law to a ""T""; placing that month's rent in a separate bank account that I shared with her. Surprise, surprise after 9 months of asking the landlord to fix this major issue, it took me threatening to withhold rent to get them to fix it. Which they they did the very next day after my proof of withholding rent. So that's who I am dealing with.

Here's where my head is at. The landlord has a security deposit of almost $5K of mine. They could not pay it back in the required 30 days after the lease expires (which I wouldn't it past them), or I could say to them use my security deposit for April rent. Legally, I know I cannot use security deposit for rent, but with the court's closed, there is almost no way they would be able to complete the eviction process in the next 60 days given that the courts are closed and there are probably 100's of cases ahead of me should my landlord start the eviction process. 

Bottom line; I'd rather they chase me for $5K versus me chase them for the return of security deposit. If they hadn't been shady the entire time during my 2 year rental I wouldn't be considering this. But I could see them, who moved during my lease (from RI to CA) try and keep my security and take them to court to get it back. I have proof from previous tenants they've done this in the past. So it seems like common sense to tell them to use security deposit for April rent and if they do not like it...take me to court which will at the earliest will probably be 2 or month from now and I will be out of the apartment.

5646,bocelotof_,1585314651,fpwo60,Nan,"Hi All,

I hope you and your families are staying safe as Massachusetts responds to the shelter-in-place advisory made requisite by COVID-19. In case you needed to hear it from someone who has responded to COVID-19 calls already, here it is: Complying with this advisory is vital to the health and well-being of everyone in the Commonwealth, but especially those who are at higher risk, like people with underlying health conditions and seniors. Please help protect your parents and grandparents by only going out when absolutely necessary, physically distancing yourself, and practicing good hand washing practices.

It‚Äôs not often that I post, but I do so today because Massachusetts first responders need your help. By definition, firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, nurses, dispatchers, and others who are considered first responders are exposed regularly to health and other life safety hazards. However, COVID-19 is different. We have never seen a pandemic in our lifetimes and there aren‚Äôt laws on the books to protect us when some of us inevitably become sick due to this virus. Already, there are first responders who have become ill because they needed to transport a sick patient to the hospital. Because they cannot prove they contracted the Coronavirus on the job, they cannot make an occupational claim for paid leave during their recovery. As a result, they are expected to use their personal/vacation time once they use up all of their sick time during quarantine and/or recovery.

There are two bills that have been submitted for consideration by members of the first responder community: SB2602 and HD4927. These two bills would ensure that any first responder that contracts COVID-19 as a result of the coronavirus is presumed to have been exposed while on the job. Any resulting incapacitation during recovery would be considered as ‚Äúon duty time,‚Äù and the employee would not be required to use sick, vacation, or personal time to recuperate from the illness.

Please show your support for us by finding the contact information of your representatives and calling them to urge them to support these two bills:

When the lockdown occurred, two of my housemates were already staying elsewhere and two were still with me. Yesterday, the remaining two came up to me while I was working from home on the couch and asked me to stop working at the shelter because they were afraid they were going to catch coronavirus from me. I refused to do that, and they were upset and have chosen to live elsewhere for the time being. The whole episode has me rattled because my lease is turning over on June 1.

I started at Pine Street Inn a few weeks ago, shortly before the pandemic blew up and the lockdown occurred. My actual job only needs me to work from home, but I took on some extra in-person shifts. (Quick PSA for those who don't know, Pine Street Inn is Boston's largest homeless shelter and due to the coronavirus pandemic, they canceled all volunteer work, such as meal service, and replaced those shifts with paid staff.) This doesn't involve getting too up close and personal with guests, mostly serving them food from behind a lunch counter or staffing a front desk while they're sleeping.

My housemates still go to work every day and are generally not careful about the corona thing. E.g. one of them started coughing a week ago, he'd cough just next to me, and when I asked about it, he'd just say ""relax"". They totally don't take this situation seriously, they go to market every day even though I asked them if they could at least get a few days of stuff to minimize their impact.

I'm a ""high risk"" individual due to a pre-existing condition, so I want to avoid this disease. I have almost 4 months of food stocked in my room (because I've been preparing since January), so I don't need to leave house even for food. Unfortunately, I never had the guts to move out (which was a terrible terrible mistake on hindsight) so I'm stuck in my current place.

Now, I currently live completely locked into my room. I'm software engineer, so I can work from home. But naturally I need to leave my room to use bathroom or to wash dishes. I bought a portable induction heater to my room so I can cook here, but I still need a faucet to clean dishes.

I'm thinking about moving to a studio just about now. I'm wondering if this is a terrible idea because I'll be exposed to more people, or a good idea so I can completely isolate myself for a few months. I'm wondering if I can schedule U-Haul now or if they're closed. I have a lot of stuff that needs to be transported to the other apartment, like furniture and months of canned food and cat food (I have a cat).

Unfortunately, I have no friends in town who I can ask opinion to. So if you have any tips I'd really really appreciate it.",boston,Is this a good time to move-in to a different apartment to isolate myself?

Like many of us, I've been sitting in my apartment browsing twitter over the past two weeks and every few hours another tweet or article pops up highlighting callous or greedy behavior by a company at the expense of its employees. There is so much coronavirus-related news coming out that it feels like this news is being washed away as quickly as it is reported.

This felt wrong to me - in a big way.

Now don't get me wrong - there are a lot of layoffs and furloughs happening, and I understand that not all of them are unfair or abusive. I know that many businesses are going out of their way to take care of their employees as best they can, all while attempting to ensure that there is a business for those employees to return to once this is all over. Still, I think we need to know who is treating their employees poorly during this time and, more importantly, we need to remember those names and what they did after this pandemic is over. I'm asking for the following information: who is the company, what did they do, and a link to an article or tweet as proof.

If you don't want to post directly to the google doc you can DM me the info here or tweet at me - i'm also covidconfidential on twitter - and I would be happy to input it for you.

The roommate (male 1) i split a bedroom with was drinking with his friend (female) last night and her new boyfriend who also lives there (male 2) in our bedroom. 

We've been having some issues with yet another roommate downstairs (male3) lately, he's the kind of guy always asking to bum cigarettes and borrow things then never return them,  when he's confronted about it, he just plays dumb or acts like he never borrowed anything, i assume he's just selling our stuff. We caught him trying to come into our room without knocking when he thinks we aren't home.  Safe to say I Don't leave without my valuables and i sleep with my wallet on me.

So the incident that occurred. Male3 returned home late last night around 1am, he came to our room and opened the door, telling us he needed weed. This triggered male1, he stood up and explained to male3 that if he ever goes into our room again that there will be consequences. Male3 didn't like the way he was spoken to and tried to lie and evade in his usual fashion but this time he was angry. Male1 barked at him to get out of our room and head down the stairs, after 5 minutes of heated argument, he finally went downstairs.

Male3 has contact with the female's exboyfriend (male4) 
Male3 returned to our room on FaceTime with male4. He flashed the phone in the room and revealed that female and male2 were cuddling, watching television. When male1 forced him from the room yet again, i started to get a very bad feeling. So we started preparing for the worst. We equipped ourselves with what we had, a combat knife, a bo staff and a frying pan.

An hour passes and we hear loud foodsteps bounding uo the stairs. We quickly rush to the door to block it.
Something big crashed into the door, shattering the lock, we managed to hold the door a bit but it came flying open, revealing the face of male4 who male3 let in the house, we didn't know his intentions but we were not keen to find out. Make1 threatened them with the bo staff but male4 grabbed it from his hands, male1 answered this with 2 hard straight punches to the face of male4, he basically crumbled upon contact and he toppled backward. Granting us enough room to close the door, we held it closed. But male4 crashed into the door again, i passed male1 the combat knife and we opened the door. I heard male2 exclaim (yo! He's gonna stab you) i saw the fear in male4's eyes as he backed down and stumbled down the stairs in an attempt to run away. Male1 chased after them and yelled to us to stay in the room, but i followed to provide backup. Male4 and male3 exited the house with us right behind them. And that's when the police showed up. About 4 of them. They immediately demanded male1 to drop the knife, he complied and dropped the knife. 

When things calmed down a bit we all got a chance to explain our story to the police, male2 and female remaining upstairs. (Scared beyond belief).  The landlord was furious, she came out demanding that everyone who doesn't legally live there has to leave immediately. We shown the police the shattered lock and male4 was taken to jail, I Don't technically live there so i started packing all my things and was rushed out of the place by a very angry landlord at 2am into the cold streets of roxbury. I forgot about some of my things, but i figure i can get them later. 

What do i do? Where can i go? I have very little money but I'm starting a job at amazon on Wednesday.

My wife and I recently purchased a condo in the North End and I am bored out of my mind. We have a guest room that is going largely unused, and I'm exploring the process of listing it on Airbnb for when we get on the other side of COVID-19 (fingers crossed and cleaned). The process seems pretty convoluted, so hoping to get advice from someone that has done this before or is going through this. My understanding of the process is as follows:

1. Obtain approval from HOA for renting one room for short term stays
2. Ensure we have the required liability insurance per Airbnb guidelines ($1M for our unit/room)
3. Obtain license for Limited Share Short Term Rental Unit from [Boston.gov](https://boston.gov/) ([Link](https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services/short-term-rentals))
4. Obtain a Business Certificate from the City Clerk ([link](https://www.boston.gov/departments/city-clerk/how-apply-business-certificate))
5. Notify Neighbors of Registration within 30 days of registering ([link](http://app01.cityofboston.gov/abutter/))

My questions are as follows:

* Is there anything I'm missing in the above? Does anyone have experience or 'gotchas' we should look out for?
* We are in compliance with all the rules/regs but the 'Short Term Rental Eligibility Site' ([Link](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/short-term-rental-eligibility/resource/83621b97-9a00-4aa7-bf43-28cae04969d4)) says that my home is **not** eligible for 'Limited Share Eligible'. We don't have any problems with income assistance/low income housing. I don't know if this is because the building was recently converted to Condos, or what the problem is. Anyone have any ideas?
* Are there any downsides to registering your unit as a short-term rental unit? Ie, will it be harder to sell, are there higher tax implications, other things that I might be missing?

Thank you for your time and help!",boston,Process for registering condo unit as short term rental in MA (North End)?

Well COVID19 stopped us from buying, and renewing our lease isn't an option. Normally we'd see apartments and just sign a lease, but I'm trying to sort through the options here. 

1) What happens if the people renting currently don't leave when their lease is up?

2) I'm hearing from various relators that they aren't doing showings but could do a virtual showing. Anyone who has lived in the Boston are before knows you can't rent an apartment sight unseen or just using pictures. These places aren't big complexes where everything is the same and in good condition, so you have no idea what issues you're walking into.  

3) Movers are considered an essential service now, but what if that changes and we literally can't move our furniture?

5816,FloatingWallaby,1585484125,fr50oe,I wrote this!,"I see post after post worrying about the education your kids are receiving/not receiving- attempts to join online Zoom enrichment classes/hire online tutors/create a daily schedule and routine to help your child progress academically. I am going to be very honest right now- most of what you are doing is unnecessary. Children's brains are elastic and they will be able to make up lost academic time. They do not \*need\* academics right now- this goes for all ages (I teach high school). They do not \*need\* to learn division, subtraction, calculus, AP Human Geography....or anything else.

They need to feel safe. They need to feel loved. They need to know they are ok. That's it. Really- I promise.

The thing about this situation that is so hard, is that so many of us parents are hyperfocusing on something we can control- school- because everything feels out of control. And we are putting insane amounts of pressure on both ourselves AND our kids to ""keep learning"" through a time of unimaginable change and stress. All we are doing is adding to that stress- I've been there,too. I tried to make that crazy daily schedule and I tried to teach my daughter improper fractions and THAT was a bad idea¬†üì∑;)

Some parents are clamoring for more online learning in this attempt to feel some measure of normalcy- wanting districts and teachers to provide ""more"" for their child. What many do not understand is that self-driven learning, even if a teacher is virtually teaching, is not possible for many students- even if they complete the work, we do not know much about the affects of long term virtual learning to be sure kid are truly getting any real academic experience (it is definitely more possible at older ages, but not for students who are neurodiverse or have a range of learning disabilities). The issue of equity \*cannot\* come off the table- as we move towards longer periods out, we have to be mindful of all students and learners- not just those who have the capacity to do work online.

Some parents want no online expectations- finding rigid structures and due dates to make life so much harder, and cause more stress and tension than it's worth- that they and their child to do not have the capacity (for a multitude of reasons) to do consistent online virtual education in any formalized manner. And that's is understandable- however many students \*do\* benefit from some measure of provided learning, even if just to break up their day and give them something to do. Projects, enrichment style activities allow kids to engage without the pressure.

Right now there is no consistency state-to-state or even district-to-district. This also raises stress, as parents frantically compare what is happening in their school or district to what others are getting- making everyone worried they are not getting a fair deal/what is ""best"".

There is no best. There is no right. We are in the middle of a global pandemic and all the rules have been thrown out the window, ripped to shreds, and then driven over by a monster truck. Education is in survival mode.

So in this incredibly long-winded post- I just wanted to say that you are alright. Your child is too. And whether or not they learn improper fractions does not matter- let them know they are ok. Help them feel safe. Create what works for your family and forgive yourself for the mistakes you make, your children's schools make- and don't worry about their formal education- they will be ok. I promise.

\*\*\*And as a special note to all families whose children are often ignored in these posts, for whom educational disruption is TRULY disabling both for the student and the family, I want you to know I see you. I see you trying to find ways to get ABA services through telehealth, for helping your child through their therapies and keep them feeling ok when nothing feels ok to them. I see you trying to figure out how to prevent regression and keep them and others safe. I wish I had answers (I and many others are working to come up with solutions), but one thing I want you to hear: You are doing enough. Your best is enough. It really is.

I quit my job and was actively looking for work and reported for 7 weeks in a row (12/15-1/26) then stopped because I never heard from them. Then in June 2013 I received a check for almost $2000, which was for each week from the time I started applying until I stopped. So I started applying again and they sent me 12 more checks for the next 12 weeks, great! A few days after I received a check in August I get a letter/ email saying I owed all of the money back($5000) because my employer had appealed the decision or denied that I was eligible.... even though I already received 19 checks and more than 8 months went by. Needless to say I lost my appeals and was found to be responsible and had to pay back the $5000 plus interest - that‚Äôs MA for you. 

I just want people to be aware that this is possible, and, while it is probably uncommon I don‚Äôt want this to happen to anyone else. 

I am not sure why the DUA sent me money before checking to make sure I was eligible. I did fill out their paperwork saying I quit ( which I now know makes you ineligible unless you had good cause).

Now, I no longer can show up at the store opening since senior hours are everyday. Today, by the time I was allowed to shop, all the eggs, soap and toilet paper were completely gone. 

I've even heard of families sending people who are seniors to go shopping rather than say their teenagers, since Seniors are the only ones most likely to get those quarantine--essential products. That completely defeats the purpose of this!

We came to this decision with great care‚Äîin consultation with community and cultural partners, performers, and city officials‚Äîto put the safety of our staff, volunteers, and visitors first.

Meanwhile, we hope you will discover new ways to connect with art and artists through our online offerings. Please explore our website and social media channels as resources for Museum updates, as well as a wide range of content‚Äîvideos, slideshows, podcasts, and a few lighthearted moments.

- https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2018/08/15/these-mass-hospital-executives-have-received-the.html

Now from what I experienced so far while dealing with the healthcare system:
- my insurance costs me $1200/month, paid by an employer mostly ( so happy about this )
- I have to pay $30 to see my PCP, and something like $50 to see a specialist
- there was some co-insurance once
- my deductible is $1000/year for family

A basic lab blood test that would cost next to nothing in my country of origin - racks up to $400+ here. Something more sophisticated like an ultrasound would go up to $1K and beyond. MRI can easily go up to $7K ( I've seen that once, they screwed up my insurance and started sending me bills for $700-something for nurse associate services, not even sure what was it. The lab service asked for about $8000 for MRI machine service ). 

I cut my finger in pieces pretty badly once, was smart not to go to ER but local urgent care to stitch it back together. The bill was interesting - they charged something like $15 for a single bandaid patch that costs $8 for a pack of 20 in any CVS.

They had almost everything with a few comments; some meat selections seemed lighter than usual, but not by much, there were limits of 1per for items like paper towels and bottled water, seemed to have rolled out a lot more canned goods, beans, fish etc. They had plenty of toilet paper (limit to one huge case) and in every other way it was an easy trip.

So trying to think of places that reflected the city, I came with this and realized how muxh I had to leave out and that it's Cambridge heavy (which makes sense given where I've lived):

1. Gene's Flatbread Cafe. While the best international food you can find in Boston is usually Brazilian or Latin (and Latin does not mean Mexican, I'm talking Peruvian, Puerto Rican, Dominican), the biggest growing demographic is Chinese, which brings us to Gene's. Hand pulled Xi'an style noodles and cuisine. The noodles in chili oil and garlic. In a soup with cumin lamb. The little flatbread sandwiches that you order two of as a side. Some of the best comfort food you'll ever have. I've only been to the Boston location, so have cash ready, walk up to the counter, and don't take too long order or the woman making noodles will roll her eyes and say something sarcastic in Guanzhong dialect.

2. Legal, either Harborside or down by Aquarium. Legal Sea Foods is a Boston institution, and they somehow maintain high quality despite being a chain now, so they're a solid pick to represent the cuisine that best represents Boston: seafood. If you come to Boston and aren't gorging on clams, oysters, cod, lobster, etc., you're doing it wrong. (And if you have an allergy Legal does all their other stuff pretty well too.)

3. Puritan &amp; Company. After seafood, there's still a rich culinary history in Boston dating back to colonial days, and few restaurants do it better than Puritan. I almost put Loyal Nine here, but they really push modern tastebuds. It's much more for foodies ‚Äî they're doing modern version of dishes nobody cooks anymore. Puritan isn't pushing the envelope like that, but everything they do is rooted in New England's culinary traditions. They even do a weekly ""bar pie"" night, bar pizza being a beloved South Shore meal.

4. Oleana. If I had to pick one ""foodie"" place, this would be it. I mean it's Ana freakin' Sortun. Boston doesn't have a Michelin guide and so no stars awarded in this city, but if it did, this would shoot right to the top of the list of must-starred restaurants. And even despite being a foodie place, it's fairly casual, an atmosphere that lends to the small Mediterran plate experience.

5. Eastern Standard. Everyone usually thinks of Irish bars when they think of Boston, and that's true but would be a whole other list. When thinking of restaurants, no place better captures that vibe than Eastern Standard. Right in Kenmore Square, you pop in on a summer night and the patio is open, the bar is packed equally with people dressed up to go out, people going to the Sox game around the corner at Fenway, grad students and academics, and then there's a nice brasserie-style dining area, but appropriately no real separation between the bar and the dining room. The bartenders are among the best in the city, the food never fails to be great, and I kinda think it's the best representation of the city at the moment.",boston,Someone is visiting you from out of town: where are you taking them to eat?

First, I am speaking to the governor and mayors office and voicing my support for a shelter in place order. I truly feel this is the safest option for Boston right now. I love this city so much and I want us to get through this, but we need to do more. 

How to voice support for shelter in place:
211 (Governors Hotline)
617-725-4005 (Governor‚Äôs Office)
311 (Mayor‚Äôs Hotline)

How to report non-essential businesses that are refusing to shut down operations:
617-635-0355 (Small Business Dept)
617-635-5300 (Inspection Services)

I myself know of some nail salons etc that are not closing. I will be reporting them and recommend that if you are aware of similar businesses conducting operations report them as well.

We can‚Äôt rely on our politicians to fix these issues. It is really important to show your support for shelter-in-place if you feel strongly about it because many politicians fear that they will lose support in the next election if they make similar restrictions. 

Hope you all are healthy and safe.",boston,How to voice your support for a shelter-in-place and report non essential businesses!

I work in health care and I do so for far less than many of my peers earn. I owe $200,000+ in student loans that I took out to get my masters', so that I could have a voice that was relevant enough to improve the way that we provide treatment for addictions. I pay equal to my share of one month's rent in a top 3 city for that privilege. I have worked in the non profit community health sector for all of it. I work a second job to make ends meet, which I do love, and also need.  I am still doing so despite being told that the same debtor I continue to pay, has failed to provide competence, guidance, and desperately needed resources to keep myself, my colleagues, and my patients safe.  

I see that organizations like mine, that are not hospitals, were left out of any fiscal aid from the largest vote-purchase in United States history.  Give people free money, they'll remember that come November, the businesses and the stock market too, oh, and also the hospitals.   The health centers that serve as the safety net that keeps the masses away from Emergency Departments and nexuses of exposure, are buckling under the strain of their own finances.  We lose money in a good year, because free care isn't cheap, but it's vital to keeping our society from becoming sicker than it already is.  That said, our own leaders are not helping.

I have seen incompetence in those that have lead for much of my career. When things are coasting, it's a frustrating annoyance, and something to complain about. When we need leadership to help unite us, show us support, and make us feel like they have our backs, we hear about layoffs, numbers, lack of control. We lack the archetypes that are most needed in times of crisis, those that rally and inspire. We have leaders who know how to threaten and remind you that you won't earn extra for working longer hours, that we are all in this together.

Except we aren't, we aren't hiding in meetings and changing everyone's routines multiple times per day, and being upset when someone's out of the loop. We aren't worried that the mismanagement of our responsibilities are about to bite us in the ass, because we have been doing our fucking jobs. We aren't the ones who can work from home for a month, because ""there is no policy for that"" and we can't ""measure productivity remotely"". We aren't the ones who are freaking out over the data from a week's worth of revenue in a sector that will always have a market. 

We are the ones who recognize that you need us desperately more than we need you. 
 We are also the ones who know what we need in order to do our jobs.

And we are supposed to support your mental health, your physical health, your children's? I am lucky, I am a seasoned veteran with relative security. I think of my students who are graduating into the most uncertain job market in modern history.",boston,Social Work during CoVID-19

6226,Udontlikecake,1585938971,fudssx,Coronavirus,"Hi all. Thought I would watch and condense the update from Charlie so y'all can read it in a quicker way. If there's any errors you notice, just mention it and I will try to fix it. Stay healthy!

* About 9,000 cases. 154 dead. 

* As of yesterday, total tests of 56k. 

* 20 Labs conducting tests. Set goal of 3,500 tests day, have been meeting and exceeding it. 5,000 were done yesterday.

* Will increase testing capacity. 

* There will be a new first responder drive through testing at Gillette stadium

* Key goal now on '[test and trace](https://www.who.int/features/qa/contact-tracing/en/)'. Working on ramping this up.

* Today, we have created the 'Covid-19 Community Tracing collaborative', Commonwealth and Partners Health. Hopefully get this started by the end of the month

* Model says cases will increase rapidly over the next weeks, but focused on 'long game'

* Want to monitor and isolate potential cases with the Test and Trace program. Virtual call center will be set up. Current patients will be contacted, and people they may have exposed will be contacted to make sure they are taking precautions. 

* Private sector and NGOs will both assist with this program and continue to assist the Commonwealth

* Charlie Baker expressing his deepest condolences to the MBTA worker who died this week.

* Medical Director of Partners in Health now speaking. (The humanitarian organization, NOT the big healthcare company)

* Must stop the ongoing spread of Covid-19. Underlining the importance of contact tracing. This isn't just staying at home. This is knowing if you've been exposed and is critical. 

* Three levels. 

* *Base of the Pyramid*. This is social distancing. But that's not enough if you're sheltering with other people. 

* *Middle*. This is quarantine, if you know you have it.

* *Top*. This is isolation. If you live with other people and you test positive, you should move out to a hotel, other isolation facilities. 

* Key is having social programs to assist in this isolation, providing services for people who need to isolate. 

* Another pyramid metaphor. Okay

* Top here is the critical patients that we have been focusing on so far. The 20% who are seriously at risk

* Bottom is the other 80%, people who may be asymptomatic and not as sick but who are spreading it. We now need to focus on this, letting these people know if they've been infected. 

* Another Partners in Health person now. 

* Need to go *The Full Monty* and totally commit to flattening the curve with Contact Tracing and full support from government. 

* Claims not to be good at sports analogies, but we need to go on the 'offense' (lmao)

* Someone asks if it is 'too late' for contact tracing. TL;DR: No. If poor African countries can do it with Ebola, we can do it with Covid

* Charlie still sees us as 'early in the game'. Underlines the importance of public-private partnerships. The Commonwealth can't do it alone.

* Someone asks where the most likely place you are to be exposed. Baker says he can't answer well until we do contact tracing. 

* Someone asks if we will have enough testing capacity for this. Baker says it will ramp up quickly. Developing new tests etc etc

* Partners in Health woman says that we may be able to get people back to work with antibody testing. Strongly warns against the herd immunity shit of waiting until 70% of people have it. 

* Someone asks how people will be notified of Covid exposure, the anxiety and risk associated. Partners woman says that the media and community needs to underline how this is compassionate and important for people to know. This is how we stop the epidemic.  

* Someone asks when people will be notified. Baker says that people have already been notified since the start. This is simply ramping up and expanding what we have been doing. Getting more data and info will help the Commonwealth to solve big issues. 

* At Holyoke, 21 vets dead. 59 test positive. All testing done. Special procedures there for those infected, national guard are there, people are being cared for.

* Question asked about if something will be done about nursing homes given risks. Commonwealth underlines past procedures, mobile testing, on site medical professionals etc

* In Norwood nursing home, 15 dead, 8 Covid positive. They are doing postmortem testing. 

* Someone says that the CIA has been criticizing Chinese data used to build models, she says that it is the only one available, models are never perfect. 

* Underlies that Chelsea had been taking stringnet and correct procedures. Holyoke did not. The results are obvious.  

* (Charlie Baker talks very slowly)

* Reporter asks Baker if he was crying yesterday and asks how he is doing (??)

* Baker says that he has been chasing PPE for a long time, they've lost it (seized in NY) and he was just so grateful that they could get PPE for front line people. (He's obviously still quite frustrated that he feels like he can't do enough.)

* Someone asks what happened to the masks seized in the port of NY. He says they're probably in the federal stockpile. (Fuck Trump)

I have a friend who wants to sell their old car, say $1,000 value. Anyways, I know the car is probably worth about $2,500, but they don't want to deal with the headache of selling it privately.

I plan on driving it for a bit, but I recently fixed my 02 CRV, and it may save me a lot of money just to bring it home and leave it unregistered and simply flipping it after a few months time.

Has anyone done this recently and have an idea of the costs associated with buying it and then registering it? My napkin calculation shows I would save quite a bit just having the title signed over to me, and not bothering with the registration, insurance etc.

If I were to simply flip it, my only concern is that I couldn't let anyone test drive it or I could take them gamble on letting them drive it to the parking lot across the street from my house

Thank you",boston,Buying/Flipping a used card from a friend.?

As some of you may know Ed Markey is running for reelection in November, however to get on the ballot for the primary in October he needs 10,000 signatures. COVID has made this much more difficult to obtain. The campaign is mailing the form where you can sign along with return envelopes and postage so all you have to do is sign and drop it in a mailbox. To get his nomination papers you just have to fill out this google form below!

You are NOT voting for Ed Markey by signing this, nor are you pledging to vote for him. You just have to be a registered voter in Massachusetts. If you also want to get immediate family or roommates to sign as well they can sign the same form as long as they are registered to vote in the same town. Feel free to comment or DM me if you have any questions. Please do consider signing, Ed needs you!

Here is the nomination paper request form: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclagsZILBB3SgnXD9SHMmFljfHaym1Kiv5\_laT6o57Zcruxg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclagsZILBB3SgnXD9SHMmFljfHaym1Kiv5_laT6o57Zcruxg/viewform)",boston,Signing Senator Ed Markey's Nomination Petition

With all that being said there will be a huge budget problem in both state and local governments for at least a few years once we get past this. One potential remedy is to consolidate government and government services. IMHO Mass should push the following towns/cities to consider Boston annexation:

&amp;#x200B;

* Winthrop
* Revere
* Chelsea
* Somerville
* Everett 
* Saugus (Only if Revere is annexed)
* Quincy (Stretch but probably unlikely due to Quincy schools being  better)
* Cambridge (would make sense but not sure if Cambridge will have budget issues)

&amp;#x200B;

Brookline, Newton, &amp; Milton while on the border might make sense but might be in good enough shape to not need annexation as a way to help cut costs.

This would make sense as we could reduce costs and get more efficient local services and quite frankly  the smaller cities/towns might not have a choice as they don't have the economic diversity/scale that Boston has in order to survive and provide city services. 

The biggest issue that would determine whether or not this happens is school busing.

For the reason I left my job I put conviction instead of terminated. Should I have picked terminated?  Does having a conviction make it easier to get benefits? Do I have a more likely chance getting benefits during these times or would it not matter? 

Also I got two forms in my inbox, one for monetary determination and another for an alternate base period? Do I need to mail those if those don't apply to me? 

Also, is there anything else I need to do? I already filled out the weekly benefits. Since there aren't many job listings what do I put? Are they being more lenient on that? And there was something about identification but no further instructions.

6486,Mumbles76,1586265693,fwkei7,Nan,"I don't want to put the cart before the horse here, but i thought it'd be nice to get a discussion going.

We celebrate our sports teams as though they've saved the earth from distinction... streamers from windows and rooftops, hell the whole city almost shuts down for the big ones. These sports figures make a minimum of 2 million a year, and most much much more than that.

What about the health care and other essential workers that are putting their lives on the line, daily, some while even sick themselves?

Are baseball, basketball or football stars putting their lives on the line to save others?

What am i getting at? Once this thing is relatively over, we need to have a parade for healthcare and other essential workers.

I don't have any special contacts or know who owns the duck boats. But I do know that some of the mayor's staff monitors this forum from time to time.

Look, i know it'll be a while before people should congregate in a big parade, but when we DO get to that point, we should be holding a parade for those putting their lives on the line on a daily basis. I don't know exactly where the line is drawn, but i think essentially, Nurses, Doctors, EMS, Firefighters, Police to start.

They deserve special recognition for their efforts and dedication to duty. We should have the parade of parades in this city... i think back to after WWII when that iconic photograph was taken of that guy pulling that girl off her feet and there was just so much momentous joy.  We need that level of excitement, unity and happiness, badly.

If the mayors staff reads this or anyone here that knows the owners of the duck boats, this idea should be floated by them.
