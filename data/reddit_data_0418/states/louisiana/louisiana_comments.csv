I also like what I know(which is honestly only a moderate amount) of democratic socialism. However, my main issue with the entire political landscape that we find our country within during these disturbing times is the sheer reliance on pure partisan belief systems on both sides of the aisle and an ever widening gap between the sides. The way I see it, to continue using the same metaphor, the people in the rows alongside both aisles are the 99% of the Nation‚Äôs population with the ruling elite being removed from the entire situation, looking on with malevolent amusement. It seems fairly obvious that over the past 20 years The Ruled classes of The United States, via exponentially growing mass media of all sorts, has intentionally been divided at alarmingly  frightening rates. It has happened in an increasingly subtle manner as to keep the majority of level-headed, genuinely well meaning, reasonable, and fairly intelligent people from even noticing. Getting to the point. What has happened and seems to be coming to a head if we as a Nation don‚Äôt pull our heads from our asses is; that the entire partisan system is set up against us, or has at least become the primary tool that those historically and currently in power(primarily the same group of people) are using to divide the only threat to their wealth and continued power. That threat is of course a united population with unbiased and accurate information and the mentality that in spite of whatever our differences may be our similarities are much greater and more important. While they make sure that we are busy classifying ourselves either Republicans or Democrats and spewing hatred toward one another based on misinformation and archaic belief systems. The so called ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of these parties and thus our Government, not to mention those behind the scenes movers and shakers who control the politicos, cannot possibly actually believe in the values and ideals they so candidly proclaim themselves to be the greatest proponents of, for if they did their actions would look very different indeed. Now, before you bite my head off, I want with all my heart to believe that Bernie is apart from this group of Washington Oligarchs. Unfortunately, this is probably why he will be unable to become our President. I‚Äôve come to believe that the actual reason that Trump won in 2016 is that his role was to insure that through his administration America would become even more divided than ever. Wether you agree with all of my ideas or not you cannot deny that we are more divided than we have been since only two eras, the mid-1960s and the middle-1850s-1860s. And we all know what happened during those times. So, let‚Äôs all try to be less, identified with a single agenda and work against those who seek to destroy everything that this American Experiment was always hoped it would become. A country united in freedom where everyone has a real inalienable right towards a life free from oppression, fear, poverty, ignorance, and repression.

Healthy, educated citizens earn more money and pay more taxes. They have lower crime rates and require less expenditure in social services. They start more businesses and innovate more.

513,513,QueefyConQueso,"The ‚Äúeye for an eye‚Äù argument is a very poor argument to make.  That mindset has not existed in the west for eons, and I question the motivation of those who make it.  

Personally my issue with the death penalty is this:  

I believe in the notion of ‚ÄúI would rather see 10 guilty people go free then a single innocent one punished for a crime they didn‚Äôt commit‚Äù 

I also think that there is a minority of people who lack the ability to empathize with other humans and who act, or do not act out because of a fear of the consequences to themselves. Not out of any sense of right or wrong done to others.  It is these people a death penalties exists.  Most people don‚Äôt function this way, but there are always some that do.  

However, looking back at past criminal cases, it is apparent that LA has most likely, in fairly recent memory, executed individuals for crimes they did not commit.  The justice system is not properly enforcing the ‚Äúbeyond reasonable doubt‚Äù methodology to captitol punishment.  

This is unacceptable.  In many of these cases you can make the argument that they where not ‚Äúgood people‚Äù, sure, but that is beside the point.  They where probably convicted of a crime they did not commit. 


I‚Äôm theory, the Governor is supposed to act as a control for that.  Review the case and halt the execution if things look flaky.  But for various reasons I don‚Äôt think that has served its function historically.  

Trust me, this isn‚Äôt an out.  I don‚Äôt believe there is any room in society, behind bars or no, for creatures like that.   I‚Äôm particularly sensitive to child killers as a parent.

609,609,QueefyConQueso,"Yes and no.  There are some...problematic applications like grocery bags that are initiatives to phase out.  Well the application is fine, they are just nigh impossible to control as a waste stream (they get taken up by the wind, washed down storm drains, what have you).  Which is fine.  

So let‚Äôs stop using plastic entirely?  There are two huge problems with this.  

1st is the choice of replacement material.  Take two problematic applications, plastic grocery bags and straws (and they are problematic) Some of the restaurants and grocery stores default to paper.  This, in the grand scheme of things is a poor, poor trade off in environmental terms.  If you factor in how much more material it takes to accomplish the same task, and the shear energy and environmental impact of the Kraft process, to say nothing of the older surfer process.  You are trading one problem for another.  And this is ignoring whatever stresses the wood and wood pulp market would be under to actually deliver product. 

The solutions are reusable cloth or synthetic bags, or cleanable straws made of metal or long life plastic (silicone for insistence, but you could modify a polyolefin as well).  But go to room filled with a 1000 people claiming to care and have knowledge of the issue and ask how many brought their own reusable straws?  Have reusable bags in case they need to stop by the store on the way home?  Maybe 5-10 with the bags, you will lucky to get 1 or two with straws.  

We have the solution, we just are unwilling to sacrifice convenience to implement it.  

2: It is not talked about wildly, because it combines two already hot topics, but is plastics broad connection to oil and gas. 

Let‚Äôs take one of the huge players in tonnage of plastic waste: polyolefins.  What are they?  They are the long chain molecules made by reacting (this is a simplification, much more goes into an end product) ethylene and or propylene together in long chains. 

Where does that come from? Well, it depends.  One of the most common sources, made even cheaper and more available with the fracking boom (this is a reason domestic production of plastics has had a resurgence, access to raw materials) is natural gas.  Some can be fractionated off, but much of it has to be cracked.  

Nobody really explores for ‚Äúethylene‚Äù or ‚Äúpropylene‚Äù.  Or even ethane or propane.  They are part of the natural gas mixtures.  The natural gas is in such abundance that in Texas it has actually traded in negative values!  They had to pay somebody to pipe it away because they reached their flaring limit. 

So what does this mean?  It means really cheap feedstock for many consumer plastics.  They fraction off the ethane and propylene, naptha, what have you.  Steam crack it, and you have just taken something and made it into an added value product. 

Now what happens if you ban plastics?  Well, that ethane and propane will A: get flared off, or it just stays in the natural gas steam, and gets sold and burned as a fuel source.

This isn‚Äôt great.  You just took carbon, that was going to be made into a solid form you could just sequester back into the earth from which it came, and sent it out to get converted to atmospheric CO2, that is very problematic and don‚Äôt have a handle on how to adequately deal with.  Again, trading one problem for a worse one. 

That solution? Is end our dependance on fossil fuels.  Again, an addiction of wealth and convenience not easily addressed.  

But until we can ween ourselves off oil and natural gas, which will be a process even if it becomes politically viable, taking billions of tons of potential CO2 and instead making it into a solid versatile product we can easily bury and resequester is not a bad deal.  We just need to be better at choosing application and designs so it doesn‚Äôt wind up in places where it can cause damage.  (Plastic grocery bags are just bad.  Disposable paper isn‚Äôt the answer, but it is an example of a poor, poor application)",1578596193,fdnztes

Can a child of 11 be rehabilitated to a degree that a 17 cannot and be released back into the general population with a reasonable degree of confidence that they are not a high danger to the test of society? 

I am not, nor are most of the people here even remotely qualified to make a qualification like that.

I know ""why"" it's being built in spite of that, and why it makes sense to do so. 

It is because Formosa Plastics is a company with a poor HS&amp;E record that will be a bad actor in Louisiana, and pose risk to the environment, workers, and citizens of LA above and beyond the economic value it brings to the state.

However, periods of time during which the offender was awaiting trial, under an order of attachment for failure to appear, or on probation or parole for an offense described in this Paragraph, or periods of time during which an offender was incarcerated in a penal institution in this or any other state for any offense, including an offense described in Paragraph (1) of this Subsection, shall be excluded in computing the ten-year period.

This doesn't seem to take into account the  depreciation that companies would write off, which would affect the assessment amounts, seemingly taking LED's ITEP data and putting face value back on the rolls, which is highly unlikely, especially after the response to the last ITEP reform.

Additionally, a lot of the plants in Cameron Parish and other places could just be written off as ""inoperable"", ""fully depreciated"", or ""partially under construction"" so that their assessment numbers would be very low.

I've also personally witnessed them import an entire plant, roll it off a boat and install it, so I wouldn't doubt they would do the reverse if forced to pay taxes, assuming that they don't just sue the state for decades.",1578690008,fdrulth

My concern with fully letting the parishes full control over ITEP is that they will be overly competitive with each other, and over time end up like states have, giving to good to be true, not fair (for the people of the Parish) deals go companies just to get a few more jobs in Parish A instead of B.  

I am unsure of a solution that allows the state the flexibility to attract new development in LA and compete with heavy hitters like Texas, give the parishes the leeway to make it fair for their area, and keep them from undercutting each other to the nth degree.  

And even if I did, the LA legislature seems stuck in some strange Regen‚Äôesqu trickle down economics theory.  Which really lost the last leg of any foundation it had the moment globalization took off.  The wealth of that companies make in LA doesn‚Äôt stay in LA.  

I don‚Äôt like the idea of property taxes at a fundamental level.  I think taxing the wealth the facility generates is at its core would be better. 

But in a global economy, when they are piping gas in from Texas, making a precursor, shipping it halfway across the world and making something else before selling to a customer that is actually making a finished product, and putting the money in a foreign bank, then claiming the profits at a headquarters in New York or something, property taxes start to make more sense.",1578699354,fdscbtw

From the companies I've been able to talk to about competitiveness between us and Texas most of them have 1 major concern about an LA location, Workforce.

The companies that locate here end up just relocating people from other states anyway because of the deal they get on taxes between ITEP, Quality Jobs, Tax Equalization, and the many more direct programs. Then when it looks like the money is about to dry up or it's cheaper elsewhere they leave, that's sort of the nature of business. Maximize profits for shareholders. 

In a more caring world we'd be concerned about all stakeholders not just those with equity in the market, but that is sadly not the world we live in as much as I wish it was. Government's job is supposed to be to fight for those kinds of stakeholders who aren't represented in the market by capital, people like minorities, the poor, and others who cannot benefit from the system optimally without help.

Regardless, ITEP is a bum deal for anyone living in this state, and we agree on that, along with a lot of other things. Maybe if our state needs to hand out a billion dollar tax incentive to get a company to locate here they should figure out why it costs so much for them to want to be here?

718,718,QueefyConQueso,"As someone in an area effected by the 2016 flood, and rural, that program was bonkers. 

For starters, the reps doing the initial inspections were pushing SBA loans to a degree that made me very suspicious.  Like a used car salesman pitch.  So much so I dig into them and realized how bonkers they were. 

 For starters, for kicks and giggles I contacted my local bank and could get significantly better interest rates.  Secondly any money taken out (at the time, they changed it later) went against your total award amount. And last, they seemed unconcerned about the your ability to repay the loan in a pre-housing market crash type of lending glee.  (I am guessing the loans must have has some federal guarantee from the lenders) 

Also, to really make the award money worthwhile, you have to put some money of your own into it.  Most people on my road could not.  They live paycheck to paycheck at a 100% expenditure rate out of necessity.  We made the best of of by doing much of the work ourselves as possible.  Now, you can tell the trim and baseboards wasn‚Äôt done by pros, but hey, who do we have to impress but ourselves? 

Also, and this changes due to a lawsuit out of Texas, of your residence was deemed out of code because of a pre-existing condition, they wouldn‚Äôt pay awards for those areas where it was not.  (Except lead remediation for some reason, which we had to do).  

Lastly, to actually do the repairs, you have to do it in 25% chunks at the most granular.  We had a very kind contractor that worked with us, but even they said while they could float the labor, they couldn‚Äôt float the material costs until we received reimbursement.  So we had to be able to float at least $5000 between disbursement chunks.  

We begged, borrowed, pleaded, and took out payroll advancements to make it happen, but most people on my road where not in a position to do that.  

A late stage inspector said many homes in our area where still in bad shape because the residents couldn‚Äôt make it work, or in some cases he thought they didn‚Äôt even bother trying to put the money in to half-arse it and used it elsewhere. 

That system is not well tuned to take the challenges of rural poor into account.

The good Louisiana is known for is called Cajun/Creole. Really the only difference between them is that Creole uses tomatoes. Louisiana food comes from generations of poor folks taught using french-hybrid techniques, making the best use of what they have on hand, and making it stretch as far as possible. Our food is heavily spiced(not necessarily spicy), often uses dark rouxs (cooked gravy-like base), seafood like crab and shrimp, classic sausages like boudin or andoullie, and then often includes rice since it's something that grows well here, as well as making the dish stretch further to feed more people for less.

An Easy off the cuff difference in culture; Sports. While south louisiana loves the saints, Shreveport (Northwest) is a big Cowboys fandom area. You could totally go deeper and talk about differences from Northwest versus new Orleans in the south east to Lake Charles in the southwest, and more. Cenla (Alexandria are) is not Acadiana is not New Orleans is not the North-shore of Lake Ponchartrain.    


Every city/town has its own weird festival and traditions. St. Landry parish closes schools for the first day of squirrel hunting season. Rayne loves frogs. Iberia parish has a sugar cane festival. Lafayette's biggest thing is probably Festival International. Mardi Gras is generally universally celebrated all over the state, but i think the north west of the state doesn't put as much hype behind it as you go further south. It may be different now, but I went to school in both Shreveport (1987-1994) and New Iberia (1994-2000), and in Shreveport we never got days off school for Mardi Gras.  


Sport-wise football is universally beloved. Saints and LSU Tigers the primary fandoms. High School football isn't as big as Texas but we have our year to year powerhouses like West Monroe, Evangel (Private school in Shreveport), and John Curtis (Private school in Shreveport).

So while they both spoke french, there are many differences in wording, syntax, and pronunciation. This lead to very different cultural, spiritual, and traditional identies.

The Creoles out west, who certainly have a connection to the New Orleans Louisiana Creoles, are creole in the broader use of the word (French speaking dialect) vs the more narrow use of new orleans Creole which is a specific group in New Orleans, and particularly the 7th ward.

New Orleans Ceroles have historicly been of french / African decent, lived in the city, held conciderable political and economic power, had access to education, and participated events such as balls and debutante coming outs.

Cajun are of French Canadian / first people's decent lived a substance agrarian lifstyle, held little political power outside their comunity, limited access to education, and was less aligned with French aristocrat customes and social events.

Two: All soda‚Äôs are called ‚ÄúCokes‚Äù.  And don‚Äôt call them a ‚Äúsoda pop‚Äù. 

Three:  The I49 project will never be completed.  Don‚Äôt move to south Lafayette of you have to go north for work, or frequently. 

Four:  Most people with the means are moving to either Scott, or way North Lafayette toward and into Carencro (not actual North Lafayette, that‚Äôs a garbage heap). 

Five: If you have kids, put them in private school, even if it is a non-profit.  There is a reason LA is within the top 2 in private schooling.  The public schools are a disgrace, with no plan to fix them beyond throwing money at the problem (which hasn‚Äôt worked, 29th in $/student, 49th in education.  It‚Äôs broke in ways money can‚Äôt fix alone) 

Six:  Avoid the I10 basin bridge at all costs.  It may literally save your live.  

Seven:  People tend toward trucks and vehicles that have higher ride heights in southern and central LA for a reason.  The roads flood.  ‚ÄúBro-trucks‚Äù are still stupid though, but they are tolerated more than other areas of the country.  

Eight: While the southern states are predominantly thought to be Protestant, the area is an exception to the rule in being mostly Catholic. This may or may not be a consideration depending on your worldviews.  

Nine: When I moved here as a kid I was at once called a yankee.  I explained that I was from WA state, and that it wasn‚Äôt even a state during the civil war and had no meat in the game.  This was the way wrong answer.  

Ten:  Generally, don‚Äôt comment on any persons peculiarities in speech or pronunciation.  This is something they will take personally.    

Eleven:  Be comfortable with firearm ownership.  LA per capita is roughly four times that of Michigan.  (Between 24-25 per person). If you have kids, this means it is a ‚Äòmust‚Äô to inform them on gun safety at an early age, even if you plan not owning none.  

Twelve:  People are generally more sociable with, and willing to open up dialogue with a stranger.  If this happens while you are on with your day, return the gesture.  Not doing so will pin you as ‚Äúa high and mighty yankee‚Äù.

Momo tea for traditional Thai tea with boba. They have all sorts of other teas and Asian type drinks there and it is just a cool place to meet up with a friend.

1242,1242,QueefyConQueso,"I agree, but I think a lot of this is a ‚Äúso how do you like it?‚Äù mirroring of how the Democrats turtled up around Clinton during his impeachment proceedings. 

Ultimately, the Democrats pushed for no witnesses during the trail, infuriating Republicans, and decided on video taped testimony.  Or, not even that iirc, but excerpts from the tapes. 

Several Democrats continually tried dismissing them altogether and went non-stop, calling it a ‚Äúlynching‚Äù.  

Personally, I think the accusations are on a different level of import in the two cases, and they should be more worried about upholding the constitution, than taking the situation as a chance for some kind of revenge play by serving the opposing party a dose of its own partisan medicine.  

A president lying about a BJ, while presenting a situation that could be exploited if there is an active coverup, is not quite the same as withholding congressionally approved funding.  The presidents job is to uphold the constitution, and I don‚Äôt feel trying to root out wrongdoing (there doesn‚Äôt seem to be evidence that there was at this point) by a powerful American isn‚Äôt wrong in and of itself.  But using congressionally approved funds as leverage is, potentially, a much bigger abuse of power as compared to covering up a sexual encounter.

Nor have most of her family, even the younger ones. They say it's for tourists only and the locals have much better things to do.

Rural and small-town Texas is still trying to cling to the 19th century, but they're being slowly but firmly defeated in that by the fact that FIVE of the nation's 13 largest cities are located in Texas. Texas is FAR more heavily urbanized than most outsiders realize.

And all those Texas cities are pretty much like urban areas everywhere else in the country in terms of relatively liberal politics, liberal social views, and the willingness these days of younger residents to move easily from one city to any other city in the country for their jobs. So cities all over the country cross-pollinate with each other and *none* of them gets along with their surrounding conservative hinterlands.

Compare the situation in Texas to Louisiana, which has only one semi-large city -- and that ranks #50 in size in the U.S. The entire rest of the state is ""hinterland."" Same problem in Alabama, which has only Birmingham, and Mississippi, where Jackson, the largest city, is only 3/4 the size of Baton Rouge.

As far as asking for dirt?  /shrug.  Let‚Äôs be real, if the Chinese intelligence agency presented the DNC with evidence that POTUS blackmailed electoral college voters, we would all outwardly condemn them for spying, but welcome the info with open arms and gleefully jail the guy.  

But, and this is a hard truth, if the senate pushes forwards and ‚Äúclears‚Äù him, in so much that means anything at this point, before the next election, what does that mean? 

Probably, for most engaging in conversation on here, they would see it as it is.  An abuse of power allowed not do to the legality of it, but tribal politics.

For the broad voting public?   This is a public who 19% believes in spells and witchcraft.  Something like 2/3rds believe demons actively roam the earth.  They will believe that the senates acquittal, dismissal, or whatever has cleared his office of any wrong doing.  

It‚Äôs a hard truth to accept, but these are our neighbors, co-workers, teachers.  Most people will not interpret the evidence and make their own conclusions, but just accept the senates verdict as true and just.  This is our America, like it or not, and I think her zeal will do more harm than good.  

In a sense, I‚Äôm thankful I know more, as I am more convinced somebody needs to check the power of the executive branch, and it‚Äôs been a long time coming even before the current admin, but I‚Äôm also troubled that it will convince the masses he did nothing wrong and it‚Äôs all business as usual.",1579727290,ffa3qtp
1290,1290,BudgetBaby,"There seems to be a bit of a disconnect here - my comment was based on the notion that the president believes it's an ""open and shut case"" because it's supposedly obvious that he did nothing wrong. However, in your replies, I'm getting the sense that the ""open and shut case"" claim was made by the prosecution, so they would want witnesses to prove such. I would completely agree with the notion that a truly open and shut case needs no witnesses, and the Democrats would too. They want witnesses in the case because they believe there is fault to the defendant's case, so witnesses are needed as evidence to prove such. 

However, all that I've provided above relies on the assumption of an issue with causality and motivations. But you also posed the issue of cost, so I will gladly address this issue as well. To start, how much *would* these witnesses cost? Well, I couldn't find an exact figure for the notion, as it's all speculative in the first place. However, it is estimated that over the three-month inquiry into impeachment done by the House, the total cost [summed just over $3 million](https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/12/18/heres-how-much-the-formal-impeachment-inquiry-has-cost-taxpayers-so-far/). That may seem like a large sum at first, but relatively speaking, $3 million over three months is a rather small figure. For example, it is estimated that the 2018 government shutdown [costed $1.18 *billion* in total lost labor](https://infogram.com/shutdown-unpaid-workers-1hzj4oegy0dp2pw). That's not even considering the two trillion dollars the already impeached President put into defense over Iran tensions or the [$124 million spent on Trump's golfing](https://www.trumpgolfcount.com/) alone during his term. Of course, this $3 million benchmark I've been using is not even the estimate for the simple witnesses - it includes the entire impeachment inquiry, which had several witnesses involved as well as other evidence-gathering and intelligence costs along with it. To say that it's a waste of taxpayer dollars would be a bit strange without first questioning the costs I have laid out above. I understand caution in government spending, but there's always a bigger fish that many choose to ignore.",1579729971,ffa8jrr
1291,1291,General_Hide,"Both sides believe it is open and shut, or at least are trying to make it seem that way when they talk about it. The fact of the matter is that both are wrong.

The democrats dont want witnesses to get to the truth in this trial. They know Trump will never be removed by the senate and they know that there will never be sufficient evidence of an actual crime. This is all an election year gambit in order to drag down Trumps chances in the upcoming election and to electrify their base. This is why many republicans are not wanting witnesses, because its a waste of time aimed at attacking the current admin and their party. I actually disagree and think they should have witnesses and call their own forward to fight fire with fire. I think the democrats have a lot more to lose in this than the republicans honestly and republicans should call the Bidens and anyone else they need to in order to make the case of how Trump's actions were a look towards 2016 instead of 2020. They could use this trial to drag Joe Biden through the mud.

Also, cost of other things Trump has done is no counter argument. You sound bright enough to not need to venture down that road to make an argument.

Speaking of which, maybe you can tell me something. I'm honestly only half paying attention to the trial at the moment because I really don't think it's going to present anything new or noteworthy and so im not really interested in what rules they vote on, but its my understanding that Mitch wanted to go through arguments before having the senate vote to decide what evidence and witnesses to bring to the senate and the Democrats wanted instead to vote at the beginning on evidence and witnesses. What precisely was the vote you reference in your original post? Did they vote no to deciding on witnesses at the beginning of the trial or to having any witnesses at all?",1579731276,ffaaubl

Its primary use is in packaging (plastic bags, plastic films, geomembranes, containers including bottles, etc.). Many kinds of polyethylene are known, with most having the chemical formula (C2H4)n.

As far as criminal activity goes, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the majority of the state is poor as fuck with no job prospects outside of oil and gas. Maybe if Louisiana tried to diversify a little bit instead of suckling at the teat of Big Oil, we wouldn‚Äôt be enslaved to oil prices and we wouldn‚Äôt be so impoverished. More people with jobs means less people committing crimes. 

Our state has an engrained ‚Äúgood old boy‚Äù system that is cancerous. Everything is based on nepotism and quid pro quo. These things are more common in red states, as far as I‚Äôve seen. We‚Äôre just flat out corrupt, and pretty blatant about it. That‚Äôs just how things are done here and no one seems to give a shit.

For many justice systems, including ours and most systems, liberal democratic society, communist socialist state, or dictatorship, ones crime is not considered in an vacuum.  Your criminal past is part of your criminal future, even if the law you break is petty and ill conceived. 

In this case, he was on trail as much for being a habitual criminal as for a single joint.  Two counts of robbery, and simple theft.  

These laws came about when statistically, these individuals where shown to be the most likely to commit a serious crime like murder, or be killed themselves.  Better a jail cell than a casket was the mantra. Much of this born out of chronic gang violence of the 80‚Äôs and early 90‚Äôs.  

Is that fair in this case?  Is the law serving a purpose and protecting not only the public, but the man on trial life?  

/shrug. I dunno.  Not enough info to determine if he was an at risk case.  It might very well be he was a reformed man who‚Äôs greatest crime from here on out was selling the occasional J and getting high. 

I think present day theories of criminal justice is of the thought that while multi-strike rules may put a tourniquet on violent death in the short term, it doesn‚Äôt do anything to solve the underlying problems that led to that state to begin with.  

And let‚Äôs be frank here.  It‚Äôs one thing to sit around and get high all day.  To each his own.  But to be a multiple felony convict and sell an illicit substance? Even if the law is a bad one?

When somebody like him ends up killed, or killing somebody, and you have your constituents asking you ‚Äúwhy did you let this person go again and again and again until somebody dies?‚Äù  You change the law so that doesn‚Äôt happen anymore.  He could have been selling bootleg DVD‚Äôs of crappy 80‚Äôs sitcoms. 

His wrap sheet as a violent offender, and a low level drug dealer puts him in a group of people very likely to do violence, or have violence done against them.  

Should these multi-offender laws be in place?  In a well working system, maybe not.  

If, for instance after his 1st offense there was a system in place to find out why this happened.  Addiction? PTSD? Lack or work? And address those problematic maybe we wouldn't have so many repeat offenders. 

Buy we don't.  And nobody wanted to be the person that told this guy's family, or the family of another ""Yep, we are just going to let this pattern repeat itself until he or someone gets killed, our hands are tied"".

1581,1581,AlabasterPelican,"It's really hard for me to prescribe solutions as a single person, I think this is going to have to be something we are going to have to figure out on a societal level. But, I will give it a swing. 

1). Toxic masculinity: this is something we are going to need to define and understand. When people talk about it people often make the assumption that this term is saying that **all** masculinity is toxic, it certainly is not. We're at a crossroads in society where gender roles are being redefined due to societal and cultural changes that have taken place, this appears to be most acutely felt by males. The old stereotypical aggressive, cold, alpha male is no longer of much use in this day in age though it feels as if that's what is being latched on to by certain subsets of the populace &amp; it's becoming problematic. We are somehow going to need to shift that masculinity to a more modern understanding of masculinity that is inclusive &amp; deeply personal. At this point I feel I need to say, toxic feminity is a problem as well, it just doesn't appear to be manifesting itself in the same destructive manner as it's counterpart. 

2). War on drugs: firstly we need to legalize marijuana. Secondly decriminalize all other drugs. Third release those who are incarcerated for possession. Fourth shift our focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment (this can be applied much farther than drug offenses but I'm just focusing on this). Fifth reintegration into society. 

3). Economic mobility: **education** is probably the most important aspect of fixing this. Our current system of school funding is absolutely abhorrent. Most of the time the schools are tied directly to the property taxes collected, this tends to lead to great schools in wealthy areas &amp; underperforming schools in poor area's. The next thing is free public secondary education. The cost of secondary education is leaving it outside of the grasp of many people &amp; those who do gain secondary education they are often crippled by debt. Unionization of laborer's is also another way to increase economic mobility.


4). Perseverance porn: this shit just needs to stop, period. Please follow the links provided in my original reply to understands what's wrong here. 

5). Moral blight: somehow as a society we have been snookered into looking at those with assets as somehow morally superior to those who lack them. We have also something began equating poor to morally corrupt and deserving of their situations. We need to have a society wide change of mindset here. 

6). Punching up: this ties into #5. We are often propagandized into blaming those on the bottom rungs for the ills we are feeling in our lives. I.e, those ""illegals"" are taking our jobs. Bullshit your boss is getting rid of you because the undocumented migrant is far easier to exploit &amp; at a much cheaper cost. The migrant is just trying to provide for them and theirs the same way you are trying to provide for you &amp; your's. Holding those in power accountable for their actions &amp; recognizing that there is more in common between you &amp; those on the lower rungs than you and your boss is critical.

The only way to take charge of your economic future is to gain economic power.  The only way for poor people to gain economic power is through the workforce.  When enough people in the local community are invested in the workforce, the neighborhood ceases to be a blighted ghetto.

Today, if more than half the residents have broadband internet, I'd be shocked. I'd throw money on people still using AOL there.

Northwest Louisiana was literally nothing going on in the 70s. The oil boom was over and done, people were poor. The most excitement would have been found in Shreveport at that time, with concert venues and.. that's really about it. The annual state fair? 

How you randomly picked the most boring part of Louisiana, I'll never know. If you want incredibly poor small sleepy town with backwards ignorant racists (in the 70s, 100%).. then i guess you found it.

Northern Louisiana is not southern Louisiana. It likes to claim it is, but it's really not. Northern Louisiana is East Texas. I'm from Shreveport, I've lived south of I-10.. completely different places. In this time frame, You're more likely to find a good Texas style barbeque restaurant with honky tonk playing through some terrible speakers than you are a proper Cajun broil up with zydeco and some bastardized francophone. Seafood has to get shipped, it's more expensive and a bit more upper crusty than grabbing a few pounds of shrimp at the dock, or going out crabbing at 2AM under a full moon.

Bible belt for days and days. Southern Baptists and Methodists, mostly. Like, ""dear Jesus let this jackpot bingo card be a winner so I can finally afford to pay off my trailer"" bible belt. (again, in the 70s.. not so bad now, but traces of that can still be found)

I think you are going to confuse your audience a bit, because people are often confused about Louisiana. Ontario is not just Toronto. New York is not just New York City... Louisiana is not just New Orleans/Lafayette/Lake Charles.

If you want that more southern Louisiana Cajun feel with some bible thumping intolerant small minded people, I recommend checking into places like Sulphur, De Ridder, or Bogalusa. (again, in the 70s)

One  such  town  was  Paincourtville.  It  was  notable to me for its  small size  and  miniscule post Office.  I   also  stopped  to  eat  there.  It  has a  population  of  about  800.  It  was  named  for  an  early  settler  who  could  not  afford a loaf  of  bread.   Pain  court  ville  is  translated  from  french meaning  loosely  where  I cannot  buy a loaf  of  bread.

1777,1777,QueefyConQueso,"If they are not wisely spending current income, they are probably not going to wisely spend any additional revenue.  

And it‚Äôs not like LA residents are unwilling to pay more taxes or find new revenue sources.  There was a recent tax/tax extension for roadworks at the state level, that residents were initially against because of consistent misappropriation.  They wrote the tax law so the money could only 100% be applied to roadwork, and not siphoned off for pet projects and it had broad support and got passed.  

I think the whole LA lotto and and gambling debacle poisoned people to ideas like legalizing Mary Jane.  Or at least from a revenue generation perspective. It was sold as money for schools and local police departments.  I think it largely got allocated to general funds, which are a haven for public waste and mismanagement. 

As far as the no win on corporate taxes?  There is truth in that.  There is a YT video on LA cooperate taxes that spells it out in a graph.  I think with the challenges LA faces we should be the top of the list, the most attractive state, tax wise to do business in.  But not to that degree.  We are waaaaay last the point of diminishing returns. 

We shouldn‚Äôt be more that 10-20% higher in tax exemptions than the next highest state.  And it should be kept that way until we can foster a system that attracts businesses for other reasons.  And FFS not have so much of our income dependent on the price of oil like some 3rd world nation.

The #1 issue that seems to come up is an educated, quality workforce.  

Higher education just flat out needs more funding.  Primary education is broken in a way money alone can‚Äôt fix, in a state that has education reform fatigue.

If you widen your scope then you might see that there are a lot of police departments plagued with crap cops.  This in of itself shouldn't be a big deal in that you would think/hope that those bad apples get weeded out.  What usually occurs is the department will close ranks and hide behind their ""thin blue line"" and do whatever they feel they can get away with to cover for their bad apples brothers in blue.  

Because of the thin blue line mentality holding cops accountable (ESPECIALLY cops that have friends in higher positions in a department/local govt) is next to impossible.  It is difficult to even find a attorney who will bring a case against a Police department because those attorneys know that department will become petty and vindictive towards them as a result (this occurs regardless if the case is legit or not).

If I felt confident that bad apples would be held accountable instead of usual line of ""we investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong""  then I might see things from your point of view.

People are hungry for football year round; this is why the NFL network exists and also why the draft is treated like a mini-super bowl. that could lead to the XFL being successful if the level of play is high and exciting, and if fans take to some of the rule changes featured by the XFL. IF that happens the league will look to expand by adding a couple of teams every few seasons, and this is how I could see an XFL team coming to LA.

Although I do agree with the notion that they may cede football territory to the Saints and the LSU tigers (unless they try to draw on a fanbase from south/west Miss. as well). But even if so, itd be damn interesting to have a ""South Louisiana"" team focusing on a region (i.e. New England Pats) instead of a city. They could even be based in Lafayette and play in the Cajun Dome. 

Laffy would be a good location too, drawing from a decent sized metro area, as well as fans from the Lake Charles metro to the west and the Baton Rouge area to the east; I think that would give them a sizeable enough local fanbase right in the heart of Acadiana.

You‚Äôre stuffing votes into a black box that is vulnerable to a wide array of security issues. What just happened in the Iowa democratic caucuses is a great demonstration of how this can go wrong. You open up the electoral process to claims, true or not, that the election was hacked or that the results were tampered with.

I will tell you that every machine that is used for an election has multiple vote simulations run on it. This is basically casting a vote for everything on the ballot for that election to make sure the machine is working properly.

Personally I highly doubt some state employ would either

 A: tamper with the machine themselves. 

Or

B: ignore an obvious flaw in the machine.

Both of which would be easily tracked back to that individual and both of which would likely end in them losing their job. 

Also none of the machines new or old connect to the internet. So any sort of manipulation would require physical contact with the machine.

Any other form of tampering would have to be done by someone working at the Sec of State office which could be done with any form of voting input not just electronic.",1581313244,fh72wg9

Although it‚Äôs unlikely that an off-network machine is going to be hacked, it is hypothetically possible for someone to gain physical access. And, while any system of collecting votes is going to have weaknesses, what makes the most sense to me is having a physical record of a vote, not a digitally encoded record. This reduces the probability of what is at best a messy debate over the integrity of the vote counts, and at worst, of voters losing faith in the electoral process and the resultant suppressed turnout. I think people would be (rightfully) skeptical of electronic voting, and more likely to think of it as rigged.

History
Established in 1896 by Harold and Alfred Harmsworth and Kennedy Jones,¬†The Daily Mail is a tabloid newspaper in the UK. It is edited by Geordie Greig,¬†who took over as editor in November 2018 from Paul Dacre, who had been the editor since 1992. The Daily Mail‚Äôs parent company is DMGT,¬†which owns newspapers including the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and The Metro. The chairman is Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere, who inherited the media empire founded by his great-grandfather Harold and his brother Alfred a century earlier. Harold Sidney Harmsworth¬†is also known to be a admirer of Mussolini and supporter of Nazi Germany.

Funded by / Ownership
The Daily Mail‚Äôs parent company is Daily Mail and General Trust or DMGT¬†and its chairman is¬†Jonathan Harmsworth who inherited the media empire founded by his great-grandfather Harold Sidney Harmsworth. The¬†Executive Committee¬†is listed on their about page.
DMGT also publishes the Mail on Sunday and Metro titles, and besides journalism, DMGT includes risk management, event organization such as conferences, training sessions, seminars and is the largest shareholder in property portal Zoopla,¬†which was recently sold to Silver Lake. The main revenue of the Daily Mail is digital advertising, print ads and subscription fees. 


Analysis / Bias

The Daily Mail is a known a supporter of the Conservatives. They are also one of the pro-Brexit tabloids and according to a Reuters¬†article, the¬†Daily Mail published a controversial headline in response to a Brexit Court ruling criticizing the judges, by branding them as ‚Äòenemies of the people‚Äô According to CNBC, the Daily mail also has been criticized by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales for publishing fake news articles and ‚Äúhyped up‚Äù headlines and ‚Äúmastered the art of running stories that aren‚Äôt true‚Äô‚Äù. ¬†Further, CNBC reported that DMG media responded by saying ‚ÄúDailyMail.com is the very antithesis of click-bait and hype headlines. We just tell stories better than anyone else.‚Äù
In review, the Daily Mail tends to publish stories utilizing sensationalized headlines with emotionally loaded wordings such as ‚ÄúWoman, 63, ‚Äòbecomes PREGNANT in the mouth‚Äô with baby squid after eating calamari‚Äù, which is a misleading headline.¬†In 2017, Wikipedia banned the Daily Mail as an ‚Äòunreliable‚Äô¬†source. When it comes to sourcing information¬†they use minimal hyperlinked sourcing as well as sourcing to themselves. In general, most stories favor the right, however the Daily Mail will report either side if the story is sensational enough.

A factual search reveals that the Daily Mail has a poor track record with fact checkers.

Overall, we rate Daily Mail Questionable due to numerous failed fact checks and poor sourcing of information. (7/19/2016) Updated (M. Huitsing 10/24/2019)

2236,2236,elthee,"I don't know about that. I am thinking one could make a very good argument that he did not care one whit about the common person, and used his popular platforms as a means of getting votes and support. Once he got power, he got pretty dictatorial. FDR called him one of the most dangerous men in America.

Share Our Wealth sounds good, and what he wanted for that was to give the equivalent of $5000 to every American family, for the purpose of getting a car, a radio, and other various other conveniences. But critics at the time said that to do even $1400 to every family, he would have to tax 100% of all income over $4000. But Long was big on wealth redistribution. He laid it all out in a book called My First Days in the White House, which is available cheap for the kindle, if you want to read more on it in his own words. He released the book ahead of a planned presidential run before his assassination.

The main reason he opposed FDR is because he said his reforms did not go far enough, and that Long's way was the best way to prevent a popular communist uprising. 

But you cannot overlook the fact that he was very corrupt once he got power. He started going through state boards and commissions and worked to fire anyone even suspected of not being 100% loyal to him personally. He took kickbacks from all state contracts as well. He did his best to destroy anyone who defied him. 

But on the other hand, he did grow up dirt poor, and understood just how much the average family struggled. And he did not just say he would support the common man, he actually did it. Free textbooks, infrastructure, improvements in the medical system for the state, and so on. 

I love reading about this guy. Whether you believe he was good, evil, somewhere in between, you cannot deny the man was one of the most fascinating people to come out of Louisiana.",1581440834,fhbeu1x

A million, corrected for inflation, is $18,903,050. 

$2500 would be $47,258

He didn‚Äôt propose the pay increase directly, but he is proposing sending more money to the districts and the pay increase supposed to come out of that pool.

That does not justify a carte blanche attitude on the part of municipalities and government. But I see the problem of city, states, and the federal government getting turned out by industry as a problem of character failing. Specifically *our* failing. 

In nearly any kind of transaction, the money-making party will push for the most lax oversight (and subsidies for bad decisions) because, of course they will! Who doesn‚Äôt want to get rich 24/7 with no rules on them? Everybody takes that deal.

I blame us. We‚Äôve weak, craven, greedy apathetic, lazy, selfish, cowards who elect politicians just as bad and worst.

We don‚Äôt organize. We don‚Äôt talk. We don‚Äôt strike. We don‚Äôt fight. Hell, most of us go days, weeks even, without looking a person in the eye. Capitalists spent decades dividing us into meaningless groups over single issues so we would forget the one group to which we ALL belong: Labor. Meaning, the people who HAVE to sell their time and skill to a person or business for a wage in order to live.

But now we‚Äôre all our own tiny, little niche within a niche. Consider the shirts you see in a Wal-Mart saying (paraphrasing): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Welder...‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Gamer...‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Nerd...‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a pipe-fitter‚Äù... and so on and so on.

We are spending our money to advertise our identity as being defined not by our beliefs, or community, or families, or ideals...but by the jobs we perform and brands we buy to make somebody else rich. 

If you do those jobs or have those interests I mean no insult to you. I‚Äôm trying to point out the psychology of Divide and Conquer. We‚Äôre all racing to further separate ourselves from each other over things that don‚Äôt matter as much as the thing that unites nearly all of us: Getting up every day for the rest of our lives to perform a task or skill to create a revenue. But we who create that revenue have virtually no say in how it gets split between us and the folks on the Capital side (large stake shareholders, investors, board members, execs, upper management, etc.) Only the Capital folks get that day. They do none of the work‚Äîafter allocating funds, obviously‚Äîbut get all of the power.

You think when the Capital folks get together, they argue amongst themselves over eating meat or veggie? Being gay or straight? Abortion being legal or legal? Owning guns or gun control? Or being Democratic or Republican? 

Nope. Or at least nothing more than a minor disagreement amongst friends. They are united in the only identity they share: Being of the Capital class who decide how power and wealth is distributed in this country. They act as one class, one mind, one motive, one mission: Get rich while the rest of us die trying. 

Folks back in the 1940s, 1930s, 1920s, and early 20th century used to go to war with their bosses and company owners. Literal war. They fought and died to get the rights we‚Äôve pissed away fighting amongst ourselves over bullshit that doesn‚Äôt matter as much as what we do every day of our lives with time we will never get back: working for a living. 

Stop blaming the rich for taking the bigger piece. We need to be blaming ourselves for being so bent and cowed that we beg them, ‚ÄúPretty please, Boss, can I be the one who cuts it up for you and then we‚Äôll sing you a song about how smart you were to get that biggest piece and how if you didn‚Äôt always get the biggest piece there would never be any pie anywhere for anyone ever again!

This is my term for the political and business movers and shakers in the large LA AfAm population centers. Many are people of great character and decency who have tried at every turn to extend their success and influence into their community to lift them up just as they have been lifted. And then there are the ones carrying time-honored American tradition of Grifting. The rabble-rousing con artists who never seem to be doing much of anything except holding and gaining more power and making more and more money. Then, when the communities implode over one legitimate controversy (looking at you, NOPD AND BPRD) or another the Grifters drown out the servants and eat as much camera they can in order to position themselves for greater power and more money, be it bribes, kickbacks, money laundering, whatever is convenient.

This arrangement, sadly, exists in nearly every major US municipality. However the damage this eco-system of sustained, formalized corruption dies infinitely more damaged to poor and disenfranchised communities that would require a sustained Restorative and Reconstruction effort (including public trials and potentially executions)somewhere near  on level of the US rebuilding Germany and Japan then remaining in those countries to oversee its continued implementation and ensure its survival. 

Regarding the educational assessment of Louisiana residence, if you don‚Äôt include majority AfAm schools in BR and NOLA metro, the results aren‚Äôt as shockingly low. The fact is, we failed them. Whites racists failed them, ‚Äúpolite‚Äù White moderates failed them, and the craven opportunists in their own communities failed them. 

I blame to much-too kind heart of Lincoln. Had he gone scorched-earth, it‚Äôs likely Booth isn‚Äôt alive to kill Lincoln. And with Lincoln ascending to essentially a dictator until Reconstruction‚Äôs completion, maybe places like Tulsa and Stillwater would be the African American touchstone cities of today and the Republican Party would be the activist, social justice party with a bevy of non-white and women members. Maybe not. Maybe something in between. 

It is amazing how loud and long one shot of a pistol can ring. When you turn on your TV and see all this Confederacy, ‚ÄúAmerica is a White Christian nation‚Äù, nonsense...what you are hearing...what seems to be more and more deafening by the day...is the ringing of John Wilkes Booth‚Äôs pistol.

&gt; A trio of Tulane students at the helm of a new environmental nonprofit organization hopes to finally implement a sustainable glass recycling program in New Orleans.

&gt; Max Landy, Max Steitz and Franziska Trautmann, founders of Plant the Peace, recently launched a crowd-funding campaign through GoFundMe in an effort to make glass recycling convenient and efficient with their proposed NOLA Glass-to-Sand Recycling Program.

&gt; The city of New Orleans has experienced a number of issues with recycling programs in the past, particularly regarding glass.

More recently, after Clinton, then Bush Jr. was unable to bring bad actors like Bin Ladin to task due to overly complicated chains of command, approval and notification processes, and departmental tribalism, it was streamlined even more, with more autonomy granted to the president.  

With the development of drones, this really reached a crescendo with Obama.  

While even Obama‚Äôs critics had to concede he was really good at killing terrorists and bad guys, there was the question of ‚Äúwe are ok with this now, with someone who is using this power wisely, even if we agree/disagree with everything else he‚Äôs doing, but what happens if the next person we don‚Äôt?‚Äù

The documents show that the companies manipulated the guest-worker visa program in a plan Pesquera says was predicated on not hiring American welders or pipe fitters.""

Note that this torpedoes state-funded programs to develop local skillsets in these areas. It undermines attempts to develop this skillset in Louisiana citizens by flooding the market with cheap illegally imported labor. Problem with training Americans to do these jobs? Americans have labor rates and protections which are higher and more politically visible than that of immigrants. 

So while Rispone's ISC was partnering with RPCC to train skilled laborers in Louisiana, Landry was competing with Louisiana workers to hire immigrant labor instead.

This also results in suppressing hourly labor rates for Louisiana workers.

But it gets better: While putting up a billboard and talking up the RPCC+ISC partnership and all the good PR, Rispone exploited the system for cheap immigrant labor too:  [https://www.bayoubrief.com/2019/07/31/eddie-rispone-relies-on-controversial-program-that-outsources-jobs-to-foreign-workers/](https://www.bayoubrief.com/2019/07/31/eddie-rispone-relies-on-controversial-program-that-outsources-jobs-to-foreign-workers/)",1581692346,fhkw9l8

A basic drug test can tell how much THC is in your system.  More advanced drug tests are being developed to tell if someone is stoned at the moment. In fact make a good one, you'll be a millionaire.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Would there be an upper limit intoxication level for driving a vehicle like the 0.8 blood alcohol level?

Yes. They are already able to convict OWI for certain drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Would the taxes go to the general state fund to be pissed away? Or, by law, ear marked for schools and such?

It's Louisiana, taxes are always pissed away. We tax the wrong things anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How does, or how should cannabis use effect the rates insurance companies charge for medical/auto/life insurance?

It shouldn't have any effect to my knowledge. The biggest threat to our insurance rates are our tort policies and trial lawyers.

&gt;The case for cannabinoids for medical use seems pretty straight forward.  Recreational use a little less so.

I think it's not that straight forward. Tons of research has to be done to prove any medical benefits.

I'd argue that legalizing it for recreational use is much more beneficial to society than medical use. Not less so. It can, and will replace alcohol in some settings. It can and will replace casual opioid use in some settings. It will reduce the number of people imprisoned for possession.

Actually, no. Drug screens are typically done by immunoassay and are positive/negative. Further testing CAN be done using liquid chromatography (usually) and can be quantitatively measured.

""Stoned at the moment"" testing does exist in the form of blood tests, which are usually used in legal cases as they can only detect cannibinoids for a few hours, essentially determining if a person was likely under the influence at the time.",1582049192,fi12953

Also, if someone who ""works in a plant"" tells you about anything other than their exact job they know even less than I do most likely. The work in most chemical plants is so automated and delegated so specifically it is nearly impossible to understand what is being used as feedstock, where it came from, and what is being made unless you're managing the plant.

Yes to your second question. Think about how much more complex the offshore situation is than the onshore, piers, underwater welders, boats, long offshore pipelines, ports. All add layers of complexity to the oil and ng extraction process. Plus, we do something similar to hydraulic fracking in the gulf anyway, so even that isn't a barrier between the two.

The first quedtion is a bit complex. Most ""plants"", which are actually many production lines in one complex, can make many different products, they just need the right feedstock (aka input, in most products cases that is NG, LNG, or some petroleum derivative) and the right tooling, pipes, and finishing equipment. 

On the gulf coast we have two main kinds of plants. ""Midstream"" and end product (not sure what industry word is) plants.

Midstream plants turn petroleum, or NG into another feedstock. A common one are hexanes, which are refined and derived from NG and used in making many plastics, such as polyethylene.

End product plants take the midstream, or sometimes original feedstock, and make something else out of it. I.e. Ronpak's grocery bag plant (and headquarters) in shreveport. Also manufacturers of water bottles, which are usually next door to the bottling plants themselves.

There was a plant near Baton Rouge called East West Copolymer that made synthetic rubber products for other manufacturers.

It‚Äôs more frustration than stupidity.  At least by the average joe I speak to.  People are at their limit, in a state with a (2017) per capita income of $25,885.

And a, while not unjustified, out of proportion at least, anger at what they see as groups of people that perpetually make bad decisions in life being indefinitely supported by their hard work.  

Its out of proportion, because most people I know getting state/federal assistance are hard working people and families, that while do work, just do a job society doesn‚Äôt value with very good compensation.  

Those few that do not have an oversized footprint in the perception, that your average person, has on taxation.

I agree, teacher pay should be reasonably high on that list, it‚Äôs one of the few things we can tackle in LA problematic education system by throwing money at it alone, but that‚Äôs a whole lot things to do with only so much money.  

The fact that LA should reign in tax breaks that have gone way past diminishing returns is irrelevant to JBE.  He has to work with the budget he has, not the one he wants.  

As an aside, it‚Äôs usually not directly teachers pay that get states in a bind, it‚Äôs the retirement and pension obligations.  I ‚Äúthink‚Äù LA has a defined benefit program, which means the benefits are a fixed formula based on pay and years of service.  So there is a down the road cost associated as well one has to try to plan for.  And I‚Äôd be truly shocked if LA teacher retirement obligations are fully funded as it stands.  

It‚Äôs easy for me to sit back in the cut and scream ‚Äúraise teachers pay!‚Äù (And I am) but I‚Äôd hate to be the person deciding what not to fund to make it happen, knowing I‚Äôm kicking the retirement obligations down the road for somebody else to figure out.",1582294142,fia6dsx

Spring and fall however are beautiful.  And stay in the populated parts of the park and you‚Äôll be fine.

After you've rendered a bit more fat from the seasoned sausage and browned it up a bit, reserve to the side. Drop in your trinity and start sweating it until onions are translucent.

Drain the soaked beans, add them, a ham hock, chunk of pickled pork if desired and some fresh water, bring to a rolling boil, reduce to simmer and let it go for a few hours, stirring occasionally. I add the sausage back to the pot in the last 30-60 minutes of simmer time on the stove so it still has some bite to it but you can add it when you're bringing everything else together with the beans. When that hock falls apart easily and your beans are bursting and mashable, you're good to go. Taste. If it needs a bit of acid, add a splash of vinegar to taste - you won't need much. Mount a couple pats of butter for added richness if desired. Cook up that rice, chop some fresh parsley, green onions and serve with a good vinegary hot sauce, pickled hot peppers if you're fancy.

My two pot pressure cooker method involves the same process but instead of soaked beans, I have the pressure cooker going with the water, dry beans and ham hock in it. When it comes time to add the beans and water, I'm just adding the contents of the pressure cooker to the aromatic base I've been building then proceeding as stated above.",1582825736,fixs0b8
3136,3136,LeChuckly,"One thing I figured out getting involved in LA politics, and this is particularly true in North Louisiana, is that Democrats are poor and the consequences are heavy. 

There are few people who are willing to publicly run for office and endure the potential damage to their business relationships or jobs altogether (e.g. Ryan Trundle was summarily fired from his job as a service technician for running as a progressive in district 4).

This may not be the case in urban areas where people don't pay a price for being liberal - but in the north it requires a pound of flesh.

3234,3234,Yohfay,"If you can make it here for that time, Festival International in Lafayette is a whole lot of fun. That'll be April 22-26, so it's coming up pretty soon. A lot of cool music groups from all over the world show up and play, and the festival itself is free. It's very much a world music festival rather than a cajun/creole/zydeco kind of thing, but you'll see some local bands playing as well, some of which will play more traditional stuff.

Festivals Acadiens et Creoles is in October, and that's where you want to go for more traditional cajun/creole music if that's what you're into. 

You're not going to be able to find many people who speak french fluently in the Lafayette area, although there are probably some of them still around. We are trying to revive the language here, but it was quite literally beaten out of my grandmother's generation in school. She refused to speak french to us or even admit that she spoke it despite it being her first language because of that school conditioning. 

There's a lot of good food around here too. If you end up going to Festival International, there's an outdoor bar called The Wurst Biergarten. They usually host Hawk's Boil Up during that time, and you can get a good platter of boiled crawfish there. They're right on the festival grounds (which is basically the entire downtown area of the city), so it's a nice place to sit down, have a beer, and take a break if need be. 

Feel free to ask any more specific questions if you think of them. I'm no expert, but I have lived in the area my whole life. If you do show up for Festival International, I'll definitely be there (I always am), and if you seek me out, I can show you around the festival.",1582862968,fizhi7g

But when it comes to physical competition?  There are biological realities, not cultural constructs, at play. This is especially apparent in any combat sport (MMA, boxing, kickboxing, etc.).  It has to be taken into account there is a very real difference between XY and XX chromosome individuals in that sense.  

This matters less in modern combat, since the lethality of our modern technology compensates for most differences.  A 5‚Äô5 120 lb boy can be as deadly with an AK as a 200 lb man.  But in sporting, where the point is to minimize artificial advantage, it matter a lot.  

‚Äú*The SRY gene was previously thought to be involved only in the development of male genitalia in the womb, but the proteins produced by this gene have now been found also in the brain and other organs. It turns out that these SRY proteins regulate the secretion of neurotransmitters known as catecholamines, which include norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, and play an important role in neural activity, cardiovascular function, and movement. The SRY gene and its proteins may contribute to the release of large amounts of norepinephrine in the blood stream and the increase in blood pressure and motor activity occurring after stress in men, which in turn, facilitate the expression of the fight-or-flight response*‚Äù.",1582895651,fj0bioi

The Novel Coronavirus is absolutely a public safety threat. I don‚Äôt believe in ever fear mongering, no matter how big the threat, but an honest assessment is necessary. What we know right now is the mortality rate of Novel Coronavirus is somewhere around 2%. It COULD be lower than that if there are mild cases that are going unreported in much healthier populations, which is likely. The mortality rate of seasonal influenza is about 0.1%, which still kills tens of thousands in America each year. If this spreads as it looks like it might, this could become a crisis and overrun hospitals and primary care providers. It may very well prove to be a flop, but if healthcare isn‚Äôt prepared, outcomes could prove far worse. I think it is prudent to quarantine the kids that have come back from Italy.

Humidity was high and seeing conditions were affected by it, but I love the halos that it creates around the bright stars. It's just one of the unique things about being an astrophotographer in a wet environment. 

With clear skies this weekend, I returned to Orion with some new techniques I had learned. I think the hard work paid off with much better results. I still see some banding and vignetting despite using flat frames. I wonder if that's an artifact of my lens or of my camera- hopefully it's the lens because my RedCat 51 is currently on its way. I'm probably just being overly critical of my own work, but I believe the new scope will make a dramatic improvement when it arrives.

3408,3408,AllomanticDragon,"Even with his tax increases we still pay less in taxes than most states [1] [2]. Under Edwards are GDP has trended up. Our unemployment rates have trended down [3]. Did you ever consider that the years of cuts to Medicaid, welfare, teachers' salaries, and infrastructure may have played a role in our shitty situation? We were one of the worst ranked states even before JBE, but we've been trending in a postive direction under him. His focus on saving TOPS and fixing our infrastructure our also saving us. Louisiana is suffering from a serious brain drain as talent leaves the state. A large portion of CenturyLink's upper management now work remotely from other states and they have downsized significantly in at their hq in Monroe. Our infrastructure is driving out manufacturers such as Calumet in Minden who threatened to leave if something wasn't done about the roads to their plant. So, while there may have a moderate increase in taxes (still lower than most states), the investments made with them are being put towards necessary programs we need to actually save our state.

3449,3449,QueefyConQueso,"Thanks for the link! Interesting read.  Sorry for the delayed response, but I wanted to mentally chew on it for a bit. 

I do think it is spot on with its views on the US political right, and with a slow march in the direction over time, even the center of 20 years ago appears left if everything has shifted right.  Certainly some of the lunacy as well. (Though I‚Äôd argue the lunacy was always there, it just existed as ‚Äúwing nuts‚Äù, courting those views are new). 

But I think the author is understating the swings to the left.  I can only imagine if somebody like Bill Clinton proposed, much less pass his welfare reform act today. He would be labeled as a traitor.  Racist.  Hates single mothers.  It would be a bloodbath of epic proportions in today‚Äôs political climate.  It‚Äôs that different on the left as well.  

If you ask my non-expert opinion, I would say all this madness stems from a fundamental shift in communication, leading to a surge of populism that neither the people, nor those in power have come to terms with. 

If you look to history, every time the way humans communicate and share information goes through a technology shift, it has caused major societal upheaval.  It‚Äôs just difficult for the people living in it to notice it for what it is at the time. 

The printing press allowed Martin Luther‚Äôs angst against the Catholic Church (and translations of the Bible in languages other then Latin) to be sent to the masses.  Allowed the theories of Karl Marx and Bolshevism to find roots.  Hell, in colonial America everyone was blogging ‚Äúfake news‚Äù in one pagers.  

The telegraph and the birth of the 24 hour news cycle drove US adventurism to a war with Spain and The US‚Äôs brief stint at Colonialism.  ‚ÄúWhite man‚Äôs burden‚Äù and all that. 

And radio and TV.  Would Dr. King‚Äôs Message even be remembered without it?  Or the US ever get the distaste it did for Vietnam without all that war footage?  It brought events into our homes.  And Washington didn‚Äôt know what to do with it other than label news networks traitors and un-American. 

I think the Internet and social media is another one of those pivot points in human communication, and we are seeing the chaos as society adapts.  The most apparent is a massive rise in populism, with both news casters and politicians using that to effect, and even buying into it at this point.  

At the end of the day, a school teaching a kid evolution or having the kid use a gender normative bathroom isn‚Äôt an existential threat to our nation, but they will make it seem so if it gets views/clicks/votes.",1583162327,fj9y5i6

You dont say.

But if I read all this right, Trump removed regulations that govern helicopters and also allowed handrails to be removed allowing workers to just fall off rigs. 

Also of notable notes, the article even says that they were FEWER accidents but they seemed to be more severe. So the regulations that were changed must have some how forced the fewer number of accidents to be more severe. 


Now for homework, I challenge anyone to state which rolled back regulations directly led to a single one of these accidents. I will put the gumbo on while waiting...",1583284527,fjf55j5

-Chiggers are the larval (juvenile) form of a type of mite (Trombiculidae).

-Chiggers do not burrow into and remain inside the skin, contrary to popular belief.

AChiggers inject digestive enzymes into the skin and feed upon the decomposed tissue.

-Pronounced itching is the main symptom of chigger bites.

-Bites may appear as blisters or as flat or raised red areas.

-Treatment involves supportive measures to control itching.",1583760819,fk0m6bz

Edit: If you're dead set on going during Mardi Gras you'd be in basketball season and you could go to an NBA game. If you want to go earlier you can certainly see some football. Friendlies and exhibition games aren't really a thing in America so you'll have to come during the season. Most universities have football teams and Louisiana has quite a few of them so a college game won't be hard to see. Louisiana State in Baton Rouge is highly recommended for a great college football experience. New Orleans is on the smaller side for a city with pro sports teams so you'd have no problem getting Saints tickets if you made sure to buy them a little in advance. As far as how easy it is to visit a game you can buy tickets online, take a taxi to the stadium, and they'll scan the tickets straight from your phone.

Also, because the average Americans don't get sick days and can't miss work (or you lose your apartment, etc), they're VERY likely to go to work with the virus and spread it. To add insult to injury, because of the cost of healthcare here, those who get it are less likely to go to the doctor for help.

Basically, we're set up for a perfect storm of bad. Doesn't mean the worse will happen, of course. But there is the potential for things to get pretty bad.

A mask is, however, useful for preventing a sick person from spreading disease to others. A sick person preferably should stay away from others, though, if possible. 

This is true for pretty much all dieseases, including COVID-19.

1 Hypothetical Scenario:
Two+ weeks ago someone came in for Mardi Gras celebrations with a cough and slight tightness in the chest. Otherwise a nice healthy 20-30 something, just allergies. NBD. Celebrates with their mates, also healthy 20somethings. A couple of days later one of them notices a tickle in the throat, a very slightly elevated fever. Who cares? Louisiana has no cases! No one they know has been sick. Those stupid oak trees are just spewing out their annual sperm and getting everyone‚Äôs bodies out of wack. This person then goes on to work, or to the bar, maybe the newest restaurant to pop up on Magazine. And so it goes, until someone says, ‚Äúokay, but y‚Äôall I can‚Äôt breathe and that isn‚Äôt allergies‚Äù or ‚ÄúI work somewhere near sick people and have a slight fever; maybe I should get tested..‚Äù Thus two points of contact or more later ‚Äî right when people
are realizing they should get tested or when it enters a group who are not healthy, young adults adverse to the idea of seeking out medical expenses unless they feel like they are truest dying to justify the cost ‚Äî we start seeing more and more cases crop up.

Think of it like this, you get exposed to the flu. It basks in your body for a couple of days and you start feeling a bit more tired than usual a bit more gross. The flu being the flu, you spike a fever early on, a high one, and that is your big warning signal you shouldn‚Äôt go hang with friends and especially not visit your mom who is in poor health.  If you has a very slight fever, would you know? (You May as you may be highly attuned to your body, but many are not.) At what point when experiencing symptoms would you go from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anyone with it, it isn‚Äôt covid19!‚Äù to ‚Äúokay, I feel crummy, let me look up how to get tested as a precaution‚Äù to ‚ÄúI am going to get myself up and go and get tested.‚Äù

A majority of our patrons use our services to find jobs or apply for/renew benefits like food stamps. There is now provisional food stamps because of this pandemic but I've only seen the announcement online. The venn diagram of people who regularly use the library and people who have internet at home is almost two seperate circles. Also the DCFS requires that paper applications be printed and faxed, which is very expensive at places like Office Depot while libraries offer the service for little to no cost.

While it is dangerous to have mass gatherings at a time like, this I believe there are different steps that can be taken with closing mass chain restaurants and movie theaters. While reducing crowd sizes it will also promote small business spending.

Libraries, even if they aren't used too often anymore, are still very necessary to a good portion of the community that just wants to do well for themselves and their families.",1584314918,fklukd0

Who‚Äôs patient zero?? There are people who came to Mardi Gras in Nola went home with it from here. That was two weeks ago. Every confirmed case here can only explained by community spread, so we‚Äôve been going since Mardi Gras and are only now taking drastic measures.

So for two weeks anyone and everyone who‚Äôs had it has gone about with little concern. They‚Äôve spread it, we will see the results of that these next two weeks. Hopefully those populations are taking the proper precautions but from the photos I‚Äôve seen of St Patrick‚Äôs day celebrations and crowds at various local casinos, I cannot imagine that we have done the best that we could..

Cases are going to rise in the New Orleans area for some time unfortunately. How much of that spread has already taken place remains to be seen. I‚Äôm no expert, but these are simple facts of the situation. 

Let‚Äôs also consider we are Louisianans. We aren‚Äôt a healthy bunch. We love to smoke, we love to drink, and we don‚Äôt love a lot of exercise that doesn‚Äôt involve hunting or fishing. While the old and medically fragile are prone, so are overweight smokers.


I fear we are going to see our health care systems pushed to their limits and we will largely have to blame an inept leader at the federal level who downplayed this incident continually since day one. We should have been taking measures to limit exposure at Mardi Gras, but the message was this was no big deal since we only had to worry about people traveling from certain regions.

Things will for sure get worse before they get better. I fear people think this is a hurricane that didn‚Äôt hit, while not realizing that it has already made landfall here.",1584324452,fkmaj3y

Putting the two together is going to be deadly for a small minority of the latter in the current circumstances.  Children/Families were no where to be seen, I think parents are going full helicopter (rightfully so) to protect their kids.  

Washing hands doesn't do jack-shit when the virus is respiratory.  It's literally in the air, so no matter how much my employees wipe menus and condiment caddies, and no matter how many times they scrub their hands, it's not even close to what needs to be done if there's someone in the building coughing out the virus, even with social distancing and 'table spacing'.  If some young guy walking to the bathroom coughs walking past elderly Ethel and Eddie's table, they're potentially contracting it.  

I agree that I don't like the governments involvement, but sometimes they need to save us from our stupid selves.  I like an argument I heard likening this conundrum to the chicken and the egg.  Restaurant owners will stay open if people will come out and they can make money, and people will go out if restaurants are open and they can take their mind off all this bullshit.  If I could say fuck it and stay home without a mandate,  I would, and I'd tell my employees to as well.  However I don't know how I'd provide for the family after the owner fired me and this all blows over.  Voluntarily limiting access isn't what the owners care about when they've got that Bottom Line Mentality.  They will always care about the Bottom Line, never the public's well-being, that's why the government needs to step in.

I'm on the Northshore, &amp; Mardi Gras was only a few weeks ago. Please, read about Philadelphia in the [Spanish Influenza Pandemic](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/).  How many people on the Northshore were in the city two weeks ago?  I'm betting a whole bunch, but not nearly as many stubborn elderly as there were invincible kids who are now exhaling-with-a-scratchy-throat-that-doesn't-really-bother-them-that-badly.  They're like you, staying away from everyone except their close friends and family who they just want to grab a drink and a bite with to talk about all this craziness.

But my primary motivation for supporting this is the health and well-being of myself (and by extension my wife/kids who are staying at home through this), my employees (who also risk bringing things home to their families), and my customers who are invincible and stubborn but whom I still want to come back when this is over.

This will definitely affect my employers long term profitability if they have bills to pay during a shutdown, and I hope the State/Federal government can do something about that, what's the point of government if they can't help keep our nation on an even keel through a global emergency like this. I wouldn't have been working for them for a decade if I didn't care about the people who sign my paychecks financial well-being, but under these circumstances priorities have to change.

And I'm sorry, but asking people to use vacation time during all this?  The point of vacation time is to allow someone to get away from work and enjoy some leisure time, not so they can use it as a tool to protect their health during a declared national emergency.

Oil and gas allows those ranging from 9th grade dropouts to PHDs to escape poverty.  And idiots want to drive them out of the state?  Of course you do.",1584496514,fksr7a5

We will not survive these restrictions and closures without immediate, decisive action from the government.  We call upon you today to announce immediately what you plan to do for our workers.  We need you as much as our community needs us.
Our recommendations are;
Reduce barriers to receiving emergency unemployment benefits to all hourly and salaried workers furloughed through this crisis and increase the maximum benefits to workers whose hours have been cut and lost.
- Call for IMMEDIATE rent and mortgage abatement for workers impacted by the closure of the restaurant industry.

Examples of large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies. These events can be planned not only by organizations and communities but also by individuals.

The governor's proclamation is phrased very broadly as to cast a wide net of scenarios, though it is addressed specifically on the governor's website in the section dedicated to COVID-19 information.",1584608857,fkwwflf

There is so much of the state infrastructure that his administration was responsible for building including highways, schools, courthouses, and our State Capitol. Some of this is named after him, like the Huey P. Long Bridge in the New Orleans area. Since this historical construction was completed during the Art Deco period, this has become the style of our newer government buildings as well. Our Capitol Park in downtown Baton Rouge is all modern buildings built in Art Deco style.

Huey P. Long also was assassinated, the spot where this happened at the State Capitol is a tourist attraction to this day. Like John F. Kennedy, this has lead to endless speculation about what he might have or have not accomplished had he lived. The most common theme in this speculation is what if had run for or become president?

Even if you survive, unlike the flu, it can cause lasting damage. Look up post-SARS sickness. It causes lasting damage in your lungs, brain, heart, and bones. Patients at last study (after 2003-2004 outbreak) fifteen years after recovery have shown to have lung fibrosis, lower tolerance for exercise, higher rates of fibromyalgia, depression, psychosis, femoral head necrosis leading to premature arthritis in the hip, and more.

You're being short sighted. Two months is a small price to pay. You don't realize that *not taking these measures would cripple our economy and work force for decades into the future*. 

Also, Italy has a top ranking healthcare system. I'm a dual citizen. The care over there is much better than 70% of American care. We may have the best and brightest doctors in America but only those with expensive insurance can see them. The majority with medicaid or basic plans will be in average public hospitals, which has the same level of care as Italy. Stop with this making Italy sound like a backwards dirt country so that you can feel better about your prognosis here and assuage your guilt from prioritizing economy over human lives. 

You should know the numbers that came out of China were not the real death toll, even the WHO has now expressed skepticism. There were leaked videos of multiple people collapsing in the street, being put into body bags while still moving, many whistleblowers saying more people died than were reported. China has a great medical care system, and they actively saught out infected individuals with door to door temperature checks in a way the US is not prepared to do. 

Do you know what the American medical system of high debt per visit gets you? People waiting until late stage. People too afraid to try to get help so they tell themselves it's just the flu and keep working, keep spreading. Go back a month on r/neworleans and you'll see posts of that nature, and look where it has gotten us this far.

We have a heavily obese and unhealthy population with extremely high rates of diabetes and hypertension in this state, which is just as bad of a risk factor as being old. There are 30 and 40 year olds in critical condition. 

The governor and mayor of NO are taking this as seriously as they should.

I find Long's politics similar to Bernie Sanders except Long was a lot more successful than Sanders in implementing his policies. If he had lived till 1936 he would of probably run against Franklin Roosevelt. He actually found F.D.R. too conservative. I would argue the point that the only reason the U.S. come out of the great depression was because of WW 2.

I think a lot of the criticism that has come down about Huey Long has to do with the birth of the modern media which found its first charismatic American leader in F.D.R.

I really don't remember much about Long being taught in school. They were still fighting the Civil War when I was in grade school (Ha Ha). In popular culture there was the novel All The King's Men, which had some critical acclaim. There was also 2 Hollywood movies through the years based on the book. I didn't care for any of them. I guess you know of Earl K. Long who was Huey's younger brother? There is a fairly good movie on him with Paul Newman in the lead called Blaze. Blaze was a stripper he was involved with. Earl was the crazy one.

4889,4889,GEAUXUL,"&gt; I find Long's politics similar to Bernie Sanders except Long was a lot more successful than Sanders in implementing his policies.

He was a populist which definitely fits in with Bernie Sanders, but that‚Äôs where the similarities end. In all honesty the better comparison is Donald Trump. They both tried to build an authoritarian government around themselves, they both created a cult of personality, and they both were/are notoriously corrupt, unethical, and willing to ignore political norms. Long is what Trump would be if he wasn‚Äôt an idiot.

You might appreciate Randy Newman‚Äôs song called Kingfish. It is one of my favorites: 

&gt;There's a hundred thousand Frenchmen in New Orleans
In New Orleans there are Frenchmen everywhere
But your house could fall down
Your baby could drown
Wouldn't none of those Frenchmen care

&gt;Everybody gather 'round
Loosen up your suspenders
Hunker down on the ground
I'm a cracker
And you are too
But don't I take good care of you

&gt;Who built the highway to Baton Rouge?
Who put up the hospital and built you schools?
Who looks after shit-kickers like you?
The Kingfish do

&gt;Who gave a party at the Roosevelt Hotel?
And invited the whole north half of the state down there for free
The people in the city
Had their eyes bugging out
Cause everyone of you
Looked just like me

&gt;Kingfish, Kingfish
Everybody sing
Kingfish, Kingfish
Every man a king

&gt;Who took on the Standard Oil men
And whipped their ass
Just like he promised he'd do?
Ain't no Standard Oil men gonna run this state
Gonna be run by little folks like me and you

&gt;Kingfish, Kingfish
Friend of the working man
Kingfish, Kingfish
The Kingfish gonna save this land",1584681064,fkzuu77

This launched Higgens into the PIO position where he became a media sensation for his ""Crime Stoppers Videos"" which were ""drill sergeantesque"" and absolutely great for bringing awareness to crime in the area. Then he got fired by the sheriff. I'm not certain of the specifics but he was over stepping his position and profiting from his newly found fame.

5074,5074,Theskidiever,"Below is the letter written by an Emergency room physicians and the Medical Director of the Sentrara Williamsburg Emergency Department. 

ÔªøHey Neighbors,    
Just wanted to send something out as a medical provider living in your neighborhood. I am sure that many of you have lots of concerns and questions with all the conflicting information out there in regards to Coronavirus, or as we call it, Covid 19.   
 
For those that don‚Äôt know, I am an Emergency physician and Medical Director of the Sentara Williamsburg Emergency Department.   I have been involved in disaster preparedness for Covid 19 in regards to emergency care for our ED patients.   We have set up separate areas in the department for infectious versus noninfectious complaints in order to protect our patients.  We have currently closed the department to visitors also to prevent spread of disease.   All of my team is preparing for the worst but is hoping for the best which is what I suggest you all do as well.   
 
I realize that at one point we were putting close contacts of known Covid 19 patients in quarantine but that has gone by the wayside.   We are seeing many Covid 19 patients with no known contact with other ill persons.   Unfortunately Covid 19 is widely out in the community.   Sending out a notification about an infected person in a neighborhood should be avoided as it is not helpful.  I‚Äôm sure that it was sent in good intention but unfortunately we find that some of these patients are being criticized for having the virus as if it were their fault.     Also, it sends a false sense of security for those that don‚Äôt think that they have been exposed since they may not have come in contact with this person.   You are probably more likely to come in contact with the virus if you are out in public which is why it is important to socially distance but not socially isolate especially one of our own. 
 
There is a lot of misinformation about the virus that is on social media and even being provided by President Trump and his political colleagues.   It is true that there are currently not enough tests for this virus which is why we limit who we are testing.   Only those that are symptomatic are currently being tested.   The test however is not very accurate and has both false positives and negatives limiting the reliability so the test itself is not very helpful.   Treatment is really all supportive at this point meaning we don‚Äôt have any known medicine that works but there is extensive testing going on.  So having a positive test doesn‚Äôt really help us at this point other than telling us how many cases are in the community.   Since the testing is not widely available, we don‚Äôt know the actual number of infected people.    No vaccine for probably a year or so as the virus changes itself like the standard flu does making it difficult to come up with one effective vaccine.  This is a new virus so we are learning new things daily and information is constantly coming in.  
 
We don‚Äôt know if the warm season will slow it down like the typical flu.   We don‚Äôt know how long people are contagious but is thought probably around 12-14 days. Most people will have only mild symptoms but the older you are and the more medical problems you have, the more likely that you will have severe problems if you get this virus.   Luckily, most of the patients we are seeing in the emergency department only have mild symptoms and can be sent home.   However, we anticipate and are ready if this gets worse.   
 
It is true that we are running low on personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, goggles, gowns, gloves which are all recommended by the Center of disease control when treating these patients.   Thankfully we have been blessed to have other businesses such as  physician offices and even the shipyard give us their supply of PPE.  We are being told that there is increase production of these items within the US but obviously we are concerned about our future supply since we are already at this point.   
 
Sentara has set up a Covid 19 Call in Center that can answer more questions about signs and symptoms.   They are currently open 9am-7pm, 7 days a week.  I encourage you to call this number if you have more concerns or need more information about the disease.  
 
I know that some of you are scared but remember we are ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.   This is the time we take care of each other.  If you are going to the store, maybe call your neighbor and see if they need anything to limit the number of exposures.  I have two sons that work at Publix and Fresh Market and would be happy to pick up groceries if you have a list and let us know.   Now that the weather is getting warmer, get outside and enjoy the blooming flowers and trees with fresh air.  
 
 I have been asked many times if there is anything that people can do to help us medical providers and the number one thing is take care of your self and stay safe by limiting exposure to others.   This should keep you out of the Emergency Department.   This virus has several days of no symptoms for which a person is still contagious.  Do not come to the Emergency department unless you are short of breath or have another emergency problem.   
 
Sorry this is so long but I thought it was important to update you on what is really going on in your local emergency department and also the true facts about this virus.   Please take care of yourselves and each other.   Feel free to forward this to anyone that may find it useful.

If you are having mild symptoms, of course, try to manage at home and isolate to avoid overwhelming the care system. But.. **If you are having trouble controlling your symptoms, have genuine difficulty breathing that you feel might get out of control soon, or your symptoms persist over a week without improvement and you think you might have COVID-19, please do seek medical attention.**

If you enter critical stage while you are at the doctors, they have a team of respiratory support professionals who can intubate you. In some places they are trying chloroquine or remdesivir and seeing better rates of improvement. 

If you enter critical stage while you are at home because some guy on Reddit told you you could manage it just as well at home with Theraflu and some Earl grey tea, that's it. Hopefully you have the consciousness to call an ambulance but even then, if it's advanced to that point without medical monitoring, the ER doctors trying to help you are now going to be rushing to save you on hard mode.

5181,5181,flipht,"This sounds like a hard sell:
https://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/Proclamations/2020/JBE-33-2020.pdf
This is the stay at home order. 

You're not providing food or medical care, so your work would have to fall under these guidelines: https://www.cisa.gov/identifying-critical-infrastructure-during-covid-19

You mention transportation. If you guys create parking tickets, he's probably trying to say you fall under the highway and motor carrier subsection, which seems like bunk, since your product is used to fine people who are parked, which has absolutely nothing to do with keeping roadways clear or keeping supply chains flowing.

If he wants to argue that you're vehicle and driver licensing or traffic management system, that seems questionable.

Check out section 5 of the order. If they're not covered under sections 3A-C, they must comply with the ten person congregating rule and be able to allow for proper social distancing. If you think this is not going to happen and they're going to basically go business as usual, then you should be completely agreeable so they don't suspect you, unless you're always cantankerous and being nice would be suspicious, and you should report them to GOHSEP under section 6 of this order.",1584917736,fl87w5g
5182,5182,KurtCobanged,Parking tickets as in Valet tickets and the tickets you get out of machines to pay to park not citations,1584917823,fl881bs
5183,5183,flipht,"Well, that's even less critical then. One could at least argue that citation tickets are necessary to eventually move a car blocking a road.

People aren't going to venues or work, so parking garages shouldn't even have many people in them. 

I hate to tell people they should report their employer, because you have to be aware that that there can be blowback and retaliation if they know it's you.

But check out section 6. It references the pertinent statue that empowers GOHSEP and tells them what they're allowed to do. If you think any of that would help, then you should be able to talk to them.

You can read the legislation by going to legis.la.gov. Click ""Laws"" on the top bar, and then in the ""View a Specific Law"" box, leave it as revised statutes, and type in 29 to the first box and 721 in the second. This brings up the actual text with arrows. You can click through, it looks like everything relates, and eventually you'll get to 761 which is the second reference. That looks like it goes through 772.

If you have any specific questions, I am not a lawyer, but DM me and I'll try to help parse it.

Edit: RS 29:723 (5) defines essential workforce.
29:724 C(3) gives the governor the authority to control ingress and egress to and from a disaster area, movement of persons within the area, and occupancy of premises therein.
29:724 E says that people and representatives of firms violating any rules or orders justified by this chapter can be fined $500 and/or jailed for six months.


All of this is complicated and nested and some people's entire job is understanding what this says and how the real world situations we face must be interpreted through these rules. So a professional is your best bet for getting solid guidance, but based on my understanding, you're not critical and your boss is taking a risk both with your health and safety as well as his own freedom if he makes you go work right now.",1584918532,fl897bq

At WalMart, entire families are spending a countless amount of time aimlessly walking and shopping because they have nothing to do and nowhere to go.

Yet all convenience stores are open.  All drug stores.  All grocery stores.  All hotels.   People are still congregating *en masse*.

Also, if it's an adult's responsibility to be prepared for a situation like this, shouldn't businesses also be responsible to be prepared for a situation like this? If we can expect people to survive weeks without pay, shouldn't we also expect businesses to?

I work for a company that works for DOTD on road construction that is not essential and when completed will not be open to public for a few years and even then with very limited traffic. Boss sent out an email saying our design office will continue to be open and all field office will as well (I work in the field). If we do get approval to work from home we have to prove that we are working. 

I am angry and upset because my company is putting my health and the health of others at risk over profits. I work with all older 50+ people many of whom have medical problems. They do not want us to go home.

The contractor is working as normal. I understand a lot of people are worried about lost wages and losing jobs and I should be happy to have mine. However, I can do my job remotely as can others in the office. Our construction is not necessary to any function and being pushed back a few months will not matter. This certainly accounts for the act of nature clause they should have in their contract to collect lost wages and have already negotiated this with DOTD. To keep people working at this point is putting people‚Äôs health and safety at risk and putting a sign up that says ‚Äúwash your hands‚Äù is not effective. 


Stupid things I‚Äôve heard off the top of my head from my older coworkers:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care infection rate, I only care about death rate because I don‚Äôt want to die. Infection rate does not matter‚Äù

‚ÄúAll these people buying anti bacterial soap are wrong. It doesn‚Äôt help you need anti viral soap‚Äù

‚ÄúThey should just infect us all, let us get it, and get over it because we‚Äôre all going to get it‚Äù

5350,5350,flipht,"Here's some information I pulled together from another thread that got deleted. 

Essential personnel does not mean essential to your employer. It means essential to the health and safety and continued basic function of the state as a whole. In other words, if your job is not related to medicine, food, or critical infrastructure, you are probably not essential, and your boss is likely breaking the law. \*They can still stay open\* but only if they're following certain guidelines like not having more than 10 people in a space, having adequate space for social distancing, etc.

[https://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/Proclamations/2020/JBE-33-2020.pdf](https://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/Proclamations/2020/JBE-33-2020.pdf) \- This is the stay at home order. 

If you're not providing food or medical care, then your work would have to fall under these guidelines to be considered essential: [https://www.cisa.gov/identifying-critical-infrastructure-during-covid-19](https://www.cisa.gov/identifying-critical-infrastructure-during-covid-19) 

Check out section 5 of the order. If they're not covered under sections 3A-C, they must comply with the ten person congregating rule and be able to allow for proper social distancing. If you think this is not going to happen and they're going to basically go business as usual, then you should be completely agreeable so they don't suspect you, unless you're always cantankerous and being nice would be suspicious, and you should report them to GOHSEP under section 6 of this order.  

I hate to tell people they should report their employer, because you have to be aware that that there can be blowback and retaliation if they know it's you.

But check out section 6. It references the pertinent statue that empowers GOHSEP and tells them what they're allowed to do. If you think any of that would help, then you should be able to talk to them.

You can read the legislation by going to [legis.la.gov](https://legis.la.gov). Click ""Laws"" on the top bar, and then in the ""View a Specific Law"" box, leave it as revised statutes, and type in 29 to the first box and 721 in the second. This brings up the [actual text](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=85667) with arrows. You can click through, it looks like everything relates but the most important stuff is toward the beginning, and eventually you'll get to [761](https://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=207669)which is the second reference. That looks like it goes through 772.

 RS 29:723 (5) defines essential workforce. 29:724 C(3) gives the governor the authority to control ingress and egress to and from a disaster area, movement of persons within the area, and occupancy of premises therein. 29:724 E says that people and representatives of firms violating any rules or orders justified by this chapter can be fined $500 and/or jailed for six months. 

 All of this is complicated and points back to other statutes, administrative code, etc. and some people's entire job is understanding what this says and how the real world situations we face must be interpreted through these rules. So a professional is your best bet for getting solid guidance, but based on my understanding, you're may not critical and your boss is taking a risk both with your health and safety as well as his own freedom if he makes you go work right now.",1584983460,flaglbk

We have been conditioned to want to keep up with the Jones‚Äô and spend all of our money on things we don‚Äôt need and now we are suffering because of it. We should focus on saving and being as self sufficient as possible. We should focus on having more than enough so that we can help our family members and neighbors. How many people have car notes on that brand new 2020 when they could have bought the older car for $1000? How many people are spending 30 to 40% or more of their take home pay on their mortgage each month? How many people have their kids in every activity they can put them in because they want their child to have every experience possible, but yet they struggle to put food on the table each week? Or how many families live on fast food, spending hundreds a week instead of sitting down as a family eating a home cooked meal and saving so much money? We have put ourselves in this situation by spending every hard earned penny frivolously. Take a lesson from the previous generations and learn how to stretch a dollar and a meal.

Yes. That's how argumentation works.

I heard you the first time. My reply remains the same: you have been and continue to be the beneficiary of governmental largesse. 

&gt;That means that I do not want a handout. I do not want to be on welfare. I do not want to be on food stamps. 

These are semantic but not substantive distinctions.

I dont think your personal history lends more or less weight to your argument. And honestly its kind of like starting a discussion of race with ""I have a black friend...""

By arguing that the poor are mostly poor because of their choices, I say you already have.

- He ran for Senator while being Governor. He won, chose his successor, and would visit him constantly to tell him what he wanted done. Idk anyone else that has ever had the influence in a state and the potential for huge national influence at the same time before he was killed prematurely.

- He made the LSU Tiger Band what it is today. He expanded it from 12 members to over 100 and wrote some of our most famous songs.

- He is possibly the closest thing to a King that Louisiana and the US has ever seen (with the exception of FDR)

- He wanted a new football stadium for LSU. He could not justify spending millions on a football stadium in the middle of the Depression so he argued for a new dormitory with a giant courtyard in the middle with lots of seating or something like that.

- Some people theorize that he was killed by the CIA or FDR because he was seen as a national security threat or a dangerous challenger to FDR. 

And theres so much more thats just what I know off of the top of my head. He‚Äôs one of my favorite people to learn about",1585178865,flib40r

So my compromise was this: these 'mid level essential' businesses (car dealers, home depot, Lowes, etc) should have 1 - 2 employees manning the stores (or an appropriate number for the size, but keep it to very small groups) and if someone needs something, they can call and have it ready for pickup outside. 
Maybe not that exact system, but you get the general idea. The problem is these huge groups shopping and touching stuff and spreading germs. People may have it, show no symptoms, and spread it all over Lowes for you and your family to catch just because you needed some nails or a screw or something.

Nobody thinks it's a big deal because 'only x% have died', but 'only x%' actually equals x number of people. I think currently Louisiana is at 120+ deaths. Maybe that's not a high number in the grand scheme of numbers but that's 120 of our neighbors, our friends, our families that have DIED unexpectedly. Just all of a sudden and not something they planned on. They weren't life long smokers who got cancer, or someone who was sick for a while and knew what was going on.

These people were OK, reading about the Coronavirus being all the way in China and now they are dead.

- I want the list of essential businesses to tighten up. A Johnnys near me just had to shut down bc one of the workers tested positive. They're sanitizing the whole store to reopen, I guess so another crew can get infected like the first? 

- I want officers or national guard looking for the idiots who are hanging out en masse in parking lots. Not only is it spreading the virus, but it's breeding violence. This is hearsay, but I'm hearing of more gun violence resulting from these gatherings. 

- I want people to report ""corona parties"". Seriously. Report them. Then I want the police or national guard to come break it up.

The person making strategic and tactical response decisions has that position by the same measure of merit as a prom queen: they won a popularity contest. 

There should be someone in a position analogous to a marshal, general, or admiral that once a pandemic and emergency declared (which admittedly came late), would lead and coordinate the response.  

Sure, is still up to the executive branch to declare that emergency.  And congress to pass funding.  But once a president declares something like the emergency production act, then it wouldn‚Äôt be up to that domestic infectious response marshal to figure out who needs to do what, and have the authority to do so. 

What we have now is akin to having a president deciding where fuel depots are in a war or what ships get resupplied. WTF?  Lethally dumb.

6075,6075,gwennhwyvar,"I grew up in Ouachita Parish and still have family there, so I will try to help.

1. You should DEFINITELY check realtor. com for crime maps. Monroe has an extremely high crime rate. You will likely want to look for somewhere closer to Sterlington (north of Monroe, easy commute to ULM) or West Monroe.  In Monroe proper, the Garden District and the area around Forsythe Park have some beautiful homes and apartments, but they are older and some of the streets in that area flood.

2a. Speaking of flooding, you should also try to find out information about flooding because many areas are prone to serious flooding. The last big flood in Ouachita Parish was in 2016, but smaller floods happen fairly regularly.  (Yes, I get paid for how many times I write ""flood,"" lol.)

2b. It's very hot in the summer, so you want to have a/c. Mosquitoes are also common, as are ""water bugs"" (giant flying cockroach things). They do have abatement trucks to help keep the mosquitoes under control, so that is nice.

3. If you are working at the college, you will have more opportunities to make friends. ULM is a diamond in the rough; not many people outside of the community know it or appreciate it as much as it deserves. You should be able to find people in your department to connect with, and they can help you navigate the community. Also, if anyone ever invites you to Enoch's, you should go. 

4. As far as what not to do...well, check your crime map. 

5. You will find what you want to find; if you expect people to be friendly and welcoming, that is what you will get. That area is home for me, so I love it no matter what, but not everyone does (same as anywhere else). There is a lot of good...a lot of love for the arts, food, and the great outdoors, and if you're already used to living in a college town, the transition shouldn't be too much of a hassle. :)",1585463592,flt9a54

They were gathering for a funeral. Secondlines originated at funerals. The first line indicates the deceased &amp; their immediate family. The secondline refers literally to the people standing behind that first line. They were not partying‚Äî so to speak. New Orleans has a rich culture that we work hard to protect. Try and get inside a meetup circle of MG Indian Chiefs, that is a difficult task &amp; is purposefully to protect their culture. 

Many people hear secondline &amp; they don‚Äôt know the origin or understand what it actually means. I understand being frightened &amp; scared. But don‚Äôt let fear cloud your mind. There are infinite number of outcomes for infinite number of possibilities. 

Maybe the people that gathered will not get sick.. maybe some will. I‚Äôd like to think it is better for us all to assume a positive outcome for all. Losing loved ones is hard.. I can‚Äôt imagine having to decide to wait to mourn. It‚Äôs a sad situation. 

These folks were literally trying to let spirit lift them up with music &amp; dance. Secondlines are a normally a loose crowd... they‚Äôre not walking shoulder to shoulder down a street.. everybody is moving constantly. You can see some clips online of this incident &amp; it is clear that they were maintaining a six foot distance from one another for the most part. From what I saw‚Äî only looked like a smaller group of five were standing closer than six feet apart &amp; they looked relatively young. 

I absolutely do not feel that anyone should be gathering in groups or participating in secondlines right now. However I do not think we should be advocating for Martial Law. The people that participated likely have learned NOW- to make alternative choices for grieving moving forward during this time. I hope that no one involved has to grief another loss for some time. 

No one should have to grieve then face court fines or jail time for failing to integrate safety measures into their grieving process. 

That‚Äôd be equivalent to charging everyone shown on Walmart‚Äôs security cameras for not respecting a six foot distance during the past week. 

I bet you‚Äôd find the numbers of individuals failing to follow social distancing guidelines far outnumber the people that gathered in small area of Uptown, New Orleans to grieve their loved one. 

It was a poor choice- but we have to remember that we learn by making mistakes. Right?",1585535560,flvz3kw

I heard in the video about 6-7 minutes in that it was a funeral repast. So, I sort of knew but again, at the same time, as you said, my mind was very clouded with frustration, angry, and worry. 

We're all human, I get that, but it angered me for reasons I've already stated. I'm not perfect by any means and I know not everyone has the same mindset as I do, about such things as these. 

I am of course biased because I have loved ones that work the front lines and that are immune suppressed. (I know I'm not special in that regard, I'm just telling you a little about my story) 

I do understand that folks want to grief for their lost loved ones, but for the sake or their safety as well as others, now is just unfortunately not the best time to be out and about. We've all had tragedy in our lives, some of us experience it earlier than others and it leaves something behind. It's just all an impossible situation. 

Please do not get me wrong, I have absolutely nothing against ALL folks from New Orleans. Like I've said, I've been there plenty of times and met really interesting and kind people. My post was frustration in folks not taking it seriously. In fact, by some of the responses I've gotten - I know some people don't care. (The majority do, don't misunderstand me.)

Legal rights are not natural things as evident by different cultures, different countries, and different peoples having different concepts of what are their rights. Natural rights are ideological rights that everyone shares with the basis being Life, Liberty, the pursuit of happiness or life, liberty, property depending on if your sourcing Locke or the constitution. 

Legal rights -- refers to rights according to law. It exists under the rules of some particular legal system. Following is a case law defining the term legal right. A legal right is a claim recognizable and enforceable at law. The implementation of martial law is changing your legal rights from one Legal system to a martial legal system. This in no way affects your Natural rights. This does not affect your rights to Life, liberty, or property.

Your rights are only your rights so long as they do not bring danger to another person.  For example freedom of speech is a legal right in America, you are free to say what you want about what you want to who you want, except in cases where it is slanderous or dangerous to parties you are discussing. Again I will iterate your rights are not being infringed upon when the government tells you to stop going places because you are putting people at risk.

I can tell you regardless of what you hear, Rita is the forgotten storm. No one talks about it. Yesterday, the Governor himself compared our successful history as Louisianians to overcome hurricane devastation to our ability to overcome Coronavirus. Siting our success in bouncing back from hurricane Katrina, Ike and Gustave but forgetting about Hurricane Rita. Katrina has always overshadowed Rita and the main reason is the media due to the higher population in South East Louisiana. During Rita, the gulf of Mexico came inland literally 30 miles and flattened an entire parish. Not a city, a parish. Cameron Parish to be exact, but you probably didn't know that. Now once again, I am not stating that Katrina was not a devastating storm, by no means. Katrina was horrible and killed many more people and caused more cost in damage. Katrina put a city underwater. However Rita is in the history books for a few key reasons. Rita still holds the record for the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. It is documented to this day that Hurricane hunter pilot's described Rita as the most terrifying storm they had ever flown into at its Cat5 peak with wind gusts over 220mph. Hurricane Rita is the largest storm ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. Simply put Hurricane Rita at it's peak was a Monster. A lot of knowledge was learned from Rita. Rita was reported to have made landfall as a Cat3, however. In Vinton a small town 20 miles east of the where eye wall made landfall. There were wind gusts recorded at over 180mph. In Sulphur street signs were pulled off their posts through the bolts holding them. Boats were launched from Ellender bridge in Calcasieu to get into Cameron parish. There were so many tornados in South West louisiana that meteorologist could not keep up with them. Estimates were over 200. Had Rita not dissipated only 24 hours before landfall, it very well would have been the worst storm to ever hit Louisiana. It's not so much as to say which storm was worse. It is the facts that differentiate the two storms. Wikipedia Hurricane Rita, you may be shocked at what you learn.

What does all this even have to do with coronavirus? Well, New Orleans is pretty much the only place in Louisiana that exists to the rest of America. So to blame New Orleans does two things. The biggest thing is THE MEDIA. The Media has something to generate a story and spread fear on. Let's face it, that's is what they do best. By no means am I saying this virus situation Is not serious. For three weeks my family and I have practiced social distancing and take all precautions asked of us. However, this country thrives on fear and excitement. The media loves to stir the pot for viewership. The other thing blaming New Orleana does is... It simply takes blame off everyone else. We all have a part to play in this. Stay safe, stay home. Have a little compasion for others. Stop blaiming one country, one city, one town or one group. We all have ourselves to blame if we do not adheer to social distancing. That is how it spreads, Simple as that.",1585669760,fm10k7y

The more we test, the higher the numbers will be.  My hope is that there is already some immunity to this.  Back around Christmas, in North LA, there was a flu-like virus that tested negative for flu A and flu B but had the same symptoms.  I had fever, cough, aching, headache, sweating, etc.  I tested negative for flu A and B.  Cough hung on for weeks.  Several in my community had the same thing.  Many were people that I go to church with.  I am not sure that I haven't already had it.

I am hoping, somehow, that there is an immunity already present where I live.

I will say that of the ones we are testing and just KNEW they would come back positive, they are not.  I'm talking like people coming back from a cruise with a cough and fever and feel like they have been run over by a truck, and still testing negative.

6522,6522,mrbangbam,"I'm a lawyer, but not a First Amendment lawyer. Therefore, this is my opinion based on my studies on the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

* First, strict scrutiny test applies because the regulations restrict the First Amendment rights to assemble and associate.
* Strict scrutiny test requires: (a) compelling governmental interest; and (b) ""the least restrictive legal means"" with regards to the regulations.
* (a) is met here - reducing deaths in a national pandemic is clear cut a compelling government interest.
* **The issue here is therefore (b) - is the restriction against congregating the ""least restrictive mean""?**
* Two constitutional doctrines that speak to the ""least restrictive means"" test are (i) overbreadth and (ii) vagueness. (Source: [https://civilrights.uslegal.com/right-to-assemble/overbreadth-and-vagueness/](https://civilrights.uslegal.com/right-to-assemble/overbreadth-and-vagueness/))
   * Is the law overbroad? **Likely no**. The law requires people to stop meeting in-person in large groups. This directly addresses the most basic fact that the disease passes among people who are meeting in-person. Therefore, the law is not overbroad.
      * An overbroad law would be, for example, if you banned all drive-in theaters due to car engine noises causing a public nuisance, whereas you could have just passed a law requiring all drive in theaters to require car engines to be turned off.
   * Is the law vague? **Likely no**. The law is clear and unambiguous as to what the regulation means, how many people can't meet, and how it applies.
   * Side note - the law also passes neutrality tests, since it restricts congregation regardless of religion or purpose. This will weigh in favor of upholding the law. It's content neutral, place neutral, manner neutral and time neutral.

The people there don‚Äôt think the actual number will ever be known, but they have been guesstimating amongst themselves, and with the incinerators running day and night, and the number of urns delivered to funeral homes, and that they are handing out 3,500 remains per day, and say they ‚Äúhope‚Äù to done handing them out by April 5th with people waiting for 6 hours in line to pick up remains?

6534,6534,audacesfortunajuvat,"Boris Johnson is almost as dumb as the idiot in charge here; Italy has the Five Star party in their government, which makes the Republicans look like calm, sober, rational people. Everyone knew it was going to be this bad, if not worse - the intelligence agencies warned about it, the WHO warned about it, plenty of people were sounding the alarm as early as January. Everyone knew the China numbers were fake too - Reddit had multiple graphs showing how their numbers were clearly being made up. I would imagine the CDC, CIA, and others have slightly better info. In fact, they thought the fatality rate was something like 3% which would have led to millions of American dead. That means we should have been about 3x as scared as we are now.

Plenty of countries took it seriously and they're not seeing anywhere near the effects we are. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, even Canada are all doing better than we are so far. The problem is not that we didn't know it was serious because everyone knew it was serious. The head of our government didn't take it seriously and people are dying as a result. Fox News is firing hosts because they're afraid they're going to be legally liable for wrongful death suits because of the misinformation they peddled.

America lost 400,000 people in World War 2. We lost 58,000 in Vietnam. This will fall somewhere between those two. It was almost entirely avoidable too - see the article about GE making 50,000 ventilators in 90 days? We will only be short 26,000 so if we'd started making them in January or even February we'd probably have enough right now but in January and February Trump was saying it would vanish, it was under control, the whole things was a Democratic hoax to make him look bad. Remember that when you bury your family members, your friends, your neighbors. And remember that in November when he asks you for your vote again - none of this had to happen.

Also, positives can be run a lot quicker than negatives. The tests looks for a lot of different markers of the virus. If they find one, it's positive and they're done.

toilet paper and virus masks are not local, i dont follow your point. 

these essentials are so cheap that anyone can afford them.  if toilet paper was being gouged at 5x the normal rate, its not a big deal. you only need enough to last until this is over and idiots stop hoarding.  

the key is that the store sells at market rates, so that hoarding is not profitable.  hoarders will not hoard  if their selling price will be the same.  so nobody hoards. the supply never is exhausted, everyone gets what they need. nobody takes more than they need. 

plus, the higher prices motivate suppliers to produce and deliver more. this toilet paper shortage was a false scarcity issue, created by hoarding. 

with masks, again, we want the supply to go to those that need it, not hoarders. we need to ramp up production. if prices go up, thats fine, thats more money for production. more money to hire workers, run the factory longer,  order more material.

Who would've thought our govt would be slow as fuck as dispensing the money they promised? They're even saying the $1200 check may not reach people until August/September. Their whole thing was to get money to people as quickly as possible and they can't even do that. Now, about the $600 increase, the states are hoping to get the money this coming week or next. Most states use 30+ year old systems to process claims and payments so many people are gonna have to wait a while. Look at TX, NY, and FL as most people aren't even able to successfully file their claims because the systems are crashing due to the number of claims. Fortunately Louisiana seems to kind be on top of their shit and it's been easy to get on unemployment and receive benefits.

This virus is lethal at a far lower than feared projection and some spots in the world are claiming to have ""peaked"". 
The time lapse of the virus reaching everybody is pretty loosely but finitely outlined so these pastors are betting that a. they can grandstand and keep that 50k a week in tithes coming in, losses will come, but at a minimum, and they will paragons of their community for their courage in defiance of governing over reach and devout faith. B. They get mildly harrassed and fined and finger wagged and so forth. C. They get arrested and jailed, become martyrs, come what may, the sicker his flock, oh the humanity lost by taking their leader, they do not get sicker, dthe ygrow louder for their faith has stood the tides...they are in, as they see it, a win win or win BIG, and will endanger any and all to play it out. SO, What to do?
Thanks for reading to me asking for you.
These mega pastors and their huge crowds of flocking faithful, who so badly wash to be together during these times flocking with one another at all risks...please allow my simple, elegant solution for us all...A compromise.
Lock them onto church grounds after they get in to get their praise on.
Churches, and especially these Mega Churches, have lots and lots of room, resources, and oodles of time for prayer prayer prayer without having to worry about having to go home and lose out on that prayer time.
Tell them bring groceries, and when they go in the gate of that sprawling estate ...clink...everybody is happy.
That fierce pastor has his flock right there with him, as he is so determined to have them, and they are right there at G,rOun.D,Central, flocking it up with their flocking other flockers where it was so important to be...
So...hey...let's grant them their fondest and most devout wish...go and stay for the duration. They won't need medicine obviously, and if they need food, I am sure a volunteer will jump to their assistance and deliver it to the gate so nobody has to leave their sacred ground...
Give them time to really REALLY get to know each other, you know?
The pastor will be a hero for taking his flock into his fold completely to succor for the duration and not have to run risks of outside contaminates, government over-reach, and unseen events that may prevent everybody from returning to the compound safe and soon.

Smart folks at risk will buy supplies in August when no one else is thinking of it. 

Same as in hurricane prep. Every year city leaders say in May, prep now , get your plan together. What happens?

At some point you can‚Äôt buy batteries, canned food or generators *anywhere* at *any* price. If stores could raise prices to meet demand, that would all stop.

  What's True

During a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax."" During the speech he also seemed to downplay the severity of the outbreak, comparing it to the common flu.

What's False

Despite creating some confusion with his remarks, Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax.

Now, it appears that JBE was briefed in early Feb to the seriousness of the virus and failed to act.  Perhaps he blew it off, was waiting to see what others would do, or simply decided to wait longer.

It was a fund built up from years and years of state employees paying their health insurance premiums. Jindal‚Äôs actuaries advised him to marginally increase the premiums of state employees. Instead, Jindal via his corrupt proxy Kristy Nichols, lowered the premiums thus insuring that the fund would start to lose money quickly. This resulted in the health insurance rates being raised dramatically which Kristy Nichols called a ‚Äúright sizing‚Äù and then was used as the justification to privatize OGB and give a huge contract to Blue Cross/Blue Shield. The same company who coincidentally had executives that had donated to his campaigns. Jindal then took the remaining $500 million in the OGB fund and rolled it into the state budget while he was also burning through every other pot of money or rainy day fund the State had so he could look like he was balancing the budget.

I just think it‚Äôs a shame that some mothers choose to have an abortion to avoid financial duress, or for convenience, or for other comparatively trivial reasons when they could have the baby and leave it at the hospital/take it to a safe place, no questions asked. I understand there‚Äôs a lot of guilt involved in that, and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but Planned Parenthood has taken measures for this, right? If so, that‚Äôs good.

The argument from pro-choicers is ‚Äúit‚Äôs the mother‚Äôs body, she has the ultimate choice over 100% of it.‚Äù The argument from pro-lifers is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre killing babies!‚Äù Neither side is wrong.

&gt;Ever since the oil shocks of the 1970s, the idea of energy independence, which in its grandest incarnation meant freedom from the world‚Äôs oil-rich trouble spots, has been a dream for Democrats and Republicans alike. It once seemed utterly unattainable ‚Äî until the advent of fracking, which unleashed a torrent of oil. By early 2019, America was the world‚Äôs largest producer of crude oil, surpassing both Saudi Arabia and Russia. And President Trump reveled in the rhetoric: We hadn‚Äôt merely achieved independence, his administration said, but rather ‚Äúenergy dominance.‚Äù

&gt;Then came Covid-19, and, on March 8, the sudden and vicious end to the truce between Saudi Arabia and Russia, under which both countries limited production to prop up prices. On March 9, the price of oil plunged by almost a third, its steepest one-day drop in almost 30 years.

&gt;As a result, the stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500 energy sector fell 20 percent, marking the sector‚Äôs largest drop on record. There were rumblings that shale companies would seek a federal lifeline. Whiting Petroleum, whose stock once traded for $150 a share, filed for bankruptcy. Tens of thousands of Texans are being laid off in the Permian basin and other parts of the state, and the whole industry is bracing for worse.

&gt;On the surface, it appears that two unforeseeable and random shocks are threatening our dream.

&gt;In reality, the dream was always an illusion, and its collapse was already underway. That‚Äôs because oil fracking has never been financially viable. America‚Äôs energy independence was built on an industry that is the very definition of dependent ‚Äî dependent on investors to keeping pouring billions upon billions in capital into money-losing companies to fund their drilling. Investors were willing to do this only as long as oil prices, which are not under America‚Äôs control, were high ‚Äî and when they believed that one day, profits would materialize.

&gt;Even before the coronavirus crisis, the spigot was drying up. Now, it has been shut off.

&gt;The industry‚Äôs lack of profits wasn‚Äôt exactly a secret. In early 2015, the hedge fund manager David Einhorn announced at an investment conference that he had looked at the financial statements of 16 publicly traded shale producers and found that from 2006 to 2014, they spent $80 billion more than they received from selling oil. The basic reason is that the amount of oil coming out of a fracked well declines steeply after the first year ‚Äî more than 50 percent in year two. To keep growing, companies have to keep plowing billions back into the ground.

&gt;The industry‚Äôs boosters argue that technological gains, such as drilling ever bigger wells, and clustering wells more tightly together to reduce the cost of moving equipment, eventually would lead to a gusher of profits. Fracking, they said, was just manufacturing, in which process and human intelligence could reduce costs and conquer geology.

&gt;Actually, no. The key issue is the ‚Äúparent child problem.‚Äù When wells are clustered tightly together, with so-called child wells drilled around the parent, the wells interfere with each other, resulting in less oil, not more. (This may not surprise anyone who is attempting to be productive while working in close quarters with their children.)

&gt;The promised profits haven‚Äôt materialized. In the first half of 2019, when oil was around $55 a barrel, only a few top-tier companies were profitable. ‚ÄúBy now, it should be abundantly clear that the current shale oil business model does not work ‚Äî even for the very best companies in the industry,‚Äù the investment firm SailingStone Capital Partners explained in a recent note.

&gt;Policymakers who wanted to tout energy independence disregarded all this, even as investors were starting to lose patience. As early as 2018, some investors had begun to tell companies that they wanted to see free cash flow, and that they were tired of compensation models that rewarded executives with rich paydays for increasing production, but failed to take profits into account. As a result, fracking stocks badly underperformed the market.

&gt;But with super-low interest rates, investors in search of yield were still willing to buy debt. Over the past 10 years, the entire energy industry has issued over $400 billion in high-yield debt. ‚ÄúThey subprimed the American energy ecosystem,‚Äù says a long time energy market observer.

&gt;Even as the public equity and debt markets grew cautious, drilling continued. That‚Äôs because one big source of funding didn‚Äôt dry up: private equity. And why not? Private equity financiers typically get a 2 percent management fee on funds they can raise, so they are incentivized to take all the money that pension funds, desperate for returns to shore up their promises to retirees, have been willing to give them.

&gt;In the Haynesville and the Utica Shales, two major natural gas plays, over half of the drilling is being done by private equity -backed companies; in the oil-rich Permian basin, it‚Äôs about a quarter of the drilling. From 2015 through 2019, private equity firms raised almost $80 billion in funds focused mostly on shale production, according to Barclays.

&gt;Until the capital markets began to get suspicious, private equity investors could flip companies they had funded to larger, public companies, making a profitable exit regardless of whether or not the underlying business was making money.

&gt;That too is ending, as investors in such funds have become disillusioned.

&gt;You can see how all of this is playing out by looking at Occidental Petroleum. In 2019, Oxy, as it‚Äôs known, topped a competing bid from Chevron and paid $38 billion to take over Anadarko Petroleum, which is one of the major shale companies. Since that time, Oxy‚Äôs stock has plummeted almost 80 percent in part due to fears that the Anadarko acquisition is going to prove so wildly unprofitable that it sinks the company.

&gt;On March 10, the company announced that it would slash its dividend for the first time since 1990, when Saddam Hussein‚Äôs invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices plummeting.

&gt;Occidental is just one piece of the puzzle. In April, the Energy Information Administration cut its forecast for U.S. oil production, estimating that it will fall both this year and next ‚Äî suggesting that the days of huge growth in production from shale are over.

&gt;On March 10, Scott Sheffield, the chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major driller in the Permian Basin, told Bloomberg that U.S. oil output could fall by more than two million barrels per day by next year if prices remain where they are today.

&gt;‚ÄúThis is late ‚Äô80s bad,‚Äù a close observer of the industry says.

&gt;The United States is now engaged in a high-stakes negotiation with Russia and Saudi Arabia to curtail production; President Trump, who has staked so much on the American shale industry, wants to save it. ‚ÄúWe really need Trump to do something or he‚Äôs going to lose all the energy states in this election,‚Äù Mr. Sheffield told CNBC in late March.

&gt;A deal, and higher oil prices, might help the industry. But they won‚Äôt fix its fundamental problem with profitability. Energy independence was a fever dream, fed by cheap debt and frothy capital markets.

&gt;All that‚Äôs left to tally is the environmental and financial damage. In the five years ending in April, there were 215 bankruptcies for oil and gas companies, involving $130 billion in debt, according to the law firm Haynes and Boone. Moody‚Äôs, the rating agency, said that in the third quarter of 2019, 91 percent of defaulted U.S. corporate debt was due to oil and gas companies. And North American oil and gas drillers have almost $100 billion of debt that is set to mature in the next four years.

&gt;It‚Äôs still unclear where most of this debt is held. Some of it has been packaged into so-called collateralized loan obligations, pieces of which are held by hedge funds. Some of it may be on bank balance sheets. Investors in the equity of these companies have already seen the value of their holdings decimated. Pension funds that have poured money into private equity firms may take a hit soon, too. All we know for sure is that fracking company executives and private equity financiers have made a fortune by touting the myth of energy independence ‚Äî and they won‚Äôt be the ones who have to pick up the pieces.¬∂",1586526060,fmzoihe

513,513,kehendrix,"I graduated from ULM and have lived in both Monroe and West Monroe. During my early college years I lived in the neighborhoods that are nearest to the college. I do not recommend any houses or apartments that may be found between HWY 165 and University Avenue (Mcguire, Cole, Filhol etc). My experiences with renting in that area consisted of noisy neighbors, break-ins and other distractions. I had similar experiences with renting homes in the Garden District. 

Overall I preferred living in West Monroe because I felt that it was quieter and easier to get to grocery stores and restaurants. My favorite apartments were Rebel Land Apartments in West Monroe. They are farther out, but super quiet. The landlords were a nice married couple and I felt safe there. I worked in Monroe and did not mind a 15-20 minute commute. The only thing that was a true hassle was having to drive from Monroe to West Monroe after 5pm. The evening commute could be a beast.

Ashford place is nice. They are quiet, clean, and gated. If safety is your biggest concern, then Ashford would be a great choice. They are located in West Monroe. You would have a Neighborhood Walmart within walking distance and easy access to the interstate. The only draw back is that they are rather expensive for my budget. A 1bdrm can easily cost close to $1000 a month. You can rent a nice house in a nice neighborhood for that amount of money.

 I do not know anything about Pinnacle apartments other than I like the area. Traffic during your morning commute can be frustrating after 7:30am, but it is a safe area. It's near my doctor's office and it's a clean area of town. It's close to campus.  

 I had a friend that lived in Shadow Creek Apartments in WM and they were nice. Relatively quiet and had washer/dryer combos in the units. A 1bdrm cost around $800.

621,621,QueefyConQueso,"Western society does need to develop some sort of exit strategy.  

The ‚Äúflattening the curve‚Äù we are doing is out of necessity.  We don‚Äôt have the medical capacity (no country does if left to spread at a transmissibility of 2 to 3, socialist medical nirvana, or pay-to-play capitalist) to care for the critically ill, and there is a certain % of those that the critical care will be the difference between life and death. 

But, we have as a society been convincing ourselves since the 1950‚Äôs that ‚Äúpoverty kills‚Äù.  Continuing down this path until A: A vaccine is developed. Or B: herd immunity is developed will be devastating. 

Your looking at impoverishing 10‚Äôs of million people in this country alone if you wait for A or B to happen.  Maybe a billion or more worldwide. 

The option of ‚Äúgoing back to normal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.  The extremes of ‚Äúeconomy 1st‚Äù or ‚Äúsave as much life as possible from the virus‚Äù ultimately leads to massive death.  

Unless you want to throw away 70 years of social progress and pretend ‚Äúpoverty kills‚Äù was just a scare tactic of progressives pushing communist agendas. 

If we were a smart people, we would have not ran up 20 trillion+ is national debt when times where good on batshit crazy corporate, misguided social, and global military welfare and be able to give everyone a living wage for the next 6+ months.

This helps Wall-Street and keep a cash shortage from happening, as happened in the Great Depression, but as seen in the last financial crises, does little to help Main Street. Job growth and wages were pretty stagnant up until a year or so ago. 

Now Main Street needs a lifeline.  And the tools are just not there for it.  Or to do it efficiently.  The feds can‚Äôt just create bits in your account, so they are forced to use other mechanisms.  The IRS.  State unemployment services, and the state services are overwhelmed.

We basically have 2 economic right parties where 1 party is far economic right and the other is moderate economic right, but both parties are exceedingly corporatist in their goals without any real concern for the average citizens. 

The only real difference between the two is republics don‚Äôt pretend to care about you or me. 

We need real ranked choice voting real 3rd parties not a 2 party system. We need a system that allows economic left, pro gun, pro environmental protection candidates to run or more clearly candidates that don‚Äôt fit the current 2 parties. Until we have that we‚Äôre basically doomed to deal with candidates that don‚Äôt care. 

Republicans / dems won‚Äôt make true steps to follow through on their base platforms aka guns for dems/ abortions for republicans for example because if they do they eliminate their need for existence and they have to find a new cause a new way to rally the troops so to speak. Those aren‚Äôt issues in places that have ranked choice and multiple parties because different parties have overlapping goals and needs.

to actually answer your comment:

CDC says to socially distance. We are past containment and are in the mitigation stages of dealing with the worldwide pandemic. CDC says to use a mask in public. 

CDC is the actual experts on this btw. we should listen to them. If they say to quarantine til late next year when there might be a vaccine, then we should do that. They also suggest we should shake hands again. 


basically, listen to the experts. they know what they are talking about. 

vote for people who will actually put your needs as a human being over profits of corporations/businesses/etc.

right now, our govt needs a plan to help everyone who make it through this worldwide pandemic that has killed thousands. 

if we had the right people in charge, you wouldnt need to choose between staying home and safe from this worldwide pandemic that has infected hundreds of thousands and killed thousands that we dont have a vaccine for and going to work to feed your family. 

The best course of action in my view is to listen to the experts and socially distance so as few people die as possible. Until there is a vaccine, I dont see a better way.

&gt;LaPlace, Louisiana (CNN)St. John the Baptist Parish is a swampy, rural swath of Louisiana that straddles the Mississippi River. It's an unassuming place with one Walmart, a population of about 43,000, and local eateries like BRS Seafood, which had a line out the door on Easter weekend for crawfish. People stood six feet apart.

&gt;It also sits among a sprawling collection of chemical plants and oil refineries that snake along the river between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Because of the air pollution, environmental activists have dubbed St. John and its neighboring river parishes as ""Cancer Alley.""

&gt;And now, the parish is known for something else: the highest death rate per capita for coronavirus in the country, according to analysis by The New York Times. It surpasses even some of the most densely populated urban hotspots that are also being crushed by the deadly virus.

Next, I'd determine what non-essential businesses are at a low risk of spreading disease. If hospital occupancy rates are lower, open those businesses up.

For all non-essential businesses, I'd suggest providing tax breaks for employees that are designated to only work from home. That would encourage business owners to find solutions to keep employees working and business moving without increasing the risk of infection.

2.

So as long ad it isnt me I am just glad I am not in charge. In regards to Bill Gates  a long time ago, before I even heard of a Tesla vehicle, someone told me how Elon musk was awesome. And how Bill Gates was a horrible person. It's just something I remembered. But at the moment I told this guy how can Bill Gates be horrible.
 He said something along the lines of using  broken countries like Nigeria to create illness and test vaccines  in unknowing people. I thought at the time that was fucking nuts and this dude telling me this was a little throwed off. Then covid-19 outbreak hits.  I see these videos recently of Bill Gates on you tube and all the facts and up. The world health organization in which Bill Gates is right in the middle of. Ignored what journalist in china warned about. The spread of this contagious virus.  Thousands of people died because of some arrogant soft spoken asshole named Bill Gates. And say what you want want about trump but at least had the balls to bring this to light and shut that shit down. So if he did everything wrong up to this point. I'm glad he was in charge instead of me or the hippies trying to let people freely enter and exit America.

A recent story:

Personal story:

I have a relative that owned a business in the New Orleans area in the 1970's. He tells a story of being in a restaurant for lunch for a business meeting and Carlos Marcello came in with his entourage. I don't remember if he talked to him or anything but I remember him saying that the whole atmosphere of the place changed. That, and they didn't have to pay for their lunch. Compliments of Carlos himself. He commented that he was pretty sure that Carlos never had to actually pay for a meal in his life.

As far as organized crime? It's still rampant here. We've got  biker gangs, MS13, various street gangs, Asian human trafficers, seafood scams, Cajun Mafia, Good Ole Boy Network, Democrats,Republicans, you name it. A dollar and the threat of violence still buys you influence here.  ;)

Even outside of war and emergencies, think of the decision to raise the speed limit on a stretch of road from 55 to 65mph.  Part of the decision is some one sitting down and plainly stating that if they do this, an increase of x% of accidents will result in serious injury or fatality. They weigh that against the benefits, and some group of people decide that change is worth that cost. 

Decisions like that happen every week at the federal, state and local level.

As for the rest, regardless of race, income, education, occupation -- I assume you're from either the Los Angeles-San Diego area or the Bay Area -- you'll find it's rather provincial even by Middle American standards. But like others said, it's not a *real* small town (I grew up in them, so I know).  Even so, S'port-Bossier people still tend to have a firm faith in convention and traditional ways of doing things. So don't be too abrupt with the locals if you hear something that you disagree with, at least unitl you get a feel for what the locals are like.

If having the standard big city amenities matters much to you, I'd definitely make room in your schedule for some weekend getaways to Dallas - only three hours away.  Yes, only! This isn't NYC or SoCal we're talking about. But I wouldn't go there right away, as you'll leave a bad impression on the locals (He thinks we don't have anything to offer here?). So make time during the weekends if you have time to see what the local area has to offer first. You may be pleasantly surprised. 

You'll find yourself driving much longer ways to get what you want in relation to how much you value that thing you want.  Dallas does have strong Asian communities, especially around Irving and in the suburb of Richardson - even if like most suburbs those are more bedroom communities.

The current number of deaths (as of this post) in the US from the coronavirus is 37,175 total deaths.  
The current number of new deaths per day is approximately 2,500 deaths per day.  
[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)  


The yearly amount of deaths from the flu in the US has been estimated at anywhere from 12,000-61,000 people per year with an average from 2010-2019 of 37,462 deaths per year.  
[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)  


Therefore, we have essentially already surpassed the average number of deaths from the flu per year within the past two months *with the quarantine in place*. If the current new deaths per day continues at this rate of 2,500 deaths per day, we will have an additional 642,500 deaths by the end of 2020.

A story from the late 1960s in Lafayette Parish.

My father was a salesman who would visit people‚Äôs homes to order and deliver household goods and coffee. (This is back when most wives and mothers were at home and families only had one car.) He knew many people‚Äîfrom different parts of the parish, different classes, different races. He was charming, affable, funny.

Local Lafayette politicians routinely asked for his help, and on a few occasions, he was paid for his work as a campaign worker. Mostly, he introduced candidates to people. 

He was working for a candidate for the state house. I was only a boy, but I remember that my father respected this candidate, and he was very excited about the campaign and worked hard. Then it was over.

It was years later when he explained to me what happened: when it looked as though his candidate was going to win, everyone involved in both campaigns met at a private club in Lafayette. Dad remembered how strange everything seemed to him as most everyone was quiet. Then ‚Äútwo long black cars‚Äù arrived. One man from the first car came into the club, and he and the two candidates went into a back room/office. (yes, literally a backroom meeting!) The man walked out and left the club to talk with someone sitting in the backseat of the second car. Then the men and the candidates returned to the back office. Quickly, the three came back out; the man from the first black car left, and the two cars sped off. The two campaigns stood on separate sides of the club: my father‚Äôs candidate explained that ‚ÄúNew Orleans‚Äù had decided that he wasn‚Äôt to win, but he would get a job with the state. The candidate handed my father two hundred dollars (a lot of money then). 

Years later, when he told me the story, I asked my dad who the men in the black cars were. He just smiled and said, ‚ÄúThe bosses from New Orleans.‚Äù Then a little sad, he added that after that he never worked for another campaign because ‚Äúwhat was the point?‚Äù 

Yes, I regret not pressing my father for more details. I now have so many questions.

I hope it‚Äôs what you had in mind.",1587227090,fnsqx23

It's not like I hate christians.  I hate the establishment of christianity, itself.  Or judaism, or islam, etc.  Religion is a tool, like a gun is a tool.  And much like a gun is only as bad as the person wielding it, so to is religion only as good as the people who use it to influence others.

People who hate religion based on the teachings of religion are misguided.  It's like the infighting of different sects within a certain branch of a religion, or even the infighting between the three branches of the Abrahamic faiths.  It's all the same god they're praying to, so why fight over whose way of praying is better?
