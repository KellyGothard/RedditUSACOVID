I'm currently in Texas but originally from New Jersey, so I miss hills and forest etc. I absolutely love Texas, however I can't stand the heat and flatness of it all, it's driving me crazy.

I am looking for a small town feel but not too rural. I would like a coastal city because I love the breeze from the ocean. Low on crime, don't really care for nightlife or bars. A good downtown area would be ideal.

Here are some towns I've thought about.

Bellevue, Anacortes , Kirkland, Bellingham. Do you have any other recommendations that are similar? Bellevue area is super expensive, and I am not going to be making much with my law degree, so that area might be out of my league , unless we rent.

110,EvilWalnut,"I hope you're right about voter turnout as a foreshadowing. As a layman I do not get a sense this is cut-and-dry, and I don't have faith in Spokane Valley humanity.  I will not be shocked if he is re-elected in the next general even after all [his Jihadi controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Shea#Controversies):

In 2018 Shea was re-elected for the **fourth** time with [57% of the vote (39,572 votes)](https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20181106/spokane/). This was after [the media reported](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/state-lawmaker-matt-shea-defends-advocacy-for-holy-army-as-spokane-sheriff-refers-his-writings-to-fbi/) on his *Biblical Basis for War.*  That year his legislative district (LD4) returned just over 71k ballots (71% turnout).

The final numbers for 2019 election show [24,960 votes from Spokane Valley (40% turnout)](https://www.spokanecounty.org/DocumentCenter/View/28067/November-5-2019-General-Election-PDF). I am not sure which of these listed jurisdictions are within Legislative District 4, and as comparison there were over 100k ballots in LD4 2018, but only 62k ballots in Spokane Valley 2019 -- I know I am missing some numbers here, so not really sure what the difference in turnout really is for LD4 between 2018 and 2019...

If someone can help us figure out the actual LD4 voter turnout delta from 2018 and 2019, we might have a story to tell.

319,GHMariner,"There are SO many places to go. It really depends on what you are looking for. Washington is a very diverse state. We have ocean beaches, rain forests, snow-capped mountains, an expansive desert bisected by a riverside oasis, majestic canyons, and, of course, Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands.

The catch is, you can't see all those things in one trip unless you are looking for a VERY whirlwind tour, which wouldn't allow you to really immerse yourself into any of them.  Most people come to Washington to see what they can't see elsewhere in the lower 48; Puget Sound set against the backdrop of the two mountain ranges that surround it. That's easy to do in and around Seattle. Most of us who live here tend to explore the rest of the state when we get out because it offers a change of scenery and pace from what we're used to.

As for where you should go, if you can tell us what you're hoping to get out of the trip, perhaps what inspired you to plan the trip, then we can make some more specific recommendations. The entire state offers abundant opportunities to explore nature and the outdoors, but in very different ways. Do you want to explore beaches, desert, forests, or mountains? Do you like to hike, ride bikes, paddle, or just explore by car?

Spring can be a beautiful time to be here, but it can also be very wet on the west side of the mountains. It's a crap shoot on any week as to whether it will be sunny and 70, or rainy and 50. So, you have to plan for both. I've literally spent a Saturday in April downhill skiing in the mountains, and Sunday took the boat to an island with the kids to play on the beach.

436,Dr_Adequate,"You're asking the wrong question.  The question is, is there a benefit to having a safety driver aboard an autonomous vehicle? 

Here's the [NTSB Report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/HAR1903.aspx) detailing how the Uber autonomous vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona last year, despite the presence of a safety driver. 

In short, the safety driver was lulled into a false sense of security, and so she spent her time watching videos on her phone rather than paying attention to what the vehicle was doing.  When the pedestrian stepped out in front of the vehicle, the vehicle did not perceive the pedestrian as an obstacle, and the safety driver was also not ready to take control of the vehicle and prevent the vehicle colliding with and killing the pedestrian.

So having a safety driver on board means nothing.  For that driver to be able to take control, that driver will have to be actively engaged and paying attention to the situation around the vehicle, all the time.  

Studies have shown that for a driver not paying attention, it takes up to fifteen seconds for that driver to perceive and understand the situation, then decide on a course of action to safely resolve the situation.

It's even more complicated than that.  One benefit of autonomous vehicles will be that persons with disabilities that prevent them from driving may be able to use autonomous vehicles to travel and enjoy a huge amount of freedom they haven't had previously.  Except these persons may not even have drivers licenses, nor be capable of operating a vehicle.  

And as AV's catch on, many people may not even see the need to learn how to operate a vehicle.  If an AV can fulfill all their transportation needs, why even learn how to drive?  

So the benefit of AV's is enhanced mobility for persons that normally wouldn't be able to enjoy that mobility.  The downside is that these people won't know *how* to drive the vehicle, or won't be capable of driving the vehicle if the autonomous system should fail, or if they need to take over in an emergency.  

Is the answer to require that all AV's must have a licensed ""emergency driver"" on board at all times?  Does that mean a person with a disability must hire an AV *and* an ""emergency driver"" before taking an AV trip?  But what's to prevent that ""emergency driver"" from zoning out to Yo\*T\*be videos, same as the Arizona safety driver?  

So in the end, AV's present many complex problems, and the mix of government regulatory agencies and private-sector developers have a lot of questions like these to answer.",1578280438,fdcp1o7

480,NakedAndBehindYou,"&gt;Automation has already eliminated millions of manufacturing jobs and damaged lives, families and communities.

While individuals are harmed when their specific jobs are automated, the net benefit to society of technological advancement is too great to stop each new advancement from occurring simply because some individuals will be harmed during its immediate arrival.

It's important to realize that each individual is continuously benefiting from the increase in quality of life, and decrease in cost of living, when *everyone else's* jobs are automated away. Thus, despite possibly losing your own job once in awhile to automation, your life still gets better over time as technology progresses *everywhere*, not just in your profession.

In other words: Would you support a ban on all email and text messages, in order to bring back jobs for the mailmen who carried physical letters around? I thought not. What about a ban on all cars in order to revive the jobs lost in the horse ranching profession? Yeah I didn't think so. What about a ban on movies in order to revive lost jobs in the theater industry? I doubt anyone will support that.

&gt;As the technology matures, companies will push to eliminate the human occupant and maximize profit.

This would be absolutely fantastic for consumers everywhere. This could significantly reduce the cost of transportation of goods across the country, meaning that prices of goods will go down for everyone. Transportation is a competitive industry not currently affected by much regulatory capture or oligopoly/monopoly behavior, which means a reduction in operating costs will largely be passed to consumers.",1578344787,fdeqzkm

Did you go to Portfolio day in November?( where are you coming from?)


If you are interested in design, Seattle central college has a highly thought of program.



My $.02 since you are asking.
If you are interested in any other subjects besides art/design, you will be better off attending a school where you can change majors without having to transfer schools and start all over.


As I told my daughter who was very interested in art, and considering Emily Carr, it was easier to do art on the side, than science.


However, if you live and breathe art and would be bereft studying anything else, then you deserve to attend a school that is prepared to instruct to a high level.

647,Wuellig,"Then please allow me to clarify: an income tax is a far more stable tax revenue because people need to have jobs to exist. They are not, however, required to go spend money on anything besides bare necessities. So in a squeezed economy (which, it must be said, is by design and not accident) people will continue to keep their jobs and pay rent and power and that's it. They will not, however, be out in the world at restaurants, or getting the new shoes, or many of the other discretionary items that generate sales tax.

With an income tax, the government gets to the money before the citizenry even gets it. With a sales tax, people *have* to spend to maintain it, but sometimes don't. To be clear, I'm not advocating for these things, merely explaining the difference in economic reliability.",1578447631,fdioq25

654,AcceptableTale,"I understand your point, but if you actually look at the data that's not what happens. It's a whole lot more likely for people to take a $10k reduction in income during a recession than it is for them to cut their spending on goods subject to sales tax by $10k.

Let's take a look at oregon from 2007 to 2009.

Year | Average AGI | % Change in State income tax collected
------|------|-------------|
2007 | $53,810 | N/A
2008 | $49,874 |  -10.4%
2009 | $47,320 | -5.1%

The WA DOR site is currently down so I can't get exact numbers, but from looking at the cached graph [here](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Cx__nVTbAyQJ:https://dor.wa.gov/about/statistics-reports/history-washington-taxes+&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us), sales tax collected went from just under $8 Billion in 2007 to $7.2 billion which corresponds to a 10% reduction in tax collected. That's less than the 15% reduction in tax collected that oregon saw. And the sales tax collected actually went up in 2008 from 2007. This suggests that when people lose their job, there's a lag period where they maintain their spending as normal while burning through cash/running up credit.

As you can see from that, the exact opposite of your claim is true. A sales tax is more economically reliable than a state income tax.",1578451864,fdivca9

Whenever a credit card is used, a fee is charged. Usually 2-3%. Typically the merchant is the one paying it because rules. Those rules don't really apply here, but there was probably some red tape that kept us from paying the fees until now.

So the bank was already receiving that money, but the state was the one paying it. Meaning our taxes were paying it anyway. It's my choice to pay with a credit card, so I'm perfectly okay not making other tax payers pay the fee for me.",1578510358,fdksply

706,romulusnr,"There used to be rules, but I believe those rules were removed a few years ago.

The merchants were expected to eat that cost because the idea was that being able to accept credit cards was a bonus to the merchant. They were basically paying the bank / agency for the ability to accept cards, much like you pay the electric company for the ability to have electricity.

But merchants got cheap and also credit transactions got ubiquitous, and merchants balked and often passed on the fees (in violation of their contracts with the banks/agencies). (In fairness, when people started making $1.50 purchases on cards, paying $2.50 to accept $1.50 does smack of ridiculousness.)

So my point is that you're right, the state was previously eating the cost of the credit transaction, which meant the state was getting less money, and they don't want to lose that money anymore.

You didn't prove a point other than to complain that your extended family didn't get a free citizenship and you dont like the process.   Ok, not my problem.  

Most migration and naturalization into this country since the 60s has been brown people, mostly Latinos in the millions.  So no, there's no adverse barrier for them, overall.  You can sneak into the country and get free welfare and housing benefits, free medical, a tax free job under the counter or on a stolen SSN.  Latinos have even gotten amnesties for the illegal members even after breaking our laws.  

But back to the point of gun rights, Latinos are not pro gun for the most part and that shift is impacting our rights.  Now.  Here.  Today.

This analogy to treating America like a frathouse we all live in is wrong. Look at three cases

1. An invited foreigner cannot come to r/Freeman001 's house even if he consents
2. An invited foreigner is allowed into his house if he consents
3. The foreigner is allowed in his house even if he doesn't give permission

Point 1 is our current situation where non-citizens aren't allowed onto a person's private property without government's sayso.

Point 2 is the true position of those who respect liberty. As in, I'm the property owner and fuck you if it bothers you that I want to invite people over to MY property.

&gt;Point 2 is the true position of those who respect liberty. 

Sounds more like open borders libertarianism to me, Koch.

Let me correct point 1 in saying your 22 million figure either comes from a shit source or no source at all, considering the actual estimate is roughly half that amount at 12.5 million with decreasing rates of illegal migration every year since the Obama era.

Now let me further correct you in pointing you towards our immigration policy. Firstly you must have some visa to enter, then compete for a limited h1b or marry, and then stay several years for the green card and then you'll be eligible for citizenship.

Decreasing rates doesn't mean a net outflow.  People are still coming in an those people have the highest birth rates.  You're using 15 year old numbers,  Gus.  So you're still without a point on the board.

998,ScallopOolong,"It's almost certainly Anglicized to one degree or another. William Bright, in his book *Native American Place Names of the United States* gives the ""original"" pronunciation as [wiÀên√°ƒça], which would be something like *wee-nah-chah*. The double dots after the *i* indicate a lengthened vowel, which usually also means stress, but the *√°* is also used for stress in his book.

But there is some additional complexity. ""Wenatchi"" was not the name they used for themselves. The Wenatchi spoke the Interior Salish language now called Columbia-Moses or [Columbia-Wenatchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia-Moses_language) (which is called *Nxa·∫£mxc√≠n* in their own language), while ""Wenatchi"" comes from a Sahaptin word‚ÄîSahaptin being a totally different language family from Salish, spoken by the Yakama, Nez Perce, Umatilla, and others.
 
Lewis and Clark called them ""Wahnaachee"", apparently taking the name from Sahaptin-speaking people. The Wenatchi name for themselves is something like Pisquoses, Pisquose, Pisquows, Pisko, Pishquitpah, or other variations like that, according to [this HistoryLink page](https://www.historylink.org/File/7624) and a bit of googling. How *that* is pronounced in their own language I don't know and can't find with brief googling.

Still, the Sahaptin word that gave us ""Wenatchee"" *might* have been pronounced more or less ""*wee-nah-cha""*. Sahaptin languages have the ""ch"" */t É/* sound‚Äîalthough it might have been an ejective */t É º/* (a kind of ""popped"" version English doesn't have). The Wenatchi's Salishan language doesn't have the ""ch"" sound.

And that ends today's Native American linguistics promulgation.",1578908580,fe7126d

Coming from Central California, the auto rate was a little cheaper, but mostly comparable, and the rates between Central CA and Denver were also mostly comparable, but AZ -&gt; Central CA was a fairly significant jump.

There are a ton of online quote options, and it's very much worth your while to check out as many as you can - make sure that you have your current policy coverage in hand so you can get Apples to Apples comparisons (the best you can, different states have different ways of doing things. FL, in particular, is kinda wacky and that makes it hard to do and A2A comparison.)

The names that come to mind because they have big brain advertising people that get that shit stuck in my head are:

Progressive (I've used them for almost a decade now and am happy)

GEICO (Used them before - that they started as Government Employees Insurance Company says it all. Not a good experience)

Esurance (Allstate in disguise)

Liberty Bibberty (We'll dub it!)

One that I had and was happy with years ago was American Family  (AmFam.com) - but I jumped ship after a rate raise. Worth getting a quote from and if they come in low, use 'em for a year then re-compare and jump ship when someone else treats you better. =)

And you have a quote from State Farm in hand. 

As always, make sure you have enough insurance that your life isn't fucked up when someone else fucks up. 

My Motorcycle Policy with State Farm was priced on the scenario ""Uninsured motorist in a stolen supercar left turns in front of me, leaving me nowhere to go, and I exit the intersection on a Helicopter""

My Auto Policy is priced on the fact that even plain old Chevy/Ford/RAM Trucks can be north of $75,000 and State Minimums haven't been raised in over a decade to account for that, leaving some people possibly woefully underinsured. https://i.imgur.com/KpJE2SJ.png",1579120031,fehnc6s

1196,CambrianExplosives,"Okay, so far two people have recommended sushi places which are not the best sushi restaurants in the city. Umi is good, but really expensive, and is still not quite as good as the best.

If you want the best sushi you have to go to Sushi.com. Yes, I know its a weird name. Yes I know it sounds like somewhere you would never eat, but I swear to you it is the best sushi in Spokane.

Other than that I would say /u/volvbro hit a lot of nails on the head. It really depends on what kind of mood you are in. Manito is an amazing park and since it sounds like you will be here in spring that would be a great time to go and see the gardens there. 

The Garland theater is a fun and cheap little historic theater that plays some older films along with a couple new films (ex. they are playing Cats this week along with playing ""The Outsiders"" on Tuesday). It has the Bon Bon connected to it which is a nice place to get a drink.

If you like parks and want to see one most visitors will miss there is a historic park that was made from an old horse racing circle called Corbin Park that is really nice for a short visit, or Lincoln park which is divided into the lower and upper halves, with the upper have showcasing beautiful views from the bluff.

I personally would also recommend going to South Perry street for lunch or dinner one day. They have a few nice restaurants on a strip there and its a nice little neighborhood.

Finally, if you want thai I recommend Bangkok Thai. My wife and I love it. It's definitely on the $$-$$$ side for Thai, but its really good.

Oh yeah, and go get Ice Cream at Doyles. It's a shop that's been around since 1940. It's in a neighborhood most people steer clear of, and its not out most exciting ice cream shop, but its really great and off the beaten path for sure.

Oh yeah again, and if you want a good burger for cheap on Monday the Backyard Public House is in the same neighborhood as Doyles and is really great... Okay I think that's everything now.",1579365550,fesiifx

&gt;The Indians were all away fishing, except for one who stayed in his house and looked scared to death. We picked out the best looking totem pole... I took a couple of sailors ashore and we chopped it down‚Äîjust like you'd chop down a tree. It was too big to roll down the beach, so we sawed it in two.

It was taken to Seattle and installed in Pioneer Square. Seattle was at the height of its Alaska/Klondike gold rush boom and was all into being the ""gateway to Alaska"". The Tlingit sent a party to Seattle to bring the totem pole back, but were denied. They sued for $20,000 and eventually got $500.

In 1938 an arsonist set fire to it. A replica was made by the Tlingit, this time with cooperation and proper payment. This is the one there today, installed in 1940.",1579489085,ff1ygy7

Spokane has beautiful scenery and mountains but they are dwarfed by the beauty of the ocean and olympics. HOWEVER, I feel like it so much easier to have places to yourself I‚Äôm eastern Washington and not deal with crowds. Like even on memorial day I can always find a campsite to fuck off to without reservations. In Port Townsend I feel like your competing with so many more people including the metro area. 

Spokane is a much much bigger town and has issues that cities do. Crime, homelessness, some traffic. However I tend to think they are super manageable. It would be super easy to have a country place and still only have a 20-30 min commute. Traffic is actually not bad at all except for few major routes for a short amount of time. Crime seems to me an issue that turns people off. We have a lot of petty crime (car break ins, porch pirates, etc) but very little violent crime. Like I never fear for my personal safety but I will never ever leave anything in my car. Spokane definitely has a little working class grit to it but the trade off is that it‚Äôs very affordable cost of living.  Port Townsend on the other hand comes off as a charming port town with just a little more yuppiness (not a slight). Not sure about it‚Äôs cost of living. 

Spokane has a lot more snow but sunnier summers. The Olympic peninsula is seriously rainier and grey.   

Spokane was awesome place for my wife and I to spend our twenties in and get our careers off the ground. The cost of living allowed us to do a lot more traveling and other hobbies.

The eight-hour day movement or 40-hour week movement, also known as the short-time movement, was a social movement to regulate the length of a working day, preventing excesses and abuses. Although it is claimed it had its origins in the Industrial Revolution in Britain, where industrial production in large factories transformed working life. The use of child labour was common. The working day could range from 10 to 16 hours, and the work week was typically six days a week.

The employers are not going to see drop in productivity. If anything, increase because of the morale boost. 

And as for your fear that employers will just cut pay, and hire someone else to do the extra work... that assumes a high unemployment rate, which we don't have. 

Employers are already paying you the least amount possible, trust me.  If they could afford to pay their employees less, they would already be doing that. They are not paying you at your current rate out of the goodness of their hearts. They know that if they pay any less, they will have trouble filling the positions.

1432,229-T,"Well, according to Wikipedia, a UBI is based on these requirements:

*Unconditional

*Automatic

*Non-Withdrawable

*Individual

*As a right

The PFD meets a few of those.  It's automatic and individual.  On the other hand, it's conditional (criminal disqualifications and continued presence, not just residency), it's arguably withdrawable (since it's subject to the performance of the fund, as well as legislative action) and it's certainly not a right (as above, subject to performance and legislative action all the way up to removing it).  Finally, and probably most important by my view, is that the idea of a UBI is to provide a level of income that provides for basic needs.  The PFD isn't even close to that.  Alaska considers the poverty threshold at $15,600/year for a single individual.  The PFD would, on average, barely cover 10% of that.",1579591758,ff5gfo6

1453,Evilconservative,"Absolutely there are those in the market that could absorb a drop in pay due to reduced hours.  People such as skilled workers make enough that they may be able to survive their hours and pay being cut.  However, I was thinking more of those working minimum wage or near-minimum wage jobs.

I understand that we have very low unemployment right now, but I think that you are assuming that people will only work one job and would not be available to take up the slack due to reduction in work-hours.  Isn't it likely that if McDonald's (for example) is forced to cut their workers' hours that those workers may have no choice but to find work at, say Burger King, to make up the difference?  After all, they aren't getting paid much and probably want the full 40 hours.  BK needs additional workers to cover the 8 hours per week per worker difference between 40 hours and 32 hours.  They don't want to pay overtime and since the same amount of work needs to get done (McDonald‚Äôs will not stay closed 20% more often), the only option is to hire more part-time employees.  So now you have one full time employee working 32 hours and one part-timer working 8.  Each person works at both restaurants for a total of 40 hours per week, but is not getting paid overtime.  They make 40 hours of straight time NOT 32 hours of straight time with 8 hours of time-and-a-half.

Of course, there may be a sweet spot.  It may be cheaper to pay OT to a point, but later, part-timers are cheaper because they also don‚Äôt usually get any benefits either.

Don't get me wrong, I hope you're right.  In fact, it would probably work out very well for me.  I have a great union job that will push for no lay-offs and I‚Äôll probably start getting way more OT than I currently do.  My hours won‚Äôt be cut.  However, my username notwithstanding, I really am more of a libertarian and feel that the government should keep its nose out of the market as much as possible.

1455,229-T,"Well, first issue is, of course, 'for free.'  The PFD (as well as any hypothetical UBI) is not 'free'.  The PFD is generated by oil revenues, which means that should those oil revenues dry up (say, from protests against climate change or some other political actions), that dividend goes away.  Other hypothetical UBI's may be unaffected by revenue streams (ie, raised by general tax income) or take whatever they are attached to into account, but either way, it's going to need some specific attention before it's applicable in general elsewhere.  

Now, as for it's affect, it's anecdotal, at best.  I highly doubt anyone is arguing that it makes **everyone** go blackout drunk, but does the PFD go directly into drink/drugs/(insert whatever vice tickles your fancy here)?  For some, sure.  I've seen it, hell, I've done it.  Does it go into basic living expenses, like food, gas, or rent?  Again, for some, sure.  Been there and done that, too.  Does it have a significant economic impact across the community, good or bad?  Hell if I know, and there's been nothing particularly convincing one way or the other that I've seen. I'm gonna need some more convincing research before I'm willing to call something one way or the other.  

A couple things that MAY be worth considering:

* Alaska leads in several categories of crimes, including consistently higher rates of murder, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery than the national average in 2017.  

* Alaska consistently ranks among the worst in the US for illicit drug use, binge drinking, violent crime rate, suicide, and naturally, the cost of living.  

What does that mean for the PFD vis a vis the idea of a UBI?  No idea, needs more research.  It's worth thinking about, though, especially when debating what the PFD may or may not be doing for quality of life.",1579595441,ff5j8to
1456,Evilconservative,"You're right.  Productivity has increased.  However, that doesn't usually seem to translate into more time off, just that we are now expected to do more with the productivity.  In other worlds, when increased efficiencies lead to doing the same amount of work in 10 months that used to take 12, businesses don't take 2 months off--they go further and use those efficiencies to make even more money.

As for professions that haven't changed, usually union jobs are at the top of the list.  For example, Jobs like police or prison guards will always need a certain number of officers per citizen/inmate to be effective.  We probably don't want RoboCop running around protecting us and there always needs to be a certain number of guards in a prison--they have prisoner-to-inmate ratios that for safety need to be maintained.

The 'do something' jobs have more or less universally gotten more efficient, and the benefits of that efficiency have rarely been seen by the vast majority of the population.

The 'be somewhere' jobs are another story, you can optimize to need fewer people that 'somewhere', but even then, only to a point.  Most of the optimizations here have been in how to squeeze more out of the 'be somewhere' people, or in removing the need for them entirely.

A guard is a great example of a 'be somewhere' person.  If you need someone on site, you need someone on site.

1537,emmazingitnip,"First of all, Allhome is not a ""company,"" it is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advocating for ending homelessness in king county. 

Second of all, the article mentions all of the ""bureacrats"" that make hundreds of thousands of dollars a yet-- when I only saw one. The director of allhome made 123k, which is in Seattle's housing market a solid middle class. The rest of us there were pretty much social services employees who work for nonprofits directly with homeless populations. The going rate for my position is 40k in seattle. I almost guarantee that most of the people who were there make under 60k. 

Third of all, the reason Ms St James was there was because she has lived experience as a homeless person-- trans women of color are disproportionately more likely to be homeless. I cant say that the decision for her to do a ""drag show"" (which is what it was announced as at the conference) was a great one. But it almost definitely was not supposed to go down the way it did.

And lastly, one nonprofit is not going to find the solution to homelessness in Seattle. That solution lies primarily in the redistribution of wealth in this state. Huge multibillion dollar companies are pushing the residents of king county to the fringes, and making it unlivable here for individuals who make a modest living.

People who work in homelessness are tired of this event being a talking point for people who dont understand the situation-- the event planners obviously made a huge PR mistake, but that doesn't mean the organization doesn't do what it says it does.",1579661120,ff7y45a

 I dont think Allhome is necessarily the most effective  organization, but I do think that people are using this event as an excuse to criticize a system that they dont understand for not fixing a problem they dont understand. And to bash on homeless people, which is the opposite of helpful. 

Homelessness is not caused by drugs, or laziness, or even primarily mental health problems. Homelessnes is caused by systematic poverty, and a high cost of living. If someone grew up poor, they are more likely to stay poor. Poor meaning one incident away from being homeless. Whether that means domestic violence, job loss, illness, injury, divorce. Once someone is homeless, it is so hard to get housed. It's no wonder people self medicate, or crack under the pressure, or act out in ways that seem unhelpful.

However something that I believe is missed in all of this, is that key point I just concurred with.  Guns are by nature simple to use and relatively non-strenuous.  The net benefit to criminals when attacking an unarmed person with a gun is not as great as it is with a knife or bladed weapon, considering that the presence of a firearm greatly increases sentencing as well as the fact that a vast majority of violent offenders are young men, and thus at a standard start off physically stronger than many others in the population.  So the benefit of using a gun for a criminal isn't quite as extreme as it may seem.

This is where it gets interesting.  A gun, Firearm, Semi automatic pistol, Rifle, shotgun can largely be used by the weakest members of our society, as it takes much less physical strength and stamina than a bladed weapon or club of some variety does.  Firearms, can and frequently do save the lives of women and the elderly, who most often lack the physical strength to fight off violent offenders.",1579829536,ffduwu4

I am completely fine with this. No regular person needs these sort of weapons for any legitimate reason. 

Further, these bills don't seem to vilify or criminalize anybody. They specifically state that owners of such firearms that were procured legally can keep such weapons, but they must be kept in an appropriate gun safe and only used in appropriate gun ranges. 

Nobody is made to be a criminal and it makes future procurement of weapons designed to kill en masse (that no regular person should have in the first place) illegal.

1781,AxisOfSmeagol,"All this is going to do is make more people dependent on the government. 

You hit the nail on the head. It's more cost effective to hire part time employees than it is to pay full time employees that overtime. Washington State healthcare system is rampant with it. As I write this, Seattle nurses are on the verge of striking over too many part time gigs and understaffed shifts. 

Business is about money. Want change things? Speak their language. 

Money talks, and the only way short of communism that we're going to change things is to make it attractive for companies to want to take care of their employees again. Taxing the holly piss out of them isn't going to do it. Just raising minimum wage and pretending that those costs aren't going to be recouped somewhere else; somewhere else NOT being the businesses bottom line, isn't going to make any difference. Cutting hours, will force people into multiple part time jobs that, since they're part time, won't be required to offer benefits, leaving the government the only option to turn to. 

Instead of blaming successful people for being such, and trying to figure out ways to punish them via taxes and regulations to take their cash, why not offer companies incentives for full time, and long time employees? For providing benefits? For wage increases and fair pay? The better they treat their employees, the better tax breaks they get.

Politicians on average get two year terms, so maybe for every two years you employ someone you get a tax break. For every 10K they make, you get a tax break. For offering a retirement plan, tax break. Benefits? Tax break, and so on. 

Now, this idea would be great for citizens, but I'm not sure big government would appreciate the income loss.

It is a thick and aggressive grass that fills in more thickly and it has really reduced the mud the dog brings.

You could also rent a high quality aerator for your lawn. That should help improve the drainage which should reduce mud, and will promote more even grass growth.

I guess I would recommend aerating the lawn in April or so, aggressively growing more grass by seeding and fertilizing (find a good guide), and adding 1/4‚Äù rock to any areas that won‚Äôt grow grass.

If you have standing water on your lawn for long periods of time e.g. it has stopped raining several hours ago and you still have large puddles in your yard, rock may help but you are probably looking at hiring a professional landscaper to take care of that, particularly if the water is standing within 2-3 feet of your house.",1580067147,ffnkebd

I got a Standard DL when we moved to WA because my Social Security Card is packed in a box someplace. I'll upgrade to the EDL when it gets unpacked and I can present it at the DOL.

/u/lusilan In order to get an Enhanced ID that's Real ID compliant as a non-citizen, the biggest hurdle appears to be having a Social Security Card - or a letter from the SSA stating you're not eligible for same. And if you don't have a Social Security Card, you've definitely got some other form of [Real ID compliant identification](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification) that will allow you to travel. (i.e. your Foreign Passport or US Green Card)

As a non-citizen, I don't think you need a Real ID compliant WA DL anyway - You've got your foreign passport with Visa attached, OR you as a Permanent Resident, you've got your Green Card. Both of which allow you entry to places secured by RealID (specifically, Aircraft flying in Federally Controlled Airspace, and to a MUCH lesser extent, Nuclear Power Plants. :D",1580080848,fforhix

1865,TomahawkJackson,"Looking at what's on the DOL website, you can't. 

The first thing it asks for is proof of citizenship. 

You may wind up getting a Standard (non-enhanced) ID, but your Permanent Resident card or Foreign Passport (I'm presuming you'll have one or the other, and maybe both) is your TSA-Compliant ID that'll get you on the plane. Or in the Nuclear Power Plant. Or into any other place that is subject to Real ID.

Or maybe you'll get a lawyer and sue, since Citizenship is not a stated requirement for the Real ID law, only having a Social Security Number/Card is. 

But probably, you'll fly using one of those other two documents. The TSA site says: 

&gt; Beginning Oct. 1, 2020, ***if you plan to use your state-issued ID or license to fly within the U.S.***, make sure it is REAL ID compliant. (emphasis mine)

It's convenient, I guess, to use your DL as your ID at the TSA Checkpoint, but I've gotten in the habit of just using my Passport anyway. Secretly makes me feel like a fucking globetrotting baller, even though I don't have any stamps in it yet. *shrug*",1580082547,ffowbql

Looking to move somewhere to find better work opportunities and lower cost of living. I also want to go back to college and basically start a life, be something.

They're USDA regulated, so you can look up pics and violations from the reports. It's sick, and the puppies are often in poor health. Mom dogs are bred continuously basically till death.

Pet stores can either buy from these mills and sell those animals in store, (the ""retail model"") or do in-store adoptions from local shelters (the ""adoption model""). Most major stores already do only adoptions.

Ppl prefer puppies, and they look purebred enough when they're young, they go for thousands in these pet stores.

Reputable breeders, who usually like dogs, also hate the mills.

Spokane is a beautiful laid back city that is very accepting of pretty much everyone. 

Spokane is far more affordable than Everett and friendlier than anywhere else I have ever lived. We have less gun violence here, virtually no gang violence and the that we do have traffic is pretty easy to deal with.

Far up on the north end of the sound, Bellingham is a pretty cool town and you can take the beautiful Chuckanut scenic byway southward.

At the western tip of Anacortes is Washington Park, which has some very cool short hiking trails, and some spectacular island and water views. In town, there are a ton of great restaurants and shops.

On the way back out of Anacortes, you can head south to Whidbey Island across Deception Pass. Down to Oak Harbor, and then take the ferry from Clinton to Mukilteo. From Everett to Olympia along the 5, it's pretty much just your standard city-to-suburb crawl, but once you've emancipated yourself from the I5 gridlock west of Olympia, there's the entire Olympic peninsula to explore. I would suggest driving north along 112 and heading in the direction of the northwest tip of the peninsula, then making the trek to gorgeous Shi Shi Beach.

2106,Dr_Adequate,"Five days isn't enough time, honestly, to really see all the things you've mentioned.  And if you are renting a car, the weather may prevent you from doing all the things you want.  Check the [WSDOT Pass Reports](https://www.wsdot.com/traffic/passes/default.aspx) because shit can get nasty quick, and rental car agencies may not allow you to drive in the snow/over the passes. 

However... 

If you're going to Snoqualmie, and you like beer, Dru Bru Brewery is right at the top of Snoqualmie Pass, at the ski resort, and they have some excellent beer on tap.  Bring a growler, or a couple of crowlers, and get something good to take with you.

If you go to Snoqualmie, and you can keep going east, go to Cle Elum, and turn north on Highway 97 over Blewett Pass.  Check the weather, as the pass may be closed.  But if you can, 97 is a beautiful scenic mountain road that takes you to Leavenworth, which is [absolutely gorgeous](https://www.yakimaherald.com/magazine/travel/regional/leavenworth-for-the-holidays/article_36dc2cfa-e9ba-11e8-ab9c-e30a5fb59d80.html) in the winter.  It's an entire *faux Swiss village* up in the Cascade mountains.  There is great food and great beer in Leavenworth.   

From Leavenworth the drive west back over Stevens Pass is absolutely wonderful.  You can stop in Roslyn ([where that TV Show set in Alaska was filmed](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2939))and have a drink at The Brick pub.  And there are many other small towns where you can learn about local history and culture.  Silly as this sounds, I always stop at the [wayside chapel](http://eriktomrenwrites.com/tiny-wayside-chapel/) just past Sultan when I drive this route. 

Once you're safely back on the wet side, Highway 2 brings you to the town of Snohomish which has a vibrant nightlife. My favorites are [Fred's Rivertown Alehouse](https://www.facebook.com/fredsrivertown.alehouse/) and [The Repp](https://www.facebook.com/TheRepp/).  

But...

If you want to see Deception Pass, then from Seattle take I-5 north then Highway 525 to Mukilteo, then take the [Washington State Ferry](https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/) to Clinton on Whidbey Island.  Head north on Whidbey Island on 525 towards Coupville and Oak Harbor, and be sure to stop at [Fort Casey](https://parks.state.wa.us/505/Fort-Casey) and check out the WWI gun emplacements.  Double Bluff Brewery (if you like beer) in Langley is an excellent hidden gem.  Continue on to Deception Pass and on into Anacortes.  There are lots of great restaurants in downtown, then you can continue on Highway 20 east back to I-5, then south towards Arlington, Marysville, Everett, and Seattle.  

If you have the time to stop in Everett, and you like art, stop at [The Schack Art Center](https://www.schack.org/) to see great art and maybe live glass-blowing.  If you are hungry or thirsty, the [Anthony's Home Port](https://www.anthonys.com/restaurants/detail/anthonys-homeport-everett) on the waterfront is a nice place to stop in for a good five-star dinner.  If you want a smaller, more intimate place, [The New Mexicans](https://www.facebook.com/TheNewMexicans/) in downtown is a great local joint with good food.  Stop at Toggle's Bottle Shop next door to refill, if your beer supply is running low.  

While you're in Everett, if you planned ahead you can tour the [Boeing assembly building](https://www.boeingfutureofflight.com/boeing-tour-seattle) the largest (by volume) building in the world. You can also visit the [Heritage Warbird Foundation](http://www.warbirdheritagefoundation.org/) that Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen established to preserve his collection of WWII and Cold War airplanes and tanks.  

Once you get back into Seattle proper, you really should check out the [Fremont Troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Troll), and stop at [Archie McPhee's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_McPhee) just because it's so weird.  And (if you like beer) there are a ton of good microbreweries around town to check out.  

If the Boeing tour in Everett was your thing, then the Boeing Museum of Flight just south of downtown will really rock you.  Expect to spend several hours there.  And next to Boeing Field is the neighborhood known as SODO (SOuth of the DOme) which has a ton of great funky restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and *dive bars*.  Also a lot of cool urban street art and [general weirdness](http://www.georgetowntrailerpark.com/).    

If you're into selfies, take a selfie in front of the [Alki Beach Statue of Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty_(Seattle)) on your way back to SeaTac.

&gt;The penalty for not having a Discover Pass is $99. The fine may be reduced to $59 if an individual provides proof of purchase of an annual Discover Pass to the court within 15 days after the notice of violation is written.

Most rangers I have seen are nice enough to not fine you right away if you are there, but i've seen them write the fines and stick it on the windshield when peoples cars were parked and they weren't there.

I feel like we need to help them out and do MORE for them. Give them a safe place to live because shelters are NOT safe. I guess my view is different because I've had to stand in line at a food bank because all our money was going towards keeping a roof over our heads, not our food. And we're in the same sort of pickle now too, money's running low and we have to start cutting out certain things to keep the house, pay the bills and so on and so forth. I might have to go back to standing in line at the food bank. It's a serious struggle and I'm just lucky we haven't lost the house yet.

The fire burned 50,000 acres, and burned for three months, before being declared completely contained. As of May 29, 2018 it was found still smoldering in some areas.

Personally, I bought one every year, and donated to the parks on my car renewals, as well as supported the Washington State Parks Fund non-profit. I'm a big fan of our state parks, and a heavy user. But I was always annoyed by the hassle of remembering the pass, and frustrated by the need to have two of them if my wife and I drove separately, even though both passes had the same two license plate numbers. But more than that, I hated to think that less fortunate families might not be taking advantage of the parks because the $30 fee was deemed an unnecessary expense.

Filled the attic, and the walls with the stuff, and our energy bill went down about 20% the first year.

What about your walls? Plaster or drywall? In 1961, they were transitioning to drywall, but most construction was still plaster.

When I moved into the house I needed to plumb a line for the ice-maker in my fridge.  I put a pipe wrench on a 1-1/2"" galvanized supply line in my basement and the jaws of the pipe wrench went right through the wall of the pipe.  I just went to the big orange and replaced that 10'or so section of pipe with another piece of the same.  
  
Galvanized pipe corrodes from the inside out and you'd never know the pipe wall was about 10% of it's original thickness and the inside diameter was reduced due to rust flaking off the inside wall unless it gets bad enough to start dripping or reduce flow at your faucet.

I keep an eye out for drips on the basement floor and will occasionally check the water meter reading before I go to bed, then look again in the AM to reveal a leak somewhere.

*The 37th Legislative District covers parts of King County, and the Republican caucus for the district was held Saturday, April 21 at Dimmitt Middle School. The caucus was broken up by King County Republican Party Chairman Lori Sotelo after the caucus elected Ron Paul supporter Tamra Smilanich as chair. Sotelo declared that the caucus was no longer a Party event, but had become a Ron Paul Campaign event, and that the attendees would have to vacate the building. As Smilanich attempted to conduct business, Sotelo stated to the caucus, ""The Ron Paul campaign does not have authority to rent this space. They have not provided insurance for this building"", and (addressing Smilanich) ""You do not have authority to run the meeting in this building. You will have ten minutes before this building must be vacated, Tamra.""  The caucus was moved outside at about 12:30 pm, business was resumed, and delegates to the April 28 county convention were elected, all eleven of those being Paul supporters. Each caucus-goer had been required to pay a $10 fee to attend the caucus, Sotelo saying that the fee was to help pay for the party's expenses for using the school. Sotelo refused to refund the $10 fees after the caucus was moved outside.*",1580952615,fgntl43

My 75 year old father had a heart attack then needed emergency open heart surgery out of state, I am currently helping him through his recovery.

I applied for services on 1/9/2020, my claim status is still at: Submitted. It is now 2/12/2020, I was able to talk to someone at the office once after trying for six hours. I have tried calling again and now am unable to get through, I have sent emails without receiving a reply back.

I consider myself lucky that I did have an emergency fund that kept me going without one of the incomes our family depends on for a month, as well as the expenses it cost to get down to California. I also consider myself lucky that I am in a position to take out a short-term loan, which I will now need to look into doing.

However, I know there are plenty of people that are not as lucky as me, I could only imagine the horror when the Washington promised the safety, security, and dignity has not materialized.

I have no doubt this program will provide Washingtonians with everything they said it would, but right now it is not - and it is failing the people who need the safety net the most.",1581534603,fhf21jo

And how this and other things were done in secret, but eventually the public found out and preservationists were able to save surprisingly small areas of old growth within the park.

When the wheels touched down, the plane flipped over and slid backward 400 feet.  The men remembered hearing about the steam caves and scrambled back up to the crater. They found a small cave where they were forced to spend the night in -35o weather with no survival gear.  They were rescued the next morning after a three-hour wait while rescuers disagreed over whose jurisdiction it was. They both survived the crash without so much as a scratch. However one man suffered the indignity of having second degree burns on his buttocks because he sat on the plane‚Äôs seat cushion over a steam vent.

They flew in Lee's 1947 two-seater Cessna 140 and, after reaching the montain, they decided to fly over the summit area. They climbed to near the small plane's 15,000-foot altitude ceiling and flew northwesterly across the crater, moving at about 90 miles per hour with the estimated 20-30 mph wind. They crossed the main (east) crater summit and then the west crater, reportedly only about 20-20 feet above the crater snows. When they reached the northwestern edge of the crater a downdraft caused the...(google books preview missing here)...dropped with a note saying a helicopter would arrive in about two hours. Later a plastic tube tent and aluminum ""space blanket"" were dropped to the shivering men, who wrapped up in them. About three hours later a Chinook helicopter arrived from Fort Lewis and landed for a pickup of the two men from the 13,500 foot saddle between the crater and Liberty Cap. They were carried first to the Paradise Ranger Station, then to St. Joseph's Hospital in Tacoma for examination.

Free health care to the people. Those providing it are compensated. And they will be compensated more under Medicare for all. Know why?

But take the business out of healthcare and there is no need to wrestle for reimbursement. You know how much time is wasted filling out paperwork for authorization for procedures? Time is money. That time could be spent taking care of patients.

1. It is generally easier to pass bills at the state level than at the national level, as there is usually the same political party in control of the house of reps, the senate, and the mayor. At the national level, as there is now, the two major political parties often split these three points, so things do not often pass all 3.

2. Most of the right to repair bills like this one would require companies like apple to prodive diagnostic tools and repair components to 3rd party repair companies and people who own their products (at normal price of course). The thing is if even one of these bills pass, it would require the tech companies to provide this assistance to only one state, and it would likely quickly snowball the the rest of the nation. Then the rest of the world would likely follow. As such, large tech companies are trying very hard to stop even a single right to repair bill from passing. I do not know the current status of any of them, but there are several states considering similar legislation as well.

* A: Makes our zoning laws more similar to the National Zoning Laws in Japan.
* B: Reduces/improves the historical impact of redlining on our cities.
* C: Allows land resources to be used in the most efficient manner. 

Nothing that I see here bans the ability for a builder to build SFH structures - it would instead allow builders to build a healthier mix of dwellings in the same area. For instance...

Which to me mostly means that the owner of a nearly dead strip mall built in '60s could (rather than continuing to neglect the maintenance of it) ""upcycle"" the property to uses that better fit the current needs of the area without having to go through the hassle and expense of trying to get the property rezoned (which *always* has (expensive) opponents you have to fight...)",1582087935,fi2sn9w

Want to go to the ocean?  Take the ferry to Bainbridge or Kingston, then get on 101 north towards Port Townsend, then Sequim and Port Angeles.  Just past Port Angeles take the turnoff for Black Diamond Road, and follow it west until it rejoins WA-101.  Turn right, back towards PA, then at the junction with WA-112 turn left and take 112 out through Joyce and on to Sekiu.  There are a couple of good diners in Sekiu for lunch, and you can go home, or keep going out to La Push.  

Want to go home? Just past Sekiu take 113 south back towards Lake Crescent and WA-101.  The drive around Lake Crescent is stunning, and you should stop at the lodge for a quick drink &amp; rest.  Or linger for an early dinner, or even stay the night.  

Want to keep going to the ocean?  Follow 112 all the way to Neah Bay and Cape Flattery (northernmost point on the contiguous US).  The road is rough and bumpy, but a great view of the straits at every turn.  

Or stay on 101 south to Forks, then take 110 out to La Push.  There's a great resort on the Makah reservation with camping, cabins, and motel rooms.  And surfing.  If you have a wetsuit and a board there are good waves to be had there.  Or just chill and enjoy the beaches.  You can buy firewood in town, and have a beach campfire.  A bunch of places in town have great, fresh-caught seafood.  

Want some deserted twisty roads?  Take the ferry to Bremerton, then 3 south toward Gorst, but turn off onto Belfair Valley Road.  Follow it to Belfair, then take Belfair-Tahuya road to Dewatto Road to Seabeck-Holly road which brings you back to WA-3 and then you can turn north to Poulsbo for lunch at any one of numerous cute little cafes and restaurants, or south back to Bremerton for lunch in town, then take either ferry back to the mainland.  

Want to go on the dry side?  Drone across I-90 to Ellensburg, then take the turnoff to Yakima Canyon Road.  It's a long, twisty, scenic road that hugs the Yakima River and takes you to Selah.  Be warned, it's a notorious speed trap, so be cool.  In Selah Miner's Drive-In is the eternal high-school hangout &amp; hip drive-in place.  

Want to go a bit farther south?  Take I-5 south to Castle Rock, then head east on 504 to the Mt. St. Helens Visitor's Center.  Or if you really want a drive, from Tacoma, take WA-7 south to Morton, head east to Randle, then take US Forest Service road 25 to Windy Ridge.  It's paved, but due to the constantly-shifting ground it's lumpy, bumpy, and rough, but the reward is an absolutely breathtaking view of the crater atop St. Helens, with Spirit Lake in the distance.  Seriously, one minute you're deep in piney woods, and suddenly you pop out and the landscape is like the surface of the moon, with the crater off in the distance.  It's surreal.  

Once it gets warmer and drier, and Highway 20 opens, you have some more choices.  Take I-5 north to WA-532 (Stanwood-Bryant Road), and head east.  Follow Highway 9 north past Big Lake (there's a stretch there posted at 35 but it's way funner if you have a heavy foot).  When you get to the turnoff for S. Skagit Highway / Sauk River Road, take it, turn right and follow the road along the river several miles to the junction with Sauk Valley Road, where it joins Highway 20.  Follow 20 east toward Newhalem and Diablo Canyon, over Washington Pass and Rainy Pass and on in to Winthrop.  Have lunch there, and if this is your thing do it at the Old Schoolhouse Brewery which is right on the river with a great outdoor dining area.  Quickest way home is to retrace your way back west on 20, unless you decide to stay at any number of B&amp;B's, and AirBnB's in Winthrop or Twisp.  

Another option if you want to do 20 is to sign up for the [Seattle City Light tour of the Diablo Dam powerhouse](https://www.seattle.gov/light/damtours/diablotours.asp) where you get a ride on a funicular railway, a boat ride across the lake, a tour of the dam &amp; powerplant, and a chicken dinner.

The USA's War on Drugs empowered the cartels... why is that a basis for punishing individual immigrants?

&gt;or proven corrupt Politicians?

Never heard of Rob Ford?  You really think Canada is corruption free?  I'm guessing you know a lot less about Canada than you're letting on. 

&gt;	How many Canadiens do you hear about involved in Violent crimes in the US?

Why is anecdotal evidence your go-to?  How about some statistics:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime#United_States

&gt;&gt; There is no empirical evidence that either legal or illegal immigration increases crime rate in the United States.[184][185] Most studies in the U.S. have found lower crime rates among immigrants than among non-immigrants, and that higher concentrations of immigrants are associated with lower crime rates.

&gt;&gt;...

&gt;&gt; Multiple studies have found that undocumented immigration to the United States do not increase violent crime.[225][226][227] A 2017 study found that ""Increased undocumented immigration was significantly associated with reductions in drug arrests, drug overdose deaths, and DUI arrests, net of other factors.""[228]

You're forming an opinion about a whole nation of people purely based on BS out of the mouths of some talking heads.

&gt;	Illegals can come from anywhere, to protect our country we can‚Äôt let in just anyone.

If I had to choose between the two of those, I'd choose The Dalles. The scenery both in the Columbia Gorge and the high desert SE of there is much better, and there's a lot more to do in the Gorge. Also, if your wife's job doesn't work out, there are more economic opportunities in the Gorge than there are in Walla Walla, at least as a general statement.

But there are tradeoffs, a big one being that Oregon's income taxes are high. In Walla Walla, you can drive to Oregon for larger purchases and no sales tax, while paying no income tax in WA. It adds up.

The Dalles is something of a mixed bag. There's a non-trivial narcotics problem, and I've never been to a town with more complainers. Sometimes I laugh and want to give people a field trip to North Philadelphia so they'll appreciate what they have. LOL. Rents are high pretty much throughout the Gorge. A fair amount of the choice depends on how much money the two of you will be making, but given the realities as I know them, I'd probably lean toward The Dalles -- but not by much, because Walla Walla has a lot going for it.

I'm like the Motel 6 guy: ""I've been everywhere, man."" All 50 states, including living in the Midwest, East, and West. I'd be happy to give more help if you'd like, but I think I'll need to know more about you and your plans to do that.

3337,TBTop,"$20-$30K a year is a powerful incentive to pick Walla Walla. The Dalles is much closer to PDX, but is proximity worth the money? It's a long drive to the Portland airport, but it's also an easy drive, completely uncongested.

Your call, but I know what mine would be. In my other posts, I've talked up Eastern Oregon, but the geography of Walla Walla makes the places I'd point you to almost as close as they'd be if you lived in The Dalles.

My other answer gave a slight preference to The Dalles, but the more I think about this, the more I'm inclined to do a U turn. Not only that, but if you'd compare the city of WW to the city of TD, I think WW is nicer.",1582405082,fih0223

3339,TBTop,"Accepted. I know, it's Reddit. This place is full of smartassery, occasionally my own. In this case, I'm being straight-up. I've lived and traveled all over the place; the high desert is probably my favorite region in the entire world. I like to think I come by that honestly, having traveled to every state, half of Canada, and 25 other foreign countries.

I like to tell people that the worst they'll be is bored by what at first seems monotonous -- but if they wind up liking it, they won't just like it. I am absolutely and hopelessly batshit crazy for the emptiness and the stark, horizontal beauty of the high desert. The following, from a foreword to a family history, says it better than I can, and might help show you why I am so high on Eastern Oregon, Nevada north of Vegas, and western and southern Utah.

This part of the American West is unpolluted by the boutique Olde West tourist traps you find in parts of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Arizona. It's the last frontier left in the Lower 48, partly because there isn't enough water to support a lot of settlement and partly because it's so far from the national parks circuit that it doesn't get the tourist crush you find elsewhere.

The high desert is one of my favorite things to write about, and I'd be more than happy to talk to you about the fantastic, lonely, harsh, and sacred and magical land, and the boatloads of Western history in the region. It is America minus 75 years, in the very best possible way. This definitely includes the people. If you ever have to depend on the kindness of strangers (and we have a few times), there is no better place for that to happen than in Eastern Oregon, IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------

&amp;#x200B;

Out here the atmosphere is so clear one can stand outside at night, reach up, and almost touch the stars. The Milky Way carves an arc across the heavens like a white sash. The sun shines at least three hundred days a year. It gets hot in the summer and well below zero in the winter. Almost without fail in the summer, a cool breeze arrives in the early afternoon, and in winter the humidity is so low that even below-zero temperatures are easily tolerated. ‚Ä¶

This can be a lonesome country, eerily silent at times, especially at night. When coyotes out there in the sagebrush start howling at the moon, checking in and discussing the night's activities with their pals, they are only making plans to locate something to eat. You might hear an owl up in one of the trees, his big eyes peeled for a mouse for breakfast, telling everyone about it with his mournful call. In the quiet of the night, howling coyotes and that sudden mournful call of the owl can send a chill up the back of the uninitiated youngster.

Sometimes the silence can be there in the daylight, too. And that is good. If it is very quiet, you will hear the song of the meadowlark sitting on a fencepost close by, or the scream of an eagle or a hawk circling overhead, like those coyotes and the owl, hunting for some lunch. When you see those things and hear those sounds, no matter how crazy and mixed up this old world is today, you know goodness still exists on this land ‚Äì pure, God-given, natural goodness.

If it's crowds of people, bright lights, car horns, angry drivers and the hustle bustle of the city that you desire, this is definitely not the life for you. I suspect most folks who drive Highway 95 in this part of Oregon would consider it the most boring, desolate stretch of road in America. We leave them to their thoughts, and wish them Godspeed. In our haste today, it is easy to miss the beauty and serenity of this wonderful land. For those people born and raised here, for those who have lived their lives here, and for others who have sought the solitude, this is their Eden.

I'm currently a WV resident who's deployed overseas. I'm 21 with goals of owning realestate and working an IT management job. WV really isn't doing it for me. I've been looking into the Western part of Washington and it looks like somewhere I'd like to settle down in. I'm going to take a trip to Washington when I return home and would like some help narrowing down where to start.

My questions start on where I should move. I'm a huge fan of the outdoors but I need to be close enough to civilization to be able to have a life with new friends and preferably a rave scene but not necessary. It also has to be close enough to the city for me to have a good tech job. The initial place I live is pretty flexible because I can always buy another house and rent the old one. Due to me never being there I have no clue where to start looking.

Secondly I'm interested in how hard it is to get an IT systems management position around a place like the one described above. I really enjoy setting up networks and I won't go to in detail but I need to know how hard it would be to get a job like that.

We get too focused on our political identity and so much of the disparaging of people on the ""other side"" (no matter which side you happen to be on) comes down to people thinking the ""other side"" is a caricature of all the worst political boogieman we can imagine.

That's a strange take.  This isn't only a Washington problem.  Watershed depletion as a result of extraction is a very well-documented problem.  They aren't infinite, and can't replenish themselves forever.

Here's a [good study on the topic](https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=utpp), it specifically mentions this exact scenario in NH and AZ:

&gt; Significant water extraction from a region damages the ecosystem that relies on its watershed. In 2004, bottling company USA Springs wanted to extract up to 300,000 gallons per day from a watershed that supports the cities of Barrington, Nottingham, and several others in New Hampshire (Gleick, 2010). Local officials of Barrington required USA Springs to conduct a ten-day test on the spring from which they wanted to draw water (Glieck 2010). During test, sections of a local wetland critical to the area dried up, indicating that 300,000 gallons per day was unsustainable and clearly detrimental to the ecosystem and the cities‚Äô water supply (Gleick, 2010). 

&gt; A similar case in Arizona involved the Sedona Springs Bottled Water Company (Gleick, 2010). In this case, extraction diminished surface water so significantly in Seven Springs Wash and Spur Cross Ranch Conservation Area that the ecosystem saw deaths of native fish, leopard frogs, Mexican black hawks, sycamore and ash trees, and deer grass. Precipitation can replenish surface sources relatively quickly, but aquifers can take years or decades to recover (CWSC, 2017). Even though bottling can harm local ecosystems, consumers do not think about them as effects of purchasing bottled water. Saylor et al. (2011) noted that most of their survey respondents did not consider environmental impacts when choosing between bottled and tap water, indicating that consumers also leave environmental considerations external to their decision of how much bottled water to buy.",1582647661,fiqmtnj

Rail is an exceptionally efficient mode of transportation - CSX reported 490 ton/miles per gallon in 2018.

Compare to the fossil fuel burning truck that you (probably) had in mind...

""157 Long Haul Trucks move 3000 tons of goods 500 miles using 11,210 gallons of fuel"" - or 134 ton/miles per gallon for comparison. That's **3.65x** as much fuel for delivery by truck than it is for rail.

Fuck. you. and fuck your stupid pampered dog - I assure you your dog would *definitely* drink tap water if you lived in an apartment.

&gt; bottling company USA Springs wanted to extract up to ***300,000 gallons per day*** from a watershed that supports the cities of Barrington, Nottingham, and several others in New Hampshire

&gt; [Nestl√© Waters' proposal to take 1.1 million gallons per day](https://www.newsweek.com/nestle-wants-11m-gallons-water-per-day-florida-conservationists-are-fighting-back-1456416) from the public source of water.

&gt; 500 to 1200 bottles per minute = 165,000 gallons per day = 4,050,000 gallons per month.

You're missing the whole business model of bottled water companies. 

They're taking water out of the tap, putting it in bottles, and selling you the tap water. What's worse is that they're not even taking YOUR tap water, bottling it, then selling it to you. They're taking tap water from the cheapest places in the country where the water use and quality laws are the worst (read: Michigan, Florida, Arizona), bottling THAT, and then shipping it to you and marketing to you a ""a healthier option than tap water"". Hilarious and super sad.

&gt; My construction crew is instructed to drink a bottle an hour when it hot. Bottled water is the main way I see it done.

Right, because it's ***left up to your crew to not die on the job*** because [y'all can't be arsed to spend $300 to take care of your guys](https://www.ntotank.com/205gallon-acerotomold-white-pickup-truck-bed-tank-x7968573). Fuck you twice, buddy. You're passing the cost of ""do not die on me"" on to them, and they're taking up the expense of not dying on you. By (as you say) largely consuming single use plastics.

You have it in your power to fix that. 

It's $10 for 24 bottles of Arrowhead. Drinking 8 bottles/day, You're passing on $66/mo employee to stay hydrated.

If you honestly believe this of republicans and not democrats then you're blind. Both parties are a ridiculous joke that have more in common with each other than any of the citizenry.

We have no real choices, we are subjects rather than citizens, and the gilded cage of ""democracy"", materialism, and modernity keeps us docile and unaware of our virtual slavery.

3617,RA_Shepherd,"&gt; People really need to get out of their demonization of others over political ideologies.

I'm a right-leaning ""centrist"" and I have to disagree.

The modern liberal ideology consists of:

No borders, no sovereignty, a reduced military, no freedom of speech, and no right to self defense. 

Universal healthcare for anyone who comes here, and taxes to drive every single entrepreneur out of the state and country. 

The replacement of anything White, European, Christian, or Traditional. 

Anti-natalism and anti-family propaganda, partial-birth abortion, LGBT education for toddlers, and hormone blockers for children. 

Even anti-science, everything from the misrepresentation of climate change for profit and power, to the denial of racial and gender differences which are not only visible facts but are also scientifically provable.

The left literally believes in using State violence to ""correct"" anything that existed before the rise of post-modernism, third-wave feminism, and neo-marxism.

While obviously not every liberal voter supports it, the ideology is fundamentally rooted in the destruction of everything that created western civilization. 

How is this not deplorable? Why should we not demonize people who enable or support these ideas?

&gt;today's politics at a national level are tame in comparison. Our age is not exceptional.

I can't help but disagree here as well, more is at stake right now than at any point in history. That is partly due to the modern world, in Grant's time the world was not so interconnected, and it didn't change quite so quickly. Even if the politics were ""wilder"", the potential for ruin was lower.",1582800701,fiws91o

Regarding loading, they have several lanes (between 5 and 10) that cars line up in. They load the ferry by lane, so one lane drives on and then the next lane and so on and so forth. They have crew inside to tell you where to park. There are three ‚Äúcorridors‚Äù where you can park, left, middle and right. I think the left and right ones are two cars side by side and the middle one is 3 or 4 cars side by side.

As each car passed through the fare booth they reached out and handed a card, or cash to the sleepy, bored employees inside the little booths. My turn, I hand the woman inside $8 cash, I tell her to have a good day, she smiles, but weakly, I drive forward. The ferry hasn't arrived yet, but out on the water I can see it moving slowly towards us, I see a sign that says 'shut off vehicles when not loading', I shut my 92 honda civic off. Around me the sounds and smells of the ferry terminal invade my senses, briney puget sound air, seagulls squawking, a mother &amp; father walk by with their little boy between them, probably going to get ice cream and coffee on the waterfront. 

The ferry arrives, seeming to ram the terminal before its stern thrusters reverse suddenly and boil the emerald waters briefly before settling in to snuggly fit againts the terminal as a large metal ramp lowers to form the guideway for the 20....no perhaps 30 cars and trucks lined up in front of me. I wonder if I will even make this ferry before it's full up? This irritates me. But we all begin to progress forward down the ramp to the maw of the large, white, green and rust colored ferry; idling in a low rumble while the vehicles board and many brightly colored workers direct them. They look bored as well. Perhaps the ferry jobs are just boring, but I heard they pay quite well; possibly explaining why most the workers seem 20lbs overweight. 

I get a lucky outdoors spot to park on the gunwale side, I put my vehicles emergency brake on, shut off the engine, and lower my window. I think this time I will *not* be tempted by the overpriced coffee and treats upstairs and just lean back and enjoy the ride. The ferry's engine revs, sending an audible vibration through the entire rig, the beast lurches suddenly forward before smoothing out in the deeper waters. In the distance towards Elliott Bay I can see faintly the Space Needle poking out amongst squat angular buildings.

3637,dude463,"It depends on the route you take or the ferry that's on the route or how many boats you have to wait for to get a spot.

&amp;#x200B;

Typically speaking WSDOT will park the big (heavy or long) vehicles first down the middle of the boat to keep center of gravity centered. Then passenger vehicles. The staff direct you which way to go (port or starboard) and guide you to within inches of the car in front of you to get the most onto the boat that they can. Cars are parked nose to but of the car in front of them. Disembarking is much the same, with semi's first then the rest but it's done in an orderly fashion to keep the boat leveled. If the ferry has more than one stop the cars that will be offloading at the next stop are typically loaded first, unless the boat only has one stop then the second stop loads first and does a U-turn and parks along the outside, with the first stop cars parking along the inside. At the first stop the inside cars disembark and the 2nd stop's cars load with all cars now facing the same direction. Basically speaking it really depends on the boat and the route which way they do what they do but everything is about balancing the boat at every step.

For walkons if there's an entry up top for passengers that happens at the same time as vehicles. If passengers must walk on the same way as cars they hold the cars until pedestrians  and cyclists can safely get on or off. Bicycles always use the car entry. There's usually a lot of pubic transit at the dock (lots of different buses).

If the trip is pretty short some people opt to stay in their car. If it's closer to an hour most people go up to the covered deck or even outside if the weather is good. The views are spectacular but some have seen them so many times they just read a book in their car.

Sailings can be cancelled due to inclement weather. Also sailings can be cancelled for extreme low tides (king tides). Some routes are a lot more susceptible to these than others. Medical emergencies can also screw up the schedule. Missing the last boat sucks but does happen. Special runs could be added if there's a large event. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Seattle-Bremerton or Seattle-Bainbridge Island ferries are the most popular / well known. You see them on most NFL broadcasts for example when in Seattle and they've been featured on things like Greys Anatomy. But WSDOT's ferry system is the 2nd largest ferry system in the world. There's a lot more to it than just that.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not unheard of to see a whale or a Navy convoy with Bremerton's ferry dock right next to the Naval shipyard, or cargo ships since there's a lot of industrial docks to the south of Colman Dock in Seattle, or sailboats when the weather is good because, well, water.

Sometimes, there is no wait. If you're on the shoulder, eventually you see a booth (similar to toll booth) where you pay and usually they either tell you a number for the line you drive into or they tell to drive where directed. You wait longer. The.ferry unloads then your ferry will load with two lanes of cars (unless someone new freaks out and tries to single file it, sigh).

Boarding the ferry, it runs while you board and embark, pushing water back from the dock. I love it. 

Also boarding, there is a middle parking tunnel that is taller than the sides. Trucks and trailers always go in there, cars can. Each side has two levels of parking with two lanes on each. On these lanes, there is a guard rail and you can watch the water. The bar obstructs the view a bit from a sedan, but SUV's are tall enough for a good view. The luckiest spot is top side deck, on the very edge by the water. If I get that, I stay in my car. Otherwise, I get out and head upstairs. 

When the ferry schedule first increases in Spring, there's a group of locals on San Juan island who await a morning ferry and complain about tourists. I heard them 3 years in a row from a wooden deck of a nearby bar/restaurant. The waiting on the island side of ferries always seems more full of stories and things to do than the mainland side. . . Except at the main Seattle terminal.

3680,dkerickson04,"I commuted via ferry for 3 years.  Mukilteo / Clinton WSF

For 6 months by car:  planning ahead is key, checking the time of day for ferry lines, watching the ferry cameras on busy days.. some days you can drive right down to the toll booth and drive right on.. other days its 1-3 hour wait with no priority loading for residents (*commuter carpool Van's with Boeing employees, motorcycles and special medical cars only can drive to front of line*)  waiting for the ferry, you can't leave the line. If you have a passenger, send them out for snacks if it's a lengthy one. 
In the loading lanes, Wa. State Patrol might make their rounds around the cars with their K9 partners, in cooperation with homeland security to check for explosives.
 On the boat, you're welcome to stay in your car or venture up stairs to the passenger cabin.  You'll come to find lots of comfy seating, brochures &amp; newspapers, possibly a galley with food and booze.  There are decks in the bow and stern that let you enjoy the ride like Jack from Titanic.  My ride was on 20 minutes, enough to sip some Rainer beer and watch for whales. Some days you get to enjoy a safety drill by the WSF workers, and coast guard. 

 As a Walk On Commuter for 2.5 years : I paid $100 a month to get a close commuter spot about 100 yards from the toll booth, others aren't so lucky as they park up the hill about 1/2 mile, some pay by hour, then trek down to the boat.  Walk  Ons are very first/ very last to get on boat.  Best is to be there 15 mins early to make sure you're on it. Some boats run behind, or get stuck with low tide and can't dock.  Walkup the stars/elevator of the ferry and enjoy the ride.  Also first to unload, so get down to the auto deck before it docks. 
As a walk on I enjoyed the fresh air, the whales that swam by,  and the tranquility before work, also a good de-stresser after work.",1582846325,fiyt38v

3683,verylittlefinger,"Of course!

The process goes like this. Ferry terminals have large holding areas designed to hold all cars that can go on a single ferry. For every ferry ride, there is the line outside the gates parked along the designated- marked - pace in the street waiting for the previous ferry to load. When the previous ferry departs and the holding area is clear, cars proceed through the gate - where they pay for the ride - into this holding area. There are several lines and the cars are directed by the terminal workers into these lines, filling each line in turn. When the area is full, they stop passing cars through the gate, and everyone is now ready to board!

When the ferry comes, it first unloads the cars that are in there already. When it is empty, the cars from the holding area start moving towards the ferry to load. Now there is a little complication: the ferry is sitting on the water, and so it rocks a little bit, so the ferry itself is oscillating up and down relative the loading dock. There is about a foot or two of space between the ferry and the dock, and the ferry as it rocks in the water goes from about a foot above the dock to about a foot below the dock. The trick is to time driving on the ferry such that the ferry is at its lowest position, and accelerate a little bit right before; then the car jumps right over the little ‚Äúchasm‚Äù between the dock and the side of the ferry. I was nervous the first couple of times when I had to do it, but in the end everybody seems to master this little maneuver. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable, you can ask for help from the terminal workers and then they handle the loading for you.

Once onboard, you drive your car onto a little platform. Inside the ferry there is a little Ferris wheel for cars - this allows storing cars three dimensionally as opposed to just on the floor. As you drive into the platform and exit the car, ferry workers very quickly seal the car around the hood and the doors with a duct tape (they call it Duck tape). They also put a special ‚Äúmuzzle‚Äù over the car‚Äôs front grille which is also held by the ‚Äúduck‚Äù tape. This hermetically seals the car from the top. Then the Ferris wheel rotates such that the car goes up and the next vacant platform appears for the next car.

Now, the reason that they seal it is because the Ferris wheel is half underwater, to maximize storage, and it is also connected to the ferry‚Äôs engines so it doubles as a paddle wheel - kinda like the older steamships, but it‚Äôs inside and it has cars on it. Sealing the car ensures that the water does not get in when the car is below waterline as the wheel rotates.

Once you have parked the car on the wheel (don‚Äôt forget to lock it!) you proceed to the passenger compartment. Depending on the fare you selected, different facilities would be available - but most ferries have fine dining, a movie theater, and a night club. The night clubs I recommend against - they tend to be on the seedier side. I have heard at one point one ferry had Lusty Lady on it after it closed in Seattle, but I don‚Äôt think it lasted. I think they spelled it as ‚ÄúListy Lady‚Äù to add nautical flavor, and the captain didn‚Äôt want to have anything ‚ÄúListy‚Äù to be associated with her ship. At least I think this was the story.

Anyway, when the ferry arrives at the destination, the reverse things happen - the wheel rotates, the staff tears off the ‚Äúduck‚Äù tape, you board the car and jump off the ferry when it is at its high point relative to the dock.

And so it goes...",1582848230,fiyw0fo

3806,fullmanlybeard,"You really ought to experience it for yourself. The ferry has a long line of vehicles in special pullout lanes leading up to the dock. You wait, you pay, you‚Äôre directed into a lane of vehicles. The ferry arrives and all the other traffic disembarks. The crew wave you on rain or shine. You pull into the boat? Will you go up the ramp or down the center? I hate the ramp it‚Äôs tight. This last time I took the center lane two cars from the front. I never get the front. You turn off your engine and sit there a moment collecting your wallet phone and keys. You look up and notice the trees moving and the engines quietly vibrating. It‚Äôs odd to be moving while sitting in your car that is turned off. I always exit the vehicle and stand on the deck a minute to take in the view before walking up the two flights of stairs to the passenger deck. I grab a drink or coffee and maybe a snack. Yesterday I got a beer it‚Äôd been a rough day. Enjoy the view of the day. Each time it‚Äôs different because of the varied weather here. Land approaches so I hit the bathroom and shuffle back down the stairs back to my car. I turn on the radio my 40 minute cruise has ended. We hit the dock, the ramp comes down the vehicles start and we all disembark.",1582990979,fj3qrhi
3807,Sola_Solace,"I will add some of the psychological parts of ferry travel by car. Commuters will have their routines down.  For a leisurely trip or to visit family, which I do a lot  or a weekend visit it's good to know the schedule and wait times.  If you've done it enough you know about what to expect. 

Driving to the ferry is where it begins.  You get to a point where you have a few cars anxiously going a little too fast to make the boat or to get into the line asap. They're mixed in with the locals who may be going slow.  So there's often some tailgating down, many times, single lanes. 

If it's a busy day you pull over into the holding lane when you approach the line.  Occasionally there's a line cutter. These are huge triggers. If you see one you can report them to the booth.  I was once traveling with some coworkers. The road we came out on was too far up the ferry line.  So she drove to the end and did a uturn into. The lane.  In the time it took her to turn around another car was coming down the hill from way back. He got out of his car, angrily pounded on the window and said she cut the line.  She got out turn around. Got to the end again, which at this point was at least another 20 cars, and got back into line. 

There's usually multiple booths open and people seem to feel anxious about getting the fastest booth so they get on to the ferry and don't just miss one boat and have to wait for the next.  You pay for your tickets. Sometimes you pay for everyone, sometimes just the car and driver. They'll still ask you how many people are in your car in that case because they keep a count.  You can buy a round trip ticket, which makes it slightly faster for getting through the booth on your return trip.  If you're a regular you can buy multiple tickets. It's been many years since I did that. Maybe they have a card now? 

Then you wait. There's usually a bathroom facility. Sometimes a coffee stand. You can get out and stretch your legs.  Look at the water. Most people just sit in their cars. 

Then you see the ferry getting closer and docking. The red and white road closed barrier will go up. The rope will drop on the ferry and the foot passengers come off first. There are sometimes vans, shuttles or a bus waiting to pick up people.  You see friends meeting. Parents exchanging their children for visitation. Then the cars unload. The sound of this is part of my childhood. The thump thump of the cars exiting the ferry makes a music of it's own. 

The person who guides the cars to start loading will walk out. They have a radio communicate with someone on the ferry who tells them they can begin.  Sometimes you. Wait while a little truck offloads the garbage. Then they signal the first two lanes to go.  Those will be the lanes that didn't make the last ferry.  If you're arriving at boarding or are still in line you anxiously hope you'll be on the ferry.  Many times I've missed it by one or two cars. Or that small SUV you were stuck behind going so slow on the way was the last vehicle let on.  It happens.  That happened to me. On Orcas Island and we had to wait 3 hours more on a very hot day. You just sigh and wait for the next one. 

They load the front, middle sides, bigger trucks in the middle lane or middle section.  There's a second level. When I drove a manual I'd always worry about beings on the incline to the second level.  If your on the incline, or the front or back, they put blocks under your tires to keep you from rolling. The workers communicate back and forth on radio to fit as many cars as they can from the lot. 

Then you can go upstairs, have a seat, get some food.  

I'll leave it there since that's already a lot. Let me know if you want more information.",1582991022,fj3qtu7

So far my takeaway from all this information is that the ""all hands on deck"" response is largely due to a non-linear, non-normally distributed Chance of Fatality (CoF)

For estimating your personal risk - if you're under 40, the chance of death or serious complication from COVID-19 is ***extremely*** small - 0.2% - 

As such, if you're a typical Redditor (13-30), catching it isn't particularly dangerous - you'll probably be underwhelmed by how sick you get compared to what you see on the news - but the danger is SPREADING it to people who have much higher risk from COVID. 

From age 40 onward, the complication, seriousness, and mortality rates ramp up fairly quickly. Shown here. You can picture what that graph looks like in your head.

Age | CoF
---|---
0-9 | 0.0%
10-19 | 0.2%
20-29 | 0.2%
30-39 | 0.2%
40-49 | 0.4%
50-59 | 1.3%
60-69 | 3.6%
70-79 | 8.0%
80+ | **21.9%**

* Amazon has 800,000 workers world wide
* Average cost of healthcare in the US (double the world average) is ~$7000 per singles and ~$20,000 for families
* Amazon's net profit in 2019 was 11.5 Billion (BILLIONS as you put it)

Back of the napkin estimates go anywhere from 2.8-16 billion a year.  So to answer you question, maybe they could, maybe they couldn't, we would need more data.  If they were forced, they would definitely layoff enough people (replace them with robots) to make it work.  In that case, I am sure the people that remained employed would be grateful for the benefits.

The bigger question is: why should Amazon provide free healthcare when other companies can't/won't?

I say he pays it. He isn't truly worth that money. His workers are exploited and his company dodges taxes. Hell, it gets refunds on federal taxes.

I have worked in an epidemic situation that overwhelmed a hospital I was working at.  I have also been trained in setting up biological, chemical, and radiological treatment areas including setting up isolation zones and treatment centers.

My estimation of the threat is based on information coming out of China, data charts showing the difference in spread of this disease compared to the Swine Flue, Sars, and others.

The phases are based on diseases that are similar to the Coronavirus.  Influenza, RSV, etc.  This is what to expect.

In my assessment I do not believe this disease can be contained.  This is also shared by others who work in the healthcare industry.  We've seen it, been a part of it, and understand the nature of it.  You don't work in the field and not come to an understanding of the workings of a disease.  Sorry, if you disagree but at this point what are your credentials?

I've worked epidemics, seen systems fail, been overwhelmed, and watched people die.

The experts have failed.  An entire ER staff is now quarantined, my wife is quarantined, an entire floor of nursing staff is now quarantined.  A patient was transferred to the ACL unit without isolation protective gear.  Family members were being let in without proper isolation protective gear.  Wrong protective gear was used.  Masks were not fit tested.  Personal wasn't trained on proper isolation gear.
Hell, the car that this patient arrived in is out there right now driving around.
I could go on.  The ER is still open receiving patients, the hospital corridor still being used, the floor still open.

If that isn't a classification of utter and complete  incompetence and failure then I don't know what better word to describe it.

The experts failed.  They failed to protect the most vital instrument in combating a disease like this:  The front line workers.

Failure is being generous at this point.  Sheer and utter incompetence is probably a better generalization.

All of this by the way could have been avoided by the simple act of outside screening for the symptoms of the coronavirus which was something I had advised at the City Council meeting a week before this incident occurred.  Instead, roughly 25% of the hospital staff is now under quarantine for minimally 14 days.

All of it avoidable.

It's not being unrealistic in believing that the very basics of knowledge in Isolation protocols would be implemented appropriately.  Because of this  an entire ER is contaminated, the passage ways to the Acute care level are contaminated, the Acute Care Level is contaminated, and a large portion of the Hospital staff was exposed.  

What gets me is the Isolation Protocol is still Droplet and not Aersolized and even droplet isolation wasn't being properly implemented last I was told (from someone still working in the facility).  The sheer level of incompetence is mind boggling.

Expecting proper procedures, policies, and training on the basics of isolation containment isn't unrealistic.  Expecting fit testing of masks isn't unrealistic. Expecting those placed in these positions to ensure that staff is trained and procedures are being implemented appropriately isn't being unrealistic.  That these experts are at the very minimum knowledgeable in doing their jobs isn't being unrealistic.  The truth is they are incompetent and have failed in the very basics of their duties which is to protect the staff from harm and to contain the spread of disease.

You prepare for the worse and hope for the best.  Instead it is the opposite.  Preparing for the best and hoping the worse doesn't happen.
That is how an epidemic spreads and how people die.

What gets me though...
Is that Moses Lake Hospital is by far and away doing things better than most of the other hospitals in Washington State.  At least they had the foresight to have enough equipment on hand to handle an epidemic which can't be said for most of the hospitals in the state.",1583371363,fjin8us

Trained in identifying pathogens / chemical agents, quarantine procedures, decontamination protocols, treatment, isolation procedures for suspected civilian and military contaminated personal, etc.  I had extensive training in Biological and Nerve Agents specifically VX and was one of the last group of people who received training in the Nerve Agent facility at Fort McClellan.  I will readily admit that my expertise in the subject of Radiation was and is poor as my training was primarily focused on those two areas.

1997 - 2005 Respiratory Therapist and worked volunteer in Mexico handling various diseases not commonly seen in the United States including antibiotic resistant TB and helped in implementing isolation chambers to treat such patients.

i worked during the 1997 - 1998 Influenza A epidemic in which a wide scale epidemic pushed healthcare response to it's limits.  This is specifically resulted in Hospitals shutting their ER doors to ambulatory services.

I have retained a high degree of correspondence and interaction with those in the NBC community and the healthcare field.  My spouse is currently working in the field allowing me to keep abreast of changing policies within the field.

My work experience is vast and involves multiple different countries.  I've worked nearly every hospital in the Southern California area and a number of those years were for myself being called in when specialty care was needed such as a time when a Marine was ran over by a Tank and required High Frequency Ventilation.

I may not be able to work the field in physical capabilities due to a catastrophic injury in 2005 but I have remained active in the consulting industry offering advice, education, and helping departments with policies and procedures regarding little seen diseases in the United States such as antibiotic resistant TB and Anthrax exposure.

4377,Kitzinger1,"Let me inform you and others what the current situation is:  


COVID 19 is an aerosolized virus that is twice as contagious as the Influenza virus and is 34 times more deadly than the Influenza virus.  
Aerosolized meaning the virus can remain free floating and infection can happen by simply breathing the virus in.  
Infection can happen through the eye.  


COVID 19 has a critical illness percentage of between 16% to 20%.  
Influenza has a critical illness percentage of 1.3% in comparison.   


It has shown to be Bi-phasic meaning there could be recurrent illnesses even after you have gotten ill the first time.  We are talking weeks or even days.  You get sick, you get well, and you get sick again.  


The number of people who get the disease doubles every 6.4 days but is now being suggested that the doubling of infection is even shorter.  To put it in perspective.  The first day you have 1 patient, in 6.4 days there is 2, in 12.8 days there is 4, in 17.2 days there is 8, in 23.6 days there is 16, in 30 days there is 32, in 36.4 days there is 64, and that is if there is just 1 patient initially infected.  


The initial testing procedures were done based on temperature which didn't factor into the initial 14 day incubation which has been changed to 24 days.  


COVID 19 has a surface life of 9 days.  You can get infected by touching the surface of an object that somebody has coughed on from 9 days ago.  In comparison, the Influenza virus has a surface life of 1 day and has a surface life on human tissue of only 15 minutes.  
COVID 19 is nine times more resilient than Influenza.  


The initial tests for COVID 19 were faulty setting back accurate testing of the virus.  This has now resulted in the CDC turning to University Labs in an effort to create a reliable test for COVID 19.  New York State has stated they no-longer trust the testing procedures for COVID 19 by the CDC.  


It is now confirmed that Canines can be infected with COVID 19.  Can Canines transmit COVID 19 back to humans is the bigger question that remains unanswered.  


Children appear to be highly resistant to the disease and now the question is:  Can they be carriers?  


COVID 19 appears to infect those 40 and over at a much higher percentage than those that are 39 years of age or less.  It appears that the virus predominately targets the elderly and those who are immunocompromized or with chronic diseases such as diabetes.   


That is the situation and those are the facts as they stand.",1583386325,fjj8do7

Mail-in voting is by far the most convenient means of getting more people to vote.

4502,ben7866,"No one should panic because panic doesn't accomplish anything, what we should do is prepare and demand our government do something.  If you remember correctly China was very meticulously checking everyone for fever using checkpoints and robots and other weird shit.  They were making sure that people who had symptoms were quarantined.  I'd love to see some estimates from an epidemiologist about what number of people with corona in Wuhan were not counted in the total, because right now its just speculation.

You're also ignoring the other end of your speculative spectrum.  How many COVID-19 deaths are being counted as just a generic viral pneumonia?  This, I imagine is especially the case right now in the US since the CDC and the Trump administration are suppressing information.

You also included that chart for the deaths, here's one side by side for the seasonal flu you're so worried about:   [https://i.imgur.com/MZHk45J.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MZHk45J.jpg)  I'll let that speak for itself, because lol.

The other thing is that the mortality rate will change based on the level of care that is able to be provided by the healthcare systems we live in, for example, Iran has lots more deaths presumably because they don't have the equipment needed to keep people alive.  As an example we can base our predictions on the numbers that came out of China we see that about 25% of patients needed medical care, 20% needed moderate medical care, like just an oxygen mask, but 5% of people were in critical care, needing mechanical ventilators to stay alive.  And there lies a really big problem.  The average number of mechanical ventilators per 100,000 people in the US is 19.  19.  For every 100,000 infected people 5,000 ventilators are needed.  

And since its flu season and other people are sick some percentage of those ventilators are already in use, on top of that in order to use the ventilators you need staff trained to use them which a lot of hospitals have maybe four or five nurses trained to use the ventilators and you can see where this starts to snowball out of control just based on a small percentage of people.

You can again look at China here because they managed to handle this as well as any country in the world probably will.  This is where quarantines and lock downs are super fucking important, its not about completely stopping the spread of the virus, which I doubt China has done, the idea is to slow the virus down so that 25% of 327 million people don't all need hospitalization in the same two month period, remember this is a slow virus that can take literally weeks to kill or recover from.  And this is where the failure on the part of the US comes in.  The US government, state, federal, local, has taken absolutely no decisive action to slow the spread of the virus.

If you're paying attention you watched the press conference at the nursing home in Kirkland today, a place that we were told was under quarantine, but there is no CDC staff currently on site today.  Residents of the nursing home are free to move around the home as they wish and staff come to work and go home as they wish.  Testing isn't being done of the nursing home staff or residents based on any real criteria, instead they're still insisting on following the CDCs guidelines which are no doubt influenced by Trump, waiting until someone is almost dying to even bother to test for the virus.

Again panic is stupid, you shouldn't panic.  Chances are you and nearly everyone you know will get the virus some time in the coming months and most epidemiologists are saying that this is going to be spreading around yearly.  What you should be doing is asking your government/s to fucking do something, because they aren't.",1583469505,fjmfx25

FWIW the box you check only counts for *this* election. It doesn't register you as either a Democrat or Republican. In future primaries (including the August primary) you should be allowed to vote for whoever you want down ticket but there are no down ballot races on this ballot.

WA doesn't require you to register with a party, and the major parties agreed that they both wanted a list of voters who identify as Democrat or Republican so they determined that this was the least intrusive way to get that list (partially because there are no down ballot primaries). I'd argue that it should've been *inside* the envelope to keep it more private but they say they did that for ""sorting purposes.""

4665,Dr_Adequate,"Culture: Conservatives outnumber liberals, compared to the wet side (Seattle, Portland, Bellingham) they prefer country music &amp; pickup trucks.  Being a much smaller town, there is less variety and depth of things to do there.  The restaurant/nightlife scene is smaller, there are fewer places to hear live music and what you'll get is liable to be country.  You're in the red half of the state, so expect the politics to be overtly conservative.  Many people there resent the government (local, State, Federal) and aren't shy about expressing that.  

Environment: From Florida, expect some changes.  Winter temps drop to 20F at night (or colder), but Yakima doesn't ever get very much snow.  It's also pretty flat, so getting around isn't too difficult.  Summertime temps routinely hit 90F and above, and sometimes break 100F, but it's also a dry heat, not the humidity you're used to.  It's at about 3,000' above sea level, so sometimes that sneaks up on you.  Temp can drop pretty fast in the evening, and heavy exertion can leave you pretty tired till you get used to it.  

Also culture: Yakima has a large hispanic population due to all the orchards and fruit packing plants, so there's a strong hispanic cultural presence and tons of good Tex-Mex food available, but the Mexican drug gangs have made serious inroads and have deep roots there.  Crime is high in certain parts, from property damage/theft up to murder.  

Downtown Yakima seems to be hanging on, but only barely.  Lots of development and growth that occurred in the 70's, 80's, and 90's seems to be barely hanging on or slowly dying.  Overall it seems to me to be contracting, as people move away and shopping moves online.  One thing I like is there are a bunch of cool antique stores in downtown Yakima, and a lot of the growth in the 50's and 60's means there's a lot of inexpensive mid-century modern furniture hitting the antique stores now.  

Overall it is a smaller town, with a nice climate and pace-of-life.  

Some fun day trips to take include going to Leavenworth, a short jaunt away over Blewett Pass.  [Leavenworth](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.5943752,-120.6648048,3a,75y,175h,100.83t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sDWTW1x3al4Rj2A8mzRTQNg!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DDWTW1x3al4Rj2A8mzRTQNg%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D154.70282%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en&amp;authuser=0) is a small town nestled in the eastern Cascade foothills with a Bavarian flavor, and if you want to take up skiing it's a great base-camp for a ski weekend in the Cascades.  

Up in Wenatchee there's the [Ohme Gardens](https://www.ohmegardens.org/), a public rock garden that used to be a private space, built by Herman Ohme as a retreat for him and his wife.  

And of course a day trip driving Highway 410 around Mt. Rainier is always lovely, with stunning alpine scenery in the spring &amp; summer.  Or you could go a little farther and head up the east side of Mt. St. Helens to Windy Ridge, where you get [an absolutely stunning view](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Mt._Saint_Helens_From_Windy_Ridge_Viewpoint.jpg/1280px-Mt._Saint_Helens_From_Windy_Ridge_Viewpoint.jpg) of the volcanic crater and the blast zone (since this photo was taken the microenvironment has recovered a lot, but you can still tell it was the site of a huge eruption). 

You could also go south over White Pass and ski the White Pass ski resort.  If you like driving there are a TON of good fun, scenic roads to drive on up, through, and around the mountains.  If you're old enough to remember the TV show Northern Exposure, the town of Roslyn still has The Brick tavern (a real place) and the movie set radio station looking out over main street.  

If you'd rather go waterskiing and you have a boat (or know someone who does) then Rimrock Cove is also a short day trip away.  

Seattle is a 2.5 hour drive away, if you want to hit the big city for more culture/nightlife etc.  And the Tri Cities is a bit over an hour the other way.  If you have a morbid streak you can take the Hanford Radioactive Disposal Site tour, and see what a gawd-awful job we're doing at decontaminating one of the most contaminated sites left over from the Manhattan Project and the Cold War.  

If you like hiking and camping there are trails and campgrounds all throughout the Cascades within an easy drive.  And of course, in the summer, floating down the [Yakima River](https://www.google.com/maps/@46.8010014,-120.4451931,3a,75y,276.91h,97.56t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sdGavmYHTEprbKMdjZvD6Hw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DdGavmYHTEprbKMdjZvD6Hw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D72.00745%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en&amp;authuser=0) is a thing a lot of people do.  Put in up at the State Park, and have someone pick you up in Selah and drive you back up to do it again.

This about a system of power and wealth squeezing all the money it can from individuals, and it is the responsibility of all political leaders to confront this.  It is the corporations who pay lobbyists who grease politicians to sponsor bills written by industry insiders so that legislation passed reinforces this status quo.  It then is the politicians who used rhetoric to claim that the bills passed are a ""win"" for their constituents.  It is then the faux-journalists ordered by their editorial staff, accountable only to corporate ownership who spin the outcome in a certain direction.  Both parties are complicit because both parties are heavily financed by the benefactors of the system.  In fact, the false dichotomy that is our two-party system is used to corral the populus into a ""us or them"" mentality that effects division.  One party is more obviously corrupt than the other, but to assign all blame to one party is in my opinion not a fully formed explanation of responsibility.

Right now as of 8:15, John Hopkins reported:

[https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

* 136,390 total cases
* 69,623 total recovered patients
* 5,065 deaths

Now that is pretty scary - about a 3.7% mortality rate worldwide. It can especially scary because there is such a wide difference in mortality rates between countries. Italy right now has a mortality rate of 6.7% whereas **South Korea is only 0.8%**.

Even if the US were to get at LEAST the total number of Covid-19 cases that are currently know worldwide, we still would not have tens of thousands of deaths.  Think about that, China has 3180 deaths out of nearly 90,000 cases (if the Party is still accurately reporting, which I find hard to believe personally).

Right now the Trump Administration is handling this absolutely terrible - we all know this, BUT there are outstanding members of Congress who are doing what needs to be done right now and I am trying to put some faith on folks like Rep Katie Porter who is really talking sense upon on the Hill. I also feel pretty thankful to have an actual Medical doctor as my Representative over here in the 8th district who is going to put good science over political agendas.

You are absolutely right this is just getting started and it is possible it could be more than, but you need to look at the math and statistical models based on the data. Look more at the science and less at journalists using scary adjectives in order to drive web traffic. Now that Islee has banned large events, and people at taking social isolation to heart here, we certainly can expect that it will be serious but not like what we are seeing in other countries like Italy which are much more densely populated (Italy has approximately **206** people per km^(2) vs Washington State at **39** km^(2) or the overall United States at 35 km^(2) ).

Here are some summaries of the legislation mentioned in this comic for those unfamiliar. I encourage people to read the sources:


**The National Firearms Act of 1934** [required](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Act) an excise tax on the manufacture and transfer of certain firearms and requires that they're registered. Transfers of ownership must be recorded and permanent transport must be reported.

The law was passed in the wake of gang crime as a result of prohibition.

Pistols and revolvers were excluded. Machine guns and short-barreled rifles were not.

The **Gun Control Act of 1968** [regulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968) interstate commerce except among licensed manufacturers, dealers, and importers. 

The law was passed in the wake of the assassination of JFK, MLK Jr. and RFK, as the rifle that killed Kennedy was mail-ordered.

**The Brady bill** [mandated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act) background checks on firearm purchasers along with a five-day waiting period, and prevents transportation / possession of a firearm who's

Between 1998 and 2014, 0.6 percent of gun purchases were blocked by the Brady bill, primarily because of previous felony convictions.


The **1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban** (which was lifted in 2004) [prevented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban) purchase of certain semi-automatic firearms that were defined as assult weapons as well as certain large capacity magazines.

The **Lautenberg amendment** [required](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_Violence_Offender_Gun_Ban) that bans access to firearms by people committing crimes of domestic violence (excluding miliary/police officers charged of felonies)

The **Smith &amp; Wesson agreement** [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson#Clinton_agreement) changes in the design of certain firearms and required authorized dealers to abide by a code of conduct to prevent sale to prohibited persons (including selling to individuals under 18 years of age).

The **School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act of 2007** [authorizes](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/2084) the Attorney General to receive information from federal agencies on persons disqalified from receiving firearms, requires federal agencies to keep their records accurate. Essentially it puts requirements on the data collected about people deemed ineligible for firearm possession.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracleum_mantegazzianum): 

&gt; The sap of the giant hogweed plant is phototoxic. Contact with the plant sap prevents the skin from being able to protect itself from sunlight, which leads to phytophotodermatitis, a serious skin inflammation.[25] A phototoxic reaction can begin as soon as 15 minutes after contact with the sap. Photosensitivity peaks between 30 minutes and two hours after contact but can last for several days

&gt;I didn‚Äôt mean to say that is was reflected in the constitution, but just in the application of the law through other law-making bodies. Technically speaking (more to the way the law has been applied), the constitution grants the government the power to make laws, and grants the courts the means of ensuring those laws are just. That system has given us restrictions over time, in response to changes in technology, government, and evolving threats to other inalienable rights.

I have heard that argument many times, but I have yet to tell me how the government's power to regulate guns is able to be rationalized in the face of the simple final 4 words of the second amendment, ""shall not be infringed"". Given that any sort of licensing, restrictions or stalling on the part of the government to allow a citizen to own arms is clearly an infringement it would seem all gun laws are unconstitutional on their face. 

&gt;Oh, you get this stuff already. Not what I expected from a reddit post.

I appreciate that, you may find that a lot of us folks are around, we just get ignored, a lot. 

&gt;I guess I just appreciate a degree of oversight with regard to threats to public safety. At a certain point, not controlling irresponsible access of the mentally ill to the means of inflicting massive damage to the populous is just negligence.

I would agree with you.

I would then make the case that if a person is so dangerous as for it to be seen as prudent to remove their legal rights to own weapons, does it not also seem prudent to remove them from free society? After all, you have written a piece of paper that says they cannot own a gun, you have in no way physically stopped them from acquiring one through any of the myriads of black market options. 

&gt;We all seem to be demanding accountability of our government for failure to respond to a public health crisis, and I think the same thought process applies.

Yes, seeing as how the current administration dismantled policies and departments specifically designated to handle such cases as global pandemics, then goes on the national stage and states ""I accept no responsibility for this"", I think we can all agree that this is, to put it bluntly, some bullshit. 

&gt;Part of the give and take of society is a grant of authority to the community. We have the means of providing a check and balance against the government. 

Absolutely, immediately to mind comes the idea of the 4 boxes of liberty. I would assert we are squarely on the Jury box at this point. There is clearly a lot of things that need to be adjudicated. 

&gt;It‚Äôs our responsibility to stay actually vigolant, and not letting the actual oppression of private government influence manipulate us slowly.

I agree, hence the reason I so strongly support the second amendment. A government that is not afraid of its own population is a government headed towards tyranny quickly. 

&gt;But in any event, you seem to be awake enough to the facts of the constitution that you don‚Äôt need to hear me (not an expert, just a student) explain anything.

I enjoy learning, I have something to learn from everyone I come across. Whether it be my 8-year-old daughter who just discovered something she found interesting with fresh eyes or a constitutional scholar student who even as a student would be much better versed in the intricacies of constitutional law than this old salty Marine.

5913,DopeDetective,"so basically they are just betting that companies would rather cover their asses than provide end-to-end encryption. the bill says something along the lines of you can have it but if shit goes down, you're liable. prior to now, companies like Facebook could not be held accountable for what account owners posted (fake news, child porn, etc). theoretically, the ""best use practices"" could expand to include end-to-end encryption as a whole but at this point it does not. the main purpose of the bill, as it is being talked about right now (but the patriot act got out of hand pretty fast too), is to prevent pedophiles from hiding child pornography.

I'd start Googling it...see what weird places are still open...I would also ask your date if they have any ideas or what they are into. They might not like thrift stores and art galleries...maybe they're more of an outdoor person and a date at a park is a good idea.

If you're in/near Tacoma I recommend W.W. Seymour Botanical Conservatory. It's a really beautiful place. They seem to still be open, but check their hours. The hours are for the actual conservatory, not the whole park...there's still a fairly large park there to walk around in.

Landlords buy properties. Often multiple, causing an artificial scarcity and driving housing prices up. Then, since buying a house is cost prohibitive,  the only option for the vast majority of people is renting. However the landlord needs profit, otherwise what's the point? So the renter ends up paying the mortgage off for the landlord with their rent, as well as giving the landlord profit.  Because of this, land lords are literally siphoning money from the lower classes and taking money from those who have the least. And because everyone needs somewhere to live,  they are allowed to charge whatever they want.

I've lived in tacoma for most of my life. I've seen rent for places literally double in the last ten years, but that money isnt getting anything more for the tenants. Why? Because land lords can get away with charging it. 

And what exactly does a landlord provide? Well, if all the landlords disappeared over night, the land would still be there. ""But they built the house!"" I hear some cry out, but people built and bought houses long before landlords existed. The only real argument is ""they fronted the capital"" which basically translates to ""they have money, therefore they are entitled to more money.""

Most places in urban areas do not have public restrooms open to the public, let alone the homeless. Where will you shower, so that you dont lose your job for smelling like you live under a bridge? 

Where will you get your food? Where will you cook? Last I checked all restaurants and bars were ordered closed due to the outbreak.

You have clearly never been homeless, and have had a pretty easy life. Either that or you lack basic human empathy.

That can be solved via raising the minimum wage, though there is a limit to how much it can be raised before you have negative effects.

Welfare for the able is worse, and has worse effects.  Not to mention you need to get the money from somewhere in the first place, which creates a dangerous cycle.

I voted for Biden in part because I'm really trying to move away from cult-of-personality and purity politics. I also firmly KNOW that my ""centrist"" parents MIGHT vote Biden instead of Trump (depending on the economy that they understand so very poorly), but will never vote for Bernie. I am under no illusion that Bernie or Biden polling numbers against Trump mean jack or shit. There's a bunch of results that favor each of them. I know that the last time I saw Democrats win, we had a center-left President and we needed to fill the house with progressives. We absolutely failed Obama by failing to do so, then whined about how he wasn't really progressive after we fucked him in mid-terms. I believe a Bernie nomination OR win would result in a red Senate and Congress, and that's the stuff that really matters. Down ballots are critical. I'm voting in anticipation of winning seats for this term and mid-terms.

I believe that Bernie never really had a shot outside of Rose Twitter or Reddit. I think it's even annoying that WA had low voter turn out for younger folks when they're _mail in ballots_. That is the height of laziness.

I voted for Biden.

I also was a card carrying, dues paying member of Socialist Alternative and helped get Sawant elected ~5 years ago. I‚Äôm now neither of those, and no longer follow Seattle politics (swapped for my smaller-town politics).

Honestly, I got tired of all the pie in the sky idealist talk with no follow through.

Every argument for Bernie is an argument to be an involved constituent‚Äîsomething that never materializes. 

Everything Bernie talks about will only happen with consistent, grassroots organizing‚Äîthat evaporates as soon as the election happens instead of digging in to actually get that agenda passed.

I‚Äôm unwilling to green light massive federal spending without a way to fund it. At least Warren had actual plans, but she also had no concept of how to break up tech monopolies along functional lines. Rolling back a lot of the mergers is great, but there were no details beyond that‚Äîand her (and Bernie) staying a(s) senator(s) would be better long term to push that sort of legislation through.

Essentially, everything the progressive candidates talked about is something that *can happen* without a progressive as the democratic nominee‚Äîvoters just have to put their money where their mouth is and *contact their gods damned elected representatives.* **Regularly.** I email mine about once a year, more if I hear about a bill I don‚Äôt like‚Äîand I‚Äôve been actively avoiding the news and politics since the Trump circus started.

Of the pack, Biden may make a lot of weird jokes/social faux pas, but he has integrity and I trust him to not become power mad a lot more than any other option. I‚Äôm unwilling to swap republican backed facism for progressive-democrat backed facism just because their ideals are closer to my own. Facism and ‚Äútoe the party line or else‚Äù BS is bad no matter what side it comes from‚Äîand Bernie‚Äôs promises are just as empty as Trump‚Äôs.

Sorry if that‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow. There is real value in having a far left candidate pushing for progressive policies, but that doesn‚Äôt mean Bernie would be affective as the democratic nominee. Plus, just about all my older relatives (and some younger ones) have actually said that if it comes down between Trump and Bernie in the presidential election, they‚Äôre going to vote 3rd party. Which means there‚Äôs a very real chance Trump could get a second term from a splintered democratic party‚Äîno matter how much people claim he won‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs not that Bernie is a sure win for every democrat and him losing WA was a blindside, it‚Äôs that Bernie is only a sure win in younger, progressive echo chambers and people thought this younger blue wave group would turn out and be a majority here (and override everyone else, yay tyranny of the majority).

Private insurance companies are not simply there to provide insurance and regulate care to ensure the system is not exploited. They are also there to generate a profit beyond the overhead needed to operate. This is the root of all issues that I have with private insurance as it is applied in the United  states.  Maintaining good health through proactive treatment and diagnosis helps keep people living longer and avoids the cascading stress people face when they need care but cannot afford it.  There are many industries where a profit is healthy and absolutely appropriate‚Äî providing insurance should not be one of them. 

I ask you this: 
What benefit is there for people to pay more for care so a 3rd party not providing any service added benefit that Medicare could not provide allready? If Medicare made a profit (I am obviously simplyfying the language here), it could inject 100% of that back into providing even better care.  

Lots of industries have undergone extreme change such as the coal industry, tobacco industry, etc.  There is a real moral issue with people choosing to not get care because they cannot handle the financial consequences of getting help.

My point isn't that it can't be done or shouldn't be done, but it needs to be done very carefully and properly. Yes we need not-for-profit national coverage. But we can't just press a button and make it appear over night. 

I am a big fan of the Medicare for All Who Want It Idea. It will get many more people on insurance, and encourage government insurance to out compete the private sector, hopefully leading to decent coverage (seriously, some medicare coverage can be pretty abysmal and akin to having no insurance). However, if we jump straight to MFA this will rock our medical system and not in a good way. There won't be as many providers available to provide care, wait times will get longer, and we simply do not have the infrastructure right now to immediately make this switch. Longer wait times and fewer providers leads to more patients not getting the care they need (in a very general sense). 

The medical field is NOT the coal or tobacco field and I think to treat it as such would be pretty foolish.

6769,CTR0,"I appreciate the civil discussion

&gt; What do you think of the German model for healthcare? As opposed to M4A and public option? Why makes you think single payer is the only way?

Most of the insurance system in Germany is non profit. I'm not sure emulating Germany would require any less of a complete overhaul than single payer would. Single payer also reduces burden on employers that offer insurance and makes it so your insurance is not tied to your work, allowing for people to switch jobs. Single payer also gives unions more power in other areas since they no longer have to fight for insurance.

&gt; He's not conservative re: abortion. The conservative position is ""no abortions"". Not ""abortions without federal funding"". Do you mean he is more conservative than you'd prefer on this issue? He did reverse that position. And many others.

I'd consider the no federal funding of abortions to be a conservative position. I'd have a problem with putting restrictions on any medically necessary procedure, and you could argue it is socially necessary too due to the economic burden of unexpected child decisions. It also gets in the way of publicly funded healthcare.

&gt;  He does love nuclear power. Do you think that's viable, or would you prefer we avoid that route? 

Making new nuclear power plants is a massive carbon investment and more expensive than renewables. I could understand using nuclear if you could somehow transition fossil fuel plants to nuclear, or if nuclear was used to supplement more expensive renewables, but neither of those are the case. It just doesn't make sense to me to spend more for less. Also, if you look at the data, thorium waste is no better than uranium, and we already have a uranium waste problem.

&gt; I think that allowing manufacturers to be sued is a way to combat their finding of the hyper influential NRA. Do you support universal background checks and gun registries but not opening up legal recourse with manufacturers?

Yes

Honestly the only thing I staunchly disagree with is the assertion that moving to a non-profit multi-payer model would be just as big of an overhaul. We currently don't have a centralized system for healthcare, that will have to be built from scratch. Apologies if I'm being redundant, but if you were to choose from the Bismarck, Beveridge and National Health Insurance models, which one would you choose? You said ""single payer"" but Canada's system for that is different than the UK's. I think a blended system like they refer to [here](https://pphr.princeton.edu/2017/12/02/unhealthy-health-care-a-cursory-overview-of-major-health-care-systems/). You could even incorporate what we're both referring to in the NHI model as opposed to be a straight Beveridge like in the UK. (That all being said, I'm assuming you were referring to a single payer service like the NHS, sorry if that wasn't the case).

Q:What if I am temporarily laid off work because business has slowed down as a result of COVID-19?
A.  If you are laid off work temporarily or if your hours are reduced due to a business slowdown or a lack of demand as a result of COVID-19, you may be able to receive unemployment benefits. Eligibility decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.

OP I would call and speak with someone and just explain what‚Äôs going on. They‚Äôre likely overwhelmed with requests and don‚Äôt have great systems for processing them (note: used to work in gov and use those systems).

Is your need for global travel more important than the need of a child in Bangladesh for medical care? Is it more important than than the need of a homeless person in Seattle for a safe place to live?

&gt;So yes money = a form of prestige. Because being a doctor in your world means nothing more than a cashier.

First you say money is *a* form of prestige. Then in your very next sentence, you imply that money is the *only* form of prestige.

You've got that very deeply ingrained from capitalist society: the more money you have/make, the more important you are to society. Someone as useless to society as a real estate investor can be very prestigious as long as he's got lots of money. Meanwhile, someone as important as an elementary school teacher isn't seen as prestigious because he doesn't make much money.",1584556760,fkuv7rb

[Commerce announces new emergency housing grant for counties - Washington State Department of Commerce](https://www.reddit.com/r/Washington/comments/flle0x/commerce_announces_new_emergency_housing_grant/)

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm thinking that maybe they decide construction is essential, at least some kinds of construction. They are trying to create housing for homeless individuals, among other things.

The homeless are in a world of hurt right now. Soup kitchens are shutting down in some places and it's scary for the homeless right now, much scarier than most of the housed people I see online making Netflix viewing lists and the like to keep themselves occupied.",1584669081,fkzeg3c

I might skip looking for soup kitchens for now. Some of them are shutting down and they are facing a lot of issues right now, from what I gather. But food pantries and other emergency food should still work.

Look for info on local churches. Help from local churches tends to not be well advertised. When I was homeless, churches were like the best kept secret and sometimes had really good stuff.

I would work on finding cheap cook from scratch info. If you are in housing and have time on your hands, cooking from scratch is a good way to keep yourself occupied and reduce expenses.

And, on the streets, we can move about without crowding each other.

Though a national quarantine has never been done before (therefore there is no legal precedent,) it is believed that the Supreme Court would uphold the right of the government to restrict travel between states citing the government's authority derived from the commerce clause.

Is it really so hard to believe some of us think things are safer with more advanced firearms only accessible to law enforcement? With common sense restrictions in place fit everyone else? 

I don't want to take anyone's guns. But I do want them to use and store them responsibly. 

Unintentional shootings comprise 1.3% of gun deaths and 18% of gun injuries.

The majority of unintentional shooting deaths involve people under 24, who are most often shot by someone else, usually someone their own age.

1,500 children are shot and killed each year.

That's just not good enough.

7816,irishsandman,"Every expert on the subject is recommending we not just ""social distance"" but that we isolate. Current projections are that about the 7.7 billion people on the planet are going to get this virus in the next year.

The more we spread out the time it take to infect those people the longer we have to produce several important things like anti-virals, masks, ventilators, potentially a vaccine, so that we can treat people more effectively and prevent the spread from even occurring in the first place. 

Go watch a video of a crowded Italian hospital where patients are being ""stored"" in hallways on ventilators. The more we can prevent that overcrowding the better off we'll be.",1584864968,fl6ebzq
7817,IAskADHDQuestions,"Not at all, if you NEED to go to the store go. My idea of a 24-7 lock down is people staying in their house unless they need something urgently or work a job that is required for civilization to function. This partial no groups of 25 or whatever nonsense means golf courses are still open as an example giving people a reason to leave their house. If nothing is open besides the grocery store, gas stations and hospitals we‚Äôd see less people on the road going to visit friends helping curb the spread of this virus by actually enforcing it.

I‚Äôm not here to change your mind. I live with someone who is full on fear mongering preparing to take on anyone who tries to force us to stay in our homes so I get that point of view. I on the other hand try to imagine every scenario from all angles and stay as neutral as possible. What I‚Äôm getting to is the partial quarantine is not working and full quarantine seems to be the only other option.

Also fear mongering to me would be telling you that the CDC numbers are incorrect because of lack of test kits. Even now doctors are being instructed to only test patients who are being admitted meaning almost 99% positive and requiring hospitalization otherwise doctors or nurses and anyone 65+ or with existing conditions. Or that the death rate is most likely much higher especially in Italy where there‚Äôs videos coming from a hospital with patients overflowing into the hallways all with what appears to be a plastic bucket on their heads I‚Äôm assuming to keep them alive. The fact is none of that matters as people will believe whatever they want or listen to one sided media on both sides. What matters is stay home as if you have already been infected.

Do you have a better solution than full quarantine to keep people home that keep taking unnecessary risks? I‚Äôm asking honestly because I can‚Äôt see any other way. Had we locked down Washington a few weeks ago even I truly believe we really could have slowed the spread not just to other county‚Äôs but also to other states.

However.

I'm an average citizen on the east side of the state. Lots of rural area, lots of retired elderly. 

No confirmed cases here yet, but with no shown symptoms people refuse to go to the doctor to check.

 There was one high school kid in my town that was tested, he was a local football player, he showed symptoms but he came up negative.

Now everyone in this rural area thinks they're invincible and they don't take things seriously. Groups of people just form up at the grocery store, just to talk like nothing's happening. It'd be one thing if they talked some distance away or if they were less in the way of other shoppers. But these people, who are usually elderly veterans, stand like six inches from each other and block aisles and chat for 20 minutes at a time at least.

Basically if the virus isn't here yet it's going to have an easy time spreading.

Restaurants are almost entirely closed but they're in a bit of a limbo waiting for Gov Inslee to make a 'final' decision. Or at least the restaurants are waiting very impatiently for things to start running again.

7896,inutilbasura,"My guess is that it's because the growth rate of cases and deaths in Washington is relatively low at \~5 days compared to 2.5 days in places most heavily affected (e.g., Italy, France, NY). A factor of two doesn't sound like much but it builds up hugely over time. E.g., at the current rate, in two weeks our cases will increase a factor of 8 vs. a factor 64 in the worst-affected regions.

This means that we have a bit more time to evaluate the situation. Considering that the cycle of the virus is 2-3 weeks from infection to death, it means that measures take a few weeks to be noticeable. We are just now coming to the one week mark after bars/restaurants/large events were cancelled and that should hopefully have a measurable impact on the growth rate of the number of infections. If the impact is not large enough then more severe measures must be implemented and I believe that this is quite clear to the state government.

What should those measures be remains an open question. Before we enact a ""shelter in place"" order and entirely shut down the economy, there are other targeted actions that could take place: close parks and hiking trains, which have become a hotspots for large gatherings. Enforce physical distance outside. Decrease building occupancy to force employers to seriously consider who really needs to come to work and who can work from home, etc. Also, I am skeptical that the minority of people who are not taking the situation seriously right now would somehow change their behavior once they are told to ""shelter in place.""",1584915638,fl84ebp

There are times throughout history when being a maverick or defying established conventions that are morally wrong is admirable. That is not the case this time, the rules are in reverse, our enemy can't be fought with words or weapons. Sometimes retreat is all one can do and by staying indoors away from each other we can mitigate the spread of this virus.

Never mind that, Piece, King, and Snohomish are the ONLY counties at risk.  Which means the rest of the state is gonna get fucked economically in a hurry. 

&amp;#x200B;

It also presents hurdles as we've already lost enough production people who're having trouble finding daycare for their kids, tending to family emergencies, and having to spend more and more time away from work just from the minimal disruptions, supply hoarding, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Add in fun issues with domestic violence.  Say you've got roommates who normally work jobs, they go do their thing, and are generally out of each others way living their lives. Put in a stay in place order, and now some people are staying at home, making messes all day, and generally being annoying. The other roomies are looking at being locked up with said assholes for maybe weeks, months, who knows. Fuck it, just shoot the sons of bitches and be done with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then issues of child support, child care, etc, etc with the lower income brackets. Work 3 jobs to support your kid, and your whore ex wife.  Now you can't go to work, and the child support enforcement agency is making threats. Yeah, great, bring it on. I'll be in Mexico bitches, come and get me. ;)  Oh wait, you can't, you'll be stuck stateside with your virus. lol! 

&amp;#x200B;

And if things can't get bad enough, you have the lunatic fringe out on the islands, in the hills, and among the general population. Some asshole in Olympia decides to declare martial law, they're running to the hills with their 20 year supply of ammo, MREs, and toilet paper.  Maybe they're not too disruptive off the bat, until the squirrel population drops like a rock, and the forest rangers haven't seen a brown bear nosing around the cities in several week. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem comes when industry has to normalized in late summer, fall, probably sooner, or agriculture, road maintenance, wildfire containment, and a million other things have to get done, lethal virus, or no lethal virus.  People who only figured on shelter in place have to get back across the country, or to other countries to keep what's left of their businesses afloat.

The nuts who ran off to the hills, they have to figure if they want to live like the Amish, or return to civilization and try to restart the economy.

Add into the mess, the various abandoned property, probate cases for those who died, insurance payouts, etc. All of this gets worse and worse and worse the longer you wait, and the more the economy was shut down.

I don't know if it's because they haven't thought about it in that much detail, after having put this plan together in just a few days, or if it's because they don't know how they'd enforce the stay-at-home order if they allowed that much leeway.

I work IT at an MSP so my job should be fairly secure, but a fuck ton of our clients are small businesses, a lot of them will likely go under after being shuttered for a full month. A fucking $1000 check from the feds isn't going to fix this.

I know the panic right now over what is, YES, a dangerous healthcare system overload is our only concern now, but goddamn, it ASTOUNDS me to see what a metric fuckton of people who two months ago were all about the poor and downtrodden middle class suddenly cheering on this giant stick getting shoved up their ass by the state. Let's be real here-- The reason for the lockdowns is NOT to actually limit viral spread, they're to ease up the load on our barely functional health care system, which wouldn't be nearly as much of a PROBLEM if the government had planned properly for such a situation DECADES ago.

My whole point is communism has never worked on a national level because it is based on evil ideas where you don't actually own  your own labor or skill and are not allowed to collect fairly on your own investment of time or risk.  That is evil.  That is theft of my skill and labor.  Capitalism is forced altruism, cause I HAVE to treat my clients well or they won't pay me.  I have to treat employees well or they won't work for me.  

Every place in history that has tried it has failed.  You love nationalization of industry? Go live in Venezuela and eat dogs.

China is currently under the control of a communist party. So good job trying to claim "" it's not real communism"". They call themselves communist.   If the only thing you are clinging to is "" they dont own the means"" that is a weak argument and irrelevant, In dealing with China. 

Now like i said if you think it's such a great idea. Go practice it. Go take on a ton of risk, then just start giving it away and make everyone equal.  I bet you  won't do it, cause you don't have the balls to go out and take risks like that. 

That's the perfection of America, there is NOTHING stopping you from going out and doin it.  GO DO IT.  Our government won't kill you for doing something you want to do. People have done it in America, they have communes.( Very small scale, but they do it.)  That's the difference between me and you.  You want to force others to conform to your will ( thats what communists want) but I want you to go and experiment with it. But don't pretend like everyone else should bend to your backwards ass idea just cause you read a few books and watched some YouTube videos about how nice communism is.  

You never saw people fleeing from West Berlin into east Berlin.  Only people being shot trying to flee from East to west.  The west didn't erect a wall to keep people in or out.  Read a little bit about Lenin, or Stalin, or Mao, or Lavrentiy Beria. If you can only bring one phrase to the conversation, then you don't know enough about the subject to speak wisely.

People who have 'flu-like symptoms' and then die of pneumonia aren't called 'pneumonia deaths', they're lumped together as 'flu deaths' by the CDC. However, 'flu' rarely appears on a death certificate either, it'll be pneumonia, which doesn't help at all.  


So no one actually knows how many people die from influenza. It's all modeled based on wide range of variables. So every time you see people spout ""Well, 50,000 people each year die of the flu!"", take it with a huge grain of salt. The modeling is also influenced by the vaccine industry, as they need to know how many vaccines to produce -- which, in itself, is odd. If you don't know how many deaths are actually attributable to an actual flu infection, then how do you know the overall value of getting the flu shot in the first place? Sadly, the vaccine industry makes a lot of money off of fear and uncertainty with no clear data to back it up other than herd statistics.   


Guess we could compare years where they get the vaccine flu strain wrong where practically no flu shots are effective, and then compare the death rates to a year where they nailed the strain...I'm sure they've done that, but I haven't dug for it.",1585163743,flhjbd3

* [This real-time case aggregator](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (only for today's totals)

Washington State's rate of new cases is sub-exponential, suggesting that we're close to or have passed the inflection point.  A best fit model (to a logistics curve) I**^(‚Ä†)**  have done in Excel suggests**^(‚Ä†‚Ä†)** that if we keep with our current testing parameters (only first responders &amp; people who are at risk) that we'll hit a maximum of about 3000 to 4000 cases**^(‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä†)**.    But the fit suggests that we'll see our rate of new cases drop to less than one per day between April 22nd and May 2nd.  This is making me hopeful that by June we should be able to resume normal activities.

**^(‚Ä†)** **WARNING:** I am not an epidemiologist.  Just someone good at math.  This analysis should NOT be relied upon.  I've run it more for my curiosity, but it gives me some hope which is why I'm sharing it.  **DO NOT RELY ON THIS DATA** to determine your course of action.  I provide it ONLY to give some hope.

**^(‚Ä†‚Ä†)** **NOTE:** There are a LOT of assumptions here including that Washington is isolated from the rest of the world (i.e. people from NY or ID don't start coming *here*).

**^(‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä†)** Based on some data from the news (which I can't source at the moment), only 1/5 of cases can identify the positive source who gave it to them.  This suggests that with better testing, we'll find that about 15,000 to 20,000 cases will occur statewide.",1585167261,flhpvf7

The closures will begin at midnight Wednesday, March 25 and last until at least 5 p.m. on April 8, 2020. WDFW will re-evaluate on April 6 whether the closure may need to be extended.

""This is not a decision we take lightly, but it's the right thing to do for the health and well-being of Washington's families,"" said WDFW Director Kelly Susewind. ""Monday's extraordinary order for the residents of our state to stay home requires all of us to work together to ensure these measures have the intended effect.""",1585181440,flifjct

Who is this mystical person that is going around and threatening everybody with this stuff?  I have never met them.  They have never visited me, or any person I know.  If you mean that you will starve and go homeless because  you don't pay your bills ( or refuse to pay them? or refuse to work to pay them) .  Then that magical entity has been around since the beginning of time, and treats everybody equally.  That is life.  It always has been.
  
What is your suggestion?  That you don't pay the grocery store for providing you with meat?  That the grocery store says to the farmer, ""Nah I just want this steak, give it to me""  You just get to have meat because you are you?

Q.¬† I am a gig worker. Am I eligible for unemployment?

A:¬†Maybe! Coverage under Washington's unemployment insurance law is broader than under most other laws. This means that just because you are classified as an independent contractor under some laws does not mean that you are an independent contractor under Washington's unemployment laws. If you are a gig worker who has been laid off or lost work, we encourage you to apply for benefits. We will evaluate each application for eligibility on a case by case basis.
We realize that there are some challenges with the online application, and it is not currently designed for the way you work. We are working to resolve those issues. For now, fill it out the best that you can.

9536,ew73,"Truthfully, rent controls fail to work for a host of reasons, but the core issue is it is addressing the wrong side of the supply and demand issue.  

Every Econ 101 student will tell you if you want the price to go down, you either reduce demand or increase supply.  

Since reducing demand for housing is generally a non-starter, the alternative is increasing supply.

Add more housing.  There's a thousand different ways to do it, but eventually, it has to be done or you end up with a homeless problem on top of out-of-control rents.  

Controlling rents does have _some_ benefits; it's equally unfeasible to expect lower-income people to move to ever-expanding suburbs where housing costs are lower as demand increases, but again, that's truly solved by increasing supply rather than artificially lowering demand.  

You can do something _similar_ to rent control by way of housing subsidies, but that's scary socialism and ""big brother"" and ""government housing"" and such programs are constantly underfunded and micromanaged to death.",1585344141,florr4m

It may be that you received an automatic notice denying your request. Don't worry, that notice does not reflect new emergency regulations that allow workers to order up to 12 weeks on Ready and Hold. We will notify employers. Additionally, employers can request Ready and Waiting status for their workers for up to 12 weeks.

We are updating our computer system. Upon completion we will review all Ready and Waiting denials from March 8 onwards to determine if they meet the new criteria for Ready and Waiting.

Many people have been paying close attention to this disease since it first became apparent in January that there was something serious going on in Wuhan. We watched as the CCP silenced/disappeared reporters, arrested doctors and welded people into their houses. All to prevent (in vain) the spread of a novel disease that had originated in Wuhan. 

Forget the politicization of the language surrounding the nomenclature of this disease. Forget scientific vs common names. Forget propaganda efforts to maximize or minimize the role that China played in controlling this outbreak. Is your contention here truly that it should be taboo to note where this disease came from? Let‚Äôs imagine for a moment that it had never spread from Wuhan. That the extreme measures put into place, the mass death, the giant field hospitals built in haste, the videos of people falling dead in the streets and being dragged kicking and screaming into ambulances and quarantine - that all of that had worked and that everything ended in Wuhan.

You want hospitals to have enough capacity to take care of the new infections once we start loosening restrictions.  So we have to be clearly past not just the peak, but past hospitals being full, to open things up again.

Fortunately, WA seems to be in better shape than other states.

UW predicts peak to be April 19th.  The ICU shortage appears to clear by May 1st.  See: https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections and drill down on WA.

So Stay At Home in effect until end of April is my conservative guess.  

To let young go back to work is one thing, but to let recovered people go back to work requires antibody tests to be available to determine who has been exposed, and perhaps define some threshold of antibodies that is ""enough"".  I have no idea how antibody tests and immune systems work but I assume there's some level involved and a threshold you want to be above.

Not sure how quickly antibody tests will be widely available.

I suspect tech companies will continue work from home for several months and some will make permanent changes to work culture based on this experience.

And then they botched the first batch, which set us back several more weeks. Meanwhile, the CDC under Trump‚Äôs direction was actively preventing states from running their own tests. It wasn‚Äôt until researchers in WA defied CDC orders and started testing people that they realized that virus had likely been circulating in the Seattle area undetected for several weeks. 

Then the state government started taking action because the Federal government was useless. And then the CDC came in and demanded that they stop testing. And I could go on and on about how Trump wasted weeks downplaying the situation and spreading false information. This was 100 percent a failure of the Trump Administration.  

Washington state‚Äôs government made the best of a bad situation and we are starting to see the curve flatten. We are in much better position than many other states right now.

Technically speaking, the entire Columbia River in Washington is lakes/reservoirs behind dams, except the tidal part below Bonneville Dam, and a short segment near Hanford.

Going upriver from Bonneville Dam, the reservoir/lakes behind each dam are: Lake Bonneville, Lake Celilo, Lake Umatilla, Lake Wallula, Priest Rapids Lake, Lake Wanapum, Rock Island Pool, Lake Entiat, Lake Pateros, Rufus Woods Lake, Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake. The dam-reservoir process continues in Canada.

Don't have a point here, just thought it might be interesting for anyone who didn't know. Almost the entire Columbia is dammed and controlled like a gigantic machine. Excepting the lowermost tidal part below Bonneville, the short Hanford Reach, and the very uppermost part in Canada, whenever you see the Columbia River you are seeing a reservoir/lake‚Äîthe natural, pre-dam river would have in most places looked much smaller, flowed much faster, and been more constrained in deep canyons, with hundreds of gnarly whitewater rapids one after the other.",1585442479,flshvcm

9922,desertdungarees,"The problem may be that Washington really only had it bad in one nursing home? Correct me if I'm wrong. It sucked because everyone there was super susceptible, but the fact that it was localized to a fairly professional facility meant they could limit the spread of the contagion. When it spread further in the community, it wasn't in, like, Spokane where more people would call it dumb shit like ""a flu"" or hinge on Trump's shitty prognostications. Instead, it was in progressive Seattle where techies, medical professionals, and coastal elites understood the ramifications and got scared and took it seriously immediately.


Louisiana might not enjoy the same fate as Washington. Which may serve to spread it s'more!!

Again, I'm saying this, but I don't KNOW any of this. It just seems like SK vs. Iran in approach.

Unfortunately, NYCs infections weren't localized to a nursing home. But NYers are similar in ilk to Seattleites. They may stay the course and flatten the curve better than a Dallas or a Oklahoma City, for example.

We have 3 National Parks nearby: Glacier, North Cascades, Rainier and a few National Recreation Areas, BLM camping areas, and National Forests.   A lot of people enjoy hunting.  We have quite a few ski areas nearby.  Scouts (both Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts) are very popular out here.

If you're not an outdoor person, we have a Symphony, a busy Civic Theater where Broadway Shows and Musicals show all the time.  We have 4 Native American Casinos nearby; they all have concerts (Def Leppard and ZZ Top are coming in October) as well as comedians.  There are dance clubs here as well.  These don't quite have the variety you'll find in the Seattle Area, but there is still quite a few options nonetheless.

During the height of the great recession from 10 years ago unemployment was going up by *only* 800k per month, and it jumped by over 3 million last week alone. Did you expect that would have no consequences? Did you want the state to have prepared for a rainy day like this and expended resources for years just in case we have a spike of unemployment like we are experiencing now?

Of course not. So let's put our adult pants on and try to have a little perspective. I know its a stressful time and we are all worried. But it will be ok. You will get your unemployment claim, and aprt of the stimulus act was to allow for retroactive claims, so you will even get past money.

C'mon dude. It has been less than one full work day since a record breaking law was passed and you're expecting it to be up and running instantly?

If you go here:

&gt;Recently the federal government passed an economic stimulus package that includes pandemic unemployment assistance. We are evaluating the package and what it means to unemployment benefits.

But yesterday during the Governor's address he was asked several times about people driving for leisure or people driving to remote hiking locations or people being pulled over to check their destination, etc.

He was still kinda wishy-washy about it.  He said that ""he guesses it's okay to drive to remote hiking locations but the problem comes when people stop to buy gas or get a donut at a store"" and ""he thinks people should be able to find local hiking locations.""

He also said specifically that they're not worried about stopping cars right now, they're worried about businesses because that's where people congregate.

He also suggested that people put a picture of a nurse on their dash and when they're about to go for a drive to ask that nurse if this trip is really necessary.

**A:** We are working as quickly as possible to update our technology to ensure everyone who is eligible gets the full amount they are owed. We are also waiting on some additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor to make some final changes. That means it will take a couple of weeks to update, with a target launch of mid-April. We will backdate your claim so you are paid from the time you separated from your job or otherwise became eligible under the CARES Act.

The best way to think about (without a treatise on statistical modelling) is to understand we can basically compare the average, expected number of deaths due to various causes around ""now"" (maybe last year) compared to actual deaths ""now"" this year.  

There's going to be a LOT of confounding factors.  Like the ""now"" number may drop significantly due to people engaging in less risky behaviour -- driving, for instance, is a HUGE killer, and we're not doing much of it lately; also, going out drinking; recreational sports (or sports in general); all sorts of stuff that might cause injury or death is probably going to be depressed.  

We'll also need to control for things like hospitals being at capacity (or not) and availability of rapid treatment (or not) for non-covid cases compared to then and now, and so on, and so on.

And yes, Google is your friend here.

 As someone else mentioned, Western WA and Eastern WA are almost like 2 different states. Western WA (where I live) is where most of the big cities in the state are, including Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, Bellevue, and Olympia. Olympia is the state capitol, where the state government convenes and legislates. Our governor is Jay Inslee, a Democrat. Most of the population in WA is pretty liberal in terms of politics. Eastern WA is way more conservative than Western WA, but due to the smaller population there, WA tends to elect &amp; vote for liberals.

People in Seattle are described as overly polite, but passive aggressive and non confrontational. This can seem standoffish or unfriendly to people who come from other places. 

Places to google/landmarks/well known spots: space needle, pike place market, mt ranier, university of washington, washington state university, lake washington.

The columbia tower is the tallest building in Seattle.

Boeing, Microsoft, and Starbucks were all started in/around Seattle. 
Amazon is now headquartered here, which sucks for our housing market. There is a huge homelessness problem in Western Washington, mostly because housing prices have gotten SO high. The cost of living here is unfeasible for a huge amount of people, especially people whose families have lived here for generations and have been poor for generations.

Good parts: WA has some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. Mountains, forest, and ocean all in one glance. The most beautiful sunsets I've ever laid eyes on were in Bellingham, WA. Mt Rainier is HUGE and amazing, the Olympic mountains on the peninsula are beautiful. Western WA is very queer friendly. Theres some absolutely amazing Asian food if you know where to go.

And that's in most cities. I'm 25, born and raised here. 

As far as land marks? Again, depends. Aside from the obvious space needle, pacific science center, and Seattle in general,  The Olympic National Forest on the peninsula is one of the most beautiful, lush, awe-inspiring places in the world. 

Not including the ONF, We have hundreds of hiking trails on just *this* side of the mountains. 

Washington has a (mostly) north-south running mountain 'wall' which is sort of a common divider for ""Eastern Washington"" and ""Western Washington"". The east has more intense weather/seasons, but the west still gets it's fair share of snow, heat, and of course, rain. 

There's also the Puget Sound (P-yoo-jet-sound) which is essentially a giant inlet of ocean with tons of small and medium sized islands that people and wildlife live on. (Google map for a better understanding) We have a pretty well designed ferry system which has stops on all of the main islands as well as places to get on/off on the ""mainland"" in all of the well know cities peppering the coast north and south. I'm not sure if ""ferry"" is a well known thing so just incase, they're essentially giant floating parking garages with decks and lobbies inside for people to hang out and enjoy the ride.

County and State officials are already questioning some of the cause of deaths and are working with hospitals on the details but this will take time.  Flu deaths this year are inexplicably down from 245 to 89.

Either FLU deaths are 36% of last year because Covid is killing the same people as the FLU or FLU deaths that look a lot like Covid without testing are being miss counted because of lack of testing. We need to sort this out and get an antibody test NOW so we dont have to guess.

General advice is to not travel, at all, zilch, zero. If you are sick, every time you stop to touch a gas pump, run into a convenience store to get a candy bar, or stop in at an essential business along your route to the beach, you potentially affect those in rural communities that do not have the medical infrastructure to handle an outbreak.

The same logic applies to people thinking about camping, hiking popular remote trails, etc.

Its shitty for all of us to stay home, but absolutely necessary. I tried negotiating with myself on whether to go ride my motorcycle (solo activity) but ultimately it's a selfish, poor choice.

Walk near home, avoid getting in the car. I miss the beach too, and as silly as it sounds, I will do some meditation to put my mind in a clear place, then hop in global webcam sites and peruse different beaches for a half hour or so and imagine myself there.

Knowing we were hit more than a month before New York City.  

Knowing we have better air quality and a better medical system than New York City.  

Knowing that we did nothing to prevent its spread until last week.

Yes and the entire conversation is at r/Washington and not r/newyork.  Again the CDC estimate is not about r/washington and I would not be surprised if it gets revised down by end of the month.  It already revised down from 2 million to 200,000.  My bet is UW is right with the 80,000

so back to the conversation and a dose of some facts and reality

Reality in Washington State

2018-2019 Season - 245 Deaths (last year) in Washington State last year total from all viruses including a corona virus

2017-2018 Season - 296 Deaths in Washington State from all viruses

2019-2020 Current Season - 247 + 89 = 336 Deaths in Washington State from all viruses

* First state with a serious outbreak so people here understood the severity of the issue quickly from statements in local news and by local leaders.

* U of Wash. is an extremely good public school with a strong  medical program (in research, education and care) and has led the implementation of testing as the federal government has lagged behind.

* Inslee has been a strong leader focused on science as a governor and has clearly communicated the threat and how it fight it to the public. Other leaders have supported him. 

* Large tech sector means a lot of jobs were able to seamlessly move to working from home, and a largely tech-literate population means there was less resistance to implementing working from home early in other sectors.

* There's the infamous ""Seattle freeze"" that outsiders commonly notice, a tendency for locals to be polite and friendly in public but distant and cold if you try to get closer. This independent spirit and slow-to-trust nature is speculated as a reason why social distancing has been effective since early on. Inslee was possibly late in issuing a stay-at-home order for the whole state, but he was relying on data showing people were already mostly staying at home without the order. Further, there is a large Asian population which similarly seems to have a cultural tendency to be able to implement strong social distancing and other methods of slowing the spread.

* Seattle metro area is not nearly as dense as the urban cores of other large cities. This has caused a housing crisis lately, but is likely another factor slowing the spread.",1585867706,fm9fk1r

We aren't so much putting our heads in the sand as sitting in our personal bunkers waiting for some test to be developed and released in mass to everyone for testing. That in itself will be a massive undertaking. But if we don't this will keep popping up and we'll be dealing with this for way longer than we should.

10768,MariRey,"I'm going to try to answer some of your questions.

&gt;Why aren‚Äôt we looking at this in a more intelligent way? 

The most intelligent way to handle this problem is to travel back in time to January and convince the federal government to ramp up testing. 

There are 3 main ways to handle this virus. It depends on how quickly a country acts. 

1) Test everyone coming in from effected areas. And do contact tracing and catch everyone was in contact with a person sick. Then quartine those people repeat and repeat. **We failed in doing that cause we didn't have enough adequate tests. People had lesser symptoms and slipped through etc etc.** That approach is impossible for us now. We have community spread.

2) Test Everyone! Everyone who has symptoms. Do this while encouraging people to limit contact with others. Social distancing etc. Maybe shut down things for a short while.  **We can't do this because we do not have enough testing.** This is what is happening in south korea. This does have the possibility of new outbreaks. People not being cautious once strict distancing measures are reduced. 

3) Okay so option 1 and 2 failed now we are at step 3. Shut everything down. The reason to do this is because hospitals cannot handle the amount of cases that would happen if we didn't. They have limited beds. Limited supplies. Limited everything. Shutting everything down slows the transmission rate of the virus. Gives the hospitals and govt time to prepare for the peak of cases. 

&gt;Why aren‚Äôt we quarantining immunocompromised and elderly as well as people with known health conditions? 


We are that's what the stay at home order is doing. So I'm guessing your question is why not **only** immunocompromised and elderly. 

1) those people need to work and live as well. They live with people who aren't. And those people could bring back the disease and infect thier loved ones.

 **2) If you are young you can still get sick and die. Sure the rate is lower. But even if you survive the side effects arent pretty. If you have a serious case, you'll need to be put on a ventilator. And stay on it for a week or more likely weeks. There is reports that people who do survive have lower capacity with thier lungs. So congrats you are now immunocompromised for any future flu like illness.**

3) People who are sick with covid 19 will be in beds that in normal situations someone with a heart attack, car accident, and other hospital related trips. Both of those groups of people will die if the hospitals get swamped. Hospitals have limited resources.

&gt;Why aren‚Äôt we trying to figure out a better way to do this. Why don‚Äôt we have real data on the people actually dieing and being hospitalized so we can make pointed decisions? 

The govt is trying. Everyone is trying. Currently it's a waiting game. A waiting game to get tests, supplies, and the numbers down. Everyone wants to go to the South Korea model. Easy access testing  and easier restrictions on public contact. 

There are models the govt is using to try to figure out when the peak of this virus will be. The issue is that the model relys on how well **we, the people,** stay home and away from others. If we can slow the peak, we get time to find/make more of those limited resources. But it all depends on several variables. 

These are the questions our govt officials are probably trying to figure out. 

How well are we flattening the curve and stay at home?

How quickly can we get ventilators and ppe?

Can we increase testing? Both for if you have the virus? Or if you had the virus?

Can a vaccine get made quicker?

Can we do all that and minimize hurt to the economy?

Will this die down in the summer and come back harsher in the fall?

If you want some resources, where people talk about this stuff, I would recommend the April 2 episode of The Daily podcast, or reading Andy Slavitts daily Twitter threads (or his podcast In the bubble). There's probably dozens others just try to check sources.",1585918234,fmb4okw

From Aberdeen to Seattle is a little over 100 miles. That is NOT a hard thing to build. Nor is it honestly that far. Since we have Trains going further than that across the country in general. 

Having transit take people from Aberdeen to Seattle would help Aberdeen in growth and infrastructure. But not just them. The small towns between too. Like Elma, and Montesano. Then the surrounding areas like Cosmopolis, or Raymond or even West Port could benefit.

I‚Äôm living in where ive seen what transit can do and has done for people. In smaller towns. It saves more money for people, it brings every thing I mentioned in. 

Your stance against it is only that it will cost a lot in Taxes when lol it‚Äôll make more in the long run than what taxes actually cost. And if implemented properly will be very important and beneficial. 

I guarantee there were UrBaN pLaNnInG dEgReE holders 30 years ago who were against similar transit building to closer cities like Bellevue, or Tacoma etc. and now look at the state of the area. 

If you make access easier for people. They will choose the easier path. Transit trains to farther out parts of the state would definitely make a difference.

There is absolutely no reason to reinvent the wheel here. Pushing a commuter train through to rural areas is the exact same concept as pushing suburbs out in the 50s. 

Why not capitalize on the existing infrastructure in place?  Do you think Aberdeen can handle an influx of 10k people? 20k? Absolutely not.

I don't hate infrastructure, I hate unnecessary infrastructure. Use what you've got, improve what you've got.",1585943020,fmccg4g
10862,TheMonsterWithinYou,"Do you think it would happen in one go? It happens over time. It took bart 15 years to just extend from Pittsburgh to Antioch. 

In that time a lot of growth and infrastructure happened. You think if they knuckles down and let‚Äôs say just pushed transit from idk Tacoma to Olympia that they wouldn‚Äôt get more people moving out to Elma to commute to Olympia for work to seattle? Lol they would. And in that time people would buy land, property. Housing developers would buy acres to build homes and businesses etc. 

It all factors in. So maybe right now Aberdeen couldn‚Äôt Handle it happening at once. But it‚Äôll never happen at once if properly planned and OVER time. 

Also doing NOTHING to prepare for the influx of people, and demand doesn‚Äôt help the situation either.

For as wide as highway 12 is, from Aberdeen to Olympia, do you honestly believe a transit train going between there wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea? Highway 4 was the same size in 90s early 2000s.

Imagine the infrastructure that would happen over time, the jobs being made, the homes and taxes being collected for purchase of homes. Businesses started.

Just because you approve of it and believe that the ends justify the means, does not mean that it isn't a violation of peoples fundamental rights. At least own your fascism, even if you believe it necessary.

Also, where I go in the wilderness nobody is ""rescuing me"" if I ""fall in the forest"". If I am unable to self-rescue I'll simply die as there is no means of communication. That's a risk I choose to take and even if I had the means to communicate with emergency services I fully recognize that nobody is under any obligation to come to my aid during a pandemic, or any other time for that matter.

I fully understand the gravity of the current situation. If I choose to weather the storm in the mountains risking nobody other than myself than that is my choice to make.

Furthermore, it's pretty rich that you think making something ""illegal"" is more effective than educating the public and letting them make their own decisions. That's why everyone wears seat belt, nobody uses their cell phone while driving, and illegal drug use is 0%. /s

If you need the government to tell you what to do you shouldn't be allowed to make your own decisions period. You should be deemed incompetent and placed in the care of a family member or social services.

Educating yourself and making your own decisions and living with the consequences isn't a difficult concept for fucks sakes.",1586073721,fmhbqbq

11164,WikiTextBot,"**Game theory**

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic, systems science and computer science. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which each participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by those of the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

Absolutely you fucking psychopath. Let's review one more time. Just because you believe a violation of peoples rights is necessary for the greater good it does not mean that rights aren't being violated. It just means that you think that the violation is necessary/justified given the circumstances. Fundamental rights don't change because there is a crisis, that's why they are called fundamental.

Furthermore, if you really attended law school than you should know there isn't one universally accepted belief when it comes to rights.

[Negative and Positive Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights)

See, any schmuck can throw Wikipedia links.

&gt; I have degrees in economics, philosophy and law.

Appeal to accomplishment fallacy. Literally not an argument. Even if it's true plenty of morons have a advanced education.

Game Theory has no place in a conversation about ethics or rights. Game theory can be used to justify all kinds of unethical policies (even slavery and eugenics) so long as it results in the most desirable outcome. Sounds like you need to read up on the selective usefulness of game theory. If you're really as smart and educated as you say you are you wouldn't be throwing around links to game theory like it's some sort of panacea.

You're the type of person that would have snitched on runaways slaves or people hiding Jews during the Holocaust because they were breaking the law. I bet you would lick boots no matter how totalitarian the government became all to uphold you precious ""law and order"".

If you get pneumonia at 22 and it causes lung problems that you end up spending tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars on throughout the rest of your life that is all because of getting sick how does that factor in? Really the way we should be measuring this impact on humans in days per capita. Cost per capita as a result of shutdown and treatment should also be measured. This way people could see how countries and places choosing to do nothing as it would ""hurt the economy"" can be shown just how wrong they are.
