The info online is not very specific and we have been told by the licensing office that it is probably out of date. 

The question: if a vehicle is deemed a total loss by insurance, is between 6-20 years old, but is NOT worth at least 7,880, can you legally get a title for it? 

More info: Our truck was involved in an accident and deemed a total loss. We need to sign the paperwork today to either keep it or give it up. We would like to keep it and fix it, but we're concerned that we won't be able to get a title afterwards. The most recent conversation we had with the licensing office, they said since it does not meet the requirements for a rebuilt title (6-20 years old AND worth more than $7,880)  that we would just receive a regular title, not a salvage title. That doesn't seem correct at all. Our understanding is that we would need a salvage title, then fix it up and have it inspected to get a rebuilt title. The website makes it seem like we will just get a salvage title but then we will be ineligible for a rebuilt title, therefore unable to legally drive it. 

Has anyone done this recently and have information?",Washington,Question about salvage/rebuilt vehicle titles in WA

I’m from TN (Tennessee) and I’m planning a trip sometime in July (after the fourth of course) and I’m glad I found this Reddit community because I’ve had trouble finding a good area to look for an Air B&amp;B during my weeklong stay! Washington state has been on my bucket list for a while and I’m going to tackle this in the new year. :) Eventually I want to move there but right now I’m just vacationing with me,myself, and I.

The ideal location would be: 

- Somewhere remote but not so far out I don’t have access to a convenience or grocery store for necessary items such as gas and food. 

- Located in a wooded area where you can’t hear or see neighbors. I’m really here for the nature and outdoor activities rather than Seattle and big city areas. I’d prefer some quiet away from the busy world. 

- Little to no light pollution if possible.

That’s pretty much it for what I’m looking for! I’ve never been there before so I figured I could ask y’all good people for some advice. :)

I live about 15 miles north of Seattle and looking for friends, specifically female. I would love to have someone to hangout with and vent to or really just do friend things in general.

At some point in the future, autonomous vehicles (AVs) will be able to operate without a human driver on board. It won’t happen all at once but eventually we’ll get to the point where we can eliminate millions of driving jobs.

This is part of the ongoing trend toward automation. Automation has already eliminated millions of manufacturing jobs and damaged lives, families and communities. This job loss was (arguably) unavoidable because manufacturing is a competitive industry and operates in a global marketplace. A manufacturer who doesn’t embrace automation runs the risk of pricing itself out of the marketplace. 

But there are key differences between transportation and manufacturing.

1. Transportation isn’t subject to global competition. Driving jobs can’t be exported. In the transportation industry, we can’t lose market share to a foreign rival.

2. Transportation takes place on publicly owned property. Unlike factories, you and I own the roads. We have the right and responsibility to regulate them. And we pay the bills. 

3. Transportation has unique security concerns. There is no reason to believe that computer hacking is going to be permanently defeated. A computer virus could convert an autonomous truck into a weapon of war. Or worse, a virus could spread through thousands of vehicles and be activated simultaneously. A Safety Driver would be able to override autonomous control systems and take over mechanical control of the vehicle. 

Today, AV manufacturers are running test projects on public roads. So far, in most cases government regulators are requiring a Safety Driver to be in the vehicle. As the technology matures, companies will push to eliminate the human occupant and maximize profit. Are you confident the federal government will resist lobbyists and protect our interests?

This would not be a ban against AVs—it would only require that all AVs have a legal operator on board. Whether or not the vehicle operates autonomously at any given time would be a judgement call for the Safety Driver to make. 

Should Washington State to pass legislation to require Safety Drivers in Autonomous Vehicles?",Washington,Would you support a requirement that Autonomous Vehicles operating on Washington State roads have a Safety Driver on board?

I'm looking to do some serious research about your state for a novel I've been working on. The majority of the book will focus on a fictional small town with something between 1K-5K and the surrounding wilderness. I'm mainly interested in historical/cultural/geographical books or documentaries so I can accurately develop a small Washington town from it's founding in the late 1800s. Although any material is useful, of course.

To show how little I know, I always assumed logging was big up here (based on...other fiction I'm assuming) but I looked it up and you guys export aircraft parts ~50% of the time? Interesting!

And of course, I'll be making the trip up to visit as many towns as I can for that extra visual understanding once I have the money.

Please feel free to pass this on and I highly encourage you all to take a moment and stand up for your rights to be free!!!  

""Dear Sir or Madam,

As a constituent, I urge you to OPPOSE these gun control bills: SB 6076 (and companion HB 2241), HB 1374, SB 6077 (and companion HB 2240), and any other bill that would restrict my Second Amendment-protected rights. As an 8 year veteran of the United States Marine Corps, I feel very strongly about what these proposed bills will do to the foundation of this great country, as well as the future of Washington State. How does restricting and vilifying tens of thousands of law-abiding citizens by passing laws that would only criminalize them help lower gun-related crime? How are these proposed bills constitutional when we look to our own states constitution? I understand that we want a safe and prosperous environment for ourselves and our children to grow up and live in, but what do short-sighted laws that criminalize the majority of the law-abiding aim to solve? Why do we not look to further enforce our already robust laws that do work, when enforced? Why have we strayed away from educating our populace?   I am the father to 2 small children and I feel that educating them to other dangers of all manner of things in this world, to include firearms and their safe handling, is a paramount principle of leadership. Why do we not address the scourge of violence and crime at its core? Why are the law-abiding firearm owners singled out to be ostracized? How does undermining the very creation of this great country by taking away an individuals right to bear arms further prevent crime? I am as passionate about crime prevention as I know many of you are, but taking away citizens rights with the illusion of security is not correct course of action. In closing, I ask that you please let me know how you plan to vote on those gun bills.""

Is one place significantly lower on crime or lower cost of living? Better education or place to raise kids? Nicer housing?

 The California promoters behind Insomniac are accusing USC Events of misappropriating $1.2 million and breaching contract for its annual event in Washington. Now, the 2020 event is in limbo amid a lawsuit.

According to [***Bilboard***](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/legal-and-management/8550027/insomniac-paradiso-festival-usc-events-lawsuit-2020?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter), USC Events has allegedly been teasing a 2020 edition of the Paradiso music festival. Three separate posts were posted on the USC Events Facebook page, which have since been deleted, that included messages like “Who should play the sunset time slot at Paradiso Festival?” The posts are pointing toward a 2020 edition of the festival, although Insomniac is in the middle of a lawsuit against the Seattle promoter, alleging that the Chad Anderson-led USC Events misappropriated $1.2 million in advances meant for artists during last year’s event.

The 2019 edition of the fest took place from June 14 to 16 at the Gorge in George, Washington.

409,RedSarc,1581141423,f0nhvc,Nan,"Friends, I grew up in Minnesota. I joined the service and was deployed a couple times. Turns out myriad health problems is my everlasting gift from my military service. More recently, a medical treatment-gone wrong at VA almost killed me - seriously, near death.

Though I have come back from this to some degree, I have done all the recovering I can. My life has been cut, my health is in decline and, although I have been fighting for years, only very recently has VA finally acknowledged my reality: 100% permanent and totally disabled; I’m 41 years old.

Why does all this matter when planning a trip to WA or anywhere for that matter? My health was decimated by a life-threatening reaction to a pharmaceutical medication and because this has happened to me, the risk of death is super high should I consume pharmaceuticals again.

As such, I now rely on cannabis as one of the many tools in my self-care kit. I am a registered cannabis patient in Minnesota (MN) but I can’t take these meds across the state line lest I be federally imprisoned for this most heinous of crimes. Though this is unlikely, I could still have the meds confiscated by TSA or some other law enforcer.

So, I write to you all to talk about cannabinoid-related options for the disabled people who visit your beautiful state. I realize cannabis in WA is fully legal but what I really need to know is what sort of cannabis products are available that are 1) easily accessible, 2) easy to use without extra tools and 3), if possible, products that are also somewhat similar to what I am using now.

MN is currently legal for medical use **but**  MN has also enacted the most strict implementation of *medical use* - cannabis is grown here in the state but the current law requires that the plant be completely reduced to oil before it is sold to patients.

In oil form, it is really easy to use - as a: capsule, oral solution, vape, topical, etc., but I am of the mind that in this form, having been reduced/processed to such a degree, the final product is missing some essential elements, it has been stripped of it’s natural goodness and is therefore far less effective. But that’s just my take on it.

Aside from cannabis and the like, do you all have any suggestions for cool places to check out. I know of a couple but I a sure the citizens of WA would know best!

428,uziduzi1,1581218425,f12s00,Nan," Hi everyone! I'm a student at the University of Washington and I'm currently studying Informatics. As part of a group project, I'm doing research on healthcare affordability in the Seattle area as well as general public knowledge of free medical clinics. I'd really appreciate it if you guys could take a minute or so to fill out this easy survey to help me with the project!

More info about the project:

Seattle has an extremely large population that faces a variety of struggles, including finding access to affordable healthcare. This includes homeless, refugees, immigrants, individuals in between jobs, etc. To support this population, a number of free medical clinics have sprung up in the area, working to provide free/affordable healthcare to individuals regardless of whether or not they have insurance. These free clinics are extremely important for individuals that for one reason or another can’t afford quality healthcare. However, this system of free clinics is not without problems. One of the most challenging problems facing the target users of these clinics is how to find them, know what they offer, and their hours of operations.

Our project is focused on finding a solution to this problem, with the goal of connecting underinsured and undocumented populations in the Seattle area to affordable healthcare resources. The following questions will be used to gain understanding on the average Seattleite's healthcare experience.

Thanks, and have a great rest of the weekend! :)

Maybe it's because it's the middle of the month and people just got paid, idk, but I've been seeing this happen more often.

I went to Winco first since I needed some bulk stuff, but most of the shelves were only half-full, there were several sections of shelves that were totally empty and had the look of being that way for some time. (Winco doesn't really clean their stores here, so everything's got a layer of black crap aside from the aisle floors). I always expect prices to be higher each time I go to the store, that's just inflation and the way it is nowadays. But some of the price changes were much higher than I'd expect. Like, 1gal of the cheap Winco milk was now up to $3.29, when last I saw it was $2.37.

At Walmart (since I couldn't find everything I needed), it looked even worse. Rather than some of the shelves being half-empty, now nearly all of them were. Probably a good 15-20% of all the shelving space was completely empty. Selection-wise, Walmart keeps removing brands and replacing them with Walmart's own company. Not surprising, but it makes me wonder if those brands have gotten too expensive for Walmart to turn a profit on? When I went to the bath &amp; hair section to get a scrubbie for my GF, the prices had doubled. Before they averaged $1-2 depending on the material, but now they ran $2-4, with only the cheapest and flimsiest ones below $3. They didn't even carry the mid-range hair product I use (American Crew) the sticker was gone, so I'll need to find it elsewhere I guess. Grocery prices have gone up a lot too, milk was ""only"" $2.90/gal, but only for the 1% and fat-free Walmart variety. The eggs I buy are now up to $5/18 count, and these are only slightly better than the basic Walmart ones because they come in a clear plastic case. (My store tapes shut the egg crates so you can't open them. After 2 times of getting broken eggs, I switched to a more expensive one where I can actually see the eggs)",Washington,"Maybe I'm crazy, but am I seeing food shortages to go along with the higher prices here?"

I am a us citizen that is in the process of investigating properties to possibly buy, around the trip cities area of Washington state (Kennewick, Pasco and Richland). 
Currently I'm in the midst of selling a property in Mediterranean coast of Spain and my intention is to later relocate in the US. The reason I've been looking in that are is because of family reasons; my father is clinically blind and my older sister live in Pasco with her family (also for work, hopefully something regarding graphic design or tech sales, etc)
Anywho, I'm inquiring you redditers for advice on what I should do to get the best investment possible. We don't have unlimited resources, as everyone in the world who isn't Jeff Beezos. Most likely, due to market prices that I've slimmed through on sites like Zillow, we will have to figure out how to finance a small portion of whatever we end up buying. 
Though I'm a US citizen, I grew up in Latin America most of my life and in all honesty, I am completely ignorant in the known unknowns of real estate investment in the country; what kind of financial aid could I apply for through what federal department, what financial institutions would be open to financing such purchase for a 30 yr old with non US University degree and/or a visually impaired retired 70 yr old man. 
Any thoughts, comments, questions, advice, links on info from federal aid (because all I keep finding is pages under pageas under pages, under more pages of aid provided but only to those citizens that have been in the military o family member in the same rank, which is not the case for me or my family).

717,Kitzinger1,1583354716,fdjfee,Nan,"Right now, we are still waiting to hear if the patient has Coronavirus.  My wife is under quarantine as is a large number of ER hospital staff, Acute Care Level staff, and Respiratory (1/3rd of the Respiratory is now quarantined).  


Last week, I went to the city council meeting and expressed my worries that the city wasn't taking the threat of this virus seriously enough.  I focused a lot of my attention on the supply side as that was my initial worry.  That we would have an epidemic and not enough supplies to treat it.  I do believe that portion was taken seriously as the Hospital Leadership came out and stated they had ordered additional supplies a few days later.  


I don't think one week was enough time to prepare even if my concerns were acted upon seriously.  Maybe they were for all that I know.  It wasn't enough time to train, to come up with a comprehensive plan, to go over isolation procedures, and to setup an outdoor triage center to assess is patients are showing signs of virus infection.  


I don't know if our city is in the planning stages of setting up an additional facility to handle a rapid influx of patients or has started contacting all the health workers within our town to provide additional support should the situation arise that they need to.  


What I do know is that our Hospital isn't using the appropriate Isolation protocol for this virus.  They are using Droplet Isolation protocols (and even that isn't being done right) and not Aeroslized Isolation Protocols.  That the patient wasn't isolated nor proper precautions done in the Emergency Room where the patient was located and all of the Emergency room was contaminated.  As a former Nuclear Biological and Chemical Specialist and a Respiratory Therapist of 9 years I can say that without a doubt the Emergency Room, the areas where the patient was transferred through, and a good portion of the Acute Level of the Hospital is contaminated and should be considered as a possible source of contagion.  Further, because of improper Isolation protocols and lack of training (including fit testing of masks) additional hospital staff are being exposed.  


More worrisome to me is that patient family members are entering and exiting the patients room wearing only a mask.  Their clothes, their shoes, and their entire bodies including their hair is contaminated.  This means everything they brush up against, everything they touch, everything is now a possible vector of transmission.  They have gone home, have kissed their kids goodnight, have shopped...  I could go on.  


Improper quarantine measures are not being used or enforced.  Patient contact should have been relegated to just the essentials.  I don't know about where the patient lived if that has been quarantined or the people the patient lived with have been quarantined also.  Further, because my wife is quarantined I no longer have anymore information if proper isolation procedures have been implemented.  If I hedged my bets I would almost certainly say they are not.  


At this point,  and with my overall experience and training, I  would state that any remote possibility of stopping the spread of this virus has become mute in our community.  The virus has circulated, it has infiltrated large communal areas such as Walmart, and to a larger extent is currently incubating among an unknown portion of our population.  


We are now in the Phase 1 of the outbreak or the trickling in portion.  In the next week or two we should see a small number of patients begin to come in with the Coronavirus.  


Phase 2 will be the flood portion and will last about 3 months.  Large numbers of patients will begin to saturate the local hospital overwhelming the Hospitals ability to provide appropriate care.  This can be curtailed if appropriate action is taken now to begin to supplement the staff with volunteers, locate an additional facility to treat the influx of patients, and institute a Coordinator.  


Phase 3 will be when we will see a return to the trickle stage where remnants of those who had not been exposed yet become sick. and trickle in.  


This is what my training and experience has taught me.  I don't think the virus can be contained at this point.  Our schools, local community resources, etc will all be hit.  
If you think wearing a mask is going to protect you then I ask you this:  Did you think about who might have coughed on that box you grabbed or the itch in your eye that you just rubbed just after picking up that box?  Did you notice your hand brushing the shelving unit as you walked past brushing ever so slightly against the spittle from an old man coughing a day before?   When you got home did you notice the virus particles flown into the air as you took off your coat, took off your mask, and inhaled?  


I would resign yourself to understanding you will get sick.  Resign to getting those things that will make you comfortable and understand that for the most part you will live.  


One thing I do want to stress:  If you are not overtly ill, if your injury isn't serious, if you don't have to go to the local hospital then don't.  Stay the hell away from it.  It better be an emergency because the most likely place you will get this virus is there.  I would almost count on it.  


I think that is all I have right now.  Got questions I'll do my best to answer.",Washington,Moses Lake Coronavirus - Hospital Staff exposed and Quarantined

737,Korochun,1583466859,fe7r7o,Nan,"Hello. I'm not going to really bother with a lot of preamble, except to say that I'm not a doctor, don't take me for a professional, and so on and so forth. I'm just tired of seeing the sensationalist hype about this and people acting like it's anything at all out of the ordinary, when so far it simply doesn't appear to be at all notable.

I think this because I am able to find basic statistics and draw conclusion from publicly available data. And currently, there is nothing to suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak is actually any more of a risk to you, or indeed more of a threat, than a seasonal flu. Here are the numbers to support this statement, and my reasoning for this statement.

Currently, [the latest World Health Organization report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200305-sitrep-45-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=ed2ba78b_2) estimates that there are just a little over 80,000 cases confirmed globally, with 3015 confirmed deaths. This is roughly 3.74% of the confirmed infected patients, which does seem significantly higher than overall death toll of the flu.

However, there is a significant problem with these numbers: the death rate and the confirmed cases are only the cases severe enough to actually end up in the hospital. Here is what the same WHO source has to say on the actual symptoms of the COVID-19 (emphasis mine):

 `The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.` **Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.** **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.** `Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.` 

This tells us that the vast majority of the people that *do* get COVID-19 are not going to develop symptoms or indeed seek medical treatment. Some of you who are reading this may have already been infected and have already successfully survived this disease without even realizing that you had it.

But there is another, more important point to talk about: so far, COVID-19 appears to be actually slightly less deadly than the flu. Here is why.

For my primary source of data, I will be using [2017-2018 CDC statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm#table1) for estimated infection, hospitalization, and death from the seasonal flu. I use the 2017-2018 period for this because CDC has had more time to compile and revise its numbers to be more precise. However, looking at both the preceding and following reports, all these percentages are mostly the same and within a basic tolerable error margin. In other words, the data checks out.

According to CDC, the estimated hospitalizations for severe flu complications in this time period and total mortality rates are broken down as so by the age groups:

Age: 0-4        Hospitalizations: 25,644           Death total: 115 (0.4%)

Age: 5-17      Hospitalizations: 20,599           Death total: 528 (2.5%)

Age: 18-49    Hospitalizations: 80,985           Death total: 2,803 (3.4%)

Age: 50-64    Hospitalizations: 140,385         Death total: 6,751 (4.8%)

Age: 65+       Hospitalizations: 540,517         Death total:  50,903 (9.4%)

All Ages:       Hospitalizations: 808,129         Death total:  61,099 (7.6%)

Now, obviously this is not an accurate death rate for total flu infections. CDC estimates that over 44 million people in the United States were infected with the flu in this time period, making the total infection to mortality rate just about 0.13%. However, I would argue that this is irrelevant to our current mortality statistics on the COVID-19 infection, because we are only seeing severe cases of people with complications who have been hospitalized, of which the total death toll is 3.4%. By comparison, of the people hospitalized due to flu symptoms or complications, almost 7.6% died, which is more than double the rate of total death % from the seasonal flu. Of these, 84% were older than 50. 66% were over the age of 65. 

As a last point, I present to you the [Chinese CDC chart for overall mortality burden of the COVID-19](https://i.insider.com/5e583c47fee23d4cf4755b27) (source: Business Insider, who claim they got it from Chinese CDC, but I couldn't actually find it from the primary source). 

To me, this seems strikingly similar to the seasonal flu both in the groups it affects most severely and the overall symptoms. Based on the data above, I'm going to make a prediction that we are not going to see any significant threat to public health from this infection, especially to anybody under the age of 60.

Obviously, I could be wrong, either in my data or conclusions I draw from it, and I welcome any evidence or discourse that would refute my claims or shed any new light on this situation. But right now I am personally much less worried about this COVID-19 than the next batch of seasonal flu.

Every show I do this year raises money for dog rescue. We're at over $17,000 and climbing!

I am doing this because of how important my dog was to me. Walter traveled with me to 48 states (and 6 provinces), and was my constant companion on the road. So I decided to help save a few more Walters.

We donate 25% of every show and the charities I choose in each city don't know I'm doing this til after I announce it - makes it more fun that way.

(If you are unfamiliar with my comedy, you can [download a free album](http://www.stevehofstetter.com/album.cfm) for a preview, check out [my YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/thehofstetter), or join [my subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/stevehofstetter).

I did what I could to not cancel my shows, but the writing is on the wall, and it's spelled out in hand sanitizer. 

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour today so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to Eugene, Everett, Vancouver, Kelowna, Yakima, Richland, Spokane, Moscow, Couer d'Alene, and Seattle will be getting a refund. I am also offering to send $20 to Eugene Levy, Eugene Merman, and Gene Wilder. I just hate cancelling on Eugene. 

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Seattle already has two more shows scheduled for July 10th). Meanwhile, I will be hosting a few free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.) Mainly Q&amp;As, but maybe I'll invite some friends over and we'll live stream some stand-up. I know we could all use a distraction. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the live stream, and the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see. 

Meanwhile, stay healthy and keep your head up. I mean, it's kind of cool we all get to be in a disaster movie.

The kids are I are out to work and school all week so we are concerned we may have brought something back. We have been rather cautious with hand washing and wiping everything down. 

She lives with me. And I'm not sure what to do at this point besides just keeping an eye on her, checking her temperature every hour or so, gave her fever reducer a little bit ago. I checked her O2 and pulse and shes at 92% O2 level and heart beat at around 90bpm laying down not doing anything. 

I will continue to monitor her and see if her symptom progress negatively or if she gets better. That's all I can do at this point right? I called a nurse hotline but waiting for a call back.

The stock market has tanked and many people have lost 20-30% of their retirement accounts before panic selling them off to greedy opportunists. A huge government bail out for the banking industry is in the works. Meanwhile, local business are suffering, as are service workers everywhere. 

Now, bars and restaurants? Sorry, I'm just done. I look out at people around me and I feel like the entire world has gone nuts.

The owner had said it wouldn’t be an issue, but now we’re about a days drive away from Spokane and with the changes calling for tons of businesses to close... now I don’t have an income until they open up again. My husband had a job lined up once we got there, but again now they’re cutting his hours/might be closing. So basically we have no income and the apartment we lined up to rent out... is asking for proof of income, which we don’t have anymore. I’m aware it’s the dumbest idea to be moving right now, with all that’s happening, but because of said backstory we have no other options and had these jobs lined up way before the coronavirus blew up. We have an air b n b lined up for a few days, but after that we have nowhere to stay and no income.  If anyone could share any resources that might be helpful, or any ideas of how to handle the situation, maybe some places that might be hiring despite the closings, or temporary housing? Anything is appreciated. Thank you",Washington,Help with housing after coronavirus affected my job?

Per [AP NEWS](https://apnews.com/d9dc529076560002238bea1a860db9ff): Joe Biden has been declared the winner of last week’s Democratic presidential primary in Washington state, giving him victories in five out of six states that voted March 10.

After nearly a week of counting votes, the former vice president on Monday held onto a small lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that turned out to be insurmountable.

Washington was a state that Sanders had been hoping to win. In 2016, he won more than two-thirds of the delegates from the Washington caucuses over Hillary Clinton.

Of the state’s 89 pledged delegates, only 31 are allocated based on the statewide result. The remaining 58 are determined based on the results of the state’s 10 congressional districts, and those results might not be calculated until the election is certified by the secretary of state’s office, which could be as late as March 27.

Biden won four other states last Tuesday: Missouri, Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho. Sanders won North Dakota.

In Washington, Democrats used he vote-by-mail presidential primary — moved up this year from May — for the first time to allocate delegates instead of the smaller caucuses used in previous years.

Four states — Arizona, Ohio, Illinois and Florida — are scheduled to hold primaries on Tuesday.",Washington,Joe Biden Wins Washington State Primary 2020

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like this is all part of life 

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now. 

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

Bonus rule

Try to remember the lessons of past. WWII, post 9-11 all the times we've banded together as Americans to face down what will be our biggest enemies during this time which are fear, ignorance and selfishness.

Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

Best Regard,

I'm part of a team of doctors, engineers and experts working together to meet the anticipated demand for medical ventilators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

About Us:

1mventilators.com is a project dedicated to rapidly prototyping, manufacturing and distributing 1 million ventilators. The ideal device will be easy to transport, sanitize, and use in low- and no-power settings. Our design needs to scale to 1M+ devices for &lt; $200/unit and needs to be operable by anyone with &lt; 1 hour of training.

Our Goal:

In less than a week since we posted our 1 Million Ventilators project on HelpWithCovid.com, over 100 professionals have volunteered to help. We have also secured a manufacturing commitment from Liam Casey, founder &amp; CEO of PCH, and a funding commitment from Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. This project was founded by Neil Thanedar, CEO of Labdoor.

How You Can Help:

While our team is donating their time and efforts, we are looking to interview medical field workers in order to gain insights on both device demand and how this pandemic has impacted their lives.

That's when the state might see the highest number of cases, she said, adding that cases and deaths are continuing to rise although not exponentially. 

Testing has increased around the state which Lofy said explains why the number of confirmed cases per day jumped from some 200 to 250 earlier this month to 500 to 600 per day starting late last week. 

More importantly, Lofy said, the proportion of tests that are positive every day has also risen from 6% or 7% to 8% or 9%. \`\`This suggests an increase of the virus in the state,'' she said, emphasizing that people should continue to comply with the stay-home order issued by Gov. Jay Inslee last week.

So I will tell you briefly my situation and just need help whether I'd qualify or if you have any tips on helping my situation.

I am a new RN and entered an emergency department residency the beginning of February (accepted the job in December) long before this stuff kicked off.

Well since then I have been put in dangerous situations that no new nurse should be in, had all of the residency classes canceled and the residency cut short. I had to take nights because that's all that was left.

My mental health has been rapidly deteriorating. I've had anxiety in the past but this is so much worse that I can't even explain it. I knew I was feeling extremely stressed and anxious, but it didn't really hit me until I was speaking to my dad (not even about work) and he expressed being extremely concerned about me because of how I sound saying ""I've never heard you like this"".

I later asked my wife if I have seemed different at all and she said odd that I asked cause she was just talking to her mother about how in the 10 years we have been together she has never seen me liked this. Asking for advice on how to help me.

I'm at work today and my brain feels so foggy that I can't even think straight. I'm making mistakes and I know my preceptor thinks I'm a POS or something..

With how I'm feeling I don't know if it's even safe for me to take care of others. I mean I'm trying to be hyper vigilant due to this but I don't know what else I can do.

OK so that was a lot longer than I meant. I guess I had to vent.

My question is.. Is there anyway to get unemployment if you quit a job due to either safety issues or mental health distress?

I will be applying to other types of nursing (I have worked in other types and not felt this way). I just don't know what my deal is and I can't stay here any more.

Can anyone offer guidance? I was just hoping for unemployment assistance for the month or so it takes me to find a different job.

Anything helps because I'm at a loss and don't know what else to do",Washington,Question about unemployment and eligibility.

 I wonder if anyone could help with this, as the UI department is unreachable? (have about 300 redial attempts in and the callback is scheduled a month out)

  I applied for UI and was given a decision to approve standby beginning on March 24th for the week of the 22nd till April 11. On the 29th one day before I was to get the first week payout there was an entry that the account went into adjudication without comment and the payment went into a ""pending"" state and has not come out of it.

1.  Could this be my employer contesting?

2.  I am homeless and opted for all electronic paperwork could an appeal or request for information come through the mail in spite of this? I am worried I might lose an appeal or request for info simply by not receiving it.

3.  Has anyone else had this experience? 

4. What has your UI experience been so far? Anything helpful?
