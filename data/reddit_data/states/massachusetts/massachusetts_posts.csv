1,KneeAnalog,1577806000,ei481v,Nan,"It is a quiet day at work so I decided to got to the RMV today to get a Real ID--since I'll need it in October 2020. I had all of my documents (despite the confusing lack of consistency on the RMV website--existing MA drivers license, passport, SS card, NGrid bill, and credit card bill).

Where I got tripped up (and there was someone else there who had the same problem) is with the form. It didn't make sense to me on line so I filled it out at the RMV and still did it wrong. 

I checked the Real ID box in the first line and then selected ""replacement"" for question 4. That is where I went wrong. I talked to the counter person who helped me and to the floor supervisor, who happened to be right there, and they agreed that for a Real ID application for an existing license there is no correct answer to question 4. They both called what I was doing an ""amendment"" but that isn't an option. Apparently, they rely on you asking the right questions of the people checking you through at the beginning of the process. I told that person what I was doing but somehow still ended up being handed a replacement drivers license. 

I explained to the person at the counted why I was there and she voided the fee and started over again. The other person I overheard hadn't figured it out and was trying to get the fee voided the next day--and they wouldn't. This was a non-native English speaker which might have been part of the problem. 

The whole thing, including filling out the form and talking to the floor supervisor, took 35 minutes at Haymarket.

TLDR: If you have a valid MA drivers license and want a Real ID leave the type of transaction blank on your application. Make sure they are processing you for a Real ID--for me the first step was a new photo.",massachusetts,RMV Real ID 12/2019 tip

15,Ctown_struggles00,1577940100,eitfmm,Nan,"I will not be promoting the fundraiser here. Please check the comments. 

Here is the context and background for why this legal battle needs to happen: 

&gt;We estimate that there are about 9000 Medicaid circumcisions a year in Massachusetts. The State Medicaid office pays for these elective, non-therapeutic male infant circumcisions as an administrative policy decision. However, the pertinent federal and state regulations require that all Medicaid paid services shall be medically necessary.

&gt;According to Massachusetts law, State officials can be sued to have the court order them to comply with the law. The Circumcision Resource Center is preparing to bring this lawsuit against Massachusetts Medicaid for violating regulations requiring medical necessity. This particular kind of case has not been filed before.

&gt;Obviously, the facts are on our side.

&gt;·         By definition, an elective, non-therapeutic service cannot be medically necessary.

&gt;·         Even if the ""potential medical benefits"" claimed by circumcision advocates were true, they do not satisfy the regulation requirements for medically necessity. 

&gt;·         No organization in the world recommends elective, non-therapeutic male infant circumcision. If it is not recommended, it cannot be medically necessary. 

&gt;·         The large majority of the world avoids circumcision unless it is rarely medically necessary or rarely elected by an adult. Aside from these two factors, a dozen international medical organizations have policies opposing circumcision.

&gt;Since most other state Medicaid offices also violate regulation requirements for medical necessity, this legal case has great potential to make a significant difference in the practice of circumcision in the U.S. and protect millions of future males from this sexually and psychologically harmful practice!  

&gt;(For basic facts about circumcision see https://circumcision.org/male-circumcision-information-summary/ and other links on https://circumcision.org.)

19,CrushedMacaron,1577978297,eizgsi,Nan,"  A few years ago, I was in a camp at Drumlin Farms. One of the days we left the land itself and went for a hike/walk where we ended in a graveyard. 
   The path was wide and continued on after it, it was more like a dirt road than a trail. I remember we crossed a road and a field that had a sign up where the wall had a gap in it and where it connected to the road. We passed a set of oldish swing, we walked through some woods and we crossed a bridge over a small stream. The bridge was fairly sturdy.
   The graveyard itself was small, at the base of a hill and had a low rock wall (like most ones you find) along the road/path. It didn’t have headstones, just plaque like markers like the ones in the Danvers Mental Hospital graveyard. I’m pretty sure it wasn’t that specific graveyard because the area was too small, but I’m not sure. Most of the headstones just had names and dates, but one headstone, for a two year old, had an angel engraved.

2. For anyone from the Worcester area: what are the best and worst parts about the town? 

3. We would most likely rent. Any recommendations for areas that are a bit cheaper? We are not opposed to commutes, and have a dog.

One maps shows all the states and **U.S. House of Representatives** districts with semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  You can turn that data off and turn on other data that shows semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the **U.S. Senators**.  I was surprised to see how many states have senators from different parties.

There is also one map for each state that can show the state legislature lower chamber and upper chamber.  For 15 states, including **Massachusetts**, the maps can display semi-transparent colors based on party affiliation of the person holding the seat.  (I will work on contacting the other states and request they improve their data so I can color their maps.)

All of this political district boundary data is hosted on various government GIS (Geographic Information System) servers.  The maps are displayed by **GISsurfer** which is a general purpose web map I developed.  Each map has a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with general information to help you get the most benefit from the map.

For the maps with semi-transparent fill, an intriguing thing to do is turn on more than one fill overlay.  For example, turn all overlays off then turn on state house fill, congress fill, congress black line.  **You might see that some areas get more blue, some get more red and some areas become purple.**

If you have trouble figuring out how to turns overlay layers on/off and restack them, then please read the **""Map tips""**.

If you want to know exactly where data for a particular map is coming from, then notice that each map link includes an address that points to a txt file.  Copy \*just\* that txt file address, paste it into a browser bar and hit enter.  That file has the addresses for the GIS layers the map can display.

Here is the link to the web page with the political district map links.

It's true. When I was a young kid, I was very strange in the sex department. An awkward late bloomer of sorts, and also half-cuck until I found my footing and really got rolling.

I lost my V-card at 21. And it was to a whore. For 20.00.

I was on vacation with friends. We were in Tijuana, Mexico. It's a filthy place brimming with degeneracy. You'd really have to see it to believe it. The inside joke for the entire trip was to ""get me laid"" which was promised to me by my travel companions. 

We were a tad drunk at the time. Hookers lined the streets everywhere outside of ""hotels"" which were really brothels. My friends told me to pick one out, whichever one I fancied. I did pick one; a cute little taco girl, although it's been so many years that what she looked like exactly is lost.

I didn't really understand what they were doing, but one of our group members who spoke basic Spanish asked for a price. Twenty fucking American dollars for her cunt. They paid her and pointed to ME.

I laughed it off, but they were serious. They had bought me my first screw. Before I could protest, the whore grabbed me by the wrist and dragged me inside and upstairs to one of the ""hotel rooms"" as she nodded to the dude behind the counter.

The room was dark. Grimey. It smelled stale like fried food. There was no furniture. It was just a mattress up on cinder blocks. The only light in the room was a single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling by it's bare cord.

She took her panties off and started pulling my pants down. I tried to tell her that this was my first time and that I was nervous, but she couldn't understand. She didn't even speak English. She just asked ""Espanol?!"" and handed me a condom.

I fumbled through it, and fucked her hairy hole reluctantly. She gave me a kiss on the cheek, and headed back outside to look for her next customer.

Virginity gone. Was that it? This is where I Iost it?

Growing up I had always heard that sex was something special between 2 people who loved each other, which was a concept I kind of struggled to understand. I felt dirty but couldn't pinpoint why.

Celebration for the sacrifice of my virginity ensued amongst my friends. It was a done deal.

I have some regret. I still don't know why. It just felt like something I shouldn't have done. 

The bad part is that the episode launched a cycle for the rest of my adult life. I would never go on to look for a real girlfriend or care about relationships. I already discovered how to get the payoff. I just continued on with whores and random hookups, that becoming the only way I functioned. Mountains of prostitutes and strippers I'd stick my dick in. Countless. Over 30+ by my estimation.

What would have happened had I not felt socially obligated to give up my virginity in such a way or not felt too awkward to decline? Would I have been a different person? Would I have folllwed an alternate trajectory? Maybe there is an alternative universe somewhere in which I said ""no."" I wonder how he's doing?

I can't know.",massachusetts,"I lost my virginity to a Mexican hooker, in Mexico, for 20.00. Some Regret."

I've noticed that people tend to self-segregate by class/race. I think some of the instability in this country is because we're not trying to understand one another and talk to one another. People are accusing others (sometimes, rightly so) of not understanding their needs and being out-of-touch. I don't want to be that person. For example, during the 2016 election, I didn't really understand why people would vote for Trump but then it hit me after that segments of working class didn't feel like it had a voice except through Trump (Obama to Trump voters). \*Of course I know that there are people who are racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. who voted for him but I don't think that represents every Trump voter.\* 

So I'm not saying we need to be instant friends (but a friendship could come out of it, who knows?) but I want to break my bubble and understand your side more. I don't care what race you are and you don't have to be a Trump voter/we don't have to talk about politics. You can message me through here or meet me in person. NO FLIRTING.

My dad is an immigrant from China. There are sometimes language and cultural barriers so I have been helping him with a case that has been bogging us down for over 4 years.

In 2015 my dad and I were pulled over on I-81 for going 81 in a 70 zone. He claims that we weren't going over 80 but that is irrelevant now. As many of you know, going over 80 in Virginia is considered a misdemeanor and could result in a jail sentence of up to 11 years: [https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#points\_6.asp](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#points_6.asp)

We didn't joke around and hired a lawyer to get the charges reduced to improper control/driving. We ended up paying \~2k for the court and the fines. Picture of the public records show: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/P1LC1bB6KoGPa6LQ8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/P1LC1bB6KoGPa6LQ8)

Essentially, Massachusetts suspended my dad's license based on an incorrect charge from over 4 years ago. Looks like Virginia made a mistake and send out an offense that should have been reduced.

323,ChristianFreedom_33,1581349136,f1s081,Nan,"It has come to my attention that ICE is attempting to deport a man named Darcy McMenamin, an Irish immigrant. There does not seem to be any record of him having a violent history in the United States. An article from the Irish Post says that he came ""to the attention of ICE after falling foul of a number of traffic offences,"" not violent offenses. The article also says he already served time in prison in Northern Ireland for any violent thing he did. Regardless of what this man did in his past, deportation does not seem to be the answer. Northern Ireland is getting very tense again due to Brexit, and the animosity between the different communities there is starting to heighten. Another Irish immigrant, who lives in the New York/New Jersey area and who was also involved in the Irish Republican movement, Malachy McCalister, fears that if he is deported, he could face violent retribution from pro-British loyalists, who attacked his house in Belfast before he came to the US. That same thing could potentially happen to McMenamin, given his Irish Republican past. I am also not sure if McMenamin has kids, because if he does, this could be a continuation of Trump's draconian family-separation policy if McMenamin is deported. I was wondering, have there been any protests surrounding McMenamin's detainment and potential deportation? Have there been any federal court hearings? I believe America is a place where people should be able to start a new life, and I believe America should be a refuge for oppressed peoples. If this man violated Massachusetts state laws, let him be charged in state court for those offenses. We shouldn't potentially ruin his life and his family's life (if he has one), and deport him. What do you all think?

Over the last 10 years, UMass Amherst has invested billions of taxpayer dollars in new, state of the art facilities, that can and will hold world class researchers. Providing regional rail to Springfield would spur this growth and make it possible for people who want to work for the university to retain a foothold in the city as well. It would also retain a vibrant a viable local consumer for all of western mass’s amazing artists and artisans who rely on people with disposable income to buy their products. 

The median age of university professionals is increasing each year, and in my own office we have had over a half dozen retirements in just 2 years. These positions would make a fine beginning to many young professional’s careers. But, younger people are not taking these jobs. I would, but my fiance works in Boston, so they will not get me. Instead we have lived in Palmer. She does an Airbnb each week. This weekend we will sign a lease and I will finish out my time at school in Airbnb situations. 

Many of us who come out here to work and go to school at UMass, especially for grad school, are in our late twenties or early 30's. We have families and they cannot always find good jobs in this economically depressed region. You guys have kept all the growth post recession confined to the metro area.

At the public hearing earlier this week, many came from Boston who are in their early 30's. They want to leave. They took the afternoon off to come and say it. They do not want to pay 800k for a condo in Southie. They would rather push out into the middle of the state. But they can't, because the commute would be hellacious.

The more ambitious proposed regional rail lines would spur growth along a corridor that would result in a more spatially equitable distribution of opportunity along the east / west corridor and by extension, the entire state. The least ambitious would only band aid the situation and not provide the kind of connection required. There are good options in the $10-15 billion range that the committee needs to explore by combining the best parts of each of the 6 proposals during the next phase of the study. For example, Option 6 could be used between Springfield and Boston, with option 4 extending out into the Berkshires. Option 4 could also be combined with option 5. 

The committee has found some interesting tools that could be used to solve this problem. The question is if the public is willing to spend the money to more equitably distribute opportunity across the state.",massachusetts,The State of MA Needs a Smart East/West Rail Plan

So the way I see it I have two options:
1. Fly 6 hours back to California just to brave the 9th circle of hell that is their DMV, only to fly 6 hours back

Or

2. Get a Mass License

I’m hoping for #2. 

Documents I currently have at my disposal are:
1. My passport
2. My social security card
3. A scan of my lost CA drivers license 
4. A physical, albeit expired, California ID
5. My Real Estate Board License
6. Lease, utility bills, etc. 

I don’t see why Mass can’t just look at my passport and other documentation, confirm the DL number with California, and then go through the standard switch as if I physically had it. But from everything I can tell, not having that single piece of plastic is holding me back. 

Do I have any options other than starting over as if I were never licensed? That seems like such a pain over a piece of plastic I probably left behind while ordering a mojito at Cheesecake Factory or something. 

Also-if I did have to start over-would I need to get a learners permit as an adult? In California it’s only if you’re under 18 but the Mass RMV website isn’t making a distinction that I see.

So I'm located in Agawam and was recently accepted for MassHealth CarePlus. I have quite a few options based on my zip code as far as plans go...ten to be exact. Needless to say, I'm a bit overwhelmed. I've reviewed the guides on ""how to choose a health plan"" and even compared each plan to one another on masshealthchoices, checked out each provider's website separately, and searched the internet all over, but I'm still stumped on what to pick. I have (somewhat) narrowed it down to two options: BeHealthy Partnership (ACO) or BMC HealthNet Plan - Mercy Alliance (ACO).

Has anyone had experience with either? I am a healthy adult female, no past medical complications or history of disease, no surgeries or hospital stays. My primary concern is to have access to a good behavioral health specialist/therapist (speculate I'm undiagnosed ADHD &amp; have other psychological needs). Having acupuncture and chiropractic specialists would be a plus. With MassHealth CarePlus I will not have any premiums, so it's not a factor in making my decision. I was previously on my father's health insurance from my home state in NY until 6 months ago (when I turned 26), and have not seen any doctors out here in MA. I would often travel to NY to see my primary care physician and OBGYN when I was still on his plan. So having a doctor I want to stick with and making sure they are in the network is also not a factor.

Here are the other options that were presented to me, in case I am narrowing down to the wrong two (or if some of the others are potentially better for me, in particular):

\~ BMC HealthNet Plan (MCO)  
\~ BMC HealthNet Plan Community Alliance (ACO)  
\~ Community Care Cooperative (C3) (Primary Care ACO)  
\~ Partners HealthCare Choice (Primary Care ACO)  
\~ Primary Care Clinician Plan (PCC)  
\~ Steward Health Choice (Primary Care ACO)  
\~ Tufts Health Together (MCO) - \*not sure how this applies since I'm in Western MA...?  
\~ Tufts Health Together with Boston Children's (ACO) - \*again, not sure how this applies to me

I am fairly new to this insurance thing since I've been covered through my father's employer for the duration of my life. Idk if I'm just making things complicated and really all of these could be a good choice for me, an overall healthy individual with no special needs.

Any advice or experience would be greatly appreciated!",massachusetts,Choosing a MassHealth Plan...help!

I work about 30-35 hours a week at my job (at minimum, of course), so I believe live below the poverty line (but I am not homeless). I don’t have any disabilities or conditions either.

I actually didn’t care to have health insurance for the past several years since I left my parents, but now I’m looking to get my life back on track and live a healthy lifestyle and I believe the first step to doing that is to get health and dental insurance. I’ve had a few people tell me I could be eligible for MassHealth, but I’m not sure how to go about getting it.

Sure enough I get a letter today informing me I still owe next month's (March's) premium, and if I don't pay my plan will be terminated retroactively effective at the end of February. The Health Connector site says my plan is already cancelled but I still owe money for March. 

1) Is this normal? I know the site itself is a complete joke of broken links, incorrect and missing info, and overall the worst website ever made. So It would not surprise me that the system somehow thinks I owe money on a cancelled plan.

Last fall I quit my job due to mental health reasons. I was depressed and could not focus on my work, and having thoughts of self-harm. At the time I was seeing a therapist but I never went to a doctor or was officially diagnosed. I was upfront and honest with my employer about why I was quitting, and put in my two weeks the same day I told the CEO how I was feeling. The reason I was ok with this is because I had savings built up to hold me over. 

I am now feeling better (!!!) and have been on the job hunt for 2+ months now. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find work. I am thinking of applying for unemployment but unsure if I would qualify. Does anyone have experience applying for unemployment after quitting your job due to mental health reasons?? Again, I was never officially diagnosed. I'm getting very stressed out financially and these benefits would go a long way mitigating that. 

TL;DR: I quit my job last fall for mental health reasons but was never officially diagnosed. I am feeling better now and have been on the job hunt for two months but nothing. Can I apply and qualify for unemployment, and if so, what's the best approach?

&amp;#x200B;

**March 12, 2020**

**Dear families,** 

**Since our communication yesterday, we have seen a significant shift in the coronavirus outbreak. We spoke this morning with our local health department officials and at this time, we still do not have any presumptive or confirmed cases in Acton or Boxborough.  However, in the last 24 hours, we have seen an increase in secondary and tertiary contacts reporting possible contact with an individual who may have been tested for the virus. Therefore, we have decided to take proactive measures to slow the rapid spread of the virus.**  

**We have made the decision to close all Acton-Boxborough Regional Schools starting tomorrow, March 13th.  Schools will remain closed through Friday, March 20th. It is important for families to understand that this is an initial determination, and as we monitor the outbreak next week, it is likely that this may lead to a longer closure.  This closure applies to all schools, including students who are attending out-of-district schools, extra-curricular activities, extended day before/after school care, athletics, clubs, and building use.**  

**Closing our schools are only a part of the broader solution to prevent community spread of this virus.  If students and families continue to meet together in groups outside of school, this initial 6-day closure will not have the desired impact.  It is critical that students and families refrain from meeting in large groups and to practice social distancing as recommended by the CDC.**  

**We will continue to closely monitor this situation and follow the guidance of our local boards of health, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH), and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE).  We will make a decision about whether we need to extend the March 13th-March 20th closure for a longer period of time no later than Friday, March 20th, and we will communicate that to families as soon as possible. Regardless of the length of our district closure, DESE has determined that the last day of school for ABRSD this year will be Tuesday, June 23rd, the 185th day scheduled on our District calendar.**

**While we are closed 3/13-3/20/2020:**

* **Our educators will meet tomorrow to develop lessons and activities that students can access from home both with and without devices.**
* **Our custodial staff will be cleaning and disinfecting all schools.**

### The following message is from Dr. Conti

Dear Burlington Public School Community:

As we await further guidance from State health officials, area superintendents have collaborated to make a timely and unified decision about school closure. The following districts have agreed to a two-week school closure starting tomorrow Friday, March 13th: Arlington, Bedford, Belmont, Burlington, Lexington, Woburn, and Winchester, while other districts in our area are working out the details.

Our decision has been informed by our local boards of health and by expert epidemiologists who recognize that the time to act is now. We know we can have a greater and more positive impact on public health and safety if we make these difficult decisions together.    

Many in our area have been particularly impacted due to our families who have a greater number of presumptive positive cases in the area.  Please be aware that this school closure period of time may be extended or shortened should State authorities so direct. We realize the decisions we are making in our geographic region do not necessarily reflect the needs and decisions of our counterparts in other areas of the State.  

We do this out of an abundance of caution, particularly out of sensitivity to families and staff who have underlying conditions that make them more vulnerable to complications should they become infected.  We also do not do this lightly, as we know that this will impose a hardship on families who do not have childcare options.

More details will be available shortly. Thank you for your understanding during this challenging time.

Sincerely,",massachusetts,Multiple school closures in Middlesex county

It's good to take measures and be prepared, it's not good to give into fear and panic.

1. Wipe down phones, tablets, door knobs, light switches, counters, and any other heavily touched surfaces

2. Remove items that you purchase or have delivered to you from their boxes with gloves and dispose of the boxes as soon as possible

3. Wear disposable gloves when you go to the grocery store, on public transit, and in any public areas where you will be touching things that have been touched by others. If you don't have disposable gloves use a pair of winter gloves and wash them

4. Wear a mask if you go out anywhere in public if there's even a remote chance you might be sick to protect others

5. Purchase enough water, food, medications and any other items you think you will need for yourself and your family members for 2-3 weeks. do your best to leave some supplies for others, use your best discretion. Buy only what you think you will need, but definitely get what you think you will need. Purchase items online if possible and if you can wait for them to arrive. 

6. Limit your visits to public places where you will come into contact with others (including stores) to the greatest extent possible. 

7. Try to stay at least 3-5 feet (more if possible) from others in public areas

8. Wash or wipe down reusable grocery bags and throw out any plastic bags you had items in as soon as possible

9. Wash hands as soon as possible if you are touching uncleaned surfaces which includes food packaging and other items handled or touched by others recently. Avoid touching your face as much as possible. 

10. If you run out of disinfecting wipes or don't have any you can mix 1 cup of beach with 1 gallon of water to make a disinfectant. You can also make hand sanitizer if you don't have any by mixing 1/4 cup of aloe Vera gel with 3/4 cup of rubbing alcohol. 

11. If someone around you is coughing or sneezing without covering their mouth move as far away from them as you can. 

12. Take any other measures you feel are necessary to protect your health and your family's health. This includes not going to work or telecommuting if possible, cancelling vacations to some areas, and limiting other activities. 

All of these measures should be taken as much as possible, although if you can't afford or can't find a certain item or can't complete a certain task it's okay. People are going to help each other.

This  of course raises the question:  did we get hit with the coronavirus?   Since we're young, and a positive diagnosis wouldn't change management,  we haven't had access to tests.

Dianne - Shows up to work in DIY hazmat suit made of puff blouses, yellow rubber kitchen gloves, spray bottle of unknown liquid. Full out panic frantic babbling, there is no more toilet paper at the store.

She refuses to let Dianne have any, even when Dianne pretends to suck up to her. Openly carrying a hand gun she bought in NH. Is wearing cute mini handgranade earrings.

Cliff - Full conspiracy mode, Russia is responsible. Insists he knows about the history of influenza and compares it to the knowledge of the coronavirus. Insists its not a big deal and it will blow over in a few days. Keeps telling anicdotes about the Spanish flu and how his family has a strong constitution and survived the Black Plague. Alludes that mail carriers are the real heroes for continuing to deliver the mail.

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets.

With people squatting in my homes and no income, I will have no choice but to start the eviction process on these people. It’s sad, but again, this is no different than a mom and pop shop calling the police on someone for shoplifting.

3. Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

4. Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.


5. Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 8 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.


6.  Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.


7. Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now. 


8. Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.


9. Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.


10. Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

Many of the comments on these posts criticise a possible shelter in place because panic shopping would increase and people would not be able to leave their house for essential items.

A shelter in place does not close supermarkets or restaurants (that has already been dealt with by the measures that have been taken). What it would close are retail stores that sell non necessary items. Examples of this are retail stores like Gamestop, Claires, Christmas tree shops, etc.  The employees of many unessential retail stores are being forced to work. The only way most corporations will close their stores is if they are forced to by a shelter in place. In many of these situations employees do not even have access to full precautions to prevent virus transmission.

There seems to be a lot of ignorance going around about the virus and how it's transmitted. Estimates are that at least 50% of those infected do not show symptoms.  Is it worth retail employees transmitting the virus for weeks because a big corporation doesnt want to lose sales?

tl;dr: I need to find a way to get 2 facemasks that I have in Boston to my grandparents in Florida. PM me if willing/able to help!

My grandparents are flying back from Florida to Boston on Saturday. We delayed their flight for a week so that the N95 facemasks from cambridge mask co that we ordered for them could arrive at their place on time, after multiple delays. I honestly thought I was overpreparing and ordered them over a month ago, on amazon prime with 2 day shipping...also ordered 2 for myself and spouse. We recieved ours several days ago, their shipment however has now been indefinitely delayed...the irony is not lost on me. 

My grandfather, whom I love dearly is extremely frail (though too proud and brave to admit it) and would likely not survive if he where to fall ill. Staying there is a non-option, there is no family in the state. And even if that was the safest option (though rates of infection and Florida's response lead me to believe otherwise) the stubborn man would absolutely refuse, and fly home regardless. 

THIS IS WHERE YOUR HELP COMES IN! Please PM me if flying tomorrow and willing to help. 

I am hoping to find someone willing to deliver the facemasks we received, located in boston to my grandparents in florida so that they can safely fly home on Saturday. If you happen to be flying from Logan to Ft.lauderdale tomorrow and wouldn't mind making a pitstop in Hollywood, I would be willing to reimburse any reasonably requested price for helping! 

PS am willing to meet at Logan tomorrow at any time and place that is convenient for you. I will open the facemask containers and show you the masks (so no fears of anything sketchy) and will then box them up. They live in a gated apartment building. Package can be dropped off at front desk and they will make sure my grandparents receive it.

If any parents, or any citizens of Massachusetts in general are interested, I'm very serious about organizing a protest about these school closings.

Whether we agree with it or not, school is the foundation of society. Both for educational purposes, but also because parents have become accustomed to working while the kids are in school.

This isn't the 1950s. Generally both parents work. And in many cases, theres only one parent to begin with.

Parents are expected to school their children from home while working from home. How does that work? How does special needs education work? My daughters autistic and I'm not a certified ABA therapist. Theres kids out there who live in dangerous environments, and have no school to keep them safe and grounded.

Parents are going to lose their jobs. Then their homes. 

Don't forget, last year if your child didn't reach a certain standard they would be held back a grade. This year those standards dissapeared. And none of that is within our control.

It's only a couple of months, but a couple of months is an eternity for children. Especially special needs children. And it only takes a few days of mishaps to lose a job if you:

A) Cant go into work because the kids are home

Or

B) cant effectively work from home because the kids are home.

I don't blame the schools, I blame the governor.  My kids school wanted to reopen soon. However, teachers and administrators are still being paid. The union will take care of them. Yet they arent providing a service. Again, I don't necessarily blame the schools because this was thrust upon them but our tax dollars are going nowhere.

The goal is to SLOW the spread as not to overwhelm hospital resources. The goal is NOT to stop the virus in its tracks.

It's time we roll out school reopenings, perhaps in a teired order by region. At the very least, an alternative option to school must be provided. And no, Skype sessions is not a proper alternative. Special education in particular is required, and our Autistic sons and daughters need their ABA therapy and socialization practice.

15 deaths. Is societal collapse worth 15 deaths? 50? 100? Theres 7,000,000 people in our state. 

It's time we use our voices to demand our government provide a viable plan in regard to school going forward. And it's time we put our heads together to make a plan of action so kids from bad families still have a safe haven, so special needs kids don't regress, so parents can work and pay their bills.

If you're interested in protesting with me in Boston send me a DM.",massachusetts,I'm asking for your help

The following really applies to any “essential” work or worker.  That 14 yr old girl checking you out of the grocery store and the Haitian nurse assistant helping you go the bathroom after a life alternating injury. 

Construction is a privilege we provide the state and the people at our discretion, at our convenience, at our mental and physical expense and our good graces.  Baker does not have a right to our bodies. You don’t have a right to sleep in a $2000 condo that won’t be ready a year from now.... at my expense. But I’ll show up and do my best if others do their part. 

THAT IS NOT HAPPENING

Those not in construction will not understand what it’s really like. What the people are like in it. What foreman and project managers are like. What that moment in time is like when you compromise yourself and what you said you would do, because you don’t have the free will you think you do.  you don’t speak up because it’s your job, status, and role on the line. Because retaliation is very real; even if it’s not this specific time.

Shared company equipment. 20 identical ladders that move around like musical chairs. 12 guys in a hall. What little safety inspections that use to happen for hard hats (at most) is now missing. Like missing as in oddly, as in none in two weeks, as in not coincidental. Guys who think it’s a government conspiracy. 

No access to any relevant ppe and the inability to buy it yourself. Guidelines that mean nothing until it’s too real or too late. Well, it’s too late now, for me at least. 

Maybe you can relate in a way. Corporate safety/HR training and the dissonance between what is pencil whipped and  what is reality. What you think you’ll do, what you think it will look like when it arrives at your doorstep. You’re in for a sour surprise.

Now that the CARES Act provides an additional $600/week for unemployment recipients, are people like me screwed? Under normal circumstances, I’m not eligible for partial unemployment.  My 30 hours pays more than I would receive from UI if I’d been laid off. And that would mean people in that boat get to work and not receive that $600 per week. Am I right?

To make this more disturbing, I work in healthcare. And workers can now leave their jobs due to the risk of COVID-19 exposure and receive the aforementioned benefits.

Massachusetts is one of the few states who still have a chance at containing the Coronavirus pandemic. I believe if we take drastic measures now by shutting off all interstate travel, we can evade much of the chaos that has ensued in places such as New York City. The situation has become so dire in that city, that many of it’s residents have fled up to the Berkshires, Cape Cod, and Boston itself. This is absolutely unacceptable. Coronavirus can take up to two weeks before it starts manifesting itself in actual symptoms. Those Manhattanites may think they’re perfectly healthy but are still at risk of being a carrier and spreading the disease over the border and infecting our residents. Governor Baker has issued a strong travel and self quarantine advisory towards those crossing into Massachusetts from out of state, but this is not currently enforceable. We simply do not have the emergency resources to actively police this. It would require stop and frisk measures for those with New York Plates, a database of those who have crossed the border within the past 14 days, and furthermore you would have to checkup on these people daily to make sure they’re not leaving their home disobeying the self quarantine order. The alternative, would be a mandate banning all interstate travel to and from Massachusetts, with the exception of those traveling for work. This will allow us to test all of our residents, get an accurate picture of the disease, and gain some much needed breathing room in the fight against this pandemic. Our hospitals will be able to  retool and gain the necessary equipment and manpower needed to treat those afflicted with this terrible disease. If we don’t act now, we run the risk of our hospitals being overrun, reaching critical mass resulting in even more death, and those with other health conditions unable to be treated. If we act now however,  we can flatten the bell curve, and ultimately come out Victorious against this terrible sickness. So please Governor Baker/ Massachusetts State Government. take heed to our request. SAVE OUR STATE.",massachusetts,Petition to close Massachusetts State Borders/Ban interstate travel

I was pretty positive when I started looking but now I don't know what to do anymore. I was offered a job at a Lowe's 2 weeks ago and did a drug test and background check, then the next day hysteria happened and the whole state was shutting down and I contacted the HR person there and all I got from them was a ""things are screwy right now, we don't know what's happening"" type answer. Interestingly enough the other day I got an email saying the background check was finished and sent back to the store. Been calling the store and the phone just rings and rings since last week. I may end up going in person, though I don't know if that will do any good. It would suck if they had to pay money for me to do that drug test and background check all for me to not get hired after all because of what's happening. 

I'm freaking out about paying bills and such without a job and how I'm going to make it. I rent a room from somebody. I'm an experienced warehouse worker, if it matters.

Problem is all the warehouse jobs I see are through sketchy temp agencies that I hear bad things about all the time, or the job is ""temp to perm"" as they call it, which I'm not too fond of.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

Best Regard,

1035,NewEnglandHappierMan,1585655911,fsbnbc,Nan,"Hey Vsauce, Michael here, and skeletons are scary and spooky, but you know what else is? Blacks. 

According to the U.S Justice Department, in 2006, 32,443 women of Caucasian origin were raped by men of African origin. That same year, the number of African American women raped by Caucasian men.. was.. zero. 

In fact, 90% of all interracial crimes in the U.S. are committed by blacks... against whites.. So what if all blacks were to... suddenly... disappear from the U.S.? Murder would go down 49.7 percent, welfare recipients would go down 40 percent, SAT scores would go up about 100 points, the average IQ would go up 7 points, and AIDS victims would go down a staggering... 67... percent. Significant changes for race that only makes up 13% of the population. 

In biology, races are distinct genetically divergent populations ""within the same species"", with relatively small morphological and genetic.. differences. Populations can be described as ecological races if they arise from adaptation to different local habitats or geographic races when they are geographically isolated. However, if sufficiently different, two or more races can be identified as... sub... species. So how long do two races have to be isolated from one another before they're considered separate species? Earlier this year, Archaeologists found artefacts in a cave on Western Australia's Barrow Island dating back more than 50,000 years, making it Australia's earliest known site of human occupation. In contrast, the domestication of the dog began just 15,000... years... ago. This distance, some several thousand miles between the mainlands of Australia and Asia also caused another kind of distance. Genetic... distance. 

Genetic distance is a measure of the genetic divergence between species or between populations within a species. Dogs and wolves have been found to have a shorter genetic distance between each other than Negroids and non-Negroids. The distance between Eurasians and Africans being even larger than Homo Sapiens and Homo... Erectus. Well, it kinda makes sense. I mean, can two races with diverging skin tones, eye colors, behavioral patterns, intellectual and athletic capabilities even be considered the same subspecies? Is it even a question? Is it even a question you're... allowed to... ask? In October 2007, geneticist James Watson, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and the familiar double-helix model we all had to leam in High School, was lambasted by the scientific community for a response he gave in an interview regarding the divergence of intellect between geographically isolated populations. ""There is no fim reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically,"" James wrote. ""Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so"". 

The response resulted with a suspension of Watson's administrative responsibilities and was forced to... cancel.. his book tour. And tragically, in 2014, Mr Watson auctioned his Nobel Prize medal he won in 1962, stating that ""no-one really wants to admit I exist"". Harsh. 

But people tend to react this way to ideas that go against their own personal world view and... cognitive.. biases. Confirmation bias. It's the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one's. own. preconceptions. This effect, stronger for emotionally charged issues, warps your interpretation of data in a way that keeps you from... being... wrong. There is something fundamental in our minds that makes us hesitant to question ideas that we've... already come to a conclusion to. We all do it. But who could blame us? That's just part of being a member of the human... species. 

And as always, around blacks, never relax.",massachusetts,Massachusetts life

I will try to add more Q&amp;A directly to the post as they come in. I am in no way associated with or acting as a Massachusetts official, I am only trying to help.

&amp;#x200B;

* Where can I apply for unemployment benefits? You can apply for benefits and find general information at [www.mass.gov/dua](https://www.mass.gov/dua)
* What kind of employee am I? If you receive a weekly check with taxes taken out and receive benefits such as health insurance you are almost always a W2 employee. If you receive checks without taxes taken out and don't receive benefits you are almost always a 1099 employee. If you receive an envelope full of cash and don't claim it at tax time, you work under the table.
* I applied last week and still haven't gotten paid, whats up with that? If you signed up for direct deposit it can take up to 9 business days for DUA to verify your bank account. Possibly even longer if your bank is running short staffed.
* Where is my extra $600??? Currently any information about the CARES act is scarce. Basically the state has no guidance from the federal government, who is supplying the funds for it. DUA has just as much information on it as you do.
* I heard self-employed people can get unemployment now, is this true and how? Yes and no. The CARES act does add self-employed and gig economy workers to unemployment benefits, BUT currently any information about the CARES act is scarce. Basically the state has no guidance from the federal government on how these people should apply or the criteria for it.
* When will we know more about the CARES act benefits? This is difficult to say, no real information on a timeline has been released. Hopefully we will have updated information by 4/3/20.
* I'm self-employed/gig/whatever else is covered under CARES act and I already applied, what do I do now? Well the current advice from Governor Baker is to not apply as there is no way for you to actually apply correctly. If you already did, 99.9% chance it gets denied, but Baker did not say you wouldn't be able to reapply when the system updates. He advised that you would delay others from receiving benefits and left it at that.
* Hey I have this specific question that is not covered here, how should I ask? You should state your issue, question, and general information such as type of employee, how you answered DUA questionnaire, or anything you think might be helpful. DO NOT give private information such as first and last name or social security number we are NOT the DUA.

1050,throwaway19828727272,1585684697,fsk0vk,Nan,"Was wondering if anyone here could tell me if I am still eligible for benefits.

Basically had 2 jobs last year. Quit my initial job  (had for 2 years) in March because I found the second job. Ended up quitting my second job in the summer because it was different than what was in my job offer and it was difficult to commute to. I applied for unemployment when I quit the second job  but  I guess when I inputted both jobs into the unemployment site, it made it so that I was claiming unemployment from both (only was really claiming from the second job). 

Anyways, so I get approved for unemployment from both jobs (said eligible under both ""claims"") and everything was fine and dandy until the first job appealed the claim. I assumed that I would still be eligible for benefits from the second job since that was my most recent job but long story short, by default of not showing up to one of the appeal meetings, my case was reversed for the first job. When I claimed benefits for the next week, it said ""disqualified non monetary"". At that point I just stopped claiming the weeks and I didn't bother to call the office to see if maybe it was a glitch that it wasn't recognizing that I was still eligible for unemployment from the second job. 

Sorry for the long post, but my question is, I haven't had a job since and decided to log back into the site and check and my determination for the second, most recent, job is still ""eligible"" and my monetary determination is still ""active"" with a ""benefit year end date"" of 5/30/2020 . Does this mean that if I reopen the claim and call them, I am still eligible for benefits? Is it possible that I was eligible for benefits this whole time under the claim from the second job?",massachusetts,Specific questions about my unemployment claim

I work for a pet salon in a popular corporate pet store. Pet stores have been deemed essential due to pet food. But as for the salon, whether that's essential or not has been a debate. Most private salons have closed and PetSmart salons closed but my corporate place doesn't want to. I guess yesterday we were told by the state we have no choice but to close the salons. 

So they gave the salon workers these options: go on leave or work in a store. If we work in the store, we would be taking a pay cut due to no comission. (W2 employees but we can still work for 50% comission). And we might not even be allowed to work in OUR store. The store can transfer us to other stores adding ~30 miles to the commute without paying us mileage. 

I was told because we have these options we are not eligible for unemployment. Our job is gone but we have the CHOICE to work in a store or go on leave. Everyone on leave is still waiting for corporate to contact us as whether they will pay us a week for leave or not. They said it goes by individual case whether you can get 1 paid week or not. They are so far behind people have been on leave for a week without corporate reaching out to them and HR is no longer contactable (they shut down the phone line). 

To put it bluntly, are us salon workers eligible for unemployment or not? I'm being told no but if they are offering us unpaid leave or a lower paying position while our job is GONE, how are we not eligible? 

Sorry if this question isnt fitting here. Is r/legaladvice a better place for this? Thank you.",massachusetts,Unemployment or not?

Factors I’m considering in my decision;

1/ Cost: I haven’t done a huge amount of research outside of real estate, where I didn’t notice a major difference between both cities, maybe Worcester being slightly more expensive, but I could be wrong.

2/ Economic climate: Current events aside, it’s tough to qualify what either would be like to do business in. One of the reasons these are the locations is because of population with the expense of Boston, but thoughts would be appreciated, is one known to be an economic hub or a economic disaster compared to the other?

3/ Crime: What are these cities like to live in in general and is one considered more dangerous than the other.

4/ Fun: Is one just better to live in? Has better night life, more things to do or is just aesthetically a much nicer place to live?

&amp;#x200B;

""The experts who advised everyone to wear a mask now say a statewide stay-at-home advisory is not enough — Baker needs to do more to stop the spread of COVID-19.""

**By Shan Soe-Lin and Robert Hecht** 

&amp;#x200B;

Governor Charlie Baker is taking many of the right steps to slow the spread of COVID-19 across the Commonwealth, even as the pandemic threatens to overwhelm our hospital emergency rooms and ICUs. Baker issued a [stay at home advisory](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/31/nation/coronavirus-boston-massachusetts-march-31/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) in March and later extended it to May 4, he closed many non-essential businesses, urged people to maintain social distancing and wash hands frequently, and expanded testing. 

As public health professionals, however, we implore the governor to do more, and do it right away, to block the further spread of COVID-19 in our community. We can’t afford to wait another day for tough federal guidance, which has been too slow in coming.

 

There are five things that Baker needs to do immediately:

**Issue a stay-at-home order, not an advisory**

Asking nicely has not been enough. It’s time for our state and city officials to lead and direct people on what to do.

When Baker issued the statewide [stay-at-home advisory](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/23/metro/coronavirus-latest-updates/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) on March 23, he said, “I do not believe I can or should order US citizens to keep confined to their homes for days on end. It doesn’t make sense from a public health point of view, and it’s not realistic.” Yet here we are in April and there are still too many Massachusetts residents who are failing to maintain social — read, *physical* — distance and are continuing to congregate and socialize, and non-essential businesses that are still operating. Every unnecessary social interaction increases transmission of the coronavirus, adding to the delay in resuming normal life and costing lives. Pickup basketball games are [ongoing](https://www.enterprisenews.com/photogallery/WL/20200402/NEWS/402009977/PH/1), forcing officials in cities like [Boston](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2020/03/29/marty-walsh-boston-parks-coronavirus) and [Newton](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/31/metro/newton-closes-city-tennis-basketball-courts-help-combat-coronavirus-spread/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) to attach barriers to block the hoops. Vehicle traffic to the Plug Pond recreational area in Haverhill had to be closed after fishermen were found [congregating](https://www.eagletribune.com/news/fisherman-violating-social-distancing-rule-are-ordered-away-from-haverhills-plug-pond/article_be031612-7505-11ea-a877-33d99352cbd0.html) at the pond in large numbers. There have been reports of soccer games and other gatherings on [BOS:311](https://mayors24.cityofboston.gov/reports/101003244754). 

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Enforce the stay-at-home order**

Although [data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-social-distancing.html) show that travel has fallen significantly in Massachusetts, there are still many residents who congregate and non-essential businesses that [keep operating](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/24/business/baker-wants-construction-work-continue-despite-coronavirus/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) in contravention to the current advisory. Armed with the stronger stay at home order, Baker and local mayors should deploy police and the Army National Guard to patrol recreational areas and break up groups, and close businesses that should not be operating. They should set up dedicated coronavirus tip lines, which are now being used in [Canada](https://london.ctvnews.ca/complaints-pour-into-covid-19-tip-line-city-hall-responds-by-phone-1.4878259), to report on people and businesses not complying with the state’s orders.

Fines should be levied on violators, as is happening in New York City where [Mayor Bill De Blasio](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/03/29/new-yorkers-who-break-social-distancing-rules-will-now-face-fines-up-to-500-1269545) has authorized police to hand out $500 fines to people who “haven’t gotten the message.” Let’s do the same in Massachusetts. The money collected can go to a COVID-19 response fund.

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Implement a universal mask policy for Massachusetts**

As [we advised in mid-March](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/19/opinion/guidance-against-wearing-masks-coronavirus-is-wrong-you-should-cover-your-face/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), you should cover your face to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The White House and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued a long overdue [recommendation in favor of cloth mask use by the general public](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/03/nation/cdc-recommend-americans-cover-faces-when-outside-trump-calls-it-voluntary/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link). Baker can go further in implementing this federal guidance by personally promoting the use of non-surgical masks. Los Angeles [Mayor Eric Garcetti called on his city’s 4 million residents](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-01/garcetti-urges-l-a-to-wear-face-coverings-when-shopping-doing-essential-tasks) on Wednesday to don non-surgical masks, and Garcetti led by example by wearing a mask to his own televised briefing. Baker should do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

A universal mask policy in Massachusetts, in addition to social distancing and handwashing, would contribute an additional [5 to 20 percent reduction](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/irv.12740) in infections and flatten the rising curve of COVID-19 deaths. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Protect our first responders**

Not enough is being done to help police, firefighters, and ambulance drivers. These first responders are not able to maintain social distance due to the nature of their work and are thus at heightened risk for infection. Alarmingly, [18 percent of New York City police have been infected](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-nypd.html) with COVID-19 as of April 3, and there is no reason to believe that the infection rate will be any lower for Boston police if they continue to work without masks and gloves. All first responders should be provided with personal protective gear to protect them and the public.

**Explain what “stay-at-home” means**

Baker needs to explain the importance of assuming everyone is infected with the coronavirus. Asymptomatic carriers could number up to [25 percent of all infections](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/coronavirus-asymptomatic-silent-carrier-spread-contagious) and are unwittingly spreading COVID-19. Go out only for food and medicine, and in the smallest groups necessary to get what you need. And no, the Starbucks drive-through doesn’t count as food. Going to Target is not an excuse to take your restless children on an outing — imagine that everyone in your aisle is infected. Jogging in crowds is also a no-no — every breath exhaled by a passing runner could be a cloud of COVID-19 droplets.

 

A brilliant but forgotten [article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/03/21/coronavirus-america-needs-five-week-national-lockdown-column/2890376001/) by Yaneer Bar-Yam, a pandemic expert, published in USA Today two weeks ago showed that a comprehensive lockdown — a complete prohibition on unnecessary travel, closure of borders and airports, and staying at home except to obtain food — could end the pandemic in five weeks. As of April 4, more than [8,000 Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html) have died of the coronavirus — and we expect that number to rise exponentially in the coming days. We are already prolonging the economic agony — [nearly 10 million Americans](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/02/business/us-job-market-collapses-under-weight-pandemic-shutdowns/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) have sought unemployment benefits in the past two weeks — with the half measures we have adopted.

To make the sacrifice count and ensure that the economic gut-punch we are experiencing is as short as possible, we must do everything we can to save lives and the economy. Rigorous social distancing and universal cloth mask use would lower the peak of daily new infections and deaths in Massachusetts while speeding up the forecasted date for returning to normal life. These are relatively inexpensive and easy actions which will yield huge benefits to our state and nation. The stakes have never been higher and the clock is counting down. Since the Trump administration won’t act quickly enough, Baker must act now.

1155,jabbanobada,1586100646,fvfjrq,Nan,"Massachusetts has a lot of coastline. Enough for everyone to enjoy. But there’s a problem. We have horrible beach access, with lots of coast privately owned and lots more with restrictive access.

The big crowded beaches with huge lots won’t be able to run at capacity this year. To be fair, they may end up closing them down entirely.

It doesn’t have to be this way. States like California and countries like Jamaica have beach access laws allowing anyone to go to any beach.

We should have temporary (or permanent) beach access laws this summer. Open up parking at stretches of highway. Eliminate municipal parking bans. 

We will need to enforce social distancing and block off sections of big parking lots, but we can balance that with increased access to other beaches. We can’t just let wealthy people on their private beaches enjoy the Massachusetts coast this summer.",massachusetts,"Let’s open ALL the beaches this summer, safely"

I’m here to seek guidance and help/advice for people, like me, and many other workers in Massachusetts that have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 quarantine. I applied for unemployment on March 17th and was successful for eligibility. I’ve finally been given the opportunity to have the option of claiming each week starting today. When logged in to the UI portal and on the main page, there is a ‘Request Benefit Payment’ option on the left side of the page. Once entering the process of the weekly request, I end up in the ‘Initial Questions’ section and on question #4 it asks, 

During the week listed above:

      Were you able to work?               Yes or No
      Were you available to work? (Select ""No"" if 
       you were in training/school.).  Yes or No
      Did you look for work?                 Yes or No  

Now my question is, what do I, and many others who lost their jobs from COVID-19, answer for these questions? I’m a full-time bartender and whenever the time comes and this whole quarantine lockdown is dealt with (who knows when), I will be able to go back to my job and start working again. Also after those questions what would we fill in for the ‘Work Search Verification Questionnaire?) I can’t seem to find any answer for this question and I’m a bit lost...any straightforward reliable source or answer would be awesome and much appreciated from myself and also many others who might be dealing with the same issue...
Thanks y’all

I recently moved from Boston back to my hometown in MetroWest to care for my mother, who is terminally ill in home hospice.  I try VERY hard not to ever leave the house due to her condition, she is at very high risk.  One grocery trip since I got down here and am set for the foreseeable future.

I can't be out looking for them for many reasons.

As a nonclinical worker at a Steward hospital in Massachusetts I want everyone to know that this statement by Steward is completely false.

N95 masks not being provided to nurses caring for Covid patients and they are forced to provide their own if possible. Because of this, masks have to be reused for days on end.
