* NCC was defined as a megacity (along the likes of Philadelphia, Los Angeles, etc.). It said megacities have among the highest household income and GDP per capita in the nation with the highest income inequality. I thought it was referring to Philadelphia, but Philadelphia and Montgomery Counties are already labeled that way and Delaware County and Chester County are not (labeled as ""urban periphery"" - basically commuter counties). I'm guessing something with banking and the Wilmington Area? 
* Sussex County was labeled as a ""Silver City"" with some of the oldest population, highest net migration, and large job increases in healthcare services.
* Kent County was labeled as an ""Independent Economy"" - neither thriving nor in distress.
* Delaware had among the highest loss in middle-wage jobs (median wages of $27,000-$54,000).
* Delaware was listed as having ""brain drain"" - outmigration of highly educated homegrown talent and the influx of highly educated movers. Net ""brain gain"" states listed included Maryland and New Jersey.
* McKinsey models a scenario in which NCC and Sussex have 10-15% net job growth, and Kent has 5-10% net growth. With the exception of Cecil County and PA above, the counties bordering us in MD and NJ will have very low net growth. Overall as a state, it's the 9th highest.

What do you think? Do you think the descriptions match?

- he used to drive an ice cream truck when he was about 16
-it was a bright pink truck 
- on the side there was a big ice cream bar with overalls on it

- he grew up on a farm very close to the delaware memorial bridge

159,159,firststateflippers,1579713990,esf5h9,Nan,"Fellow Pinballers,

  
I'm reaching out to all of you today to inform you that the time has come to try and bring more pinball to the state of Delaware. The resurgence of pinball over the past 5 years has been incredible in and of itself, however, combined with the recent efforts of the First State Flippers over the past 2.5 years, competitive pinball in Delaware is rapidly becoming a hotbed in the tri-state area. More cowbell? No, more pinball!!

Yet there is one glaring thing missing in Delaware and that is a place that pinball enthusiasts can come together and enjoy pinball in a relaxed setting other than someone's basement. I've personally talked to so many restaurant and bars about adding pinball machines and no one wants to do it and most of the time there is no real good reason. Pinball leagues are all the rage across the US, except in Delaware, and the First State Flippers crew wants to change that. We truly believe that we can push Delaware to the top of everyone's destination list when it comes to a place where enthusiasts, hobbyists, and competitors can gather to play a simple game that we all love.

With that said, we are looking to create a pinball social club and/or collective. Our ideal spot would be large enough to hold about 30 games from private collections plus some ample seating for people that would include a mixture of chairs and couches. This social club would give all of us an opportunity to come together and enjoy pinball, rather than playing at home or at the random bar by ourselves. While we are excited about this opportunity, please know that its in the very early planning stages, however we can't make this happen without the support of the local hobbyists/enthusiasts/competitors, and that is where all of you come into play. We need your help and support to make this vision possible.

At this point all we are looking for are people in and around Delaware that are willing to help support this effort by any means necessary. We will have more details to come in the coming days/weeks but for now we are just gauging interest. If you have friends or know of other enthusiasts in or around Delaware who would be interested in this social club, please have them contact me.

Finally, we have already reached out to a few different ""pinball collectives"" to get their feedback and we will be sharing some of those details in the very near future. So, if you want to see pinball grow in the First State let me know and together we can all make this happen!

today he LAUGHED at me. this is getting ridiculous. I need to find this truck. 

here we go again, 3rd time. Almost a year later. PLEASE help me find this ice cream truck. It has been eating me alive. 

About a year ago my ap gov teacher gave our class a task. If we could find the name of his ice cream truck that he had as a teen, he would dye his hair pink. It is my mission to figure out the name of his truck before I graduate. But, I made a deal that i would stop looking so, i will be living vicariously through a friend. 

Here is what I know: 
- He about in his mid 40’s 
- grew up in New Castle County, Delaware. 
- he used to drive an ice cream truck when he was about 16
- it was a bright pink truck 
- on the side there was a big ice cream bar with overalls on it
- he goes by “jay mac” or just “jay”
- he grew up on a farm very close to the delaware memorial bridge 
- he went to William Penn High School 
- the reason that he stopped telling students the name of his old ice cream truck is because apparently the name rolls off the tongue so nicely that his students started to call him it 
- He used to teach at Brandywine high school but i’m not really sure of the timeframe

What I have already tried: 
- I tried to find a yearbook for the years that he was in high school or maybe the year that he graduated, so I could maybe ask some of his old classmates but i can’t find one online and he definitely won’t give us a yearbook if he was a copy

- tried going through his nephew, but the family ended up sending us on a wild goose chase. 

- and i was set up by a colleague of his who taught at brandywine. 

please, please, please help me!!! and dm me on ig @kristinacazeau if you can offer any tips

In the most recent Newark post, there's an article stating that Newark municipal now owns the lot that was previously owned by Simon Eye. Somehow squeezing 80 new spaces in there. 
(they also tried to persuade Starbucks and Duck Donuts to give up their free patron parking. For essentially ""the greater good"") But let's drive down the road slightly.

Burger Kings parking lot is nothing but a trap for unsuspecting people trying to travel to mainstreet. There is a whooping 81 parking spaces... For a Burger King. The McDonald's on the end of mainstreet has 62, which still feels like more than they need, but more reasonable.

Now I understand the shopping center having so many spaces, and towing when people leave. It's for a ton of businesses, in a large area.

212,212,sininspira,1580248241,evca63,Nan,"Just thought I'd post this PSA in case anyone else runs into the issue I had for my 2018 taxes. **This only applies if you've worked in MD the entire year but changed residences between MD and DE during the year**, and you're weird and like to do your own taxes (like me lol). TurboTax and H&amp;R block don't handle this situation correctly (or at least it didn't for 2018 taxes, I had no reason to try this year).

Last year when I tried to file my state taxes through Turbo Tax, they forced me to choose between filing MD Resident or Non-Resident. If you're a part-year resident that continued working in MD the entire year, you need to file two separate returns: 502 for the period you were a resident and 505+505NR for the period you weren't. This is outlined (with more instructions for this specific situation) in section 28 of the Maryland non-resident instruction booklet.

If you allow tax filing software to only file one MD state return, you end up in one of two situations:

1. Resident Form 502 Only: MD local taxes are assessed for the entire year, and not just the part you lived there. You're likely overpaying MD local taxes if you moved between states.
2. Non-resident Forms 505+505NR Only: MD local taxes are not assessed at all. If you moved from MD to DE, you're underpaying MD local taxes. You may get a bigger refund, but MD may adjust your refund/payment due to match the residence dates. DE to MD, same situation but it's even more suspicious that you moved to MD and didn't file a resident form.

Filing both assesses the correct amount of MD local tax so you're not over or under-paying.

I'll probably end up posting this in the Maryland subreddit too, since I guess it applies to other states as well. If any tax programs did fix it this year, let me know and I'll update or delete this post.

Also, no I'm not a tax professional. I just like doing my own taxes because mine are relatively simple, and I only caught TurboTax and HR Block filing this specific tax situation wrong by chance.",Delaware,"Tax PSA for those that worked in MD all year, but moved residence between MD and DE during the year"

I recently attended a Citizen's Lobby Day in Dover for Cannabis legalization. The amount of people that arrived was wonderful but the reality is many representatives and senators were never spoken to because their constituents never came.

While i was specifically referring to cannabis legalization like HB 110 (adult use) and SB 79 (2nd amendment rights for medical patients), there are multiple groups, advocates, bills, and issues, that are largely ignored by the general public and legislators in Delaware.

That's by design.

We don't have Voter Initiatives and the outreach is weak at best. If we don't vote and tell them what we think, they are unaccountable to their constituents.

Get involved. Comments on Facebook and Reddit don't change minds.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

He is about 5 years old, fixed, has his vaccines, but he does have an auto immune disorder known as Feline Immuno Deficiency Disease. 

If you or anyone you know would like to adopt this precious boy, please feel free to message me. I have also been told that his adoption fee can be reduced or waived.

Last year I took a road trip from DC to Canada, passing through a number of toll roads on the way.  After the trip, I looked at my EZPass balance and paid the amount listed for the trip.  One or two of the toll roads didn't read the EZPass so I got letters in the mail, after the fact, including one from NJ with a late fee.  Unfortunately, I never received a letter from Delaware's toll agency and now their collection agency is chasing me for an astronomical price (considering the original $4 cost).   


Delaware Toll + Late Fee: $91  
New Jersey Toll + Late Fee: $33

545,545,Jack5291,1583857713,fggi9m,Nan,"Saturday night I was with my buddy and we were riding around the Newark area near the western family YMCA and decided to stop by riggins to get snacks (it was 9 pm) but decided to hide the longboards in the treeline because it's a sketchy area at night and didn't want to get robbed. (it was very well hidden and you would've had to go digging to get them. We also made sure no cars were around which there were none) when we left the gas station a black Ford pickup truck with a black bed cap stopped in the middle of the road and yelled ""why you walking [expletive] [expletive]"" and then continued to tell at us while driving away. We weren't thinking about what he said at the time because we were surprised at what just happened but when we got back to where we hid the longboards they were gone. We walked up and down the treeline with flashlights and still couldn't find them. The reason we didn't call the cops is because he drove off so fast and we didn't get the license plate number. The driver is a white male with gray beard looked like he was in his late 40's-50's. The one longboard was a electric one which cost my buddy $400 and the wooden one cost him $100. The electric one is black and says verreal on the top in blue letters, the wooden one is tan with blue trucks and has a sector 9 design. If you know anyone that matches that description please tell him to give it back (contact me on here first).

I am a cat foster mom, currently fostering for Homeless Cat Helpers. I am currently fostering 2 sweet kitties who are looking for their forever homes. (I’m the one who fostered a kitty who was about to be put down in a previous post here.)

Both kitties are male, neutered, up to date on vaccines and FELV/FIV negative. Both are healthy and happy, but the sooner they find them homes the sooner I can foster other homeless kitties :)

Marty: About 1 year, loves other cats but is a little shy around people. Very playful, would do best in a home with a cat playmate. Loves water—he always jumps in the shower after me. Ridiculously cute: https://i.imgur.com/CXS8bgb.jpg

Boris: 1-2 years, extremely affectionate. LOVES humans. I think he’d be happiest with a person who spends a lot of time at home. Gets along with other kitties but prefers humans. He is the most gentle, affectionate cat I’ve ever met. Perfect companion cat for someone who wants a lot of feline attention. https://i.imgur.com/RO0A9F7.jpg

I don’t charge adoption fees but I do check vet references.

CORONAVIRUS UPDATE: SCHOOL CLOSINGS UPDATE
Dear Christina Parents, Staff and Community:

As you are aware, after consulting with School Superintendents, Governor Carney has asked that all 19 Delaware School Districts close for a period of two weeks*, from Monday, March 16, 2020, through Friday, March 27. (At this time, we expect schools and offices to reopen on Monday, March 30.) President Trump has declared a national state of emergency – and health experts from around the globe agree that extraordinary measures are needed to slow the progression of the disease.

We are acting quickly to provide as much time as possible for family planning. This is a fluid situation and that means we may not be able to answer all your questions at this time.

 

Will we have to make up the days? It may be possible to recover days originally set aside for snow. In addition, the Board of Education will consider a potential modification of spring break dates. We will seek guidance from the Delaware Department of Education and will make every effort to recover lost instructional time during this unprecedented situation.

Will graduation still be happening as scheduled? This is a fluid situation. It is too early to confirm when, or even what graduation will look like until later in the spring.

Will work be sent home while school is closed? The District will provide academic work packets via our website and in print material. If you do not have access to the website, printed packets will be available for pick up on Wednesday, March 18th at your school between the hours of 11 AM - 1 PM, and at meal distribution sites after March18th. We are also reviewing additional resources for learning. This will not count as graded work and there will be no tests on the material.

Will options for meals be available to students during this time? We will provide meals to Christina students at five distribution sites - Bancroft, Bayard, Kirk, Shue-Medill and Leasure - starting on Tuesday, March 17th between the hours of 11 AM – 1 PM;. Meals will be provided at the main entrance at each of these locations.

Is there a chance that we could be out longer than two weeks? There is always that possibility. However, our hope is that this shutdown will help slow the spread of the disease and allow us to get back to normal operations.

Have there been any students, staff, volunteers… in our district who may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus? We have not been notified of any instances at this time.
 

Our goal is to do whatever we can to prevent the spread of the virus and make sure we get back to business as usual as quickly as possible – while keeping our community safe and healthy. Let’s all be supportive of one another in this unique time of need!

 

Sincerely,

Richard L. Gregg

But now with all the outbreaks happening in Newark I’m worried about exposure to the virus. No first time mom wants to get sick right after giving birth and also deal with a sick newborn. I’ve read some stories of women being exposed at the hospital they delivered at because patients and their partners didn’t disclose they had the virus to staff. 

I was thinking of just going to the new milford hospital instead when I go into labor. I already called and they said if I do that they can just fax my records over, and I have good insurance that’s accepted everywhere so I’m not worried about being out of network. Also I live 20 minutes from milford and 50 from Christiana.

In a traditional parade, the spectators choose a spot on the sidelines and stay there for the duration of the parade, and the participants parade down the street.

In a Reverse Parade, the spectators stay in their vehicles and drive down the parade route, and the participants choose a spot on the sidelines (hopefully a safe distance from others) and stay there for the duration of the parade route.

It would be cool to organize something like this in Delaware, where participants can dress up in costumes, spin signs, and otherwise make a spectacle of themselves, and parents with kids can drive down the parade route.

I think it would be great to create a spot on r/Delaware that you could draw attention to your favorite local businesses. Their owners are probably worried and stressed. 

Maybe a local restaurant, bakery, coffee roaster, bike shop, the list goes on...one way we can support business who’s revenue is adversely affected would be to purchase their goods online if possible, support them through gift card sales, heck PayPal or Venmo them a surprise gift of love!

Point is, share some business names in the comments, maybe a link to their website. (If you are a business owner, maybe you could list how we can help you in this difficult time.)

Let’s do our best to share some love and generosity. As always there are needs for donations and generosity across the state to help those in need. I am aware of the Blood Bank needing volunteers and the DE Food Bank needing donations for drive through events.

She’s been worried for the last week that she’s going to end up catching something because of how close she is with many people in her work setting. 

Well they aren’t closing. My wife just forwarded an email to me about how their business is justifying they are essential. It’s about 10 paragraphs of the most unbelievable corporate talk I’ve ever seen. Talking about “we have an obligation to society to continue to serve our customers in this time of need.” 

How do they justify it? By saying they are an industry listed on the list (but the quoted industry they claim to be apart of does not show up on the list) and that they “support” an industry listed on the list. This is reminding me of how Gamestops were still open in CA because they were saying they were supporting people working from home because they sell mouse/keyboard/webcam devices. 

These PDFs should not be what determines if businesses stay open; someone (or a team) should review each business and shut down the ones they determine to be non-essential. Putting out a PDF is only a way for businesses to find a loop hole to stay open and put their employees at risk. 

Since someone analyzing what businesses are open most likely won’t be done – how can I report a business to be reviewed?

People are being laid off- a lot of people. There are families that don't have anything in their bank accounts, who may end up losing their homes or having their cars repossessed.

“Similar to Carney’s order, Rehoboth’s order allows people to leave home for essential activities. Delawareans may leave their homes to get groceries, pick up a prescription, see a doctor, and engage in other activities essential to their health, and the health and well-being of their family members, including pets. Delawareans may also engage in outdoor activity but must adhere to social distancing guidelines.

According to the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge is open. A statement on the service’s website says, whenever possible, outdoor recreation sites at national wildlife refuges and national fish hatcheries will remain open to the public. Visitor Centers and other facilities, however, may be closed. Scheduled events may be cancelled.

According to the Delaware State Parks website, all state parks remain open, however, buildings such as park offices, museums and nature centers are closed. Anyone visiting a park is encouraged to engage in responsible social distancing practices, avoiding groupings of people. All Delaware beaches are closed until May 15 or until the public health threat of COVID-19 has been eliminated. Beach access from within Cape Henlopen, Delaware Seashore and Fenwick Island state parks is prohibited. Parking and fishing at the Indian River Inlet within Delaware Seashore State Park is permitted. All state park campsites, cabins, bathhouses, and cottages continue to be open at this time. There will be at least a one-day break between rental periods of cabins and cottages to allow for thorough, increased cleanings between guests.”

I'm looking for a tutor who knows Python (classes, rest calls, os module, etc.) and Github. This would be for teaching and adult in his late 20's. I've taken courses on Codecademy and other MOOCs but I always have questions that I need answered.

The tutoring would be through Zoom, due to the Coronavirus situation, hence my post in DE and just Wilmington.

Thanks",Delaware,"Looking for a programming tutor (Python, Github, etc.)"

Motorists may pass through Delaware en-route to other states

Motorists may leave their home state to work for a Delaware designated essential business, to care for a family member in Delaware, or for healthcare reasons in Delaware

Out-of-state employees who work for an essential business in Delaware but could otherwise do their work from home should remain home

Troopers will be conducting patrols on non-interstate roadways which have been identified as having a large volume of out-of-state travelers, in an effort to enforce the Governor’s declaration. The Delaware Department of Justice and Delaware law enforcement agencies are empowered to respond, inspect, and react accordingly. Visitors who fail to self-quarantine could face criminal charges.

Reportedly the police try not enforcing this on out of state cars on  I-95, I-295, or I-495.

&gt;**DOVER, Del.** – The [**Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control**](https://dnrec.alpha.delaware.gov/) announced today it will take steps when necessary to limit the numbers of visitors within state parks and wildlife areas, following crowding and public health concerns.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Starting Friday, April 10, administrators of parks and wildlife areas will recommend to DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin that vehicle access be limited at times when visitor usage is observed to be cause crowding and prevent safe social distancing.** These limits will be implemented by DNREC’s Natural Resources Police.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“As the days have gotten nicer and the stay-at-home period endures, we have been increasingly concerned to see the behavior of some visitors to our state parks and wildlife areas, with full parking lots and increasingly crowded trails,” said Secretary Shawn Garvin. “Limiting the number of people when we see too much crowding will allow us to keep these public spaces open for individuals who need a break and fresh air, but to keep everyone safe.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;DNREC provided the following tips and guidance for visiting parks and wildlife areas at this time:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Parks or wildlife areas may be restricted, or areas may be closed if it is determined based on observation of parking lots or groupings of people that lack of responsible social distancing has become an issue.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- While parks and wildlife areas are large, many visitors use the same amenities. Visitors should try to spread out from others within these areas.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Visitors to parks and wildlife areas are urged to limit the time of their visit so the overall number of people in each area is reduced.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyone concerned about an individual or group in any state park or wildlife area may contact DNREC’s Natural Resources Police via Tip411, DNREC’s smartphone app, or by calling the 24-hour DNREC Dispatch Center at 302-739-4580.

Not surprised that this is happening given much of the behavior I've seen at state parks over the past month or so. I'm also curious to see how crowds will fluctuate once the free entrance period expires at the end of April.",Delaware,"DNREC to limit number of people in state park and wildlife areas, which may close for periods of time"

118,118,lfe-soondubu,1586750178,g0bf9g,DE Info Request,"Hey guys, I'm considering buying a condo in Wilmington, especially if home values trend down due to current economic conditions, but its really hard to find any that aren't super old, or in a bad part of town. The only option I've found is the Christina Landing condos. I actually rented an apartment at Christina landing a few years back, and liked living there but have since moved north.

I'd also like to look at some options in Justison/Riverwalk, but those seem to not go on the market that often...

My big concern here though is, looking at historical prices on both these and the Justison condos, they appear to still be trending downward since the 2008 crisis... 

Anyone know what the story is there? A lot of these units are selling for, it looks like, 20-30% less than back then still, which worries me about future resale value. Were they just absurdly overpriced back then or something? Or is there something fundamentally problematic about these properties contributing to them losing value over time?",Delaware,Christina Landing condo values?

121,121,YoureaLobstar,1586794620,g0m2tv,DE Info Request,"I am filing for partial unemployment. I went from working 36-40 hours a week, to 21 hours a week. My manager just asked if I can work 2-8 today, I declined because that would put me past part time hours. I agreed to drop to part time hours during all of this with the expectation that I would not be working more than part time hours. There's no way I'm going to work a constant 36 hour week right now without working open to close every day- we close early two days a week and Saturdays we usually close completely due to lack of appointments.

My manager is now telling me I need to only file when I work less than full time hours (36 as defined by my company.) I was under the impression that I had to file eery week, no matter what I worked? I am still getting insurance and benefits from my job. 

I am not trying to work the system to get benefits and unemployment or whatever- our benefits suck anyway. I would just like to work my 20 hours a week or whatever and apply for UI to supplement the rest. 

I have to file every week, right?
