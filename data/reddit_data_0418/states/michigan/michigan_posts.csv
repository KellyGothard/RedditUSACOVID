117,117,HueyPNFreeman,1578159820,ejzp2z,Nan,"So last night, me and my friends decided that since it's the start of a new year, and a new decade, and all of us were finally drinking age, we would bring the new year in by bar hopping on a Friday night. We didn't have the gas/Uber money to go all the way to downtown Detroit, so we decided that our best bet would be to hit Royal Oak and see what was popping over there since it's relatively busy in the daytime hours.

That... turned out to be a mistake..

Of all the bars that we walked past/went to, they could be put into a few categories: A.  bars where there were **very few** people around our age range and single, so the bars were either filled with couples in their thirties or weirdly a bunch of middle aged old dudes. B. bars with, uh... *suspicious* cover price justifications like when we decided to try and head into Mr. B's ""gastropub"" on Main street and they cited us wearing joggers for the reason why they told us that we had to pay a **$15 cover charge** just to get in (kinda looks suspicious to a group of Black guys when the security outside of Mr. B's are literally the only bunch of security guards that patted us down the entire night and charge use a ridiculous entrance fee when we can easily look on Google and see that your ""cover charges"" aren't normally that much, not even the guards outside of O'tooles patted us down when we ducked inside of there, and it's supposed to have some sort of reputation of being ""trashy"" according to the Detroit subreddit) and finally, C. bars that were just straight up closed, which were a couple.

At first we thought that it was just  us being lame until we crossed paths with a group of girls and asked them if they knew of any bar around the area that they could point us to that wasn't so dead, and they all replied that that's exactly what they were trying to figure out...

We walked around Main and Washington streets at least 3 good times trying to find a good place to chill at with no luck, that's when we began to take notice of the store fronts and how we were some of the only people walking around while the night was still young. If I could make an accurate guesstimation, I'd say that  ~25% of the storefronts on Main street had a ""for sale"" sign on them where a business used to be there less than a year ago but closed down due to high rents, and a further 50% of the businesses were just closed in general around 10 o'clock for no reason. I had no idea Royal Oak could be so dead, especially with the hype that certain groups of people give it online. It's like what some old dude's idea of what people in their twenties want in a city is, the whole night was just lame.

I'm pretty in tune with local history and the backstories of a lot of communities in the Metro Detroit area, and apparently a place like RO was *the* hang out spot for people in their twenties go go and meet other people in the late 90's/early 2000's. So my question is, how the hell could a place that was supposedly hip way back when gentrify into a boujie outdoor mall? For real, when it comes to night life or liveliness outside of ""business hours"" , it might as well be Southfield

For those who live in other parts of the state, are there areas/cities that you think are overhyped? What do you think can be done to change those areas around you into places that are more friendly to a younger crowd?

Like I told my friends, the ability to just be able to get up, go out on a whim, and have fun with as little hassle as possible is super important for people around our age, if we can't  find that in the communities around us, we start looking for other places where we can find that at... which is mostly out of state.

P.S.: If there's anyone from Royal Oak's government reading this, your town is a glorified  boujie bedroom community, outside of going to OCC, there's no reason for people my age to be in your city, you need to reassess what type of town that you wanna be or you'll literally just be a walkable version of Soutfield",Michigan,What the hell happened to Royal Oak?

I’m not sure if they’re on any other ones. The user raised a lot of red flags for me because every time I’ve come across him, he uses the same photos but with a different name and occupation. I called him out on this when I matched with him the second time (he seemed to not remember matching before) and he immediately unmatched me. The first time we talked, we never talked about meeting, but I had unmatched with him because some of his messages made me uncomfortable. 

I’ve reported his account numerous times but he just keeps created new ones. He also uses the passport feature of tinder, allowing him to change his location to appear to be in different cities, which is why I chose to post on this broader subreddit. 

The names I’ve seen him use so far have been Camron, Coulter, and Coulier. He’s listed his occupation as physical therapist, financial analyst, and international relations. If you’d like more info please DM me, just want everyone to stay safe out there!",Michigan,Caution about user on dating apps

When the map opens the **Michigan state house districts** are displayed with semi-transparent coloring (red=R, blue=D).  The data for the map is hosted on a GIS server operated by the state.  I am \*assuming\* the data is current.

To change the map so it shows the **Michigan state senate districts**:

1. Click the basemap button (Next to the ""Menu"" button)

2. Look under the ""Overlay"" heading (mobile users scroll down)

3. Click the house layers to turn them off

4. Click the senate ""fill"" layer and then the senate ""boundary"" layer.

It may take a few seconds for the data to appear.  It depends on how busy the GIS server is and the speed of your internet connection.  

The map is displayed by GISsurfer which is a general purpose web map I developed as a public service and part of my way to ""pay it forward"".  There is a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with some general ‘Help' information.

In terms of ice, most models suggest an area of ice stretching across the state from east to west. The location of the ice varies from model to model but all suggest it will either be south central or southern lower Michigan. Some models show ice accumulations up to 1/4 or an inch, while others bring it as high as 1 inch, which would not be good. At All.

I'm not sure how I didn't realize that sooner-- possibly because they were both listed as ""AAA Autodebit"" in my bank account activity-- but it pissed me off. They're basically charging me twice!

I realize every car insurance is different because everyone is different, but I'm curious what y'all's experience has been. I drive a lot for work-- about forty miles round-trip-- but I'm leaving my job soon for one that requires less driving, so I'm hoping that'll bring my premiums down.

Finally managed to get my rear passenger door open, but that's the side of the car where the small section of the rear seat folds down so I still couldn't reach the scraper.  

After working on the other passenger door for a while, I finally managed to force it open from the inside.  But wait, there's more.

I can't fold down that section of the rear seat because my front seat is too far back.  I try reaching the button to move the seat forward but can't.  

The driver's side door just will not open from the outside.  I then work on the passenger door and finally manage to open it.  From there, I'm able to lay across the front seats and apply enough pressure to the driver's door to force it open.

Next I'm able to move the seat forward, lower the back seat, and crawl far enough into the trunk so I can get to my scraper, which of course is as far away from me as possible.

What's it like there? How are the people and the recreational opportunities?  I know there won't be as much wilderness up there but it looks like there's plenty of woods to tramp around in and the upper peninsula is very close.  I love to canoe and walk around all day in the woods.

520,520,framptal_tromwibbler,1579631461,eryszj,Nan,"Hi, a couple of years ago I had MISSDIG come out to my house to locate all underground cables, etc.  just in case I ever needed to do some excavating on the property.  They painted the grass where the cables were and left.  I took pictures and saved them and even created a schematic drawing for my records.  

I have a window well that is poorly graded that sometimes gets some water leakage during heavy rains when the ground around it gets super saturated.  A couple of weekends ago when SE Michigan had all that rain, that is exactly what happened.  So I went out there that Saturday morning and dug a shallow trench to give it somewhere to drain off.  Just something temporary until I can fix it properly in the spring.  While doing this I think I severed an orange underground cable that was buried a few inches deep. I'm not %100 sure it was me.  If it was me, I didn't notice it at the time, just saw it afterwards.  But I was digging right there so I'm pretty sure I did it.

Anyway, my question: am I liable in any way for this?  This was in an area where there were no underground cables identified by MISSDIG.   There were some cables located about 6 feet away on the other side of my backyard fence but they seemed to end at the house and the painted lines did not extend into the back yard where I was digging.

Also, as far as I can tell, it has had no consequence for me.  None of my services were interrupted at all. One possibility is that it was a telephone cable for a land line.  I use only a cell phone, though, so if that's it, I wouldn't know.  It kind of looks like it is heading off towards my neighbor's house, though, so  conceivably it could be affecting somebody else's services.

What's the right thing to do here?  I feel like I should report it but a) I do not really know who to report it to (MISSDIG? AT&amp;T?) and b) I would like to know what my liability is here.

Thanks.",Michigan,"Severed a buried cable in my yard, what now?"

We got some such as 275 in the lower peninsula less than 100 miles north of the state border which has 4 lanes on each side with a median dividing them (8-lanes total) and still needs extra lanes on each side during rush hour to be built in the future, and we also got ones such as I-75 which is in the upper peninsula that is near the national border where Sault Ste. Marie is, which has a second (left) lane on each side that simply just serves as an on-demand PASSING LANE dedicated for each direction on a 4-lane undivided highway which otherwise would suffice if it was just a 2-lane undivided road instead, which the rest of the UP has.

and, sometimes we see roadways such as US-10 which is a MIXED BAG of freeway and 2-lane undivided segments.  Sometimes we have roadways where the passing lane is shared with the opposing direction, but one has to be CAREFUL not to end up in a head-on in that lane.

I've seen maps of Michigan's traffic volume readings on the Internet years ago, and that some indicate freeways with super-low volumes that otherwise don't need a second lane for each direction (e.g. I-75 in the UP), and we also have moderately busy 2-lane roadways with intermittent passing lanes (e.g. US-31 in various segments, north of Ludington).

Who here can comment about the disparity between lane availability, and traffic congestion of any Michigan road segment?",Michigan,"With Michigan's freeways, some need an extra lane, and some simply just have an on-demand passing lane."

I'm a new grad who's basically lived in the Bay Area for my whole life.  I recently got a job offer in Warren, Michigan for General Motors which requires relocation.  I'm a 5'10"" asian kid so I'll definitely be a minority.

So for those of you who moved from the Bay to Michigan or have any tips/advice, let me know the good and bad!

Here's a list of stuff I'm somewhat concerned about as well:

- Crime.  I come from a safe bubble.  I believe Royal Oaks is where most of the Uni kids are and most of the no-go places are south - is this true?
- Traffic.  Traffic here sucks.  How's traffic over there?
- What is snow?
- Racial demographic?  I'm not trying to be racist here, but growing up I've been surrounded by 99% asian/indian people and 1% everyone else.

There's a chance I could be moving with my family to southern Michigan in the near future (currently live in Northern Ontario, Canada). As you all know, we don't pay for our health care here besides paying taxes, which I appreciate. Nonetheless, there's not much work in my field here, so I've begun applying to jobs there. As a dual citizen I don't expect to have any problems with this.  


Naturally, we're a bit concerned about the cost of healthcare in the States. Can someone with a family (3 kids preferably) please let me know how much I can expect to pay in premiums for employer-provided comprehensive health coverage? I know there's probably tons of variance but all I can find online are averages (apparently $600 a month?) and I'd prefer hearing from you all.

We get him up, dressed, fed, to school on time, picked up on time, fed, together with my daughters regularly, brought to Cub Scouts, activities done together, put to bed on time and everything in between that i may have missed. My 43 yr old sister and mother of my nephew has been steadily backsliding for a little over a year. She had a Vicodin addiction that has progressed into full blown drug use (heroin suspected, crack confirmed). We know she hangs out at a known drug house. When she would be around home and her child about a year ago, she would make frequent trips to this house daily. Multiple trips. Spotty communication, thefts from loved ones homes, stealing and writing fraudulent checks and even blocking me on the phone when i would text asking when we could expect her to pick up her son when he was with us. We purchased and placed a gps tracker on her car and we then saw exact locations and exact frequency of these trips. Always at this shithole house. Fast forward to now, my sister has not shown her face in 2 weeks. Tells my dad every day that she will ""be home in about an hour"" (she and her son live at my fathers house) then cuts off contact and never shows. She no longer has the car we were tracking. That car was totaled in a fender bender, with her son in the car. There are more details to add and each are shittier than the last. What do we do? We dont want to contact authorities outright because we dont want to end up having to hand the child over to CPS when we have a support system and are all willing to take him in.

Recently I saw this video of this religious fanatic lady in a Meijer's store causing a major scene. Turns out she's done this at other places before, as I looked her up and found other videos. The other videos of her are at another Meijer's location, Del Taco and McDonald's. There's even another video back from 2016 where she chases down a garbage man and almost causes an accident due to him not taking all of her trash (Language Warning - video with all of her incidents [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl5XBsZS8to&amp;t=158s)).

From reading a few comments, I've heard people say that she's notorious in Michigan, or at least the areas surrounding where she's done this stuff. I've even read a comment from someone saying that there are warning posters about her, but I don't know if this is true or not.

&amp;#x200B;

So I currently have a home in NY State and.....it's a joke. I'm looking elsewhere to get my outdoor fix and have heard nothing but great things about Michigan; specifically, the Upper Peninsula. I enjoy riding snowmobiles, ATV's, dirtbikes, side-by-sides, etc. I also enjoy shooting and would like to find a property where I can shoot long distances and not bother anyone. A run of 2,000 yards minimum would be great, or even a property with hills and valleys. 

&amp;#x200B;

Could you recommend any towns, cities or real estate professionals in that area?

Side note: my search isn't just in Michigan, so if you know of another place around the country, that would be great too. I love places like Park City and Vail but....you know, price starts to come into play!

I’ve been there a few times over the years and I found it to be beautiful. Also, since we’re staring down the barrel of the climate change shotgun I think Michigan will be a great place to be. 
Anyway, I’d like to buy as much land as I can afford and I’m looking for advice on where to get the most bang for the buck.  As I look around Zillow it seems like land is surprisingly cheaper than many other places I have looked. 
My end goal is to use the land for agroforestry (plant trees to absorb carbon) or install a solar farm to provide renewable energy to the grid or lease space for wind turbines. Or any combination of these. 
So cleared land is preferred. It’s better to buy and replant cleared land than to buy land that already has a forest on it. 
My dream is to sip my morning coffee on my front porch and look out over a beautiful sustainable paradise that helps people, nature, and the world at large be better. 

Wild card - I love to kitesurf so I’d be great if I was driving distance to some good kitesurf spots or at least an airport where I could fly to some kitesurf spots once or twice a year.  I know the west shore has the best kite conditions but surely the East has some good wind too.

So far, In 2018, in the Grand Rapids, MI, community, more than 600 children were poisoned by lead because more than 85 percent of the housing stock in the City of Grand Rapids, and many others throughout Kent County are contaminated with lead-based household paint. This issue is still present.

Given that, I am looking to find a solution, so that fewer children get poisoned. Consequently, at my University, I am researching how to reduce the number of lead poisoning cases of my community.

So far, In 2018, in the Grand Rapids, MI, community, more than 600 children were poisoned by lead because more than 85 percent of the housing stock in the City of Grand Rapids, and many others throughout Kent County are contaminated with lead-based household paint. This issue is still present.

Given that, I am looking to find a solution, so that fewer children get poisoned. Consequently, at my University, I am researching how to reduce the number of lead poisoning cases in my community.

The cop came to the scene and noticed my plates and asked to change it. So I changed it this week. 

I initially offered the driver to pay the repair costs out of pocket, he has informed me today that the estimate is about $1000. My car also has a little bit of damage and I’m thinking if I should claim insurance or not.

March is the time when our registrations are due because that's when my birthday is. If I were to change the registration from my name to theirs, how would I do it?

First let me make something clear: I would not be on here if I did not call Kroger, Meijer, Walmart and attempt to call Faygo themselves. All Walmart locations in my are say they sell it. They do not. None of them. Not one. Same with Kroger and Meijer. What it is is that it is in their systems and it can be delivered but it just isn't because it's not ordered. But could be. But cannot be ordered because a customer requests it. Trust me I literally tired everything. 

I can buy 24oz bottles from Speedway but not Rock &amp; Rye. I wouldn't mind getting some Better Made chips either. So I would drive to Michigan to get it but I have no way to have someone say ""I shop at such and such and they have it"".

1134,1134,knowtruthnotrust,1581614337,f3d95n,Nan,"In the State of Michigan, whether you see your primary care physician, specialist, pharmacist, dentist, eyedoctor (anyone who is providing medical care to you), your private information is now being shared to several state and federal databases.  This information includes appointment time, appointment date, what you are being seen for, diagnosis, family history and the medication prescribed.  This information can now be freely viewed by any health care professional that you see.

The typical sharing profile for a Michigan resident is as follows: your health care professional's Electronic Medical Records system sends your information to Surescripts and Great Lakes Health Connect.  Both Surescripts and Great Lakes Health Connect send your information to MIHIN (the State's designated agency).  MIHIN sends your information to CareQuality/Commonwell.

You do have options!  The State of Michigan is an 'opt-out' state.  If you don't opt-out, you are automatically included in the program.  You can download an opt-out form from Great Lake's website.   
 Surescripts' patient privacy policy allows any patient to opt-out of having their medical record or prescription history shared through (or retrieved from) their network.  Commonwell (the system that allows all of the doctors' programs to communicate with one another also allows you to opt-out.

Under federal policy (ONC), ""no patient shall ever be surprised that their information is being shared"".  Under state legislation, the HIT Commission is tasked with ""educating the public"".  Are you surprised?  Did anybody educate you about the program?  Of 87 people surveyed, none knew of the existence of the program.

The program has its merit--if you are vacationing out-of-state and get in an accident, they can quickly pull up all of your health history and RX data.   ...but, does your dentist really need to know that you had an abortion?  Shouldn't the program have been disclosed to you?  It's been active since 2009.

Want to exercise your options?  Your doctors will not know who they are sharing with.  As a matter of fact, it is highly likely that they will tell you that it is a HIPAA violation to share your info.  Not true.  Call your doctor's privacy officer.  They know what they are sharing and what your options are.",Michigan,The State of Michigan is gathering your private health information and sharing it. You have options.

First there is no State or Federal Law that mandated them to do so, this is just their policy. 

But everything from Beer and Smokes, to Ammo and Spry Paint are age restricted. And they used to just ask for your ID and then move on. Now their policy is that they need to scan in your ID.

Recap: Youth Advocacy Day 2020
New legislation on HIV and sex education, consent

Thank you to all those who were with us in-person and in spirit for our Youth Advocacy Day on 2/18 at the Capitol in Lansing!  Our group of MOASH staff, Board members, and youth advocates met with state representatives to ask for their support and co-sponsorship on three different bills related to HIV and sex education.  We are grateful for all the legislators who took time to talk with our youth advisory council members, and for the 20 reps who co-sponsored these bills!  Details about each bill below:
HB 5499: This bill from Rep. Hood will clarify the current Michigan law by changing “shall not be medically inaccurate” to read “must be medically accurate and objective” with respect to health education. It expands curricular opportunities to affirm all gender and sexual orientations.
HB 5500: This bill from Rep. Wittenberg would revise health education curriculum to emphasize the necessity of “enthusiastic, freely given consent to sexual activity.” It would also create a component of the curriculum on the prevention of sexual assault and dating violence. The bill also specifies departments and community partners that must be consulted in the development of these new lessons.
HB 5501: This bill from Rep. Pohutsky will expand currently mandated HIV/AIDS education to include medically accurate teaching on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medications",Michigan,MOASH successful advocacy day

I'm a 19 year old college student from the netherlands. I might be going to the Ferris State University in Michigan next year to study for 6 months as part of an exchange program.

This is all very exciting to me, but i have to admit that i don't know much about Michigan as a state itself. So I'd really like to get to know some more about it! 

For example:
-What is something i should definetely go and see or do while i am there?
-What are the people like? (Generally speaking)
-How do you feel about Michigan?

And so on!

I hope some of you can take some time out of your day to give me your perspective. Thanks in advance ;)",Michigan,What is Michigan like? (Question from an outsider)

Assuming I'm coming **south** and want to go **east**, the southbound light has just turned green, it's decently heavy traffic, and all distances are roughly equal, **which option is the fastest?**  What about if the light has been green for a while?  Or what about if it just turned red?  How about on average?

**[Option 1](https://i.imgur.com/fsl2Owd.png) - right then Michigan left**: This tends to be the fastest overall in my opinion


**[Option 2](https://i.imgur.com/5cQSXBh.png) - Michigan left then right**: This one's annoying because you make it through the intersection initially, but then by the time you've waited long enough to make a Michigan left it's just become a northbound red light so the eastbound traffic is just starting and a right on red is going to take a while.

**[Option 3](https://i.imgur.com/p0GMTx9.png) - two rights through a corner gas station (possibly illegal):** I have only ever done this a few times when I got gas but it sounds like a good idea

Also, I've noticed certain behavior when I drive in the left lane of a divided road.  Can anyone explain why drivers around here do these two things?  Because of this, driving in the left lane of divided streets is unpredictable so I think the middle lane is typically the safest and fastest lane.

**[Person 1](https://i.imgur.com/9q4hiRq.png):** Why do they swerve out to the right like that?  This isn't a semi with a huge turn radius.  Imagine it's a small SUV.

**[Person 2](https://i.imgur.com/KuoNOCq.png):** Why do they take such a long, angled approach to the Michigan left lane?  It slows down everyone behind them.",Michigan,Michigan Left Questions

I’m here to answer your questions on all things Michigan during the 2020 election cycle, including local races, key issues, [the upcoming Michigan primary (March 10)](https://www.freep.com/story/news/2020/02/24/michigan-presidential-primary-2020-date-time-absentee-ballot/4855707002/), and what’s going on politically in Michigan communities.

I'm 23 and ill be attending GVSU out there in the Holland campus. I'll be moving to Holland either in June or July and i'll be there for the next 2-4 years until I get my bachelors degree...but anyway, I've personally have never been out there before and it will be my first time being in Michigan. I'm moving with my family, but I'm very hesitant and kind of reluctant out there as far as social and night life... like what is there to do out there for young adults? I know that Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo seems that they have a nightlife activities, but what about Holland. I've also been told that Holland is very religious as well..so I'm also kind of reluctant about moving out there as well or just wondering if I would personally like the city itself.

Just a bit of information about myself. I'm a raver and love EDM music!! Now.. I know that I probably will not find that in Holland and that is okay. I am aware that I have to put that part of my life on hold until I get my degree. I'm also Cali born and raised and I have never lived outside of California... All and all, I'm just very hesitant and unsure about me liking Holland... So if you guys can answer these questions for me as well as expanding about what you love about Holland, that would be great. It will also be cool to start talking to people as well that are attending GVSU or living in the Holland area so I can make some new friends.",Michigan,Moving to Holland Michigan from California

I’m driving out to Montana in Mid May from Ohio and want to come up through Michigan taking
I 75 and then catching Hwy 2 all the way to Montana. I’ve always wanted to see the UP and now is my chance! 

 Although I do have a few questions -
 
•How is the weather in the UP in mid May? Reason I ask is I’m in an old rear wheel drive camper van that doesn’t care for snow very much, even with winter tires :) 

•Next question I had is how are services on i75 + us hwy2 as I travel up and through the UP? From my Google Earth research I’m gathering most gas stations are about 40 minutes from each other?

So I m looking for trucks I get on a website called iSeeCars and find a truck so good so far . There is a place you can send messages to the dealership and one of them is “what is your best price “ so I hit it and receive a call from LUNGHAMER Chevrolet in Waterford. They don’t want to talk money just come on in and test dive . So I change my schedule around call them and say I can be there first thing in the morning. They checked on the truck told me it still here and it will be ready and waiting for you and there is room to negotiate. Still no answer to my inquire .  I proceeded down to Waterford arrive on time not early but on time I go to the front door and it’s locked so I have to wait for someone to come to the door and open it,oh well it happens, I meet the sales man and he starts telling me how smart I am for considering this truck. I give him my license he copied it and said “ let me go get the keys” comes back with a huge ring off keys goes through them and said wrong key ring disappears to get the next set off key ring and I sit and wait. Now remember they called me and verified the appointment and assured me it would be gassed and ready to go. Now the manager is helping him look and they say that the kid that pulls up the car’s probably has it and hasn’t got it yet. I sit and wait. Then the salesman from LUNGHAMER CHEVROLET  comes back and says to me “it’s been sold can I do something Else￼ for you . Well I’m livid I just drove 53 miles one way and he’s acting like whoops a daisy we goofed . I can’t repeat what I said next and where I told him and the rest of the morons at LUNGENHAMER CHEVROLET IN WATERFORD where to go but they got the point that I was furious very quickly. 
 Why am I sharing this? Because I believe we should be treated￼ like humans not potential marks to rape our bank accounts.
 Please share this with as many people as you can and show them what a wonderful dealership LUNGHAMER CHEVROLET IN WATERFORD IS !

Please forgive spelling and punctuation I’m still furious

What pros and cons are there to moving to Detroit/Detroit Metro? I want to stay permanently if I move.

Things I hate about Phoenix:
*Low Teacher pay(I am a teacher)
*Police helicopters always out at night
*Meth/opioid epidemic &amp; homelessness which leads to alot of burglaries/crime unless in a gated community.
*Patchwork bad areas-nice neighborhood next to crime infested area and repeated. 
*Rent rising rapidly to be unaffordable.
* Intense Summer/seasons don't change
*So much beige (desert, house/building colors)

Things I love about PHX:
*great boardgaming community
*multicultural with many food options
*alot  of festivals/events
*6 monthes of spring weather for outdoor activities.

 I cannot ask family, because they are new to MI too. I tried looking Reddit history, but it seems like a lot of people move from MI to AZ  &amp; not the other way around.  I am sorry if I do not respond quickly. I have the flu.",Michigan,Moving to MI(Detroit)from AZ(PHX)

1850,1850,snagglesohone,1583526438,fejmb4,Nan,"Despite a favorable court decision that would allow the Secretary of State to continue to suspend driver’s licenses for failure to pay court fees, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson joined with Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Bridget McCormack to help people avoid suspension.

A May decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Fowler v Johnson upheld the Secretary of State’s practice to suspend driver’s licenses, saying: “That this policy may in many cases make that … payment harder to accomplish does not show that the law lacks a rational basis.”

“While it was clear the state would likely prevail, this onerous policy clearly penalized low-income drivers, putting them in a no-win situation by severely limiting their mobility and access to employment,” Nessel said. “It is time to re-evaluate laws that effectively criminalize being poor.”

As a result of the state’s offer to settle the case, the following sentence will be added to Michigan citations and court forms:  “If you are not able to pay any fine or costs due to financial hardship, contact the court immediately to request a payment alternative.”

“I am proud that we are working to stop penalizing poverty,” said Benson. “There is a disconnect of logic in this law, and all Michiganders benefit when we make the justice system more fair.”

The new standard language must be part of the state forms within one year of the effective date of the settlement (Feb. 13, 2021).

“Driver’s license suspensions are one of the leading factors for sky high jail admissions in Michigan,” said Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist. “This action is an important step toward reducing how many people come into contact with the system. It moves us closer to ensuring our policies treat people across the state fairly despite their socio-economic status.”

Chief Justice McCormack agreed.

“This agreement builds on efforts by Michigan’s judiciary to make sure that judges determine on the record a litigant's ability to pay fines and fees and provide those who can't pay with potential alternatives like community service. And it resonates with some key findings and recommendations of the Joint Task Force on Jail and Pretrial Incarceration,” McCormack said. “For example, the Task Force has recommended that licenses should not be suspended for reasons unrelated to safe driving like inability to pay fines and fees. Michigan is poised to become a national leader in criminal justice reform; we can protect rights, makes communities safer, and treat everyone with dignity and respect.”

“Criminal justice reforms, such as this settlement agreement, benefit the entire criminal justice system,” stated Col. Joe Gasper, director of the Michigan State Police. “I applaud the work of the Attorney General’s office and the Department of State to reach this agreement, which supports the important work of the Michigan Joint Task Force on Jail and Pretrial Incarceration led by Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Chief Justice Bridget McCormack.”

1915,1915,peewinkle,1583633647,ff5rye,Nan,"Hi all. We went ahead and implemented a few minor changes that will hopefully reduce the number of low-quality/non-related posts. 

1) All posts must be specifically MI-related regardless of the subject. This includes but is not limited to politics, health and science, and Ohio. 

Posting general national political stuff across multiple subs aka astro-turfing will result in an immediate ban if you do it here. 

Local/state politics are fine, as long *as they are specifically MI-related.* 

2) All news/political posts must be directly from the source. Screenshots of a news article will not be allowed. Same goes for videos and .gifs of news as well, they must be from the official source.  Altered headlines are no longer allowed either; they must be the headline of the linked article when posting. 

3) All pictures must include at least a general location in the title. ""Up north"" is a bit too general but at least the county/park/area, kapeche?

We haven't seen much brigading if any recently aside from a few users who were banned from reddit outright but as always we count on you to help report it. 

Please remember the report function is for when someone breaks the rules, not because you disagree with them. Repeated misuse *will* result in a ban, the admins have been very good about this lately. 

++++++++++++++++

Regarding a contest, well, the new Reddit layout could use a header, icon, etc. If there is interest I will make a sticky to submit to and we can have a vote. Rules will be in the sticky.

2016,2016,Youkilledmyrascal1,1583813508,fg832v,Nan,"Hello Michiganders. I have not been very busy with politics this year: no bumper stickers or signs or canvassing. I’ve mainly been focusing on my speech-language pathology classes that I’m currently taking. But I’m noticing something that I can’t ignore: Joe Biden’s language is revealing that he’s experiencing cognitive decline. I would like to explain this in a way that’s respectful as possible, because I do treat my adult patients in the university clinic with respect, and I believe everyone should be respectful to Biden, too. If this were happening to any political candidate I think the same is true. 

Here is a video that may be useful to watch before and/or after reading this textbook excerpt about the early language-related signs of dementia. 

[https://youtu.be/mvCxJGOkfKo](https://youtu.be/mvCxJGOkfKo)

From the textbook Language Intervention Strategies in Aphasia and Related Neurogenic Communication Disorders, 5th ed. (edited by R. Chapey):

“Intact cognition is necessary for normal communication abilities. As a result of memory and other cognitive impairments, individuals with dementia have considerable difficulty communicating. Most of the research on communication in dementia has been conducted in individuals with Alzheimer-type dementia. Early in the disease, individuals with AD become repetitious and forget what they have heard or read. Over time, the discourse of individuals with AD becomes impoverished and fragmented, and is characterized by a lack of coherence, tangentially, and perseverations. Auditory comprehension of language is also impaired because memory for what was recently seen or heard fades rapidly. Nonetheless, phonology and syntax are relatively preserved into the advanced stages of the disease.” (p. 993)

What this means: Often, changes to speech and language are slow and subtle at first. Grammar might still be good, and the speech might still have all the normal sounds that would be expected. However, the language the person uses may not carry as much coherent meaning as it used to. 

Excerpt from the textbook’s real patient’s language sample from year 1 (Picture description task):

“Well here’s a man reading something. It’s happening, but he’s not looking at the reading. See he’s looking someplace else, and he’s he’s talking to these beautiful ladies here, and also reading his own paper beside. And here’s the little boy. Isn’t he cute?” (p. 993)

What this means: Though the patient uses complete sentences, much of the meaning gets lost. It sounds similar to someone who is very sleepy or a bit disoriented, and may seem more like typical mistakes. When language remains confusing and empty over a long period of time, it’s a sign that it’s not just an “off day” – there is something wrong with cognition that is affecting language.

2017,2017,Thatsplumb,1583826149,fga7li,Nan,"Hi Michigan,

I'm not from the USA but I am worried that you will vote for Biden.

Under Obama he also did fuck all to restore industrial work there, he also did fuck all to solve the water problem (Obama faked drinking your water for fuck sake) Biden is a cheap knock off of Obama, less charisma, less ability to use complete sentances, much less of a back bone (he wouldn't stare down the vlad). 

Bernie isn't radical, coming from outside the USA, he isn't radical, the policies he talks about can be enacted and make everyone's lives slightly better, slightly less stressful, slightly more secure.

Outside of America a Bernie presendancy would drop less bombs (concidering his voting history), this has to be a good thing? It can also help pay for some of his policies I assume, bombs are expencive! And no, this won't weaken your military, you spend 4x anyone else already.

I am working a gig economy job, that just covers my rent and food at the minute, it's stressful, if there is no work I could get cut off / kicked out (a longer process here tho, chances for me to catch up) but we have health care, so, if I do get sick I can go and get sorted. The thought of not being able to go to the doctor because I can't pay for it gives me anxiety! Because I couldnt pay for it right now, then the problem gets worse, affects my ability to work, less money, more stress, puts strain on my relationships as they are in stressful environments, become isolated, depressed, still no medical help. Holy shit, how do you live like that!

Do the world a favour and vote for the candidate that will push for change for the slowest in your community. They will appreciate it and be able to start contributing, then everyones experience gets better.

When Troy Restaurant Week was planned, there was no pandemic. Now there is. There is such thing as safe dining, but you need to find out if the restaurant you wish to visit has all the CDC recommended guidelines in place. Because this is supposed to be a big event for Troy restaurants, many people are already stretched thin and under-prepared for the volume of business. Now add a pandemic. 

We should not panic but we should be smart about this: put pressure in high volume restaurants to reduce the way they pack people in. Don't just cancel your reservations. Call and tell them why. Ask for change. The employees of these restaurants don't want to help spread a disease, but corporate policies make some managers too scared to push for the changes to the restaurants that they need to make. 

Tables should be 6 or more feet apart. If a restaurant wants to go forward with having a packed restaurant and not reducing the space between tables, then I urge you to not visit that restaurant.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Northern Michigan  and am the director of a community driven food pantry. We currently serve about 500 families each month; around 1050 to 1100 people. The people we serve are either a part of the community that do not have insurance, are elderly, and do not have the money or access to the best medical care.

Currently, we are a ""shop your own pantry"", meaning that when people come in, they go around with a volunteer and choose their items. 

Depending on the family size, we let them know know how much of each product they can get. The items change each day,  depending on what we receive in donations. (although we always have certain items in stock).

Everyone who works there are volunteers, no one is paid to help our clients.

I have a core group of people (9 in total) that run the day to day operations. This group of people consists of 2 people who have finished cancer treatment in the last few months, one lady who is 74 years old and has diabetes and kidney issues, two volunteers who have copd and the youngest person is 55 (me). The average age of our volunteers is 65.

I have to admit, the volunteers are nervous with all the things going on and our current government is not much help in the real world. 

I am debating switching to not letting people into the pantry and just packing boxes for everyone. All of the volunteers have expressed concerns about close contact and I have to admit that I an right there with them. My husband has been trying to get me to stay home, saying its not worth the risk.

No one wants to quit yet, but the threat is real.  We know the need is great, especially with all the schools closed and families not having that resource to draw upon.

I guess what I'm wondering is would it be so terrible if we just gave our clients a box of food and did not let them in the pantry?  Everyone is on board to pack boxes and pass them out, but people wouldn't be able to hand pick items.  Would just like some thoughts from the others out there who have already been through these first stages or are finding themselves there now.",Michigan,Coronavirus concerns....

I created a survey  that is inspired by Condé Nast Traveler's YouTube series of ""[50 People from 50 States](https://www.youtube.com/user/condenasttraveler/videos)"". They're very interesting and amazingly edited (often times hilariously). However, they only ask one person to represent each state, which leads to some very skewed results.This poll  will ask you what state you're from, what your state's ""partner in crime"" is, and what your state's biggest rival is. I'm also including DC, because I think they should be included.

I received this email from a co-worker:



Covid 19. From Stanford Hospital Board Member - Sounds like great info and advice for us and loved ones.
﻿
 
I have this from a friend of mine who’s brother is on the Stanford hospital board. This is their feedback for now on Corona virus: The new Coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days.


How can one know if he/she is infected? By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late. Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning.


Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection. In critical time,please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air.


Serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases:

Everyone should ensure your mouth &amp; throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs. That's very dangerous.
 


1. If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold
2. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.
3. This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. It hates the Sun.
4. If someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.
5. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.
6. On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill it.
7. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice.
8. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.
9. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.
10. Can't emphasis enough - drink plenty of water!
 

THE SYMPTOMS
1. It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days
2. The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further.
3. With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.
4. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning.
It's imperative you then seek immediate attention.
 


Spread the word. Please share. Stay safe.

I am a very extroverted personality - I SO enjoy and gain energy and confidence from being around other humans that I can talk to and laugh with. But I’m also actively choosing to self quarantine and socially distance myself until this covid-19 virus calms down. 

I absolutely don’t want this to turn into a stressful political/social conversation. The facts are out there via the CDC, WHO, and state gov sites. Please go there with questions/comments.

I’m putting this post out there with the intention of being present for other people like myself that might be struggling with this situation. I am new to Michigan and have no friends outside of coworkers - which I am unable to be physically with right now due to our corporate guidelines (which I am thankful for given the situation!). 

If you are feeling isolated, alone, anxious, etc, please feel free to reach out to me directly as someone to talk to whether it’s about covid-19 or not. I will welcome any and all human interaction while we’re limited in outside activities. I am all too familiar with the anxiety and depression that will likely arise with this and if talking it out with similar minded people will help you, please allow me to be that resource for you. 

I’m open to talking via message, text, phone, email, FaceTime/Skype, etc. Literally anything that will help comfort other people and give me some interaction vs being by myself. 

I sincerely hope you are all prepared and well and I look forward to hopefully meeting some of you during our next social event, once things calm down and it’s allowed ❤️",Michigan,Fellow extroverts - let’s get through this social distance/quarantine together!

But I work at a fresh thyme in oakland county and everyday since the coronavirus officially came to Michigan, its been packed. I understand that people need their groceries but does that mean that the employees and managers of Fresh Thyme have to sacrifice their own health for the public? Fresh Thyme isn't exactly an essential, must-have grocery store and its impossible to remain 6 feet away from customers. They have to ask questions and check out, we have to take their cash that's been all around the world. I see some people wearing face masks but the cdc says they won't keep people from catching it, it'll only keep people from giving it to others. So, social distancing, SHOT! Face masks, SHOT! Its pretty much impossible to disinfect my station more than I would usually do on the regular because of how busy it is. When i got off lunch i tried to give my station a good wipe down before I opened up again but my supervisor wouldn't let me and told me I needed to hurry up and open, because we were that swamped. So, sanitation, SHOT! I have pre-existing conditions, so I'd rather not be at some crazy crowded store. I need the money but its not like cashiers can work from home. So even if they did close the store, would we all get some kind of supplemental pay until this is all over?",Michigan,Social distancing???

The governor signed an executive order mandating extreme visitor restrictions and every day we get more restrictive. A LOT of people are not aware of this and it’s creating issues. These decisions are well above our pay grade, please do not take it out on hospital staff, we are only trying to keep the most susceptible safe and follow current guidelines.

As of right now each patient is only allowed to select ONE visitor for their entire stay.  No one else may visit the hospital under any circumstances (not even if death is imminent). Hospitals in the area are already restricting this even more by only allowing this visitor in if the patient is actively dying, going for surgery, or in labor.  If the one visitor shows any signs of infection they will be escorted off the property if they do not leave on their own accord.  I can only imagine how incredibly tough this is for patients and their families but patient safety comes first.  These are strange times for us all.

Please make sure you and your loved ones are aware of this so if hospitalization occurs the drastic visiting restrictions do not come as a surprise.

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to the following shows will be getting a refund. 

CT - Manchester

MA - Boston

MI - Westland

NH - Manchester

NJ - Atlantic City, Point Pleasant

NY - Albany, NYC, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Syracuse, White Plains

OH - Cleveland, Perrysburg

ON - Kingston, London

PA - Philly

QC - Montreal

RI - East Greenwich

VT - Burlington

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Poughkeepsie, Manchester NH, and Cleveland have already been rescheduled for October). Meanwhile, I will be hosting a free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.). Some are Q&amp;As with famous people, others are stand-up shows with my comedy buddies from our houses. If you wanna watch, they're free at [YouTube.com/thehofstetter](https://YouTube.com/thehofstetter) every day at 2PM and 8PM ET. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see. 

I'm not sure what to do with all this time at home. Maybe I'll go on a vacation. I hear Italy is nice this time of year.

However, I noticed very clearly in reading the comments on here that the people complaining about a potential shut down are not people living with low income low paying jobs, they're professionals who get paid a decent wage.

I don't understand how some of you can be so, and forgive me for just coming out and saying it, irresponsible and vain as to say you cannot afford to be out of work for one to two weeks making the money that you do. Now I'm a professional as well, I run a shop where my guys are preparing for the worst and even they have money saved up to be able to wait out the storm. Yet some of you are taking well over $1,000/week and don't?

What are some of you guys doing? Spending $990.00/week because you're so vain and so irresponsible that now others, even those far less fortunate than you, have to pay the pied piper to continue your unsustainable lifestyle?  How some of you don't even have some of this money locked away and saved up is absolutely astounding. Paid professionals shouldn't be living paycheck to paycheck.

If laborers and those far less fortunate than you have enough saved up to weather out the storm, then you should have more than enough to do so as well. This virus impacts all of us, but especially targets and takes aim at those less fortunate than you. Seeing some of you here living on two income families or making well over $75k/yr complaining that unemployment wouldn't be enough are extremely selfish. I'm sorry, but in no place on God's green Earth do you make that kind of money, in this state then claim you are a ""minimalist"" and have no money left over. That's absolutely absurd.

If places like New York City and San Francisco can take measures to completely mitigate the disease, giving their overly exorbitant living costs without much complaining, then this state can as well. Maybe learn to save up some of your money instead of spending every single bit and iota of it on your lavish lifestyles, because right now really are showing your lack of humanity for your own personal vanity.

And yeah, I get it, you need it because you're living paycheck to paycheck but you're only doing so because you've lacked the foresight and were irresponsible enough to live well above your means without saving your money. Don't take that out on those less fortunate than you, because right now that's exactly what you're doing.",Michigan,Really astounded by some of the comments I'm reading here

2603,2603,AngryJourno123,1584537071,fkpacf,Nan,"It's safe to say that Whitmer's response to the outbreak has been well received so far for her taking quick action to try and curb the effects of the pandemic as much as possible. Most of which was outlined by [public comments on her Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GovWhitmer/status/1239919587266826241) as well as [various posts on this sub yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Michigan/comments/fk8yrk/governor_whitmer_responds_to_trumpa_attacks_shes/), it's been pretty surreal to see Michigan and governor  Whitmer under the national spotlight so quickly, so, while we have so many eyes on us for better or for worse, why don't we lead the nation by example for how to properly respond to this unprecedented epidemic? While what we've done so far is good (for the moment), it is largely no different from the responses that have been coming out of red states like Ohio. If Whitmer really wants to shine, she should take this crisis as an opportunity to outline what a progressive response to this situation should look like

Using public resources like our university system and it's great minds to aggressively research a cure for this disease and then distributing the product to our 10 million residents free of charge purely out of a sense public good and solidarity would be an extraordinarily amazing policy and legislative coup against the pharma industry, which, looks all but guaranteed to come out of this crisis *ludicrously* more profitable than they went into it because of how our stupendously broken healthcare system currently works where [people like pneumonia patients are billed for receiving treatments that aren't covered by their insurance providers even though they went to hospitals ""in their network""..](https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-03-16/what-coronavirus-treatment-could-cost-privately-insured-patients)

Because of the likely costs of the vaccine on the private market, it's increasingly evident that a crisis of this scale won't be solved by simply ""letting the market work itself out"". What's needed is decisive and swift action by state and local leaders to nip this in the bud as quickly as possible and to provide relief for every person affected by the knock-on economic consiquences of this outbreak. Which, we're in the middle of right now, while the response so far has been fast, without any further action policy action, especially due to the fact that people like me have had their hours cut or have been laid off entirely, I think the situation could go from ""okay-ish"" to SHTF in a week or two..

That's why in combination to the mass-research drive that I'm suggesting, I strongly think Whitmer should follow the lead of places around the world like Italy and suspend all rent and mortgages payments, obligations to debts, loans, and interest, freeze all utility payments and match dollar for dollar any personal checks or IOU's that come out of DC so she can take the GOP's tanks off of the Democrats' 'front lawn'. Since there are probably countless millions of people across the country newly unemployed because of the needed virus prevention and the economic shocks that its causing, these solutions are absolutely needed for Michigan's working class communities that survive on a paycheck to paycheck basis and, letting the Republicans out-flank Dems on social programs while maintaining their bigoted xenophobia is a recipe for electoral disaster.

I've been a vocal and ardent critic of Whitmer and her time as governor since she was elected due to my leftist political leanings, you can check through my post history and see for yourself, if she actually has the political will to pull all of this off though, she'd have my unflinching support until the next general election. I'm a working age 22 y/o, so I'm definitely a demo that she'd have to reach out to when the time comes anyways

It's not only a good thing to do, but, it's the right thing to do as well, so.. Whitmer should get at it!",Michigan,"Whitmer should push for the state's Universities &amp; Community Collegs to do some Research into a generic covid19 vaccine and when it's fully developed, distribute it to the public for free"

I tried the website on Monday and repeatedly got errors and couldn't do anything productive despite repeated refreshing of the website as others suggested. I called the phone number instead and was met with a brick wall, finally got someone on the phone and told them I was trying to file and they directed my call to the automated phone system. Got through all of the questions there and then it said I needed to speak with an agent. But by that time it was just after 4:30 so the automated system immediately changed tone and said there were no agents available because I ""called outside of normal business hours"" and that I would need to call back during normal business hours to start the process over again.

Now I'm trying to file online and the website seems to be more stable, but for some reason it will not allow me to file a new claim. It's got me locked into an old unemployment claim I made back in 2012 which has obviously long since been expired and closed. But there are zero options for me to create a new claim.

Now I see that UIA has decided to close their offices to in person appointments and are now closing call centers at 3pm instead of 4:30. Live chat seems to also be disabled after 3pm because I received this message when I tried opening a live chat at about 3:15:

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now.

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule 10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

Most of the contention comes from the amount of the payout, and, instead of using political, moral, or philosophical arguments to persuade readers here to view the topic one way or another based on how the conversation has played out so far (i.e. not productive at all), hopefully if we utilize the objective truth of math to illuminate some facts, bring clarity to the conversation, and make the general public more informed about this issue, it could possibly help our policy makers make the right decision when it comes to solving the crisis through legislation.

###Thought Experiment

Let's assume a couple of things:

1. You work(ed) part-time at Jimmy John's for 30 hours/week before the virus hit

2. While working, you can make one sub in 4 minutes, so consequently, you're able to make ~15 subs in an hour 

3. Each sub you're able to sell is worth $7.50

Before the virus came through and ripped up any shreds of consumer buying power in the economy, a single part-time worker was able to produce and successfully sell $1,000 worth of food just off of nine hours of work ($7.50x15=$112.5, $112.5x9=$1,012.9). So, essentially, your average ""low level employee"" unknowingly contributes a small bit over $1k worth of value to a company for nothing more than a day and a half's worth of work. 

If you take the math further out, the figures get even more stark, that same employee produces $3,375 worth of food over the course of their 30 hour week ($112.5x30=$$3,375), and a staggering $13,500 worth of food over the course of a month assuming the month is four weeks long (30x4=120, $112.5x120= $13,500).

Of course, that assumes that this part-timer doesn't ever go on any breaks, call in sick, use the bathroom etc. but, employees should be expected to do that, and even when you factor those caveats into these equations, the amount of wealth that your average joe Jimmy John's sub maker's own two hands creates vastly outstrips not only the possible dividend but especially what that worker is paid in wages..

If this is the case for a lowly sub shop worker, imagine what labor value you contribute to your industry as opposed to what you're paid or got paid... Keep these numbers in mind as this conversation develops.",Michigan,"the possible $1k payout from Washington due to the effects of COIVD-19 and whether or not if its enough, too much, or, just right using nothing but math"

My employer said nuts to that and told us to stay open even though 60% of the customer base is 55+ and most if not all have respiratory problems from decades of cigarette smoking. So I walked out. 

I’m probably going to spiral into debt before all this blows over but weighed against the lives of your grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, children and friends my choice was so much easier. 

The true cost of going to work right now when you feel in your heart that something is wrong isn’t going to be the things you own but the people you love. 

Bottom line is your employer isn’t going to do the right thing because it’s just not profitable. It is now in your hands to do the right thing. My actions were drastic and one way or another I’m going to pay for them, at least now I sleep easier knowing I’m not affecting the health of yours or my loved ones. 

That is the real choice employers are asking you to make.

It is long past time that we said NO to a system that asks us for our well being and health to live a decent life, that asks us to risk everything and only compensate you for labor. 

So I offer you another option, organize with your coworkers and call-in en masse. Do what you can to SHUT THEM DOWN and let them fear the same financial burden you will. Let them know that the relationship between employer and employee has to be revisited with your actions. 

You don’t have to quit your job to do the right thing but there are things that are in your power to ensure the health and safety of every person you know and every person they know.

I work as a cashier at a car dealership in Wayne County and we have not closed down. It has been busier than usual due to the other business closures and people migrating to the ones that are open. I sit about 10 feet from the full waiting room and interact with 30+ strangers per day. I cash out customers 3 feet away from me and have to touch their credit cards and cash. 

Lysol wipes, spray, and hand sanitizer are the only precautions my work is taking.

For three days within a week I have been experiencing severe migraine level headaches and sinus congestion. No fever or shortness of breath, but enough for me to call off work. I called a Covid-19 hotline to get a screening and they said I wasn't ""high risk"" enough to get tested due to my age and no fever. Even though they won't test me, I still need a doctor's note that says I am symptom-free in order to go back to work. Even if this isn't Covid-19, it is apparent that my workplace is not taking this seriously enough.

I strongly URGE you to stay home and not go out unless absolutely necessary. I understand many people look at this as a vacation and an opportunity to ""get things done"" (like getting your oil changed etc), but the numbers are climbing every day due to this carelessness.

To begin, this run on toilet paper is utterly ridiculous. People keep buying every bit they can find the second it hits a store. And stores with no limit per customer, run out, for half a week or a full week with in an hour of putting the stock out. 

The hand sanitizer, masks and other things like wipes is seeing the same thing. 

I'm on board with all sports shutting down, the schools, concerts and theaters. 

I personally believe resturaunts are a bridge too far, I believe the above mentioned closings will stem the tide, at least for our State, well enough. For other cities and States, maybe that's not the case. (Hear me out on this point, but first, I just want to recap a clue of things).

The point is, this is past stopping the virus, we know we can't do that. Even if everything shut down. This is about slowing the virus down, so our health system can handle this. Because of our Federal Government acting too late  ( not to mention China's initial cover up), this made it impossible for some communities to make handle this disease and manage the disease 

And then, as a result of our Federal Government's slow action,  all the major sports shut down, it created panic with all the Hoopleheads, ( who got scared and confused and bought all the TP and sanitizer up ). When the Big Ten shuts down just at the start of a game, the fans freak out. (They knew shit was about to get real.) I didn't mention some Mayors and Governors who acted earlier, because that didn't create the panic that the sports did.

So, already people began to panic. Then, Monday, it was ordered that the bars, resturaunts, well, you know the rest. Here's my problem. 

The first problem, is that these businesses are still open for Carry out. So if and when a worker gets sick and doesn't know it, for days or even a.week, there's a chance they'll infect those customers anyway. And that's even if they can afford not to work sick. ( I worked in the service industry, food or retail, they don't care if you're sick. You call in, you could be fired, or just not scheduled. They do not care. )

My second  issue, every other business besides the ones they closed, retail not involving food or a needed service, stayed open with no restrictions.

Not everyone goes to the bar or even dines in a restaurant. But everyone goes to the drug store and the grocery store. Both of which we need, but, without restrictions?! 

What's the point of destroying your locally owned resturaunt, gym to other affected business for the sake of safety when these other gaps, make it the effort moot?! 

Businesses will close for good, unless this rdoes lift on March 30th, then, maybe most will survive. But, this might go on for longer. And if it does end with March, the order to stop was pointless anyway. 

The media as a whole, has really worked people into a panic. Doing more than just highlighting the worst case scenarios, they're making them seem inevitable. So, people support these measures. 

To close, I believe this was a half measure, that wasn't needed. But, if they were going to do this, then they  needed to give businesses a chance to prepare and shut down ALL unnecessary businesses and restrict many of the ones that aren't. 

Corona isn't going away.

2740,2740,BrownSugaWinky,1584662012,flknly,Nan,"So I'm having a hard time with this if I'm being honest. I've worked for this resoration company in Midland for a couple of years now and while there's always been some fishy things about the way they do things, it's never been this bad. This all started a few months ago when said employer started demanding we reuse dirty tyvek suits and 3m N95 paper masks that have been used in hazardous conditions such as mold, sewage, soot and anything else you could imagine. There has been some backlash from some employees but that was only met with lame excuses and unfair treatment by management. I can also recall several times being exposed to asbestos without any warning by management. Wether this was due to lack of evaluation or just shady business idk. Of course any employee whom expressed being uncomfortable working in such conditions was again, given a ridiculous excuse, mistreated and ridiculed. Now with this covid-19 situation they've shown me that I really cant trust these people to keep me or my co-wokers(many of whom have health issues) safe. Recently they've been cheaping out on everything especially PPE. This past week the janitorial department was finally provided with a honeywell half face respirator but they weren't provided with the filter cartridges. According to the owner of our company, they dont need the cartridges because the masks have built in filters. That doesn't seem right to me at all but I haven't been able to find any information proving otherwise. Luckily those of us in other departments(fire and water) who have been using them for a while, warned those on janitorial side about it which must've scared management enough to provide them with the cartridges shortly after. This being after janitorial employees already went on a couple sanitizing jobs where covid-19 was rumored to be. Mind you, none of us are comfortable with dealing with these conditions and no one is being compensated in anyway They just keep telling us that we should be honored that we're almost like first responders and that it'll look good for the company. To make things worse, the project manager on janitorial side is becoming known for lying to her employees about the hazardous conditions on these jobs. I'm assuming so they won't refuse going.  We've had some employees recently refuse to go on some of these jobs and quit which resulted in the employees who stayed, getting yelled at and blamed for not convincing them otherwise.  All in all, theres so much more I could go on and on about with this place. I just needed to vent about these recent concerns and see what others had to say about what we're dealing with. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if I'm wrong to be suspicious about some of these things. I wish I had documented evidence to back up these stories but I dont unfortunately. Maybe ill try to get some during my last few weeks there. Luckily I've already found a new job that I'll be starting soon. I'm just worried about the exposure my co-workers will be dealing with and the potential of exposing customers as well so I feel like I needed to say something. These co-workers of mine are wonderful people who deserve better than being lied to and manipulated by management due to there lack of knowledge about safety equipment and precautions. Anyways, thanks for reading. Stay safe everyone..",Michigan,Anyone else dealing with a shady employer trying to force employees to work in areas covid-19 has been confirmed?

Long story short, I am a fulltime, salaried veterinarian and was hired by a corporate veterinary company to work in their Oakland county location on Jan. 15th, and as such my PTO isn't available for use until April 12th.

Corporate made the decision to close all of their clinics across the United States in response to the outbreak. We had an emergency meeting tonight with the district manager to address the closure and he wasn't sure what to answer when I asked him how my lack of immediately available PTO will play out for the closure. 

I am very worried as I am a sole provider. He said he would try to have an answer for me tomorrow...but I am a nervous wreck right now and was hoping someone may be able to shed light as to whether or not I should consider myself unemployed (or if that is even something that can be determined based on the circumstances).

Any other tips for apartment dwellers?

But none the less, I've been attacked for speaking the truth.

Downvote all you want it isn't going to stop this from happening.

**I want to empathize with you for a moment**.

I have children and a wife and a house and two cars and a life and a job and a bank account and a neighborhood and friends and pets and LIFE. I'm not some neckbearded troll looking to piss people off. I'm genuinely concerned about the people who don't see what is coming.

I know this is hard to imagine, I know that you have hope that it can't be as bad as it looks. I'm sorry but it is what it is. 

There are just shy of 10 million people living in Michigan right now. JUST Michigan in all of it's vast and lengthy suburbia and forest. In NYC ALONE their are 8 million people. 

NYC is 302.6 square miles. 8 million people.

Michigan is 96,712 square miles. 10 million people.

Where do you think 8 million people are going to go to avoid being near each other and transmitting COVID-19 in such a densely populated area? 

Indoors, yeah? 

Well they fucking didn't.

In fact they went to bars and restaurants and parks and airports and retail stores and government buildings and everywhere. 

Only a small population self quarantined QUICK ENOUGH to prevent themselves from getting sick.

So now everyone in NYC is reported to have been exposed to the virus and government officials are projecting that 70-80% of the population will be infected. That's 6.5 million people, if the virus keeps it's death rate trajectory at 4.3% that's 260,000 people dead in JUST NYC.

For comparison - just over 300,000 American soldiers died in WW2.

Multiply that by every major metropolitan area of the world. 

This is an unprecedented disaster that has been met with an incompetent response by the federal government and now partisanship will drag out any sort of economic relief to the people and businesses who need it the most. 

We don't have the resources, the response team, or the time to pull off the containment measures that people here and elsewhere keep alluding to as being our saving grace. 

And you can't just whip up a vaccine like some special salad dressing combination and pass it out to the population at large - *more* people could be hurt by that.

The window of opportunity that we had to prevent this was shut abruptly when the current government decided that acting in the best interests of the stock market was more important than tracking down infections and quarantining. We had **at a minimum** of a 3 month lead time on this disaster and NOTHING was done to prepare for it, in fact the team assembled by the previous administration that was comprised of experts in the field of pandemic response had been disassembled and cut as an Obama era roll back. 

Now we are full steam ahead into something that many people are refusing to acknowledge and people are blindly attaching themselves to hope that likely doesn't exist.

*This is something that experts and professionals have been sounding the alarm on for decades. This is the worst case scenario that they had been shouting at the top of their lungs and now that it's here you have two choices.*

You can keep moving along day by day hoping for things to get better and gravitating towards information that confirms that bias **OR** you can look at what is happening and prepare for it now before you don't have the time and resources to do so.

We are blessed to be in this country, it is very likely that we have been given a solid amount of time to prepare for the worst of this but you have to start now. 

Don't be so illusioned by the false comfort this system gives you by offering you near infinite choices to buy to your heart's content and consume until you can't. 

We survived up until now and we can survive into the future by adopting the simplicity we built our humanity upon.

Do what you have to to become self sufficient. Build a community in your neighborhood. Create a commune of people with cooperation and trust. 

Do it now before you can't at all.

The facts and information are available to you.

3039,3039,ConnorCarbon,1584967619,fnjdkp,Nan,"Neighboring Ohio just issued stay at home orders and Michigan should have a week ago. I am in a small up north city and the very Michiganders who are most vulnerable to serious illness and death from COVID (older people) seem to be the ones milling around our city touching everything.

Then, looking on here, I see that a big number of them seem to be ""down-staters"" and, even worse, I see that your reasons for being here were casual. Understand that the up north communities are not playgrounds for you to venture out to when you want to stretch your legs during this pandemic. We have limited medical capabilities in northerly towns and in some of nicer coastal areas we also have a significant percentage of seniors and people over age 55. These are the same people prone to death, as a reminder, and if you're that same age and traveling around loosely right now, why?

Look at the maps of coronavirus cases in Michigan so far. They are (understandably) almost entirely downstate. The up north ones are mostly from people returning from air travel, but we've already seen an ""actually local"" case in Traverse City.

I really hope those from down state (or anywhere) will absolutely cancel all non-essential travel throughout the state immediately but especially up north travel. I'm 30 and healthy, but I am genuinely concerned about how Michigan residents older than me are not taking this seriously enough. I see about 50 people a day when I drive through Traverse City just walking around taking pictures of things. Less than 5 of them are young people (under 40).

Please understand that millions of younger Americans who don't even need to stay home in self-quarantine since they're unlikely to fall seriously ill from COVID-19 are all losing their minds, canceling dates, plummeting further into depression and loss of morale about the world, and so on ALL JUST TO PROTECT PEOPLE YOUR AGE FROM UNNECESSARY SUFFERING.

So please quit being ""typical boomers"" and cross contaminating the vulnerable communities of Michigan because you felt like going for a drive as a creature of habit.

If you must travel up north, complete this check list:

1. Have an essential and dire need to come here
2. Know that you and all others with you have not left your immediate surroundings for 14 days or otherwise have tested negative for coronavirus the same day you want to come up here.
3. Put on gloves the moment you step out of your vehicle once you arrive and keep all mouth-related activities to a minimum (talking, sneezing, coughing, yawning, spitting, smoking, blowing nose, etc) unless ONLY in outdoor areas the entire time.
4. Wash (not just sanitize but wash) your hands before touching anything commonly touched by the general public for the entire duration of your up north visit
5. Touch and/or make mouth contact with as few things as possible in the given area for the duration
6. Either plan to stay here for the duration of this (up to 3 months or more) or get out of here as soon as possible.
7. If you own property up here, fine. It's your right to visit it! BUT STAY PUT. Don't come up and then go back down because you're bored. Pick one or the other and stay there. This is not the time for importing and exporting a ""boomer remover"" virus from one area of Michigan to another because you're set in your ways of milling around like the good old days.

This is with all due respect, but understand our government is lethargic and should have ordered us to stay in place a week ago or more. If they won't tell you to stay put and quit floating around, random strangers like me have to, I guess.",Michigan,"Please don't travel up north (northern lower or the UP) ""just for fun"" right now"

3176,3176,Probads,1585006529,fnuj61,Nan,"So I need to vent and get this off my chest, a little bit of background:

I work in a test lab, we do testing for the automotive industry, typically pre production parts / vehicles. On the rare occasion we will do safety recall testing, but this is rare and we haven't done any in a while.

Today after the announcement everyone at my facility, my boss included, were preparing to close today and open on the 13th as with everyone else. My boss got a call at 1530 from his boss (local area manager basically) saying that we were an ""essential business"" and that we would be staying open.

It is a large company that has locations all over the world, and some of the facilities do pharmaceutical testing, but the local Michigan labs are all automotive testing locations.

Normally I would be OK with working in a situation like this, but as I'm sure a lot of companies do, mine claims ""safety is our number one concern"". This year has been kind of rough for our Michigan locations financially, and this decision to stay open seems like it is purely money based. Our location is basically surrounded by all of the areas with high covid 19 confirmed cases.

We haven't always worked for this company, we are an acquisition (we get bought/sold like every 3 years), and it seems like whatever loophole they have found, it is going to make us stay open. If I thought we were an essential business I would understand staying open, but the large majority of our customers aren't working currently, and we aren't doing any work right now, nor will we be, that would be ""necessary to sustain or protect life"". 

And I get it, it's rough out there right now, I am grateful that I still have a job, i get that businesses have to make money. They say they are doing a bunch of really good things, but they have yet to show that they actually do any of the things they say they do. Safety only seems first when it doesn't cost any money or affect the bottom line.

I'm sure I'm not the only one, what are your guys opinions?

Saturday, my boss told me I should probably file for unemployment and I was given the impression we would not be working if given the orders. 

We talked today and I’m still expected to come in. We still have clients that want our services. I filed for unemployment today and he knew I was doing it. I will not scam the system. I told him I’m not comfortable working and he didn’t fight me on it but I knew he was not happy. 

My other coworker is very new, she is going to continue to work but told me she is very uncomfortable doing so. 

I’m feeling an immense amount of guilt for not working. I’ve been with the company 11 years and I never put my foot down but I feel like if anytime this is the time to do so.

I am only wanting to ride my motorcycle to get a bit of activity and much needed alone time. I wouldn't be stopping at gas stations, I have a couple gas cans of rec. fuel onhand.

After reading through Whitmer's stay-at-home order in detail, I'm a little confused as to whether or not I can take my motorcycle for a solo ride. The order says we can ""Engage in outdoor activities like walking, hiking running, biking"", though I'm sure biking means bicycling here. The order's language on what you can't do is pretty specific though, and doesn't say anything about going for a cruise.

I injured my knee a month ago, and have been riding my motorcycle whenever the roads are dry to get my much needed dose of outdoor time (I used to ride a bike with a foot clutch, so riding ""one legged"" is easy for me).

Sorry if this is a ignorant question, I'm not sure if I just ""don't get it"", but I have a hard time seeing how going for a ride would harm our community. FWIW, my partner, our kid, and myself have been social distancing for the past 10 days; the only exceptions have been to get groceries and necessary supplies.

[Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issues 'stay at home' order for Michigan](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-522625--,00.html)

Governor Whitmer Signs ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"" Executive Order - Temporary requirement to suspend activities that are not necessary to sustain or protect life

Though sweeping, it includes exemptions for essentials such as:

* Shopping for food or medicine
* Getting needed medical treatment
* Getting fuel
* Walking a pet
* Walking for exercise
* Staffing to allow maintenance of ""minimum basic operations"" for many employers

Essential workers such as police, fire, hospital, grocery store and pharmacy workers are also exempted, as are their workplaces.

Violating the order is a criminal misdemeanor, the order says, and could also result in businesses being shut down.

I apologize: there are a lot of new posts on this subreddit, and I admit I may have missed questions similar to mine. To keep things simple and quick, here are my two questions: 

\- I work as a safety compliance officer for a small logistics company. My industry and my position, to the best of my knowledge, are deemed critical and therefore exempt from shelter-in-place orders. Do I need to have a letter from my employer, or can I simply say that I'm on my way to work at Place of Business X? 

\- There is a DNR-operated nature center a five-minute drive from my house. Given that the DNR is advertising that its trails remain open, is it safe to presume that Section 7a of the Executive Proclamation--which states Michigan residents may ""travel as necessary"" to engage in ""outdoor activities""--covers vehicle travel to the same?

Stay the fuck home idiots. The same ignorance the drivers of this state practice on the roads is being displayed in public, where lack of awareness and a complete disregard for following orders prevails over common sense.

I know many of you are glued to Fox News and don’t heed to the nonchalant warnings the president has ineffectively portrayed. You don’t need to bring your whole fucking family to Meijer. You don’t necessarily need to go to bass pro shops and other hunting outlets at the moment for your apocalypse needs.

I'm posting this as a way to ask if anyone has any information on my situation. 

I'm currently at home with my family in the Rochester area, and my significant other is with theirs in the Grand Rapids area. They would like to meet with me this weekend in Lansing (where we reside the rest of the year) and hang out, but I feel like that's a bad idea and I feel very anxious doing this because of the spread of COVID within Oakland county. Also, my dad had to go to a hospital recently for unrelated reasons and I would rather not put their family at risk if I somehow pass something to my SO.

I'm trying my best to limit my movement across the state, and honestly I'm terrified of getting sick. I also miss my SO though. What's the right move?",Michigan,Is it okay to visit significant others?

Mods please let me know if this isn't allowed. I will delete. 

I'm a Michigan transplant (no pun intended) and where I grew up, if you wanted vegetable seeds, you went to talk to your friendly neighborhood farmer depending on what variety you wanted. I tried the store bought seeds last year and was overwhelmingly unimpressed. 

Sooo.....I'm kinda hoping someone can point me in a direction where I can get quality seeds for my vegetable garden this year. I'd prefer to buy local but I'm in metro Detroit so....not many farmers in the area but maybe someone is close and could hook me up with some places to look. 

I am literally talking about vegetable seeds. This has seemed to be a problem thus far. I'm specifically looking for: 

Tomato's
Zucchini
Yellow summer squash
Sweet peppers
Sweet corn
Possibly pumpkins 

I'm not super picky on the variety. Any help is appreciated!",Michigan,Any farmers selling seeds?
3425,3425,michiganick,1585232311,fpc95t,Nan,"I work for a plywood and lumber treating facility. It's a national company with a dozen locations.  We apply mostly fire retardant and have a couple large customers for preservative.   The larger of the two preservative customers uses them for high end boats and the other is a building products company.  We are not open to the public and only treat material that's brought in on rail cars and then ship out 10 to 30 units at a time on trucks.  Nearly 100% of the time, the wood we load is just delivered to other wholesaler building supply companies, not delivered urgently to job sites.

I've read Whitmer's EO on michigan.gov, FAQ page for the EO and CISAs documents as well.  The company claims we fall under critical manufacturing yet anything I'm reading about that sector applies to medical supply manufacturing. I tried tying into the construction sector and it does get a little vague, but the concepts I gather and interpret still point toward construction of medical related things. 

We employ 60+- people at our location here (mostly general labor) and right now about half or two thirds are calling off. There's about 6 of us that work in the office together and most of us floating in and out into the yard.  

They've allowed the regional manager (we'll call them) to fly to visit is twice during this pandemic only to just be here to make phone calls, print some things and hold a meeting to tell us how much of an essential service we are 🙄.  

The employer has not cut production personell,demands or hours, shipping times are the same and we're told that there's no issue staying home at will for self containment - but our job might not be here when it's over. Great...

There's an office full of salespeople at corporate selling freaking wood treatment - telling me that's essential?  We have 5 to 15 trucks per day come in and out - telling me moving wood around the country is essential over putting those trucks to work moving medical supplies or any other relevant commodity right now? Granted they are mostly flatbeds.

I'm struggling.  Everyone at work feels used - used to keep our employer's pockets swelling and our health at risk.  They're not making any efforts to screen us, and as of a matter of fact, during an earlier meeting in the week, the same regional manager told everyone here that the only way you can get sick is direct contact with a symptomatic carrier.  100% false because part of the reason this virus is so bad is because of non-symptomatic contagiousness.  We're being lied to for the sake of profit and I know we're not the only employees victim to this behavior. 

Who can employees like me call to get info? To get a real answer if there's wrongdoing here and how to act on and defend ourselves.",Michigan,Who can we call to inquire about or report non-essential employers remaining open?

&gt;LANSING — Michigan has not yet requested  a major disaster declaration for the coronavirus, a spokesman for the  Federal Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  administration of President Donald Trump has already declared major  disasters for Texas, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, New York, California and  Washington, officials confirmed.  
&gt;  
&gt;But for Michigan,  where the number of confirmed cases topped 2,200 Wednesday, with at  least 43 deaths, ""FEMA has not yet received a request for a major  disaster declaration,"" spokesman Michael Hart said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tiffany  Brown, a spokeswoman for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, said Wednesday morning  that state officials were ""reviewing and looking into"" a request to  FEMA. By Wednesday afternoon, after the Free Press published a story on  the issue, Brown said officials were ""working urgently"" on a disaster  request. She did not immediately respond to a question about why the  request was not completed sooner.",Michigan,FEMA Claims Michigan Failed to Submit Request for Major Disaster Declaration

And I'm willing to cut the President some slack since many nations are struggling to attach a timeline to this virus, but these briefings are not helping when it comes to understanding if there is a concrete plan in place with a timeline to deal with this virus. I feel like Pence and the Doctor do a better job articulating their policies across than Trump does. 

So it seems the only thing we know is that we want to reach the peak in cases and allow it slow down with this shelter in place. But, this does not seem to be working in some places. Italy had a temporary slowdown in cases but then it picked up again. China claims to have no new local cases and I don't believe that. 

So as a country if this doesn't work out do we just continue the shelter in place orders or begin to lie like China in order to get economy on a running foot again? What do we do as the state of Michigan? Shelter in place for a month or two? And slowly transition back to normal life? I approve of the governors job so far and have faith in her moving forward. I'm just curious how will states and nations recover from this pandemic.

The person in this video used a program called Tectonix to track data points from cell phones to see where the people partying on a single beach in Ft Lauderdale went once spring break was over.

No surprise it shows many of these cell phones can be traced back to Michigan as many people enjoy going down to Florida for Spring Break to get away from cold weather. I was surprised to see that Detroit seems to be the 2nd most dense area of cell phone activity in the US that can be traced to this SINGLE beach in Ft Lauderdale Florida

No personally-identifiable information is collected, I'm not affiliated with any restaurant business, and made the results open for anyone at the end of the survey. Here is the link if you'd be interested in giving insights - https://forms.gle/pso7fmft6tegTKNT6

Some background information on this. I've seen so many articles about restaurants being on the verge of going out of business, due to people sheltering in place (which is absolutely critical). I wanted to take advantage of this crisis to gain some in-the-moment insight as to what might be driving more/less patronage of these businesses, both to help restaurants make informed decisions right now, and also for extra insight when this happens again in the future.

If you wouldn't mind taking a moment to fill out the survey, that would be great! It should take less than 3 minutes, I'm not collecting any person information (to the extent that Google allows that), and the results are open for anyone to see at the end of taking the survey. Thanks a lot, hopefully this will be a helpful resource for businesses and restaurants!",Michigan,"I wanted to help restaurants understand what is driving their change in order-frequency during this pandemic, so I made an open survey."

If we can find people with space who are willing to take and store them, and we were able to get them in touch with some volunteers to help get it to them. we could help keep these out of the garbage and stored somewhere until they were able to be recycled again. I for example live out in a rural area and would be able to easily set up some temporary sheds and such to store the ones I will have, I could also store quite a bit more. We would of course have to be as sanitary as possible and be safe to minimize exposure between those who were doing this but I think that is achievable.

Then when we finally can return them we can use the returns from the recycling to buy food and goods to bring to people to help them get back on their feet at that time. Anybody think this could work? Know anyone who could help or might be interested?",Michigan,Bottles and Cans

3701,3701,CoreyHamiltonBuis,1585445126,fqx3ft,Nan,"Ok, first of all, I do not support secession. At this point in time, that is a ridiculous notion. Disclaimer away: I proposed a joke to my group of friends regarding the situation with our governor and the President. Now, from what I understand, the initial situation has resolved. At the time, I asked my friends, ""If the President does not want to support Michigan, and if we must still provide taxes to support everyone else during this crisis, and if we are essentially being put on our lonesome, then perhaps... we should pull an 1861 and leave the union. I followed that with the suggestion that our state runs to Trudeau's arms and our deer and their maple syrup will forever rejoice. Yada yadda, you get the joke.  


I thought it might be fun to take that proposition in the joke and have a conversation about it. Let's ask, ""What if Michigan tried to secede?"" We can talk about what could realistically happen or we could have a discussion about how an independent state of Michigan would act in the world. I'm sure the Great Lakes would be a major international issue. And, of course, there would be the ""dark horse"" and would the state have to bend down to the Queen and join with the northern moose people.   


I guess a start would be to ask if such an event is even realistic. I would argue that it isn't, but I thought it would be fun to talk about.",Michigan,What if Michigan pushed for independence?

&gt;QUESTION: What if you had **symptoms**, but you’re over them now. Can you still get tested and how do you know when you can leave your house?

&gt;Dr. Agarwal: If you did have symptoms, it very well **could** have been coronavirus. If the symptoms are much better, to test at this point it’s probably not going to offer much. What I would recommend is staying home. Give yourself 14 days. At that point, it would be safe to say that you’re allowed to leave the house.

I read this as: you **could** have had Covid, but don't bother being certain and getting a test. Just wait 14 days, and if it was; you're good. If it wasn't; go out and try again?

It just seems, from my limited point of view, health pros are trying to keep people from requesting a definitive diagnosis up  offering bad advice to percent it.

The shopper showed up and she was 7 or 8 months pregnant! I wanted to cry. She's putting herself in danger during a time like this. We had already tipped her and didn't have cash, but I probably would have given her more. Maybe a 25% tip or even 30%.

Obviously, we can't afford a grocery bill like that every week, but this was to stock up. So on the rare occasion we're putting someone else's health in danger while we stay distanced, I feel like a good tip is necessary.

But I'm reading that a typical tip is 5-10 dollars? I hope those who can spare some money are being a little more generous toward their shoppers during this crisis.

Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

I am asking this on the behalf of my nephew .

They were set to graduate from college in Michigan next month and would have more likely been employed if it weren't due to the current circumstances.

Their only job at the moment is some student job at their college and they make about $200 every two weeks. They still get paid as they do work online. And no one is claiming them as a dependent as far as I know. I personally help them with some food, clothes and some pocket money, but that's about it.

I personally feel they would need the unemployment benefits money as they need to rent something, as they will need to exit their college's owned apartment when the semester finishes next month.

Also will they be considered eligible under the new Cares bill and/or because there is an active Presidential declaration of  disaster? [https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-523450--,00.html](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98158-523450--,00.html)

In my opinion, anyone affiliated - or who shops - at Walmart Should be Demanding at least three lifesaving measures. If your family is bored, here is something for them to demand about. There Customer Service Line is: 1-800-925-6278.

1. All Walmart Employees receive explicit training on how to protect themselves which is directly in line with both the World Health Organization and the CDC. Including, but not necessarily limited to, Personal Protective Equipment, Handwashing technique (there are specific requirements to kill Covid), and instructions on how to effectively social distance.
2. A single customer per cart with explicit instructions provided to them in order to keep both them and the associates safe.
3. Sufficient incentivization to stay home if the associate or people they associate lives with are at risk. What if you live with your grandma and she starts coughing. Can you call in? How about if you are in the store and people start coughing? What if you live with a vulnerable person (elderly, chronic health issues)? The associates should be protected! DEMAND IT NOW!!

If you're not an essential business you need to close and you need to protect your employees. We're confident that the vast majority of people are going to do the right thing.""

Violating the executive order, which ends April 13, is punishable by a misdemeanor, $500 fine and up to 90 days in jail.

Quote is from https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/03/how-to-report-if-your-non-essential-workplace-is-still-open-during-michigans-coronavirus-stay-home-order.html

All these companies are doing exactly that, playing fast and loose with the rules. A $500 fine is hardly much of a deterrent for a factory to close their doors if they've already made the choice to remain open. I work in a factory and we are business as usual. I have many friends who also work at other factories as well. Same story for them and theirs. In fact from everything I can tell more of these factories are still open than aren't. All these businesses are quite simply ignoring our Governor's executive order and ignoring the public health risk as well as ignoring the risk to their employees. When the penalty for staying open is so minuscule why would these places close? No one is enforcing this executive order. It's being treated like a joke. 

Later today Whitmer is expected to announce the closing of schools for the year yet millions of people still must work because their business's owners are greedy and there is literally no penalty for them to remain open. This is total bullshit and our federal and state's government have been completely incompetent in handling this crisis. 

Please report any businesses (especially factories) that you see still open. Perhaps our local law enforcement will take our public safety more seriously.",Michigan,Too many non-essential businesses are still open

We've added two Michigan-themed [community awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/): the Michigan Coat of Arms and the Michigan State Seal. You'll find these if you go to award a comment or post. We'd love to make them cheaper but Reddit doesn't allow them below 500 coins. Either way we thought they'd make a nice addition to our subreddit.

The good news is that we have room for more. Unfortunately r/Michigan had to fire our entire art department due to an unfortunate incident with a Faygo 3-liter bottle and someone wearing clown makeup. That is where we could use your help in coming up with more awards. The rules are simple:

* The image needs to be perfect square, e.g. 1200x1200. Reddit won't let you upload them otherwise.
* Keep them themed to r/Michigan or Michigan in general.
* They must be PG-13 or below. 
* Post them in the comments through Imgur or Reddit's hosting service.
* Upvote the ones you like.

Thanks in advance and have fun.",Michigan,r/Michigan Community Awards

Im out of work indefinitely until the crisis is over.   They have been really awesome to my fiance and I,  making sure we are stocked up on beef, pork and propane.   They are good people.  

My best friend was able to convince a number of Amish schools in the Clare Area,  and all around Amish Settlements in Michigan to close as per the Governors order.   a number of Amish still had church on Sunday.  Most of the Amish thinks My best friend is crazy for taking the virus seriously.   He's staying home practicing social distancing,  I only take them out when I go out once a week to get groceries.  He even got a milk cow so we didn't have to go out as much for milk, cream and butter.    

Id say about 90 percent of the Amish in the Clare area are not taking this seriously at all.   All of the Amish businesses are open.  When 90 percent of them need to close.  

The only Amish owned businesses that a reasonable person would consider essential are L&amp;W Discount on Surrey Rd.  Its a grocery store,  and  The Colonville Country Store on Colonville Rd in Clare mainly because they sell propane and that is how a number of people heat their homes around here.  

Other businesses like the metal fab shop, quilting shops, engine shops, bike shops are all open for business. 

The Gladwin Amish are completely oblivious to this,  Its business as usual for them.  

My best friend has tried to convince the community to do whats right and stay home,   however they do not seem to care.  But as they say,  Cannot help those who won't help themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Hear me out.  Both Walmart and Meijer have an app and online ordering system where you can have someone else shop for you.  Meijer gets $5 for their service through Shipt, but the Walmart service doesn't have a cost.  Big stores like Costco, Sams Club, Lowes, Home Depot, Menards could all do the same thing.  Most of them already do.  I do all my Meijer and Lowes shopping using their website and then just go pick up my stuff without having to spend hours in the store looking for things.

&amp;#x200B;

Especially now with idiots out there sneezing on produce sections and coughing on carts and kids touching stuff down every aisle, how does this not make sense as the next logical move to fight the spread of the virus?  When I picked up my order on Sunday at Meijer, I watched at least 3 couples walk into Meijer hauling kids in with them.  These idiots aren't smart enough to keep one parent home with the kids to cut down on exposure, let's remove the option.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that some people don't have the internet or whatever.  I get that some folks don't trust using their credit card on the internet.  That's fine.  During the pandemic, they could have a drive up or call-in service.  Write down what you need, bring the list to the store, give it to a shopper.  Come back in an hour and pay using a credit card on one of those mobile CC scanners and off you go.  No muss, no fuss.

&amp;#x200B;

For businesses, there really shouldn't be much in the way of extra costs.  Instead of people manning the checkout lanes, they're shopping.  Instead of greeting and pushing carts, they're taking orders over the phone.  You can do all this with the same people, just use them more efficiently and significantly reduce the exposure for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this belongs on unpopular opinion or change my view and maybe I'll get downvoted to hell.  If so, I'll take it.  But if I were in Whitmer's seat, I'd be talking to the big mucky-mucks at many of these big stores about what it would take to make this happen and then making it mandatory in the interest of public safety.",Michigan,Real question - Why are stores still open to the public?

This is very sad, but at the same time there is a risk of customers and employees getting/spreading the virus through carry out, pickup, and delivery. 

If there are local restaurants that are staples of the community and support local workers, programs, and events I think a good way to support them would be through online crowdfunding websites or maybe even working out an arrangement with them where you could order food but just let them keep the cash. I know stuff like this isn’t in place right now, but it would be cool to see and safer for the employees and customers. 

I know many restaurants and businesses in my community I want to support, but right now I only get takeout once a week or less to minimize risk. I think this would help businesses and encourage people to stay home.",Michigan,We should consider supporting local restaurants virtually (i.e. Go Fund Me)

4151,4151,nothingtothis,1585888459,fu1rxw,Nan,"Just sitting here late and thinking about a message I got on Facebook...not much else to do without work or leaving my apartment.

So a friend of a friend who is a business owner in the Southfield area sent me a message asking if I would support her making a presentation on the capital steps. She went through a list of reasons she is planning a march on Lansing but mainly focused on the shutdown being unconstitutional. 

I didnt know how to respond (i'm not well versed in the constitution or rights we have in all honesty. I know we have the right to life liberty and happiness and to bear arms...but that is the extent of my knowledge).

I googled and found a constitutional lawyer in California mentioning the shutdown in California would essentially be struck down if challenged in court.

I am divided on this to be honest. While I am nervous about the virus I am also happy I just got myself off of all forms of wellfare this last year(in my adult life, I've always had bluecaid/ebt...it was a proud moment for me to know I didnt qualify any longer this last year.)

Now that I've lost my job and the small savings account I have built up is quickly going away (I'm probably going to be broke before the relief check comes in the mail..), I am wondering if she had a point in saying people that choose to quarantine shouldnt be punished by the company they work for (maybe have something set-up to help people out that are choosing to quarantine) but those who want to continue to work should be allowed that option without facing being arrested and fined.

I was wondering how fellow you guys feel about this as I'm undecided.",Michigan,I got a message today from someone saying they are planning a march on lansing if the shutdown is extended...

We can't have everybody returning trunkfulls of cans and bottles, 2,500 at a time all day every day for the first few weeks of the state being opened back up for normal business. We're gonna wreck all those clunky old machines in the Meijers and Krogers and whathaveyou. 

&amp;#x200B;

So why don't WE, as in, Michigan's subreddit, organize a bottle and can drive for Covid-19 relief and start it NOW. We could do it as a community, starting with how we want the funds to be allocated once they are all collected. For my part, I think it should be something to help either people who are going to be orphaned by covid19 or people who will end up being permanently disabled from the disease.

&amp;#x200B;

My thought is, if we have a bottle and can drive, maybe we can work something out directly with the distributors who pick them up. That way, we can bypass a lot of the cans having to go through our grocery stores all at once. It'll solve a severe bottlenecking I can see happening right away. Plus, we'll free up those services for people who are gonna need the money their bottle and can hoard will give them.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a thought. I'd be happy to be really involved in the process or to hand it over to others who may be much more able to handle the logistics. I don't know the ins and outs of the process myself but maybe some other redditors can help out? 

&amp;#x200B;

It'll give us something to DO, if nothing else.

PSA: fast food is NOT ESSENTIAL. Do not risk your life walking up to a drive through window.

Fast food places taking the right measures likely have less of a chance of spreading the virus then some grocery stores but walking up to a drive through window is extremely dangerous.

People don't pay attention to what they are doing in a drive through. They often hit cars in front of them in line. People often speed like crazy idiots driving up to the window and many are looking at their phones, never checking if someone is there. They sometimes drive right past the window from this behavior (don't be this person either).

At my job we are not allowed to serve anyone walking up to the window, anyone on a bicycle, or anyone on just a mobility scooter. This was a rule even before the pandemic.

If an employer’s written policy states that accrued, unused vacation will be paid on termination, the employer must pay for the unused time when employment terminates.

Since it would remove private insurance and have all michiganders on a single payment system, for Regular Vision and Dental health services the cost would be down per capita at least 50.

The cost for all non MI residents would be 200 a month for everything. If everyone used it that would be 60B a month for MI in revenue. Making that 720B per year. Since 200/m is likely about 25% higher than actual costs would be that would add 180B in direct profits for the state budget.

As the pandemic escalates, rural counties with high shares of seasonally vacant housing are seeing higher rates of COVID-19 cases than either urban or other rural areas. In the nation’s 199 rural counties where seasonal housing accounts for 25 percent or more of all housing units, average cases per 100,000 are more than twice as high as in other rural counties and 15 percent higher than in urban areas as of April 5 (Figure 1). This is consistent with anecdotal reports of hot spots in popular vacation locations as visitors, including some who are unknowingly infected, exit urban areas attempting to socially distance at second homes and seasonal rental properties. There are, however, several possible explanations for the higher prevalence of cases including differences in the level of testing and the higher median age seen in these areas.",Michigan,Rural Michigan: UNH Study finds Rural Areas with Seasonal Homes Hit Hard by COVID-19

She waits 4 days to declare a stay at home order, allowing the virus to spread unchecked for 4 days. Waited until 11 pm to announce the 1st case, well after most people are asleep on a Tuesday night. Won't make decisions and just says ""tune in to my next press briefing,"" to find out, like what she did for all of March regarding whether schools would open again. She doesn't answer important questions either, or at least not in a timely manner. 

For once, Ohio is doing better than us. They announced cases the same day as us and issued stay at home orders same day, also closed schools before us. Their governor will not answer questions he doesn't know saying ""he will find out,"" and actually answers the question the next day. He is transparent and open about the whole thing. Whitmer is closed off and just copies what Ohio does, but waits 4 days to do it.

Why can't we go get gardening, paint, and flooring supplies at big stores? They are already limiting the number of people in the store t once, so why limit the floor space more? Why can we go sailing but not boating? You don't come into contact with many people at a boat ramp, you just sit in your truck and wait for the guy in front of you to finish.

Let’s have a friendly debate about what the most underrated and most underwhelming places to visit in our spectacular state are.

I think it would be interesting to hear about underrated cities in Michigan to visit. Also, if someone from a city or enjoys visiting a city that is mentioned as being underwhelming, maybe they can provide some fun options to do in those city’s that would make them more enjoyable!


For me-

Underrated: Grand Marais

Tiny little beach town tucked away on the shores of Lake Superior.  Grand Marais is just what a beach town should be.  No frills.  No fancy high end shopping.  Just a place to get away from the world and enjoy the beach, water, solitude, and nature.  



Underwhelming: Sault Ste. Marie

I visit the Sault often for work and love the history of the city and the Soo locks.  Also, a burger from West Pier is one of the best burgers in the state.  I just feel like the city is missing a lot in terms of entertainment and fun things to do.  With its history, location, and with it being a college town, I just always expect there to be more fun things to do when I’m there with friends and family.",Michigan,Most underrated/underwhelming places to visit in Michigan...

Also, I learned from my husband that he's afraid of retaliation because of what happened to his family (broken into house - little sisters room among other incidents). Much of the land around us is owned by the same family, which is the same situation he was in with his family, that's why there's anxiety.

Edit 2: I realized I should clarify that it's marshland, there are no trails. People are just hiking from the road onto the land. Also - I have a plan to call the county parks and rec in a little bit to see what they can tell me - I'd like to work with them as much as possible.

Edited to add: I wrote out my thoughts to show the conflict I'm feeling. TLDR want to post signs, afraid of retaliation

Hi,

My husband and I moved to a rural part of the state outside of Ann Arbor about 3 years ago. We've been steadily improving the property (it was completely trashed - garbage hole where a pool was, a burn pit that was half the property, etc). We were told we had 3 acres but the part of the property we knew was ours is definitely not 3 acres. We recently got ahold of the Washtenaw county map of our property and now we can see where our property is! The trouble is...it buts up against a county preserve.

Here's where my dilemma comes in. We have people coming to our property clearly thinking it's part of the preserve and walking all around, parking cars, etc. They take pictures and do other things recreational. It's clear they don't know that property is ours. We can clearly see them from our residence and I've had people walking towards me when I'm out doing yard maintenance.

Now, I by no means expect this to stop entirely nor do I expect tempers not to flare if I put up signs around the property (which has been our plan for a while, we're waiting for the POSTED signs to come).  My husband and I grew up in the country - we understand that people sometimes walk on rural land - especially land out of sight of the residence. These folks walking on the property are doing it in full view of our home and, frankly, are starting to make me very nervous and feel unsafe while I'm outside. The reason I feel this way is because I think they think I'm cleaning up/doing work on public land and I am not.

Unfotunately right now I can't walk over to the neighbors and let them know/talk to them about it. All our neighbors up and down the road have POSTED signs so I'm fairly sure the culture around here is to respect signage. However I am worried if we post signs along our property the people who think it's public land will retaliate.

I realize that my post is really long - I'm just getting it all out. I could really use some advice on how to handle this, especially since I can't just walk up to folks and ask them to leave at the moment. I'm also really worried about someone hurting themselves on our property with an overtaxed emergency/medical system right now.

Does anyone have any thoughts about this? If we post signs we will do it all along the perimeter of the property, not just the areas they are walking on.  I also want to say I have no problem if they park on the road and take pictures of the wildlife from the road - it's the walking deep into our property that I'm concerned about. I also wouldn't care if people asked me permission to come on the land. I just want to make it known that it's not public land to cover our behinds if someone gets hurt and so we feel safer.",Michigan,Private land - marking it and making sure folks aren't too irritated/angry

Still waiting on Brownstown but it seems like most cities will not be enforcing against us doing routine lawn maintenance.

This comes against the order of Governor Whitmer who says cutting lawns is not essential. Our industry is already out and about, another company at building is already taking off and I'm seeing people just now getting ready to maintain turf, weather permitting. Its a little chilly but I suspect next week you'll see all major mow crews out doing work.

Check with your local cities statements on social media, usually some good info. I know Dearborn isn't allowing people, obviously Detroit probably isn't with them being the epicenter of problems.

Were taking our own precautions and following other guideline rules of masks, sanitation, and distancing. The thing is, mother nature does not stop, and our ability to maintain throughout this pandemic that will not end this year needs to be allowed. 

Cities understand this as they have dedicated mow-crews to maintain city property - and they know its a weekly/biweekly routine for many areas, and after 3-4 weeks its a hell hole to deal with.

Please realize that these people aren't here over that. These people are here because they're losing jobs, businesses, etc. due to the extra restrictions binding our economy more. The economic destruction we're about to face is worse than anything the virus has done. 
     I get it guys, these times are scary and different and it's ok to be angry, but the spread of misinformation needs to stop. These people are just as scared and hurt by this as everyone else, but its because of the restrictions, not the virus. I personally had to deal with my mother losing her work as they had to shut down her manufacturing plant over this. So many people are out of work because of this. The quarantine in amputating the body to save the foot.
     Now, I've also seen some posts about ambulances blocked and people screaming about losing luxuries. If those are true, I agree that they're being stupid, but do keep in mind, this is reddit. It can be hard to say if it's a troll post or not. But for those that are true, don't let these idiots stsnd for the rest of the protesters. The group as a whole isn't stupid, they elected to protest in cars to avoid spread of the disease. They aren't ignorant of the effects of it.
      So please, don't come after me over this, all I'm asking for is people to stop generalizing a group for the words and actions of a stupid minority. Have some sympathy, this entire situation is scary and it sucks, but we should get through this together.

Everyone in America has the right to safely protest. 

What is happening in Lansing today is NOT SAFE. 
People are angry, they want the Governor to reopen all of the state by lifting all stay-at-home orders and  allowing businesses to proceed as normal. 

But this is not normal, this is a pandemic.
The Governor’s decisions came from a number of sources including but not limited to, other states, the CDC, medical professionals, and more. In addition, she choose to be PROACTIVE rather than REACTIVE. 
She chose to impose restrictions to save lives rather then impose restrictions after lives were lost. 
If, in a few weeks or months people will feel like nothing happened due to these “seemingly over done” restrictions then it means they worked! It means she did what she could so that eventually we could get back to “normal” and how privileged are we to be untouched, unaffected by the virus. 

The people who chose to protest in Lansing today did not do so safely. Many of them got out of the vehicles and came in to close contact with little to no adequate protective gear.

Some of those who remained in their vehicles actually blocked off entry ways and exits from
Sparrow Hospital. 

Ironically to them, those who are protesting the stay-at-home orders are actually engaging in activities that could spread the virus to one another, potentially creating the need to extend the order. 

Governor Whitmer has been proactive, but perhaps those who are out today will give her a reason to be reactive, then they will have no one to blame but themselves, but the lack of responsibility these “protestors” seem to have means they will only continue to blame others, and thus the cycle continues.

Want to save lives? Want to go back to “normal”?

How long before you agree this needs to end? Would 2021 be too long or what?

There are many people who CANT even get through to unemployment.

What about people who can't afford rent and food and car notes for their family now?

What do we do when the economy opens? The virus will still be here. Do we shut down everything?

If your answer is mass testing how long will it take to test 330 million people? Probably years right? What happens if you have the disease? More quarantine?

I was about 30 minutes south of lansing visiting my friend when the storm hit. At first nothing really happened occasional hail, high winds and lighting, a normal thunderstorm. Then we noticed a funnel cloud. We ignored it, cause that was the most genius option. A few minutes later we heard very strong winds and wood creaking. We looked outside and saw what looked like a tornado. We couldn't see it well because there were nothing but trees in the direction, (except for a 3-4 acre field) but it looked like the top of a tornado. If it was a tornado, it was huge. As we looked at it, to see if we could get more details, it came out of the trees (taking out some with it) just as we were getting out our cameras. It was almost definitely a tornado. We rushed to the basement to be safe, and a few minutes later, the noises stopped. We could kind of see it still, but our cameras couldn't. My friends barn was completely missing. No debris or anything, there is just no barn left. No evidence of it ever existing except on Google Earth and pictures taken previous to the storm. Seriously, we could not find anything no matter how far we drove, we found nothing. We saw trees knocked over and a few things in the woods. That's it.

I recently graduated from university and plan on staying in Michigan for a year to experience living alone before venturing off to graduate school. I grew up in Lincoln Park and spent the majority of college life commuting from home to Detroit. My degree is medical-related, and I plan on working in a hospital setting. So I can go anywhere. 

The point being, I've spent my whole life downriver and don't know what else there is. I just know in my heart that whatever ""Detroit"" is, I want the opposite of that. That stereotypical big city feel, I'm tired of it.

What small/mid size towns exist in Michigan that are safe and affordable? But also arent central or south east Michigan.

On a personal level, I've enjoyed cooking more and not having as much stress with traveling for work. But for all of society there are a few things I hope we can keep after this:

\- Letting small breweries deliver beer and self-distribute. It should be expanded to allow shipping within the state, and ideally outside the state for beer, wine, and liquor producers.

\- Wearing masks. It doesn't look or feel weird anymore, and would be a good thing to see more people wearing them during flu season.

\- PTO. Should be available for all so workers don't have to come into work sick.

\- Preparedness and sanitation. I think people realizing having some food (and toilet paper) on hand is a good thing, and how important hand washing and cleaning common surfaces is.

I was intending on transferring the registration/plate from a different vehicle to it. What kind of legal area would I be in if I insured it, and drove it, with my other cars plate? I fully understand that, under normal circumstances, that would be very illegal, but given the fact that registering it with the normal process is an impossibility, that brings into question whether or not it would be a reasonable course of action to take. I do not have to drive it, as I have a different vehicle as my daily driver at the moment, but I would like to at least be able to test it out and make sure it functions as advertised.

1268,1268,psrE353,1587161251,g3bmsb,Nan,"In a time where we should be coming together and working together to stave off a deadly virus, regardless of politics and ethics, it disturbs me to see a lot of the state being more divided than it's been in a while. Sure I know some of the comments I've seen circulating around news articles and Reddit posts regarding this matter are coming from trolls, but it's surprising to me yet how much volatility and hostility is being released due to just a stay at home extension and a small additional restriction on shopping.

This time is hard on everyone in many different ways. Students and staff of schools and universities are under immense pressure, stress, and adjustments, meanwhile many in the workforce are out of work and struggling to get by.

It's very selfish that people would congregate together, breaking social distancing, which can and will worsen the spread of the pandemic, to seemingly evolve what was supposed to be a basic protest into a multifaceted protest with hidden agendas and ulterior motives.

And I am not blaming all of this solely one one side of the political spectrum either, though it does seem to weigh heavily more on one than the other. It seems silly that with all the fear mongering that goes on already, that protesters - who are a lot of the same people complaining about the media fear mongering - would then show up at the capitol with heavy arms, and flags and signs calling to action liberation, and most likely with force. And it doesn't help that we have the president saying phrases like ""Liberate Michigan,"" to divide us even more in a time where we need as little division as possible.

I would hope that the people so upset by the restrictions on what you may buy at ""Big Grocery"" realize it is only to limit the amount of people in a big store at a time, so as to reduce risk of exposure and transmission. And the same goes for the stay at home order, though I can relate to some of the anger about it. Also while this has most likely been over dramatized, I will still say that when the anger behind one's protest is so great that they don't find harm in blocking ambulances from delivering people to hospitals with extremely threatening illnesses or injuries, it really weakens the reputation of your cause.

So come on everyone, we can do better at this. We will not make it through this if we don't all start working together better. Let your differences subside for a bit and just power through - this is tough on EVERYONE.",Michigan,"Michiganders, this is not a time to be divided!"

However, hear me out please. I am not sure that the power to determine what is essential belongs in the power of one person. Some protesters didn't like how gardening tools were not listed as essential, because they wanted to be able to produce their own food if the grocers were unable to meet the demand for food. You should also know that according to the stay at home orders, if there was a store selling items that were labeled ""unessential"", that store could be shut down. Also, even if you owned a small lake, you cannot use your jet-ski on it, regardless of if you are following social distancing guidelines. I should be able to buy what I need, and not be fined.
