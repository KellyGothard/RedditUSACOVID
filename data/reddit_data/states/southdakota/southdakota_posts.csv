So here's my question, I believe it's best for me to fly to Sioux Falls, SD and drive back and forth daily. What's your advice into airport and driving conditions? Also, I've never been in SD or MN in my life before or ever had to drive in snow in TX lol. I'm panicking since my company is booking me an economy car (the smallest available lol) from Enterprise and will be having to drive to Worthington. I believe it takes an an hour and a half from Sioux falls to Worthington. Any tips on driving conditions, in day/night, driving in snow/ice,  or parts of the road to watch out for? (preferably will onlly use I-90) Also, how's the airport in your experience? Are flights usually delayed in or out? Has there been a lot of weather related cancellations lately? Will be there for 3 weeks and flying out sometime next week or so. Thanks in advance for all positive advice!",SouthDakota,Visiting Texan who doesn't know how to drive in the snow!

The “VOTE YES” signs around town are in favor of the Rapid City Area Schools bond issue for $189,553,000 to build and renovate schools. According to rcasfuture.org the reasons for the bond are:

• Address safety and security concerns at school buildings throughout the district 

• Replace or renovate aging and deteriorating facilities 

• Increase capacity 

• Modernize learning environments to best meet the needs of 21st century learners

And what the bond includes:

· 3 new elementary schools ($89,346,000)

· The rebuild of South Middle School ($44,222,000)

· Elementary school renovations ($16,007,000) and the conversion of RC High to an elementary school ($8,326,000)

· Stevens High School renovations and fine arts wing improvements ($19,094,000)

· District-wide safety &amp; security upgrades ($12,558,000)

This is something the majority of citizens would like to get behind, but due to the proposal the school board has put forth, we should take pause. If this bond issue passes we lose Rapid City High School. A school that hands out its own diploma and has its own mascot (go Eagles). A school that has been working hard to educate the 500 students enrolled, who struggled in the Central and Stevens environments. These students have been given a new opportunity for success. RC High’s graduation rates are on an incline while arrests and disciplinary action are on a decline. This high school is so sought after that there is a waitlist to enroll. Yet the school board wants to kick out the 500 students enrolled and the students waiting for the opportunity for an alternative way to learn in order to spend 8 million dollars to renovate it into an elementary school. 

Rapid City High is located downtown in the old Dakota Middle School at 601 Columbus Street. Renovating it into an elementary school, places young children in a heavy traffic area, 5th Street. The area also has a heavy homeless presence due to the Hope Center and public library. 

The school board has said on multiple platforms and interviews in the last year that they will come up with a plan for RC High usually referring to it as Rapid City High School program or programming, a way of discrediting them as a real high school. Despite that at the beginning of the 2019 school year, our state gave them the okay to handout their own diploma. Giving students the opportunity to have pride in their school and begin to build their own school culture and traditions.  Saying “we will come up with a plan” is not good enough. The proposal very clearly lays out how all of the 190 million dollars is going to be used. Every item has a dollar amount next to it, except for “Rapid City High School \*new location to be determined”. Where will the money come from?

One thing to remember when voting is the importance of what the ballot says- that is what you and the school board are agreeing to. 

“SHALL THE RAPID CITY AREA SCHOOL DISTRICT 51-4, MEADE AND PENNINGTON COUNTIES, SOUTH DAKOTA, ISSUE ITS NEGOTIABLE GENERAL OBLIGATION SCHOOL BONDS IN A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT NOT EXCEEDING $189,553,000, ISSUED IN ONE OR MORE SERIES, ISSUED ON ONE OR MORE DATES, BEARING INTEREST AT SUCH RATES AS MAY BE DETERMINED BY THE SCHOOL BOARD, PAYABLE AND MATURING FROM 1 AND NOT TO EXCEED 25 YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF ISSUANCE, FOR THE FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINANCING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THREE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, ONE MIDDLE SCHOOL, A FINE ARTS WING, STUDENT COUNSELING AND SERVICES CENTER, PATHWAYS RELATED UPDATES, ADDITIONS AND RENOVATIONS TO EXISTING SCHOOL FACILITIES, DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT IMPROVEMENTS, SAFETY AND SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS, FURNISHING AND EQUIPPING THE SAME, AND FINANCING COSTS OF ISSUANCE?”

The ballot makes no mention of RC High. When nothing happens for them or they are given less than they had- how are we to hold the school board accountable? 

The school board has been applying pressure by implying that if this bond does not pass, the schools will not be built or renovated in the future. Deteriorating schools will close down, class sizes will increase, and forced bussing will be necessary. This is incorrect. The first time the Civic Center renovation went to vote it did not pass. The second time, it did. 

A vote of no does not mean you do not want better schools, but that the current proposal is not good enough for our kids.

The goal of this post is to start a VOTE NO campaign. We are looking for other residents who think the school board could submit a better proposal the second time around. We are looking into hosting a forum downtown for voters to hear opposing views on the bond issue. It would be great for past or present RC High students and parents to share their experiences. We also need to make a collective effort to put out more VOTE NO signs to encourage voters to dig deeper and non voters to get involved.  The deadline is quickly approaching. Early voting has begun and the voting day is Tuesday, February 25th. The last day to register to vote or change registration is Monday, February 10th.

Please visit rcasfuture.org to view the proposal and rcasforward.org for additional opposing views on the bond issue.

As the title states, my husband and I are looking to move soon. Currently we reside in Bergen County, NJ &amp; have been here basically all our lives. Living here has completely drained us, mentally, emotionally, financially and we are in desperate need of a change for the better. 

A bit about us. My husband is 32 and I'm 30. He works as a BDM, but has been in Real Estate for 11 years before making the switch. I'm in school for mortuary science and work in a funeral home. Prior, I was in the rescue field for 6 years, having worked in a shelter and an animal hospital. We have one dog and no children, although we do plan on it within the next few years hopefully. We love nature, outdoorsy stuff, etc. Bars/eateries aren't SUPER important to us. We just want a quiet, slower pace of life after being around the hustle and bustle of the city for so long. 

I've browsed through the moving threads here which were helpful! From what I've read, Spearfish, Black Hills, &amp; Belle Fourche all seem great, but I'm certain I'm missing a few! We were strongly considering NH, but it seems like it's getting more costly and difficult for younger people to relocate there, plus little housing availability. I don't want to run into the same issues up there that we're facing here. 

 In NJ, we have a large opioid problem, but that could be said for a majority of the country really. Is meth use in SD something we should be largely concerned with? Any advice/suggestions greatly appreciated - thanks in advance! 



TL;DR: Husband &amp; I (32 &amp; 30) looking to relocate from VERY ovecrowded and expensive area in NJ. No children yet, one dog. Interested in locations that could possibly work for us.",SouthDakota,"Relocating from Bergen County, NJ ? Advice appreciated!"

My 2xGreat Grandfather left “German Schlesien” in the 1870’s. His original surname was something like Pulusky. Thing is that many in my family believed him to be Polish. Well on 23andme the Czech Moravia-Silesia region shows up and not the Silesia in Poland which is a little odd. I also have a bunch of matches with people in Czechia.

Also another odd thing is that he originally immigrated to Gregory County, South Dakota. He eventually left after about 10 years but that area is known for its Czech not Polish people no? I think there is barely any Polish in South Dakota.

If you or members of your family have trouble starting a family there is a bill that severly limits your options to continue your bloodline.

Unfortunately there is are extreme activists influencing our state Representatives and Senators. They feel that if you cant have children the natural way then you shouldn't have children. Representatives from Tea and Harrisburg made this clear in Committee and on the floor of the House.

If you want to help a struggling family as a Surrogate the language in the law is poorly written. In Section 3 of the bill it states that all contracts are void in SD if any money is exchanged. While in Section 2 (the part that makes it a crime) it gives an exemption to medical expenses, it doesnt do that in Section 3, where it voids all Surrogacy contracts.

If a Surrogacy goes forward without a contract both sides are vulnerable to bad things happening. Maybe something happens to the fetus, maybe the parents get sick and can't take the baby, maybe the Surrogate had a problem with a previous pregnancy thst she didnt know about.

If a good Surrogacy company is hired to facilitate an arrangement there is a much greater chance that everything goes smoothly. The company will arrange and pay for medical record review, further medical testing, psychological evaluation and medical insurance. Surrogates who are in it for the money are screened out by both the company and the psychologist.

An experienced company can talk about rare but real risks to the parents, the baby, and the surrogate. If there issues are talked about prior to the pregnancy then the effects can be avoided or mitigated.  If you know that there are ""dealbreakers"" that won't work with everyone involved then you don't enter into a contract with the other party.

To the Right to Lifers: abortion doesnt happen in Surrogacy any more. So shut it.",SouthDakota,Surrogacy

Right now we’re in a bit of a transitional period. The station has been lacking in a lot of areas ever since we got back on the air in 2012. Our broadcast is spotty right now due to upgrade work in the studio and on the transmitter, but please tune in occasionally and see what’s playing. (91.3 FM or kteq.org) listen a bit, take note of what you like/don’t like, and give us some music suggestions. Or current automated playlist is about 150 unscheduled songs, but we’d like to know what time you usually listen, what kinda music you’d like to hear in that time, and things like that. What do you want to hear, what events would you want us to put on, would you buy merch, yadda yadda.

We’d like to be able to show people the bright side of SD, and put on display our acceptance, diversity, counterculture values, and maybe even cultivate a half-decent music scene. But we need your help. 

I know radio, online or FM/AM, isn’t the most popular format right now, but it’s our goal to show that we can put together programming and events that help nurture alternative music tastes in this bass-ackwards place we call home. So tell us how to do that. Or come join the organization if you live in Rapid. We need many people, not just in DJ roles. 

You can tune it at 91.3 FM in the Rapid area, and kteq.org/the TuneIn app for our stream

You can also donate to help us at kteq.org, on the “donate” page.

- I see the temperature in the southern part of the state is gonna hit 65 or so in the next week. Is the ice usually melted enough to permit some shore jigging and whatnot by March 30th or so? 

- Up here we have a spring flood each year which makes shore fishing kinda hard. Is it the same down there? Any bodies of water in the southern part of the state I might hit which don't really flood? I'd *really* like to hit Spearfish if I could, but I'd take anything at this point.

So if you are seeking for   the truth information, real knowledge, uncensored news, open  discussion,  cure &amp; solution for the new corona virus named as NCOV,  COVID-19 or  SARS-COV-2, then the only webpage online is **theworld.data.blog** and **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

The   fact is that the media &amp; government are toying with people’s life.   They are only promoting fear and scare to face the truth. They were  not  telling the real information about the corona virus from the  beginning  and probably in the future as well.

Even   I as a Savior want to telling you the truth, real information about   this epidemic with just text-based message, they think me as fear-maker,   and delete all the messages online. Many of my information now even   scientist was confirmed like the started for this epidemic event from   October/November or the real features of this virus, but many still not   yet confirmed and verified yet.

If   they say cannot talk in the public or big media sites, then it would  be  ok, but instead they are deny in all fake free speech websites as  well.

You  need to understand that  even the top government officials, top doctors  who have access to top  notch medical care had died because of this new  corona virus, they  cannot protect themselves so there is freaking any  reason they can  protect normal people like most of you.

The   new corona virus is not yet peak, the full strength of that virus will   only appear in the summer time. The current situation is too dangerous   for normal people to deal with.

That   why from now I will provide free working cure &amp; solution at  private  matter for all of you, if you are rich (have more than 5  millions USD  worth of asset) then you must donate money, but all with  restrict  conditions and limited time. But only at **theworld.data.blog** or **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

But   if you are willing to open your mind, want to face the scary hard   truth, accept new knowledge then you can visit that websites. If you are   the anti-christ with big ego and do not want to change, then do not   visit.

Remember everything has the limit and I have the final decision of anything on that website.

The   authority cannot save you, only you can save you, and only the savior   can give you real working advice, cure &amp; solution to overcome this   crazy epidemic event.

First let me state that I understand if we shut down things like bars, restaurants, etc. that many people will not have a check/tips/or any income. This is awful and should not even be an issue to begin with. I know this. I'm sorry I can't say more than that. This is a shitty situation from every single angle. I wish our state/nation was better prepared for this, but I don't really know what to say. This shutdown would impact my household as well.

In my town of about 21k in southeast SD, we had St. Patrick's Day yesterday. Bars, Restaurants, etc. were all open. Everyone was jammed packed. No one cared about Social Distancing, leaving a 6 foot distance, or anything similar to that (Facebook friend was bar hopping all night with lovely pictures). I will admit I have an autoimmune disease that compromises my immune system. I had to go to the doctors yesterday, with a follow-up to Walmart to pick up my prescription. People are traveling in groups. Sitting in the aisles chatting it up about a foot apart. No one is taking this seriously. This virus can literally hit anyone. Think of anyone in your life, it can impact them - including yourself. Your parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, husband, wife, kids, cousins, best friends, worst enemies, etc. - it can impact all of them. We need to do what we can to protect those that we love around us. Our county is within a 75 mile(ish) area where every case is besides the west, but we have no cases yet. And as I am sure that many South Dakotans know, we might not have a high population, but our ratio to hospital resources to population is actually very low, specifically in rural areas.

The time to get ahead of this is now. When we went from 0 cases to 8 overnight, including one death, the rate of change was 8. The average national rate of change for this disease is 2. We are 4x worse nationally right now on average. The governor says that the reason that nothing is getting shut down is because it is not spreading that much right now. However, it is only a matter of time. The way that this virus presents itself in most cases with states is a slow curve up, then a rapid growth which can become impossible to handle.

An example of this would be Illinois.

Their cases went:

March 2: 4

March 8: 7

March 9: 11

March 10: 19

March 11: 25

March 12: 32

March 13: 46

March 14: 64

March 15: 93

March 16: 105

March 17: 160

March 18: 288

&amp;#x200B;

While their population is significantly larger than ours, their cases are similar to ours by the cluster of cases being in a concentrated area to begin with (the Chicago area vs the Sioux Falls area). I am not trying to scare anyone or the like, I am sharing how easily this can get out of control. But again, one thing that other states has above us is the fact they have a larger access to medical resources than we do. We, as a state, need to be smarter about this. People that are not staying at home are going to have a higher probability to get people infected and killed. Our medical system nationally is already strained to hell, between doctors and nurses and other medical professionals being worked to hell. We need to do all we can to alleviate it.

And while we did let schools out, which is good to protect the children, the likelihood that children are contracting the virus is about 10%. The likelihood that adults over 30 are is about 60%. Why would you close schools, that has a 10% chance to contract the virus, but not other non-essential travel or places? It seems counter-intuitive. We need to take every precaution possible to protect our citizens of our state, but also our country.

Which leads me back to the first thing I said, what do we do about the fact that it would financially ruin families if this happened. That honestly, I don't know. I'm sorry. I have a high amount of guilt even writing this, but I feel like I scream into the void every time I call her office. We have the opportunity right now to flatten the curve of our numbers before it gets excessive. We should take every precaution necessary, including those within the state and nationally for financial compensation.

Sorry for the long post. If you finished it, thanks +2. I hope you all stay healthy and safe during this time. We're all in this together and we will all get through it together.

Mayor and council members,

Open letter to Rapid City and South Dakota state government and public health officials on the need to more rapidly implement strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is an unprecedented time. We face the COVID-19 pandemic that will challenge every single one of us. While we appreciate the tireless efforts of those involved in managing this crisis, it falls short of what we feel will make a true impact.

Throughout the world, the most effective responses to the historic threat of COVID-19 have come from state and local governments. Using that history as evidence, we must shut down all unnecessary travel and utilize social distancing and self-isolation to stop the spread of the disease. Failing to heed warnings will lead to an exponential spread and will incapacitate our local healthcare system resulting in deaths.

We will face an overwhelming flood of patients requiring intensive care and ventilator support. Death rates for those over the age of 70 is over 8% and for those over 80, approaches 15%. Using even

conservative estimates, ventilator and intensive care beds will be exceeded. Supply lines are limited and will quickly be diminished. Waiting to act will kill more people while taking aggressive action now will help to limit the severity of this pandemic and allow the system to serve those most in need. Based on a recent Harvard study, the Rapid City area could experience 40,000 sick, 8000 hospitalized, and 400 requiring a ventilator (*we have fewer than 80 ventilators in Rapid City). Untold will die.
-----‐------------------

We must protect those most vulnerable in our community.

Therefore, we the physicians of the Black Hills, advocate implementing all of the following:

1. Self-isolate at home except for essential needs and practice social distancing;

2. Stop non-essential travel: most importantly airline and public transportation;

3. Close non-essential businesses: restaurants and other facilities that prepare and serve food (except for take-away), bars, salons, retail stores, clubs, gyms, schools, daycares, social events, and churches;

4. Conserve medical supplies;

5. Limit nonessential healthcare operations.

Crucial mitigation strategies, prompt intervention, and our remote location offer us a unique opportunity to stop the disease. We recognize that many of these interventions are already front of mind for our government; but our public officials also face competing priorities including concerns about the economic, political, and social impact of these measures.

The balance of those concerns is greatly outweighed by the health and safety risk facing our community and our responsibility to those most vulnerable among us. Now is the time to take further action. You must not hesitate; we need decisive action now

South Dakota state officials are waiving certain requirements for unemployment insurance.
Anyone applying for unemployment insurance will no longer be required to be actively searching for employment in order to receive benefits. The change will also accommodate those workers who are temporarily impacted by COVID-19, including those who are in an unpaid status or whose hours are reduced due to a shutdown or quarantine.
""This change applies to everyone filing for unemployment compensation,"" said Secretary Hultman. ""While many job search efforts are conducted online, waiving the requirement to search for work is in line with the social distancing practices needed to limit the spread of COVID-19 and potential exposure to the disease.""
The changes will remain in effect until Governor Kristi Noem (R-SD) lifts the state of emergency.
While the requirement is waived, the state is still encouraging people to search for new jobs. Just as many industries have announced major layoffs, others are looking to hire. Amazon and Domino's Pizza officials say they both plan to hire 10,000 new employees and Walmart announced it is looking to hire as many as 150,000 through the end of may.

To file a weekly request for payment, visit raclaims.sd.gov or call 605-626-3212. The application will ask: ""Did you make contacts for employment as instructed?"" Claimants should select, ""no"" and write ""not required"" in the comment box

Pennington County Commissioners have no desire to see the state or Rapid City shut down non-essential businesses in the county.

At a special meeting Saturday afternoon where commissioners gave special authority to Chair Deb Hadcock and Vice Chair Gary Drewes in case county decisions need to be made in fewer than 24 hours, several on the board said the current response to the coronavirus outbreak worldwide was going too far.

The commissioners asked Elevate President and CEO Tom Johnson about the impact of closing businesses in the area would have on employment. Johnson said an immediate effect would be about 500 layoffs with 3,000 to 4,000 at risk if the situation extended more than a couple of months. He said $81 million in revenue and $10-$15 million in tax revenue was at risk.

""I don't want to minimize the criticalness of the health of people,"" Drewes said. ""But at the same time, you hit the nail on the head when you talked about the economy. You can't lose the economy at the same time.""

Drewes pointed out that Commissioner Ross Rossknecht had mentioned only 14 people in South Dakota have tested positive for coronavirus and none in West River. The state has only been able to complete just under 200 tests in seven days and three were positive. A New York man who trained bank employees in Rapid City also tested positive for the coronavirus.

""Some people have common sense when it comes to business travel and some don't,"" said Hadcock. ""As we learned with the Security First Bank thing this week.""

Drewes said he agreed with Gov. Kristi's Noem's approach to encourage cities to stay open for business and simply use common sense.

""I think most people are taking precautions that the CDC and Governor Noem advised and that's where we need to take our direction,"" Drewes said. ""I have full confidence that this is going to turn the corner and that we are not in near as severe or dire shape as the picture being painted by some and I would encourage you to keep going to those businesses.""

Rossknecht agreed. ""I think the general public is aware and if a business uses common sense and opens, they can make a decision with their own common sense about whether they should visit that business,"" he said.

After more discussion, the commission voted to give Drewes and Hadcock the authority to make decisions on an emergency basis. Lloyd LaCroix wanted to make an amendment that the communication of the actions of the board come from Gary Drewes, who he sees as a great communicator. That motion died for the lack of a second and the commission voted 4-1 to give Hadcock and Drewes the authority to make emergency decisions related to COVID-19. Hadcock pointed out is a resolution and not an ordinance so the additional authority will cease when the situation is no longer an emergency.

The “no” vote came from Mark DiSanto who had called in via speakerphone for the special meeting. DiSanto said very few of his constituents liked this resolution, which is similar to one passed in Minnehaha County this week and is being considered in other counties next week.

""There is a slim chance that we will need to make a decision in less than 24 hours where we could call a special meeting,"" DiSanto said.

Hadcock said she understood a meeting might be held Monday night to close non-essential businesses in Rapid City. In Mayor Steve Allender's daily video update, he gave no indication that a meeting Monday was on the horizon. Allender said there were competing ideas among local health care personnel. He said some wrote an open letter calling for bars and restaurants and other businesses to close, while others call for waiting for more evidence.

""I hope people understand we are not delaying the decision, but we are taking a more deliberative approach,"" Allender said.

Noem released the following details on the new cases. Six of the positive results are people in Beadle County:

Female, 50-59 years old

Female, 20-29 years old

Male, 20-29 years old

Female, 10-19 years old

Male, 10-19 years old

The seventh positive test is in a man from Brown County, between 60-69 years old. The state says that case is travel related.
Noem says the state is running an additional 29 tests on Sunday.
With the new cases in Beadle County, Noem is asking leaders in that area to take additional steps to protect the public. She says it does not qualify as community spread at this point. She says according to the CDC, Beadle County has a substantial level of COVID-19 cases, which is more than four or five positive cases in one county.
She's asking people in Beadle County to stagger work schedules and do regular health checks on others in the community.
She stressed that if you are feeling sick, you need stay home.

*Sunday March 22, 2020*

Rapid City Council Members along with citizens came to a special City council meeting to discuss an emergency ordinance that would shut down recreational business due to Covid-19.

Mayor Steve Allender discussed the emergency ordinance earlier Sunday at a brief press conference.

""We are being advised now that, especially in light of the governor's press conference, that there is a better justification to take further, more restrictive action as a city government,"" Mayor Allender said.

The stricter enforcement would include closing bars, restaraunts, cafes, and other recreational type businesses. It would not include closing essential businesses like grocery stores and pharmacies.

He strongly urges people to practice social distancing and to support local businesses by using curbside and delivery services. However, some were not in favor of this ordinance.

""We also have bills, loan payments, etc. Are you going to pay these? If we have to shut our doors are you going to pay for these,"" a business owner said.
There were also people who hope to see the ordinance pass.

""My business owner did shut us down and I'm happy that I work for that place because they did the right thing,"" a community member said.

""We are on our toes having to keep up with what's going on. This also causes a great deal of frustration so we are asking for patience,"" Mayor Allender said.
The emergency ordinance passed by a 7-2 vote. It will not go into effect until Friday.

233,Wally4114,1584951340,fnge37,Nan,"43 of the nation’s governors or state health departments have instituted some sort of ban on dining-in on restaurants or bars, South Dakota is not one of those.

On Sunday, Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) said the decision to do that was not within her powers and said it would be up to local leaders.

“I told them exactly what I’m going to tell you right now, is that I can stand up as Governor and I can give a strong speech telling businesses to shut down, but I don’t have the authority to enforce that,” Noem said. “That enforcement and those tools are at the local level.”

The mayor of South Dakota’s largest city disagreed.

“It’s our understanding that within state law there are certain emergency privileges that a governor can enact,” TenHaken said in an interview with KELOLAND News.

TenHaken posted a photo on Twitter over the weekend showing two bars with packed parking lots, telling businesses and patrons to listen to the experts.

“My powers are somewhat limited in an emergency declaration,” TenHaken said.

Packed parking lots at two local watering holes last night. Businesses and patrons, PLEASE listen to the recommendations of experts during this time. Carry out =

Closed space gathering. The experts, as TenHaken said, believe social distancing and not having people crowd in places will be key to “flatten the curve” of the COVID-19 pandemic. The nation’s top infectious disease doctor has said he’d like stronger action.

“I would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars. Whatever it takes to do that, that’s what I’d like to see,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said last week on CNN.

While there hasn’t been federal action on this, most states complied with the advice using executive orders.

“In most states, it does come down kind of as a statewide mandate,” TenHaken said. “Our preference is that that would happen because that would allow us not to do city by city, county by county. If Sioux Falls is shut down, they can go to Harrisburg or they can go to Brandon.”

In a Sunday morning media briefing, Noem said she couldn’t use an executive order to do that.

“An executive order is not an option at that point, we could maybe do emergency statute, but I’d have my attorneys looking at that because those right now lie at the local level with city governments and county governments, not with the governor’s office,” Noem said.

According to South Dakota Codified Law, there appear to be certain authorities given to the governor in times of disaster, terrorist attack or emergency, including an epidemic. One of those is to suspend the rules of any state agency.

“I can certainly give directives as governor, but when I look at the statutes and powers given to me as governor, the actual enforcement of that is very difficult for a governor,” Noem said. “So, I have told them that they have the tools at their disposal to do that.”

Noem said TenHaken and other large city mayors in South Dakota know this.

On Sunday, the state announced seven new cases of COVID-19, six of those in Beadle County. Noem said she wanted to see action on restaurants from local leaders there.

“I am going to have a harsher message for the county of Beadle, for Huron specifically,” Noem said.

Beadle County and the City of Huron did take action by ordering all restaurants and bars to shut down before Monday. Drive-thrus, carryout and delivery will still be allowed. The two government bodies also shut down entertainment venues, but grocery stores, convenience stores.

Rapid City announced it will have a special city council meeting Sunday night to close restaurants and bars until April 8.

In Sioux Falls, TenHaken said, right now those actions may not be needed, according to his conversations over the weekend with Sanford and Avera Health.

Friday, the Deadwood Mountain Grand made the decision to suspend operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Monday, Deadwood’s mayor follows up, asking that all casinos close until the virus threat has passed.

In a letter to casino operators, Mayor David Ruth Jr. said:

“While I recognize these decisions are difficult and impact many employees and their families, in addition to the strain they place upon you as business owners, just this morning the United States Surgeon General warned ‘the coronavirus outbreak will worsen this week’ and said that ‘people across the country are not taking the threat seriously enough.’ The time to take things more seriously is now.”

The mayor also wants the casinos to stop allowing people to dine in restaurants, switching to curbside, takeout and delivery services. Businesses should also stop on-sale alcohol sales.

Deadwood is the latest gambling town to take action in combating the novel coronavirus. According to Ruth’s letter, 90 percent of casinos across the country, including those in Nevada and New Jersey, had already closed in attempts to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Less than 24 hours after announcing South Dakota gained seven more positive COVID-19 cases, Gov. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) announced another 7 positive cases in the state.

As of Monday at 9 a.m., South Dakota now has 28 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19.

Gov. Noem also said the state believes community spread is happening in Beadle County. Community spread is when the origin of a positive COVID-19 case is unknown

Noem also said she would be releasing an executive order in relation to COVID-19 on Monday with more details.

Models state health officials are looking at suggest 30 percent of South Dakotans could get sick with COVID-19 during the outbreak. Noem says models indicate this will not peak until mid-May.

She says while thousands of people could get the virus, she stresses that the majority of people will recover and not experience severe illness.

Noem says the state has been proactive in actions to slow the spread. She reminded people it is important to do this to flatten the curve and allow the health care system to keep up with the cases

Noem said the date she has seen shows 30 percent of South Dakotan's will get infected with COVID-19 and it is a reality all South Dakotan's need to come to terms with. She noted likely 80 percent of the 30 percent will not show many symptoms. 

Noem said state’s that have community spread have stopped testing individuals to focus on taking care of people in critical situations. She said that point will also come to South Dakota. She said healthy and younger folks won’t get tested.

Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon says the health department gets a daily update on available hospital beds and critical equipment. The state will work with hospitals and look to manage resources as best as possible.

As for schools, Noem said the state is looking at several different plans. She said the state wants to limit groups gathering together. She said it’s encouraging to see teachers across the state going above and beyond to find ways to educate students.

Noem said personal responsibility is incredibly important to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and it will help make all future decisions for all leaders easier.",SouthDakota,"""Gov. Noem: 28 positive COVID-19 cases in South Dakota; Models show 30 percent of population could get virus"""

The move to close hospitals to visitors is to protect patients and staff from the spread of COVID-19. Avera added for end-of-life, NICU and pediatric cases, limited visitors will be allowed. 

“We understand that these restrictions will be difficult for patients, family members, friends and loved ones. Top priority is the protection of everyone, especially those who are most vulnerable. Similar to other hospitals across the nation, we are taking these necessary steps to protect our patients and staff. We ask for the cooperation and understanding of the public – we as a health system must act responsibly and do everything we can to minimize the spread of this virus,” ] David Erickson, MD, Chief Medical and Innovation Officer for Avera Health said in a news release.

Rhonda Keller, the branch manager for Triple-A here in Rapid City says the price for a barrel of crude oil went for 22 dollars and at 60 percent of the pricing comes from that barrel price.

These lower prices for oil could help families who are seeing their paychecks affected by the current covid-19 pandemic

South Dakota schools will remain closed through April due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Kristi Noem made that announcement during a Tuesday morning news conference.

“Today I have put forward recommendations to all of our school administrators and those at the local level that kids should stay out of their school buildings until May 1,” Noem said. ”This will give us time to make sure we are flattening and bending the curve of the spread of the infection in South Dakota and also gives them some consistency at the district level on how they will teach these children at home or at a distance.”

The governor added that this decision will be re-evaluated over the next several weeks.

Noem said that the state’s teachers are going above and beyond in ensuring students can continue lessons even though schools are closed. This includes getting instructional packets to many students who do not have internet access.

“I have heard of so many different innovative approaches that they’re using,” Noem said.

*Deadwood* -

The Mayor of Deadwood has sent a letter to casino operators, asking them to suspend operations until the Coronavirus Pandemic settles down.
In the letter, Mayor David Ruth stated he understands the difficulty this situation presents, but the U.S. Surgeon General warns the time to take things more seriously is now.
The mayor also wants the casinos to stop allowing people to dine in restaurants, switching to curbside, takeout and delivery services. Businesses should also stop on-sale alcohol sales.
On Sunday, the American Gaming Association said on its website that at least 445 (95%) of the country’s 465 commercial casinos, plus 91% of the country’s 524 tribal casinos, have closed. U-S-BETS-dot-com says the closures have already started to have an enormous economic impact on workers, states, and local governments.
Twenty or fewer commercial casinos remain open, and as of Monday at least nine of those properties were in the historic town of Deadwood.
One the town's largest, the Deadwood Mountain Grand, announced it would suspend operations for now due to the Coronavirus.


The Mayor's Letter is below:
Dear Operator:

Many of you have contacted me over the past week asking whether it is necessary for you to cease operations in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, I have not provided you with a directive. However, many local businesses including some of our larger casinos have taken the steps, voluntarily, to cease operations until the threat of the pandemic passes.

While South Dakota has few diagnosed cases, the testing for COVID-19 is extremely limited and recent cases make clear that community spread has reached South Dakota. Before the voluntary closures made by our local casino owners, 90% of casinos across the United States, including all of the casinos in Nevada and New Jersey have been closed in an effort to help reduce community spread of COVID-19 and to give our medical professionals the opportunity to combat this disease.

At this time I am requesting you take the following actions: 1) Stop allowing patrons the option of dining in at restaurants immediately. The option of take out, curb side service or delivery may still be used. 2) Immediately cease all on-sale alcohol sales. 3) Close down your casinos temporarily until the COVID-19 threat has passed. While I recognize these decisions are difficult and impact many employees and their families, in addition to the strain they place upon you as business owners, just this morning the United State’s Surgeon General warned “the coronavirus outbreak will worsen this week’ and said that “people across the country are not taking the threat seriously enough"". The time to take things more seriously is now.

The Governor has recently taken the position that as municipalities we have the authority to shut down businesses for safety during this pandemic. I strongly encourage you to take these actions immediately in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19 throughout the United States and across South Dakota.

Again, at this time, you have the authority to make your own decisions with respect to your operations. I hope that you will make a wise decision in an effort to help everyone.

Sincerely,

David R Ruth, Jr.
Mayor

We tried Obamacare to see if he could quit his job to be safe, but we made too little. Yes, too little. You have to make $17,000 a year to get the tax credit. We have only made $4,500, because it's fucking March. We tried Medicaid, as we were told to. But we are automatically disqualified because we don't have children. We don't have children because I can't have them, and are not financially stable. So we don't qualify for either, and the minimum insurance plan was $600/mo. That's just the monthly. No copays, deductible, out of pocket, etc. They told us that we could just go to community clinics then. But that doesn't cover prescriptions which still total $2,200 with GoodRX. And doesn't cover speciality, like mental health, which I need with my mental illness. Also, there are two clinics, one has one doctor and one is a prison. I also have RA &amp; a couple other chronic illnesses that would require specialized doctors. We have always paid taxes, worked, done things I guess okay? But what are our options now?

It's Monument Health's first COVID-19 positive test, according to an internal communication from Monument Health that was provided to us.

It says they know the caregiver contracted the virus while traveling within the United States.

The memo says the information would be reported to the media tomorrow (Wednesday) morning by the SD Department of Health via Governor Noem's daily press briefing.

It says they are working through their protocols to inform and isolate all who have been in direct contact with the caregiver.

*Sioux Falls* - 

The city of Sioux Falls will ask the Sioux Falls Department of Health to pass stricter measures regulating social gatherings in the city.

The measures will follow those recommended by Gov.  Kristi Noem’s executive order issued on Tuesday. The measures include any bar, restaurant, brewery, cafe, casino, coffee shop, recreational or athletic facility, health club, or entertainment venue should limit to less than 10 people in one place.

“This is the most aggressive step we can take in the city of Sioux Falls,”  Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said.

If the local health department approves the regulations at its Thursday meeting, the Sioux Falls City Council will address it at a meeting later that day.

City attorney Scott Kooistra said the regulations would be effective as soon as it was approved by the city council.

On Wednesday, the South Dakota Department of Public Health announced new cases of COVID-19 in Minnehaha County and Lincoln County. Confirmed positive cases are at 13 in Minnehaha County and Lincoln is at one. There have been 13 recoveries statewide.

Minnehaha County also moved to “substantial” for the level of community spread. That means there are five more cases of community-acquired COVID-19 in a county or district city or township.

“Going from five to 13 in (the county) is not the surge,” TenHaken said of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Minnehaha County.

While the regulation includes social gatherings at bars and restaurants, TenHaken said they shouldn’t be scapegoats.

There are instances in which people are not staying at home or practicing social distancing in larger stores, he said. “…that ticks me off,” TenHaken said.
“Stay home. You don’t need to take your family on field trips to Lowes or Walmart or Hy Vee…,” TenHaken said.

The new regulations would be in effect for two weeks, which allows the council to make changes as necessary, TenHaken said.

During a time of crisis, many people want to help by supporting those in need. The most important thing you can do is to stay home if you can. Practicing social distancing can help us flatten the curve.

Area businesses and organizations are stepping up to help meet the demand for personal protection equipment needed by health professionals. South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology is using 3D printing technology to create reusable masks. Rapid City Area Schools staff went through the district’s now-empty classrooms to gather gloves, Clorox Bleach wipes and hand sanitizer. Rushmore Plaza Civic Center donated hand sanitizer to Monument Health’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit’s transport teams.

You can help by donating unused personal protection items (see list below) that could help the physicians and caregivers who are fighting this disease. As the global pandemic of COVID-19 spreads to the Black Hills, Monument Health is facing unprecedented challenges with the supply chain.

“To protect our patients, we need to protect our physicians and caregivers,” said Brad Haupt, Vice President of Supply Chain and Contract Management. “Each day we are monitoring a long list of supplies that will help keep our physicians and caregivers healthy as they care for the next round of patients.”

Based on statewide projections, the number of positive COVID-19 patients is expected to rise. Caring for these patients requires significant personal protective equipment (PPE). At this time, Monument Health has a supply of the necessary equipment. However, as the global pandemic continues to disrupt supply chains, it will be a challenge to obtain more PPE.
If you are able, please consider donating the following:

New and unused:
* Ear loop masks
* N-95 respirator masks
* Surgical isolation masks
* Isolation masks with visors
* Full face shields (with forehead straps)
* Eye shields
* Goggles
* Isolation gowns
* Disinfectant bleach wipes
* Hand sanitizers
* Nitrile gloves (any size)
Hand-sewn masks:
People with sewing skills can help out by making two different cloth surgical masks. There are specific fabric and design requirements that must be followed. Specifications and patterns can be found here and here.

*South Dakota* - 

Surgeon General Jerome Adams told America that “Everyone needs to act as if they have the virus right now. So, test or not test, we need you to understand you could be spreading it to someone else. Or you could be getting it from someone else. Stay at home.” 

Governor Cuomo is telling America that the State of New York is running out of medical supplies. Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci are informing Americans of up-to-date medical information regarding the pandemic. New Yorkers who have fled the City have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days.

One of the essential components of providing healthcare to people who develop COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-19, is an ample supply of skilled, trained, competent healthcare workers. Personnel trained in combat casualty care, and healthcare workers that have training and experience in delivering health care under harsh, stressful or austere environments will be a premium within a few weeks, or less, in the United States.

There is an arsenal of doctors, nurses, EMT’s, and paramedics are on the front line caring for people infected by the virus. Some of them may contract COVID-19 forcing their quarantine and removing a valuable member of the fight. A growing number of retired healthcare professionals are volunteering to come out of retirement and help with the crisis. Yet, they are the very demographic at a heightened risk for severe disease or death if infected with the Coronavirus. 

There are thousands of Navy Hospital Corpsmen known for their versatile scope of practice and respected by all branches of the military. There are various subspecialties that these paraprofessionals occupy, from biomedical technician, lab and x-ray tech, to the Field Medical Service Technician who is trained in Combat Casualty Care.

Veterans across the country are pondering how they can help. The military teaches how to serve and thrive under adversity. These are invaluable traits in today’s global pandemic.

“The U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman is the most uniquely trained military medic between all of the armed services,” Joe Hamm PA-C, a former Navy Corpsman and Physician Assistant Instructor told us. “Hospital Corpsman skills and training are the envy of other services. You can take a Hospital Corpsman anywhere in any condition, train them and they will deliver. They have proven it in armed conflicts and real-world operations, so much so, the Duke’s PA Program was based off U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsmen”

In this time of imminent crisis, with a looming shortage of healthcare workers, the United States needs healthy, young healthcare workers to fill the void. We supply this need in part by deploying the National Guard. The Guard is an organized group of individuals, who under non-crisis circumstances, are practically invisible to the average American.  Yet when a National Emergency surfaces, the National Guard rises to the challenge. We trust in their authority and ability to serve the public. 

In the same way, in this time of National Emergency, we can consider special Federal authorization can be considered to allow corpsmen and medic veterans to volunteer and register to provide healthcare services. They will rise to the occasion once more. These veterans can use their training and experience in the effort to fight through this pandemic. They can support the essential medical staff, in or out of the hospital. There is no field operation too harsh or forbidding for a corpsman or medic. 

Given the opportunity to serve again, these paraprofessional veterans already have resources to perform house calls. They can act as community screeners and answer some of the challenges that hospitals are wrestling with today. 

The United States is in the early curve of healthcare infrastructure devastation seen in China, Italy, Spain and France. It’s possible, New York is next, or maybe San Francisco, Los Angeles or elsewhere.  The corpsman can help. On active duty, corpsmen perform a host of procedures, from laceration repairs, inserting IV’s, and assisting physicians with complex medical procedures, including assisting in surgery. The VA hospital has recognized this invaluable resource, creating an entire profession surrounding a corpsman or medic veterans’ abilities: The Intermediate Care Technician.

One of the greatest threats to date is the risky exposure to these essential physicians, nurses and other medical staff. A doctor performing a nasal swab is potentially placed at an unnecessary risk of exposure when there is an alternative. Corpsmen and medics are untapped resources that could limit essential medical personnel from being pulled off the front line of this pandemic war.

Corpsmen and medics could perform many of the necessary screenings and testing far from the front line. As community screeners utilizing telehealth, corpsmen and medics can treat homebound individuals, while maintaining the social distancing precautions and using personal protective equipment. It will better serve the sick with face-to-face care, with that clinical information transmitted to the front line and to the doctor or hospital.

With the medical bag in hand once more, this time armed with nasal swabs and a pulse ox, rather than a pressure dressing and tourniquet, everyone’s health will be well-served.

“Throughout my Naval career Corpsmen played a vital role in assisting military doctors while serving as sick call screeners for military personnel in the fleet.” Dr. Sharon Miller, retired Navy Captain and ER physician told us. She described her recent experience with patients suspected of being infected with coronavirus and some with symptoms of COVID-19. A majority of mild and moderate symptoms could have been screened and managed from home.  

 “Using retired corpsmen during this crisis would enable them to provide valuable first-line screening of COVID patients (with vital signs and cursory exam) outside hospitals,” Dr. Miller said. “Corpsmen could perform the COVID testing in the less ill patients while simultaneously determining which patients need referral to the Emergency Room. We are seeing many COVID-infected patients who are being discharged home to self-quarantine because they are not in any distress and are maintaining their oxygenation. Experience in other countries tells us this crisis will get worse before it gets better, so we must continue to prepare to manage large numbers of sick patients.”

Dr.  Miller addressed another valid concern an influx of paraprofessionals could mitigate. The United Kingdom witnessed an incredible response in doctors and nurses who volunteered to come out of retirement in response to this dire pandemic. Four thousand five hundred have already volunteered. In the United States at least 2000 have responded and more will. We acknowledge that older people with chronic underlying health conditions are at increased risk from COVID-19. Young doctors and nurses do not retire. Young corpsmen and medics do.

“Recall of retired military doctors would provide a wealth of experience while battling this crisis,” Dr. Miller told us.  “However, those doctors who retired from medicine are likely to be those in the age groups which are most at risk should they contract the virus while serving on the front lines.”

We must treat and protect essential medical staff as valuable assets. There is an excellent reason the senior commanding officers are often positioned well behind the front line.  

The time for Corpsmen and Medic Veterans emergency mobilization is now. President Trump is the Commander-in-Chief with the power of his pen. One can appreciate that such a measure would require a substantial amount of organization and federal involvement to tap into the valuable personnel resource. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.

“Setting up a registry such as the Selective Service but for CRITICALLY needed healthcare professionals may be helpful in future catastrophes, pandemics or social unrest/conflict,” Joe Hamm PA-C told us. “It would have to be voluntary or a service they could volunteer on their way out of the service.”

There is one final scenario that the veteran corpsman or medic can be purposed for. There is an anticipated shortage in ventilators for patients with severe respiratory compromise in the United States. This shortage has already hit other countries and is creating profound challenges in ethical decision-making. The question of who gets a ventilator and lives and who does not, hangs like a toxic cloud of doom over Italy. That doom may roll like fog over the United States. Soon there will not be enough ventilators in the United States to accommodate need. Heaven forbid it comes to this, but the alternative decision is to manually “bag” a patient until a ventilator becomes available.

In combat, should a troop sustain a sucking chest wound, or a lung collapse as the result of tactical trauma, the corpsman will provide such manual ventilation. Ideally a CASEVAC helicopter or medical vehicle will promptly be called in from the rear to get the severely injured casualty to a higher echelon of care. But what if such support is not immediately available due to the zone being too hot? The corpsman will remain with his injured Marine or Sailor as long as it takes, providing lifesaving intervention, including ‘bagging’ the patient, until help arrives, no matter the personal cost. 

So, when the ventilators run out, do we sit idly by as patients succumb to hypoxia, saying there is nothing more we can do? One would posit that a far  greater alternative is to delve into the active duty military and veterans in our community who can support the soon to be overwhelmed hospital system, even if it is as simple as performing round the clock manual ventilation so the essential physicians and nurses can do their job, while the service-members and veterans do theirs, once again. 

Danny Jazarevic MD, PhD, FACS Colonel U.S. Army (ret) is the Director of Trauma/Surgical Critical Care and Acute Surgery at Halifax Medical Center in Daytona Beach, Florida. Daytona shares the unfortunate distinction with other beach communities of hosting thousands of spring breakers that have brought the Coronavirus down to the Sunshine State. Dr. Jazarevic had a different take on solutions for the looming shortage of trained healthcare workers due to the exploding number of COVID-19 victims.

“Military doctors, nurses and Army and Air Force medics and Navy and Marines corpsmen are exceptionally trained hybrid with skills between EMTs and nurses,” Dr. Jazarevic told us. “After twenty years of war, they are trained and capable to function in most austere environments, under massive pressure and with peril to their own lives. These exceptional personnel serve with unparalleled discipline and commitment. Contingency response is their life calling. Unfortunately, many of these reserve and retired military members are employed in civilian medical hospitals and medical facilities already battling personnel shortages. Using these to “backfill” medical institutions elsewhere, will take them out of the present positions. A workable and more desirable alternative would be to use active duty medical professionals to augment the civilian medical facilities around the country. This especially applies to attending and resident physicians, PAs, ARNPs and medics/corpsmen currently in large military hospitals, greatly underutilized and overstaffed for the levels of patients.”

Mayor Bill Di Blasio implored the Federal government to deploy active duty military to New York City Tuesday on Fox. Dr. Jazarevic’s alternative fits the request made by the Mayor.

“In addition,” Dr. Jazarevic told us.  “Any physician, military and civilian, with a clean medical license should be immediately eligible to apply for a new “Federal Medical U.S. License” valid across State borders.” 

In this time of crisis, solutions need to be inclusive and innovative. Bringing active duty service members and veterans into the fight to save lives from the Coronavirus pandemic has never more urgent.

*Rapid City, Sturgis, Spearfish, Deadwood, Custer* -

On Monday, we reported that Creekside Medical Clinic has COVID-19 tests. However, since then, doctors say they were told they no longer have unlimited access, as parts of the physical tests were diverted.

Doctors say this would have made a big difference in how patients are managed.
However, Dr. Nancy Babbitt, a physician at Creekside Medical Center, said she found out Wednesday that those tests have been diverted from Rapid City and to other areas.

""I had publicly told people that we had thousands of tests and we could start testing,"" said Babbitt. ""So, I feel terrible that I had to then follow up and tell people we don't and I didn't have any control over that. I am very sorry that we're facing this.""
In a statement from an executive from Sandford Laboratory, Babbitt was told the distributor of the swabs used in the tests have re-allocated those swabs away from South Dakota, to areas of higher need.

""I think right now, we are trying to prioritize the people that can put others at risk in a dangerous way, like health care workers,"" said Babbitt. We're trying to test people that had direct exposure to someone that's known to have COVID.""

Treating Coronavirus is not based just on a test result. Babbitt says having a result does not change treatment for patients who are stable and able to remain home-- positive cases would require 2 weeks isolation.

""So, testing is really important for epidemiologic reasons and for decision making,"" said Babbitt.
Babbitt said her clinic only has 10 COVID-19 tests. Ideally, she would want more than 100 restocked each week.

""I just don't think that they're grasping, still the needs that we have in the day-to-day care that I give to patients,"" said Babbitt. ""We hope that we will catch up eventually, but we're behind.""

Babbitt says the federal government is two months behind and many things could have been done to react to what was happening in other countries.
According to Governor Kristi Noem, if both state labs and the private lab are working at full capacity, she says the three labs can test almost 800 tests per day.",SouthDakota,"""Swabs for COVID-19 tests diverted from South Dakota"""

*Washington D.C. / South Dakota* -

Medical workers and first responders are battling the coronavirus on the front lines, but their supplies are running low.

Now, the Justice Department is stepping in against hoarders and price gougers who they say threaten the supply.

U.S. Attorney General William Bar spoke one-on-one with Gray Television’s Washington Bureau Chief Jacqueline Policastro about the issue.
Read the interview below:

Question: Attorney General Barr, across the country, there are reports of people hoarding medical supplies. How is this impacting our healthcare workers?

Answer: If there is any real hoarding going on, or price gouging, it’s keeping these essential supplies away from the people who really need them right now, and therefore, it’s endangering the community. Why the president put out an executive order that prohibits hoarding and prohibits hoarding for the purpose of price gouging.

Q: You say you’re going to prosecute for hoarding and price gouging. What’s the penalty?

A: Well, the penalty is a felony. It’s a felony to violate this, so it could be a year in prison, but more importantly, it lets us take possession of these materials, and take them to the people who need them, and that’s the most essential thing right now.

Q: Is there a case that got your attention? What led you to this decision?

A: Well, we figured there would be incidents of hoarding, and a few days even before the president’s executive order, we heard from some hospitals and some others that their supplies, their supply chain was being disrupted, and some of the contracts were being broken, and some middlemen were creeping into the picture and trying to corner the market on some of these things, so we immediately launched an investigation.

Q: Who are the folks who are hoarding all this stuff?

A: I think it’s important for people to understand we’re not talking about homes and small businesses stocking up on the supplies they need. This is not about having 100 rolls of toilet paper and so forth. This is about having thousands and thousands and thousands of surgical masks stuck away and hoping to make a killing in the market on it.

You can report hoarding and price gouging concerns to your local US Attorney’s office.

WEATHER ALERTS

Governor Kristi Noem told reporters Friday her team has another packet of bills for the South Dakota Legislature to consider next week on the final day of the 2020 session.

The Legislative Research Council meanwhile posted a list of her draft legislation Friday. Long-time observers couldn’t recall another South Dakota governor making such an aggressive move so late.
Noem said her overall purpose with the nine bills was to provide a stronger response to the COVID-19 virus that is rapidly working its way around the globe.
So far in South Dakota it has killed one man, a Pennington County resident, who died in Davison County.

Globally COVID-19 has stirred havoc in the past few months, crushing stock markets at least temporarily and shutting down economies of many nations, including the United States.

In South Dakota, many lawmakers now plan to rely on the safety of technology Monday and cast their votes remotely, rather than return to the Capitol.
Many state legislators are men in the 60-plus age group. Some have underlying health conditions. Some fit both categories — and that puts them at great risk.

Advanced age and weak health have been found in the U.S. and many other countries to make people more susceptible to the pneumonia-like illness, for which there is no vaccine.

The legislators who do come to the Capitol will be required to use one entrance, where each lawmaker’s health conditions will be screened, the governor said Friday.

“We’re encouraging them if they’re not feeling well to obviously stay there (in their communities), if they’re part of the vulnerable population to not come to Pierre. There are a few that would choose to come here and we’re allowing that,” Noem said.
Noem has issued four vetoes — two outright, and two to have their style and form fixed — that will require action by lawmakers Monday.

As for the new bills, the governor said each would help deal with a specific aspect of South Dakota’s COVID-19 situation:

Draft 928 would make unemployment benefits available sooner. South Dakota saw a giant spike in unemployment claims filed last week.

Draft 929 would allow the state Health Department to declare COVID-19 a public health emergency.

Draft 930 would somewhat expand the governor’s emergency power.

Draft 931 would let the state education secretary waive required classroom hours for students. South Dakota schools have been closed since mid-March and students won’t be allowed back into school buildings until early May, at the earliest.

Draft 932 would grant the state health secretary certain authority during a public health emergency.

Draft 933 would waive some requirements such as standardized tests for K-12 students. The federal government has already dropped the testing requirement this year.

Draft 934 would extend various driver licenses and non-driver ID cards for 90 days past the end of the COVID-19 emergency. South Dakota driver-license stations are currently closed because of the governor’s current order directing non-essential state government employees under her control to work remotely, rather than go to their buildings and offices.

Draft 935 would let school districts and local governments delay spring elections and open absentee voting for a longer time. Many communities have been concerned that COVID-19 would discourage voter turnout and make poll workers more difficult to get, because people are being constantly reminded to keep a ‘social distance’ of at least six feet from other people. COVID-19 seems to be often transmitted through tiny droplets of spray when people speak or sneeze.

Draft 936 would give county governments broader emergency power during a public health crisis. Thirty of South Dakota’s 66 counties have populations below 5,000.

“Every single one of the bills that we are bringing has an emergency clause on it. That means as soon as they do pass them and I sign them into law, they will be enacted. Typically a bill doesn’t get enacted until July 1. That is not going to be true for these bills. Because we have an emergency clause on them, they will immediately be put into place and in statute as soon as I sign them,” Noem said.

“They’re all also temporary,” she continued. “They have sunsets on them, so they will expire, and I think that is the right decision that I have made, because we are doing this remotely, and legislators are voting using technology, that it is important these aren’t permanent statutes, that (they) are temporary to allow us to respond to the virus, and they will go away.”

Noem described the effect of COVID-19 on state government’s budget as significant.

“I am telling the legislators that I will sign bills that we did for the budget and sign them into law, but I’m not going to spend that money. We’re probably going to come back in June and have a special session and make some changes that are very significant to our state budget,” she said.

“Some of these they have already passed. I will sign them into law but I am choosing as governor to not spend those dollars. I will keep them and hold them, knowing that in June we’ll have a better picture of where we’re at when it comes to resources as a state, to continue to fight the virus and make sure that we’re doing due diligence and taking care of people and governing over the people of this state.”
She continued, “I also want to focus on the federal legislation. We know that the (U.S.) House just passed the CARES Act, which is a bill that should help us respond and take care of folks through this situation that we find ourselves in. We’re still looking at the details of that. There is some language and interpretation and guidance feedback that we will need to give the (Trump) administration in order for South Dakota to access some of that money. There is some dollars that will flow into those caregivers here in South Dakota that will be incredibly important in the future.”

Noem thanked South Dakota’s members in Congress — Senator John Thune, Senator Mike Rounds and Representative Dusty Johnson — for their work on it. “There’s still some hoops to jump through to make sure that we can utilize all the resources that are available to South Dakota and we’ll get that done,” she said.

Late Friday afternoon, the governor’s office released the last list of bills that she had signed into law. There also was a statement.

“At the moment, it is unknown how much relief the federal stimulus bills will give to South Dakotans,” Noem said. “I’m signing these 15 bills with one caveat – we may need to come back in June and make drastic changes to both the current budget and next year’s fiscal year budget. As we receive further guidance from the federal government on what resources may be available to us, I will provide updates to the Legislature and the public.”",SouthDakota,"""Governor Kristi Noem told reporters Friday her team has another packet of bills for the South Dakota Legislature to consider next week on the final day of the 2020 session"""

*Pierre / South Dakota* -


 One year after the governor vetoed Lesmeister legislation that would have legalized low-THC hemp in South Dakota, a state lawmaker says he is thankful she agreed to the 2020 version.

The new new measure  took effect immediately Friday afternoon when Governor Kristi Noem delivered to the Legislative Research Council HB 1008 and 14 other bills she had signed into law. Representative Oren Lesmeister said Saturday morning he was willing to wait until after the COVID-19 crisis has peaked in South Dakota for the state Agriculture Department to start the new program.

The highest number of COVID-19 cases could come in late May or early June, the governor said Friday. She told reporters a special legislative session likely would be called in June to deal with “significant” changes she said would be needed in state government’s current budget, which ends June 30, and possibly the new budget that starts July 1.
The governor said she planned to hold off using money from any new legislation until her administration can get a better understanding of COVID-19’s deteriorating effect on South Dakota’s economy. That would include nearly $3.5 million intended for the hemp program.

South Dakota state government depends heavily on the 4.5 percent sales tax for its general fund, followed by video lottery. Neither source is expected to produce revenue at the same slightly increased pace the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Appropriations used to revise the current budget and set the coming budget.

HB 1008 contained about $742,000 from general funds and more than $1.1 million from other funds to get the hemp program equipped and running. 

Another $350,000 of general funds and $1.2 million from other funds were put in the new budget to run the program for the 12 months starting July 1.

Maggie Seidel, the Republican governor’s policy director, said Saturday it was too early to say what is going to happen. “The first thing we’re working on is getting approval from USDA,” she said, referring to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal approval is required for any state to grow hemp that has a THC level no higher than three-tenths of one percent.
The state Department of Agriculture also would need to set rules, including license fees, before starting the program.

While Lesmeister sponsored the 2019 version, this year House Republican leader Lee Qualm of Platte took the lead. Qualm chaired the Legislature’s interim committee that generated the original version of 1008. 

Noem’s administration rewrote it and said the Legislature needed to pay her estimated totall cost of nearly $3.5 million for starting and operating the program. The Senate then completely gutted it, reducing the bill to one sentence. The final 27-page version, including funding, was based on work by a conference committee of House and Senate members.

The Legislative Research Council staff meanwhile had estimated startup and first-year operation would cost less than $250,000. Unwilling to rile the governor for the second year in a row, lawmakers agreed to her estimate.

Lesmeister told KELOLAND News on Saturday it has been “a long road” to get to this point.

“I understand the times that we are in, and if the funding has to be pulled at this time temporarily for the better of the people of South Dakota, that’s fine,” the Democratic rancher from the Parade area said.
“The Department of Ag can still submit its plan to the USDA for approval and when the time comes we could still possibly plant some hemp in South Dakota come June or July of this year,” he continued. “At least we will let our processors get set up and ready for a fall run, even if they have to bring hemp in from other states.”

He added, “I want to thank everyone and I do mean everyone that has worked from upfront to behind the scenes on this to get this passed and finally signed into law. I also want to thank the governor for signing the bill into law. This will be a huge step to creating a whole new industry in South Dakota and our nation.”

*Pierre / South Dakota* -

At its peak, South Dakota is expected to see more than 200 deaths from COVID-19 and some resource shortages like Intensive Care Unit beds, according to a new forecast from the University of Washington.

However, researchers say that’s only if Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) takes a stronger stance on social distancing within the next seven days.

The model, which White House Coronavirus Task Force lead Dr. Deborah Birx has said matches their internal models pretty well, shows the peak use of hospital resources in South Dakota on May 1 with peak deaths beginning on April 26 and lasting until May 8.

That apex is behind the national anticipated date of April 15.

At its peak, South Dakota could see an average of six COVID-19 deaths per day. The forecast anticipated 204 deaths by August, but could go as high as 400.

“Our estimated trajectory of COVID-19 deaths assumes continued and uninterrupted vigilance by the general public, hospital and health workers, and government agencies,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine. “The trajectory of the pandemic will change – and dramatically for the worse – if people ease up on social distancing or relax with other precautions. We encourage everyone to adhere to those precautions to help save lives.”

All of this, however, hinges on states enacting three out of four social distancing requirements until the end of May 2020. Those include: a stay at home order, schools closed, non-essential services closed (like bars and restaurants) and travel severely limited.

Currently, only schools are closed at a statewide level.

Researchers said in states that do not currently have social distancing in place, the model assumes they will put it in place within seven days.

“If they do not, then the estimates for the number of deaths and the burden on their hospital systems will reflect this and will go up,” the researchers said.

They also say local recommendations and partial orders are showing to not be an effective statewide response, according to data. South Dakota has a patch work of social distancing measures at different local government levels, but statewide, only only recommendations by Nome.

That could change, however, as the legislature looks to revise some powers, according to draft legislation filed with the Legislative Research Council. Lawmakers are expected to act on Monday.

Noem said the state expects peak infection rates in May or June.

“I think I need to be honest with folks. This is just beginning in South Dakota. We’re going to be doing this for many more weeks,” Noem said.
Noem had encouraged social distancing and businesses to limit to 10 or fewer people, but without enforceable action.

“Individual behavioral responses and government-mandated social distancing (school closures, non-essential service closures, and shelter-in-place orders) can dramatically influence the course of the epidemic,” the researchers said in a report explaining how they came up with the forecast.

While the researchers say it’s hard to get to an exact number, implementing three of the four measures will be enough to follow the trajectory of Wuhan, China, which was able to see a dramatic decline in the pandemic.

“But it is plausible that it requires all 4 measures,” the researcher said.

So, if more strict restrictions go into effect within the next seven days, IHME forecasts South Dakota will actually not have a hospital bed shortage overall, will need 18 additional intensive care beds and possibly 73 ventilators.

The state hasn’t released numbers on how many ventilators it has.

The data is being updated as new information comes in and governors or the federal government take more direct action.

“We hope these forecasts will help leaders of medical systems figure out innovative ways to deliver high-quality care to those who will need their services in the coming weeks,” Murray said.
If the country as a whole completes strong social distancing, the Washington study predicts this wave of the pandemic could end by June in the United States.

South Dakota nursing and assisted living centers could use some critical supplies in defense from the novel coronavirus.

The South Dakota Health Care Association is asking businesses to consider donating items such as face masks and shields, disposable gloves, scrubs, and alcohol-based sanitizer to their local assisted living or nursing center.

“It’s important we all do what we can to help our most vulnerable during this emergency,” said Mark B. Deak, SDHCA executive director. “If South Dakotans are looking for ways to help local residents and combat the spread of Coronavirus, donating protective supplies is a great way to do it.”

SDHCA recommends businesses and organizations – including farmers and other agricultural operators, dental clinics, veterinarians, schools, brewing companies, salons, tattoo parlors, and textile, manufacturing, and construction companies – contact their local assisted living center or nursing home to determine its needs and ability to receive the items.

A retirement community in eastern Sioux Falls announced two residents tested positive tests of COVID-19 Tuesday afternoon.

Avera Prince of Peace said it is taking all precautions 
to stop the spread of the virus. Officials said they are working with the South Dakota Department of Health and Avera infectious disease specialists to follow appropriate steps. 

Prince of Peace closed its doors to visitors more than two weeks ago and believe the transmission “could have been an employee.” Avera said employees and residents have been screened daily for symptoms, but noted it is possible to have the virus and not show symptoms.

Avera says it has been screening and will continue to screen all employees and residents daily for symptoms.

Officials also said the positive residents do not need hospital care and they’ve been isolated from other residents.

*South Dakota / Souix Falls* -

The public can’t play basketball and kids can’t play on playground equipment and other facilities are off limits, but the public still has limited use city parks, Sioux Falls Parks and Recreation Director Don Kearney said today.

Here’s what is off-limits: No use of playground equipment, basketball courts, shelter houses or benches, of dog parks and no organized games on athletic fields or social gatherings at the park. Users must maintain proper social distancing on bike and walking trails and on all park property areas that are not closed to the public.

Kearney said, for example, if a person wants to bring a lawn chair and eat lunch or read a book in the park, that’s fine, as long as the person is six-feet away from others. He’d also recommend staying away from any common surface areas such as a railing.

“It is a fluid situation that seems to change daily,” Kearney said of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

For now, the ban on the use of facilities is for an indefinite period of time, Kearney said. Whether or not it gets more restrictive depends in large part on the users.

The city has at least 80 parks in its 3,178-acre park system. It also has a 29-mile paved bike trail.
The department’s 2018 annual review said certain parts of the park system had 2,768,655 in attendance in 2018. Attendance includes visitors which can be tracked through park shelter usage, attendance at the Butterfly House at Sertoma Park, attendance at special events, attendance at the city’s indoor and outdoor aquatics facilities and similar activities.

In 2018, the city had 24 outdoor basketball courts. The rims will be removed from those courts and they are closed to public use. Also impacted are 16 sand volleyball courts, 73 softball courts, 60 soccer fields and the like on which there can be no organized games or social gatherings and violations of six-foot physical social distancing.

Kearney has the authority to close park facilities and park grounds. The decision to close facilities in Sioux Falls was made after this past weekend’s improper use, he said.

“We had a bunch of people gather in shelters,” Kearney said. Users also played full-court basketball games and many kids were using playground equipment, all of which violate physical social distancing, Kearney said.

Parks are for the people but the facilities closures are “doing what’s in the best interest for the community itself,” Kearney said.

“We’re trying to slow the spread (of COVID-19) when people aren’t social distancing…,” Kearney said.
Kearney said city officials consult with local, state and federal health care officials as well as local medical officials. In addition, the National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) had guidelines on COVID-19 response for cities, Kearney said.

“We’re monitoring other cities that are further along in this (COVID-19) process,” Kearney said. It’s helpful to learn what actions those cities have taken and how those actions have helped, he said.

I'm sure you've heard by now that the federal government has allocated $600 per week on top of their state benefits for Americans on unemployment. I'm going to assume this is common knowledge, but it is easy to verify if you don't believe me.

With that being said, Governor Kristi Noem has been silent on this issue, and there is some question as to whether or not this money will be properly distributed to those for whom it is intended. I know this post will probably be ignored since I am forced to be purposely vague for my own anonymity, but please believe me when I say *there are concerns about this.*

Whether you think $600 per week additional is excessive, I would ask you to set this aside for the moment and focus on the deeper problem of the potential misuse of funds. Imagine, for example, a scenario in which regular working class South Dakotans receive less than those who have historically earned more *just because the state feels this is the way it should be done.* If this is hard for you to imagine, then I would say you are not very informed about how things are decided in Pierre.

So what's the problem? Well, perhaps nothing; but I fear that if some pressure is not put on Pierre and on Noem specifically, this funding will be quietly distributed as Pierre sees fit, as opposed to how it is intended to be used.

What can be done about this? I honestly don't know. I hope this is a discussion we can have here to find a way to ensure that unemployed South Dakotans receive the money they have been promised. The $600 is not ""too good to be true,"" or should not be. It has been promised at the federal level, and unemployed South Dakotans deserve to receive it. This is not ""South Dakota"" money; it is money for all unemployed Americans.",SouthDakota,$600 additional per week for unemployed South Dakotans?

*South Dakota Daily News* - Will now attempt to find  the best up uplifting local stories and label them accordingly. Thanks!


A company with ties to the Northern Hills is poised to help provide modular hospital rooms nationwide in response to a skyrocketing need because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Best GEN Modular, headquartered in Rapid City, is preparing to shift its available resources toward the manufacture of scalable units for extra isolation rooms and temporary hospital use that can be installed anywhere they are needed most, said the company’s CEO, Branden Bestgen.

Bestgen, who grew up at Sturgis and graduated from Sturgis Brown High School, is no stranger to planning for a large-scale operation. He served as the assistant police chief in Sturgis under then chief Jim Bush.

“I’ve had insight into running a catastrophe, although it was planned, with limited resources,” he said. “It has been interesting to draw on the skills that I learned and used in those years of law enforcement with the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. It also helps to have an understanding of the emergency management process and everything that goes with it.”

Until the coronavirus outbreak, Best GEN’s focus had been on manufacturing modular units for hospitality projects, senior living, student housing, and apartments. The hospitality projects included components to build hotels such as Fairfield Inns and Hampton Inns.

Although headquartered in Rapid City, the manufacturing was done at a plant in Watertown. 
The process is done by building two rooms connected by a hallway. That means the rooms are across from one another when they are pieced together for construction.

This isn’t just a roughed in room. It is fabricated complete. When it comes out, all the vinyl is on the wall, the ceilings are in, the lighting is in, carpet is down, the tile is in the bathroom, all the bathroom fixtures are in, and all the furniture is in, said Bob Sieve, president of Best GEN.

“When it leaves our factory. Those two rooms are complete, but the hallway is unfinished,” Sieve said.
He said all of the electrical, plumbing and ventilation is plumbed to a “chase” or small compartment in the corridor. All the chases are in the same spot, so when they are pieced together at the construction site all of the chases line up throughout the building.
The hospital rooms are a modified version of what Best GEN had been building. Best GEN is also offering even more temporary structures that can be placed inside convention centers to serve as hospital wards complete with rooms, nurses’ stations and more.

To expedite the process of temporary hospital rooms, Best GEN has partnered with general contracting firms nationwide who can get the buildings operational immediately, Sieve said. Best GEN Modular said it is prepared to provide 5,000 rooms. The first 100-room hospital will be on-site within three weeks. The company is redirecting all its resources to operate 24/7 at its manufacturing facility to help produce units as needed.
Upon hearing about the pandemic, Bestgen first believed it may just be undue panic on the part of people.

But he soon realized the threat was real.
“Then I thought, I really need to pay attention to this and what is going on,” he said. “I started realizing that this virus was probably going to be one of the worst things our country has ever faced.”
He said his perspective shifted, not from a fear perspective, but from a reality perspective.

When New York governor Andrew Cuomo first announced the state would be sorely short of needed hospital rooms, Bestgen gathered his team to brainstorm ideas for answering the call.
“I knew we needed to be part of the solution because there was going to be an incredible need for hospital rooms across the country,” he said. 

He gave his team five days to come up with a plan to shift from making motel rooms, to manufacturing hospital rooms. 

“I told them that by Monday morning I wanted a plan in place for us to manufacture 5,000 hospital rooms,” he said. “I think they all thought I was nuts, but they worked non-stop.”

The team, made up of architects, engineers and others, talked and tweaked the plan during the five days.

“We realized, with confidence, that we could do this,” he said. Currently BestGen manufactures 1-1/2 to 2 motel rooms a day.

“For us to do this, we have to get to 1-1/2 per hour,” he said. 

The company switched gears and put their efforts into temporary hospital room production. Government and health officials from across the country are realizing they need many more hospital rooms than are currently available. 

But, for Best Gen it will take about 28 days to manufacture 1,000 full rooms with bathrooms at their plant in Watertown. So, if the company gets a contract, they plan to ramp up production in other locations at Madison, Rapid City and Phoenix, Ariz.
“There is still time for those who are in authority to start making hard decisions right now to get ready for it,” Bestgen said.

Instead of a full hospital room with a bathroom and outside walls, some states are opting for “pop-up” hospitals that can go inside a convention center.
“We have everything set to do both,” Bestgen said. “We are talking with people at all levels of government across multiple states and we’re waiting for them to pull the trigger and say, ‘this is what we want,’” Bestgen said.

In Watertown, the first units already are being pieced together.

Bestgen said they would ramp up production from there and plan to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week in four different locations.

“We have enough time, if we act now, to get everything in motion to get these hospital rooms positioned for when they’re needed,” Bestgen said. 

“We are poised to help our nation address this pandemic head-on.”

During the week of March 22-28, a total of 6,645 initial weekly claims for unemployment benefits were filed with the Department of Labor and Regulation. This is an increase of 5,132 claims over the prior week's total of 1,513, or a 339% increase.

""Remember these tips to make the initial claims process go more smoothly,"" said state Labor and Regulation Secretary Marcia Hultman. ""File online at RAclaims.sd.gov. Write down your username and password. Read the packet of information you get in the mail. Complete your weekly request for payment. And please, be patient.""

Nationally, according to the U.S. Dept. of Labor, the initial unemployment claims between March 22-28 were 6,648,000. This is the highest level of seasonally adjusted initial claims in history and is a 101% increase compared to the prior week. The prior week, March 15-21, was 3,307,000 after revision.
Back to South Dakota, the Department of Labor and Regulation (DLR) reminds unemployment insurance claimants to request a weekly payment by calling 605-626-3212 after 6 p.m. CDT or by filing online at RAclaims.sd.gov any time.

Benefits are not automatically paid out, even though the work search requirement is currently waived.
“The claim week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday at midnight,” said state Labor and Regulation Secretary Marcia Hultman. “Your weekly request for payment will be filed for the previous week, and you cannot file for the week until it is over.”

Video tutorials have been created on the weekly request process and on other quick links and options available to a claimant when logged in, such as updating addresses or changing payment methods. 

To ensure benefits are not denied, be sure to file a weekly request for payment in a timely manner. Claimants have seven days from the end of the week to file for the previous week. All weekly requests for payment are recorded at Central Daylight Time (CDT).

If a claimant does not file a weekly request for payment within that one week filing time, they will need to call Customer Service at 605-626-2452. To cancel a claim, email your name and last four digits of Social Security number to CancelRA@state.sd.us.

Up until recently, food deliveries were a treat for many families. For many senior citizens and people with different abilities, food deliveries are essential. Meals on Wheels deliveries have increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. That means drivers have a lot more places to go. A local company is making a donation to make it easier for people who need deliveries to put food on their tables.

Just when you think marriage is for the birds, you meet a couple like Carolyn and Larry Vallette.
“We worked at Davis Taylor’s Dry Cleaning and we’ve been married now 44 years,” Carolyn said.
The two continue to take care of each other thanks to a promise they made in their wedding vows.
“He has been very helpful to me when I was sick, now he’s sick, so I’m helping him,” Carolyn said.
The Vallettes are housebound and get food from Meals on Wheels through Active Generations. The organization delivered 400 meals per day before COVID-19. That number has climbed.

That’s why Schulte Subaru is donating three brand new cars to help drivers get to where they’re needed.
“Since the COVID event started, and talking with them, their needs have tripled. We thought it was a great time to help them out,” Mike Schulte, owner, said.

“It’s so generous. It’s going to help in many ways,” Rebecca Behnke, nutrition director for Active Generations, said.

Behnke says with more routes, the new cars will help drivers deliver at least 100 more meals per day.
“It’s 100 people that weren’t getting meals because or not getting out to the grocery store because of COVID-19,” Behnke said.

Carolyn says the car donations mean a lot to her and her husband.

“I’m just so happy they donated them. I know the drivers really need them,” Carolyn said.
Just when you think everything is bad, you see how people in a community take care of each other, in sickness and in health.

Governor Kristi Noem (R-SD) held a media briefing Thursday to give an update on the spread of COVID-19 in South Dakota. In the briefing, Noem said the National Guard will help set up hospital capacity in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.

Federal funding will help cover the cost of using the National Guard.

Noem said the National Guard will be building up supplemental facilities and that it is important to keep COVID-19 patients separate from others.

The governor said the state is preparing for a second outbreak that could possibly happen in the fall. Noem added that the amount of unemployment claims in the state is “alarming.”

Noem said more COVID-19 projections will be made 
available on Friday. The state will also be giving details on the models South Dakota is using for these projections.

Noem said businesses in the state need to continue to be innovative and practice social distancing, while adjusting hours and business models.

Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said that hospitals in the state are preparing to see an increase in patients.

State prison inmates are producing utility personal protective equipment (PPE) for Department of Corrections and Correctional Health staff members.
Inmates in the Pheasantland Industries (PI) Garment Shop at the Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield are producing cotton jersey face masks and nylon gowns. Inmates in several PI shops at the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls are producing reusable and disposable face shields. Inmates in the Print Shop laser cut clear plastic sheets to size for the face shields, the Upholstery Shop inmates make the elastic bands with foam and the Metal Shop workers apply the metal and rivets to the shields.

“We ordered enough materials to produce approximately 3,000 gowns, 6,000 masks, 300 reusable face shields and 1,000 disposable face shields,” said Stefany Bawek, Director of Pheasantland Industries. “Production has begun on the masks and face shields. We expect the material for the gowns to arrive soon.”

While PI is not classified as a producer of medical equipment and the masks are not approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the items can be utilized for emergency situations when no other option is available. While the DOC has supplies of equipment for staff, there are national shortages of personal protective equipment, which makes acquiring additional items difficult. Medical grade equipment needs to be reserved for medical staff for treatment and emergencies.

“This is a perfect example of the DOC and PI staff members and those in our custody coming together to do what’s needed,” said Corrections Secretary Mike Leidholt. “I’m proud to lead an organization that maximizes our resources and our abilities to help out during this pandemic.”

Utility PPE items produced by Pheasantland Industries will also be made available to other governmental agencies.

*South Dakota / Spearfish* -

 In Spearfish today, people watch a local man, Rick Radliff, wearing shorts and flipflops, ascending to the top of Heisler's Hardware store in the cold. Radliff says, Spearfish pantries are running low on food donation recently, and to help raise funds, Radliff is going to stay on the roof until he could help raise 15 thousand dollars to help feed the community. A local roofing company even built handrails on the roof for Radliff's safety.
Radliff says, when leaning on these new handrails, he feels like he's on the Titanic! But if anyone wants to help get Rick off the roof, use GoFundMe.com or drop off donation at Heisler's Hardware.",SouthDakota,Man camps on rooftop to help raise funds for food pantries

*South Dakota* -

When you just hear the statistic, an estimated 30 to 70 percent of South Dakotans could contract COVID-19 before the virus subsides, the scenario is bleak.

However, Gov. Kristi Noem stresses that 80 percent of people who are diagnosed with the coronavirus show little to no symptoms. Coupled with that are the current actions South Dakotans are taking to “flattened the curve.”

“I appreciate that the people of South Dakota have taken this seriously,” Noem said during a Friday news conference. “They, when asked, have stepped up to the challenge and have done exactly what we have asked them to do to protect their families and to make sure we are in a good position to deal with this virus going across the state.”

This pushes back the date the virus is expected to peak; giving the state breathing room to prepare. The peak is now projected as sometime mid to late June. That’s just the peak of the virus; not when people are out of danger. That isn’t expected to happen until possibly the end of August.

Data suggests that South Dakota has flattened the curve enough that the state is now looking at the number of people who would be sick at one time during the peak of the virus is cut in half. “Which is fantastic,” Noem said.

When South Dakota hits it’s peak for infections, there will be an expected need for 5,000 hospital beds and 1,300 ventilators. That is based on computer models that claim about 5 percent of people with COVID-19 would need to be hospitalized and 26 percent of them would need ventilators.

“It is a very serious situation. A lot of people will have mild to no symptoms but there are people who will get very sick; and there are people who will not get better,” Noem said.

In early March, the state estimated that 30 percent of the population would probably contract COVID-19. That estimate has ballooned to anywhere from 30 to 70 percent; 265,000 to 600,000 people out of a population of more than 882,235.

Currently, only two people have died due to COVID-19. The state is hesitant to give an estimate on how many people could die but it could be anywhere from 0.5 to 3 percent of those infected.

341,batteen,1586028156,fuzljp,Nan,"I live 40 miles southwest of Aberdeen, on my family's farm.  I live in a house I built in a grain bin, and it's quite small so there's no room for another person.  Otherwise I'd offer to stay in my house.  My family owns the farmland around me, and after much begging and pleading they allowed me to use a small unfarmable portion to try to start a fruit farm.  They think I'm crazy.  Maybe I am.  I'm in my fourth year now.  I think it's going pretty well.

I have to work to support this endeavor until it takes off, and so I work in Aberdeen at Walmart.  I have a dog who is a very social creature and she's so sad that we left town with our roommates and stuff, even though she otherwise loves life on the farm.  She hates it when I go to work every day.  And now, she's getting old and arthritic, so not only is she sad and lonely while I'm gone, she's sad and lonely and in pain.  She's in less pain when we go out and stretch and move fairly often, but she doesn't move when I'm at work.

So, I'm looking for someone to help me take care of her.  I'm hoping that what I'm offering seems like a fair deal.  I know it's an unusual deal, and for most people unappealing, but maybe for the right person, it's a great deal.  Most likely either someone working remotely, or an online student.  Someone who likes the outdoors, likes being in the middle of nowhere with not many people around, loves dogs.

I have 100/100 fiber internet, and electricity, both of which you can have for free.  Keep it 65 in your camper all summer long, sounds great.  I haul my water in from Cresbard 4 miles away, so you'll have to too.  I don't have a septic system so I use the bucket and sawdust method and empty into a compost pile.  If you're not willing to give up the convenience of a real toilet I can probably figure out a way for you to empty your blackwater tank, but you'll have to move your camper to do it.  If your camper is easy enough to move, you can put it wherever you want on the property.  If you want electricity obviously you can't go too far from the quonsets but if you don't need a/c there are some nice places to camp.  You can put it inside the quonset during stormy weather.

If you want to have a garden or some chickens or something, you can totally do that.  I have plenty of room.  If you have pets of your own you want to bring, that's probably cool, but let's talk about it first.  We might have to have a meet and greet to see if our dogs are compatible.  Cats are for sure cool.

I can get along with pretty much anyone who's chill.  I don't care what your religious or political beliefs are.  Personally I don't really know what the right answer is, but I'm pretty sure neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have it.  I wish people were better at cooperating and working together.  I'm 420 friendly and ok with moderate responsible alcohol use.

Your responsibilities with Athena are to have her with you in the camper all day while I'm at work, and to walk her at least a half a mile while I'm gone.  That's it.  I work 4-5 days a week now and will drop to 3-4 days a week when gardening season kicks in to high gear.

My responsibilities to you are electricity, internet, and a safe place to store your camper during a storm.  You can fill up with water at the same place I do in Cresbard.  You can also shower and do laundry there.  You're on your own for food.  I have an electric hot plate you can borrow for your camper if you want to cook without using propane.

Does that sounds interesting to anyone?  Message me for questions or more info. I'll message you my facebook profile and you can cruise it for pictures of me and the dog and the farm.",SouthDakota,I'm looking for someone to live on my farm in their camper for free if they help me take care of my dog while I'm at work

*South Dakota* -

South Dakota state representative Bob Glanzer died from coronavirus Friday night.

Glanzer, 74, is the second member of his family to die from COVID-19, The Associated Press reported.

He is the first sitting U.S. legislator to die from the virus.

“No words can describe the sorrow, but no words can describe the joy of knowing he is with God for eternity,” Glanzer’s son Tom wrote in a Facebook postannouncing his death. “Our family would like to thank the amazing staff at Avera McKennan Hospital &amp; University Health Center for their amazing care of our dad and of us. Their work was even more appreciated during this truly trying time in our world.”

In the South Dakota House, Glanzer represented the state’s 22nd District, in the east-central part of the state. He lived in the town of Huron, about 275 miles west of Minneapolis.

Glanzer was the fourth person in South Dakota to die from COVID-19.

Op: Waited two day for local media to cover this story. Rest in peace Bob Glanzer.
