SNICKERDOODLES &amp; SHORTBREADS

by Morris Stuttard. Story booked by Nabiel

‚ÄúMe? Christmas was more the stuff we did. Playing Nat King Cole while decoratin‚Äô the tree. Helping Ma make snickerdoodles and shortbreads. Grandpops with the same joke on repeat‚Äîtelling us to look at the baubles on the tree; said they were crystal balls and if ya looked into ‚Äòem, you‚Äôd see how fat you‚Äôll be once Christmas is gone done.

‚ÄúAnd Pops would tell me it was my job to make mistletoe. The ingredients were the same every year: apple trees, a ladder, secateurs, and a boy still too young to fear death by fallin‚Äô.

‚ÄúI never told him that each year I was more afraid to go up those trees than I was the last. By sixteen I was darn-near terrified. ‚ÄòGot some christmas spice this year, Tye‚Äîdamn gale‚Äôs a blowing out there,‚Äô Pops said before we went out.

‚ÄúThere weren‚Äôt no berries on the apple-tree mistletoe that year so Pops sent me up an oak‚Äîa tall straight one whose lowest branches were still four men high. I remember‚Äîthe old tree weren‚Äôt swaying that day, the thing was flapping when I climbed it. And wi‚Äô me way up there, clipping away in a fury at the sprigs of mistletoe like I were Denzel Scissorhands or some god damn... And the sprigs of mistletoe dropped down and went bouncing across the field in the wind, with pops chasing em down, shouting up that I‚Äôd done good, and all the while both my hands shaking more than grandpops‚Äô cigarette during overtime in a Cowboys game. But I got the damn mistletoe.

‚ÄúAnd we had white Christmases sometimes too‚Äînot like here‚Äîand we all went sledding down Truman Hill. Went so damn far and fast one time that I had to jump off before I hit the river. We spent the next half hour trying to fish the thing out of the water with them metal rods that poke out of concrete.‚Äù

‚ÄúRebars,‚Äù comes Luca‚Äôs twang from inside his tent, the glow of his phone screen floating supernaturally behind the blue nylon. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre called rebars to those that know.‚Äù

A silence lingers as Tye lets his thoughts wander more. He heaves out a clouded sigh. ‚ÄúWonder if Ma and Pops think about the Christmases when they were kids, or the Christmases when we were.‚Äù

A silence more.

Until Tye finishes his thought. ‚ÄúChristmas is only fun when you‚Äôre a littl‚Äôun. Ain‚Äôt meant for grown ups. Not more than facilitatin‚Äô anyways.‚Äù

None of the line of huddled men and women on the street say anything to disagree. But rarely do they say anything when it‚Äôs this cold. Conversation is for summer when you‚Äôre on the street.

There is movement at last from Tye‚Äôs right. Old Cody lifts his Santa hat from his eyes but doesn‚Äôt go as far as to open them. ""That‚Äôs the first time I heard you say a single nice thing about your pops.""

Tye spits so hard through his teeth that it nearly hits some high-heeled boots trotting by on the sidewalk.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the first time I heard him say anything nice ‚Äòbout *anyone*,‚Äù adds Luca.

‚ÄúShow me someone worth talking nice about and I‚Äôll sing ‚Äòem a damn song,‚Äù says Tye, and he wipes a dripping nose on the back of his mittens.

More people shuffle by, spattering the sheltered section of San Francisco sidewalk with brown water from the icy rain. Cardboard shopping bags from designer stores clack against each other like ducks on the run. The murmur of people on the phone is as constant as the jammed cars in the street beyond.

One pair of wool-suited legs and sheeny black shoes ostensibly steps aside to let a girl move past the pole of scaffolding first. He treads on Tye‚Äôs trouser leg.

‚ÄúSorry, buddy. Didn‚Äôt see you there.‚Äù

Tye narrows eyes. ‚ÄúNot what you say to us on the street, ‚Äòbuddy‚Äô.‚Äù

And the man moves on, pretending not to hear what he had already failed to see.

‚ÄúWhat d‚Äôyou get like that for? The guy apologised, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù growls Cody as he pulls the hat back over his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to make ‚Äòem notice us any more talking up like that.‚Äù And he gives the sorry cup of mostly-quarters in his hand a single shake to make his complaint more specific.

‚ÄúI tried being nice last Wednesday.‚Äù Tye turns on his side and goes to pull his sleeping bag over some apparently unassailable cold spot near his collar. But the moment he moves his shoulder, the top of the cover slips and his exposed neck gets another gust of Christmas Eve wind.

He tries again. But again the cover slips down. Furious, Tye leaps up from his mound of clothes and covers so suddenly it‚Äôs like a monster from a mound of leaves. The latest constipation of shoppers veer away from him. Glances swim past as he stands at their level‚Äîsome furtive, others challenging. Cody lifts both hat and eyelids this time.

But Tye just turns his back on the passers by and reaches up for a high-neck fleece hanging to dry on a scaffolding pole. Centimetres behind is a designer showroom where plastic figures wear clothes of a quality Tye has never even felt between his fingers. The original turquoise of his fleece now better matches the colour of the Bay in torchlight, and it‚Äôs clearly flacid with wetness even before his fingers rub it to check.

‚ÄúI swear these windows were heated yesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe shouldn‚Äôt a hung your shorts up there, like I told ya,‚Äù comes Luca‚Äôs squawk again.

‚ÄúWhere the goddam else am I going to hang ‚Äòem, huh?‚Äù

The tent unzips and Luca‚Äôs neolithic arrow-head of a nose pokes out, illuminated by the phone he is playing on. ‚ÄúYou see. There are certain inconveniences to being homeless, Tye. Certain things you have to go without‚Ä¶ Like heated hanging rails.‚Äù

Tye turns and walks off.

‚ÄúHey! Where you going? Get me a coffee!‚Äù

But Tye is already embedded in the sea of shoppers, who part almost biblically, keeping half a metre away from him at all sides. He shouts loud over the honking horns of traffic‚Äîto everyone and to no one. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done freezing out here! I ain‚Äôt no dog. And ain‚Äôt no dog should be freezin‚Äô like this neither.‚Äù With that, he walks right off the sidewalk, weaving through the static congestion of mostly yellow cars, sending up more horn honks into the skyscraper-walled cavern of the business district street.

Cody is watching with both eyes now as Tye reaches the other side of the road

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that fool goin‚Äô now?‚Äù asks Luca, straining from his tent to see.

Cody sees Tye stomping towards a policeman on the other side of the road, who is typing out a ticket on a small device in his hand. Tye pulls off the mitten of his right hand as he gets near.

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs gone hunting for a warm cell.‚Äù

The policeman, smaller than Tye in height and shoulder, looks up just as Tye is in full swing‚Äîa slap so wide-arcing and so straight-elbowed that Charlie Chaplin would have clapped.

SPAK!‚Äîgrubby open palm hits cold, wet and raw cheek.

When the policeman‚Äôs face returns forward, his eyes are a fury.

Tye turns his wrists upwards and gives the policeman a look of ‚ÄòWell? Arrest me.‚Äô

And gets a fist hard in the nose. He goes down as quickly as moments ago he jumped up, clutching it.

‚ÄúTry that again and I‚Äôll shoot your damn ass off,‚Äù shouts the policeman so loudly that Cody can hear it even over the honking cars and Luca in full hysterics beside him.

The policeman finishes booking the car and keeps walking. Tye hauls himself up to a crouch. The more human of the passers by flinch to help, only to realise their hands will get dirty and so keep their help to a flinch. A young suit with a preened beard and fur-neck coat wills him to get back on his feet with awkward hands and sorry eyes. Tye does, and shakes off the hands that aren‚Äôt touching him, before stomping back across the sea of taxis to the corridor of scaffolding-covered homelessness.

‚ÄúBroke my nose. That‚Äôs police brutality right there. Did anyone get a video?‚Äù He says as he staggers back to his spot.

‚ÄúYou... hit him first.‚Äù Luca is still laughing so hard his tent is shaking.

‚ÄúThat was just to get arrested. Ow.‚Äù And Tye drops back onto his stack of clothes and cardboard.

A wet fleece falls on Tye‚Äôs head like an oversized flannel. Even Cody chuckles at this.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with this city.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot before the city‚Äôs done wi‚Äô you,‚Äù says Cody. And he pulls the white rim of his Santa hat back over his eyes as if submerging into a warm bath.

Tye spits blood into the space between his shoes and leans back‚Äîpart exhaustion and part so that the blood will run back into his nose not out.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù

It‚Äôs then that something catches his attention out of the corner of his eye. Two people are distinct from the hurried stream of evening shoppers. Unlike everyone else, they are not going anywhere. They are stopped, and what is more, looking at the line of hunched men and women beneath the scaffolding in their cardboard boxes, tents or, like Tye, buried in leaf-heaps of discarded clothes. Looking at them individually.

A middle-aged lady, delicate, elegant and thin-boned‚Äîlike an Audrey Hepburn taking late afternoon tea at Tiffany‚Äôs‚Äîbows down so that she may hear what her nine year old son is saying. The boy stands tall and straight like a miniature president, with brown hair neatly quiffed even where it protrudes from his high-fashion trappers‚Äô hat. The two appear to be gradually moving along the line of strewn men and women, discussing each in turn. It is almost as if they were window-shopping, except they are not looking into the stores at all but at the people huddled in the windows‚Äô light before them.

As they get closer, Tye can hear them.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll know when I see, Mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, but we have already ‚Äòseen‚Äô a good many, dear‚Ä¶ At least a type? You have a type you‚Äôre looking for perhaps?‚Äù The mother speaks with an accent so refinedly British it verges on caricature.

‚ÄúMrs Jennings says it‚Äôs rude to talk about people as types,‚Äù replies the boy, still looking at the row as he goes.

‚ÄúYes. Well. What distinguishing features, then?‚Äù

‚ÄúHim,‚Äù says the boy. He is pointing directly at Tye now, who has just finished depositing two twisted knots of tissue into each nostril.

The mother smiles at Tye then leads her son out of earshot. All Tye can think about is how wonderfully smooth her skin seems.

He watches her lips and thinks she is saying something to her son about Tye being a black man. Or perhaps he is imagining it.

The boy just nods and looks up at his mother. His face stoney with decision. The mother lays a hand on his shoulder and nods an okay, before returning to Tye and bending down respectfully to his level. Cody and Luca are all ears and eyes now too.

‚ÄúHello there. I do hope we‚Äôre not bothering you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine‚Äîbegging kind of just happens.‚Äù

She gets the joke quickly. Not like most people he speaks to. And her teeth gleam in the store window‚Äôs light as she smiles. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name, might I ask?‚Äù

‚ÄúTyson. But they call me Tye.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, this is Jonathan. And I am Mrs Peterson. I hope you don‚Äôt mind my asking, but what happened to your nose? You were... fighting?‚Äù

Her effort to hide any judgment shows just how much judgment there actually is, eddying around her question.

‚ÄúFighting? Me! Ha! No. I only do hugs.‚Äù

His humour makes the truth more palatable and she smirks, eyes sparkling beyond the cosmetically-enhanced norm. Jonathan leaves her cashmere-jacketed side and steps forward.

‚ÄúWe want to invite you for Christmas lunch,‚Äù says Jonathan with impressive simplicity.

Her mother lays a flustered hand on his shoulder as if to steady his directness, and says with an almost angelic warmth, ‚ÄúYes. It would be a great pleasure if you‚Äôd come.‚Äù

Tye just stares at them.

Mrs Peterson sees she clearly needs to do some explaining and gives a little cough as dainty as most people‚Äôs giggles.

‚ÄúErm. We‚Äôll be entirely honest... I would love to say this offer comes only from the goodness of our hearts. But as well as wanting very much to give you a good meal, along with access to sanita... our bathroom facilities, and some new clothes, it would also be helping us. You see, Jonathan needs to demonstrate he is engaging with the community. For his university applications you understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs what, nine?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly right. But the earlier the better‚Äîwe don‚Äôt want the admissions people thinking he only did the said ‚Äòengaging‚Äô for the sake of his application, you-‚Äù

‚Äú-understand. Sure. Got it.‚Äù Tye eyes the boy, who is either compliant to the point of servility or actually genuinely wants this. ‚ÄúSo let me get this straight‚Äîyou want me to come to your house, have a bath... I get a bath right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd new clothes? And a meal?‚Äù

‚ÄúNew*ish* clothes, yes. Goose and all the trimmings too. Made by my own fair hands.‚Äù She gives a laugh like the shiver of a chandelier. ‚ÄúWhat do you say? Tomorrow at eleven thirty? We live on the top of 22nd street.‚Äù

Tye feels Cody and Luca‚Äôs eyes, and knows Luca is less than a second away from volunteering in his stead.

‚ÄúSure. Deal.‚Äù

‚ÄúSplendid. Here‚Äôs our address.‚Äù She hands him a card from her neat little tan leather purse and smiles more pearls before straightening like a swan looking to the sky, and gliding with the boy off into the stream of shoppers. Jonathan turns and gives Tye a wave through a flurry of sleet.

Tye musters enough positivity to wave back. The kid smiles.

‚ÄúAnd you say you don‚Äôt ever get no lucky break‚Ä¶‚Äù grumbles Luca.

‚ÄúNot quite sure what this is,‚Äù says Tye, to everyone and no one.

‚ÄúCity ain‚Äôt done with you yet,‚Äù says Cody.

In his response, he asked if there was anything he or other Redditors could do to help.


All of this said, I probably shouldn‚Äôt have used the word crippling but my anxiety is very bad. I‚Äôm not on meds, but the older I‚Äôve gotten that harder I‚Äôve found it to meet people as I don‚Äôt typically feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in most social situations. Now, part of that may be due to the fact that I don‚Äôt drink (1.5 years now!) but I don‚Äôt identify as an alcoholic so I‚Äôve refrained from AA/ have received feedback that those spaces are best used for identifying members. 


The other part of it though (from my years of being an adult in other cities who DID drink) is that for introverts it can be very hard to make friends. I‚Äôve tried meetup.com but that tends to be a lot of 1. Extroverts 2.social partiers. There aren‚Äôt a lot of activities for 30 somethings who want to form genuine relationships as that‚Äôs a little more intimate than a bar crawl.


And if you‚Äôre thinking it, yes I‚Äôm single and please don‚Äôt even get me started on dating in this city. If you‚Äôve got advice there pls be my guest.  No I‚Äôm not bitter ;)


Whew! My point is that I‚Äôd love to know if the fine souls of Reddit, some of whom are introverts anonymous, have any ideas or interest for meeting up in real life with the intention of getting to know each other. Maybe making plans once a month or so to check out a museum, show, dinner, or watch a game. I may not drink but I actually enjoy and miss bars (tiki and sports being my favorite) as well as the ease they sometimes brought to meeting different people. If you‚Äôre a sober person who doesn‚Äôt do well in bars tho please PM me or sound off in the comments so we could potentially do a separate meetup for sober Redditors in SF.


TLDR: please share interest and ideas for a Reddit SF meetup for those who need a gentle nudge into IRL. If you‚Äôre cool as hell in social situations please feel free to join as well, lordt knows we need you! 
Mods: sorry if this isn‚Äôt allowed I can delete or move it if need be. Just let me know.

This is an actual proclamation by one of the 19th century's most colorful crackpots, the self-proclaimed Emperor Norton, who was well-known in his time and tolerated, if not loved by many people in the Bay Area.

The Emperor also issued a decree in 1872 to build a bridge between Oakland and SF that essentially follows the eventual route of the Bay Bridge, gave an order to dissolve the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as a number of other hair-brained schemes that don't sound all that bad to the modern ear.

""At 3:30 pm on Friday, January 3rd, 13-year-old Sienna Carter left UCSF‚Äôs  Madison Clinic for Pediatric Diabetes telling her mother and grandmother she was sick and needed to get some air. She never returned.  At approximately 4:00 pm and two miles across the city, restaurant server Jaclyn Davis was starting her shift and noticed ‚Äúthis little tiny person‚Äù shivering in the ally. Jaclyn invited the girl inside the restaurant and grew concerned that a young girl was seemingly alone in the city. At approximately 6:30 pm, the girl abruptly left the restaurant and ‚Äúfollowing my gut‚Äù Jacklyn chose to pursue. The young woman walked quickly and met a man, they embraced and walked off on foot. Jaclyn observed the pair meticulously ‚Äúto make sure that no matter what, I could identify them again‚Äù.

We were away from the car for no longer than 5-10 minutes and we came back to a smashed passenger side window. Thought a rock fell at first until we realized mine and our friend's purses were stolen.

After calling the cops, we soon learned that we were the 5th car to have this happen within the past hour. Filed a report, called credit card companies, etc. 

We are devastated. It's hard not to feel blame toward ourselves, but it was the people who did this who are solely at fault. We had so many important things taken from us. Not just things of value (like $150 cash, headphones, etc), but sentimental items as well. Now I have to hope United Airlines lets me board without valid ID...

I don't intend this to stir up the typical beehive or even really as humor (well, kind of), but as a legit curiosity about SF that  I've been pondering and that some lazy internet/reddit searching hasn't revealed - but regarding the new DA and the national headlines about not prosecuting prostitution, camping, drugs, etc...  


Do these lifestyle crime definitions extend to all people?  On my next visit to SF can I, oh...let's say...go enjoy golden gate park and snort a line off a prostitute's chest while chilling on a sidewalk?  


My example is extreme and dumb, but in all seriousness - can one now just openly do drugs or maybe skip a line for a bathroom and feel free to pee against the nearest wall?  And if one did get arrested for doing these things, would you have a case as being unfairly targeted or profiled for your appearance when others are openly and publicly stated as not to be prosecuted?

449,vanwyngarden,1578713569,en262n,Nan,"‚Ä™When I was waiting in line for Dave Chappelle Sunday (hell of a show by the way, 7PM)  I witnessed something that really struck me. A woman and her bf were in front of me and he went to go pick up some food while we all waited (doors were in an hour and a half). When he came back, he saw that a homeless man had sat down near the line with his dog and a sign. Without hesitation, he said it was a lot of food and they could give the second order to the gentleman. She said of course and so they divvied it up and he walked it over to him. Respectfully asked if he would be interested in the gyro then handed it to him. I have no doubt that they‚Äôd done it before. While a small gesture, it was inherently kind. 

Living in San Francisco, I regret that I‚Äôve become somewhat desensitized to homelessness. It is around every corner. They‚Äôre hurting and while I consider myself an ok person, even I‚Äôve stopped really seeing them. I‚Äôm sharing this with you because I vowed to carry that day into my next. While I cannot help everyone, I can afford to help some. 

Tonight while in Burger King getting my $1 ice cream cone I saw multiple people struggling. I saw many on the bus there leaving work and on the block walking up. When I got to the counter, I got two $5 gift cards to hand two of the people in the booths. I was thinking of the couple I saw last weekend. There is so much to be sad about in this world and not all of us can help how we‚Äôd like, but even a tiny gesture can make someone a little more comfortable for even a couple hours. It‚Äôs so easy to judge but truthfully we never know what someone else is going though. Both people I handed the cards were startled someone was even speaking to them. Their smiles were just like all smiles. Joyful and pure. 

I‚Äôm telling you this so that you to may share in my experience and do something kind for someone else when you can. Perhaps keep a few gift cards to hand out. If they have a 2 for 1 special at Walgreens share the 2nd Gatorade. But please be respectful, discreet, and ASK. I‚Äôve got a lot of things I can work on and do different. This is one of them. 

You never know how your gestures may impact others. It is just a small way I imagine it might be used for good. This city and depression can be a mind F and I just hope this helps someone remember there are good people here too. Maybe you do something like this. Or you wanted to. May this be your sign! If you think this post is lame, feel free to downvote and sound off in the comments. I‚Äôm a sentimental fool, admittedly.

502,txcatlover-1,1578845780,enpcg5,Nan,"Hi! So Im looking to move to San Francisco pretty soon. Ive lived in Texas/nyc my entire life and I‚Äôm ready for a change. After discussing with family/friends, I‚Äôm focusing on San Francisco because of weather, culture, jobs, things to do, etc. I‚Äôve been many times so I know sort of what to expect (or not at all! Haha). I have tons of questions about living, finding an apartment, etc. 

I‚Äôm currently searching for tech and consulting jobs so mostly it depends on that. I‚Äôve been working in oil &amp; gas consulting, but would like to make the switch to renewables if possible. 

I‚Äôve given myself a deadline of May to quit my job and hopefully move to the Bay Area in June or July. (Also hopefully with a job lined up ü§£). I have a family friend who has a house in Palo Alto, and they said I can stay there for a little while (month or month &amp; a half) while I get settled. I think this would give me time to find apartments and roommates on the weekends. 

1. Is staying in Palo Alto and commuting to SF daily doable? Is there public transportation between the two or would I need a car? I know parking is a nightmare...

2. How easy is it to find roommates? I have many mutual friends there but not a ton of people that I know personally 

3. Where do you look for apartments? Craigslist seems sketchy to me but finding apartments in Texas is a lot different. Is there anything like the apps street easy or roomi in nyc? 

4. What areas should I look in? I‚Äôm 25, I go out pretty frequently, love doing activities, very into yoga and hiking.  

5. Is it absolutely insane to bring my 2 cats? 

6. I imagine keeping a car once I get to the city is a nightmare. Should I keep it or sell? Parking is awful, parking spots are expensive, but it would make it easy to get out of the city. Worth it?

7. Can someone explain rent controlled apartments? I‚Äôve seen it online but no good explanation of the risks or benefits or how to find them. 

Thank you so much - I will probably have more questions later!",sanfrancisco,Moving to San Francisco

I know living expenses are pretty ridiculous, and fortunately I have some family in the Bay Area I can probably live with for at least a couple years to save money, which is why I'm still considering SF as a place to live and work. I've grown up in Seattle and honestly kinda hate the short winter days and cloud cover/rain so I'd like to try out a slightly warmer, sunnier area, even though I know SF gets a lot of fog and cold summers etc. 

Could I get some input on life in SF especially for a post grad, and whether you think it's worth it to try living in SF? What about grad school in the Bay Area? Anything is appreciated, thanks!

Why, besides just taking the $150+ cash inside a dropped wallet outside a bar, why did you actually take the time to switch my clipper card out with an empty one before dropping it off with the restaurant? That's no longer ""I just needed the money"" which I can forgive, that's plain malicious.

You could have just taken the whole Clipper card, or the whole wallet for that matter, so I didn't have to find out it's the wrong Clipper with only $1.75 on a rainy Thursday morning running late for work. Hell you'd have made an easy $200+ reselling that wallet if you kept the whole thing. You could have dropped it in a USPS blue box.

I noticed this small, middle-age,  Asian (not that it matters) woman get on the bus with a bunch of Trader Joe‚Äôs bags. The stop was close to a TJ‚Äôs, so makes sense. Nothing out of the ordinary about her. Well groomed and dressed, acting normal, etc. I get off my stop and walk about 5 blocks to my work shuttle stop, there‚Äôs nobody else there at this time. Randomly I look behind me and am taken aback when I see that same woman standing RIGHT behind me. Like less than 1 foot behind me. Keep in mind there is plenty of open space and this is a shuttle stop for my work private shuttle only. Feeling uncomfortable, I casually take a few steps to the right so we‚Äôre about 4 feet from each other. In my peripheral I can see her head pointed toward me. We stand like this for about 30 seconds. Right when I‚Äôm about to take a second glance, she walks in front of me. Again, she nearly brushes me as she walks by because she‚Äôs so close, and as she does, she looks up at me dead in the eyes. Her stare was chilling! Then she walked off in the direction we came. 

I have no idea what just happened. Could‚Äôve been nothing, but it made me so uncomfortable I just had to write it out. I thought maybe she was trying to pick pocket me, but I can‚Äôt imagine someone attempting this with a bunch of groceries in her hands. Who knows!

I'd never been to San Francisco or California in general, before--I've always known that I want to be a filmmaker and it wasn't LA that was calling to me, it was San Francisco. After growing up somewhere Connecticut that I never quite fit in and was unable to be myself or grow, San Francisco welcomed me with open arms. From the moment I arrived, I knew I was starting something that would  be an incredible journey. I fell in love with San Francisco. I was in a city of outcasts, artists, and eccentrics. 

July 2020 will mark a decade of living in SF. A lot has changed in this city during this time; not just the city, but the people (including myself). Unbeknownst to me, I had just moved to San Francisco right when the next tech boom was about to hit and change everything. In a way, San Francisco and I were going through growing pains together during this time. I was evolving with her and as she turned from the bohemian-mecca to the Hollywood of Silicon Valley. I watched the artists, eccentrics, and friends start to disappear, slowly. I started to become cynical and resented the techies. Like a child, I was refusing to change, but eventually realized that the city was going to change whether I want it to or not; I needed to ride the wave. People love to say ""San Francisco is dead"", but cities change all the time and it's up to the people that live here to bring that character and eccentricities form within ourselves and encourage others to embrace it as well. As a proud San Francisco based Filmmaker, I love calling this city my home. She's given me so many opportunities to grow and flourish into my filmmaking career and be a better person in general. Now that I've shared my long-winded personal story of San Francisco, I want to discuss A24's The Last Black Man in San Francisco (2019) directed by SF native Joe Talbot alongside fellow native and co-writer Jimmy Fails.

You know when you see a film that just speaks to your soul and feels as though it was made only for you? You see something so poignant and cathartic that it haunts you. This film is very special, but not just for me but for everyone who grew up in this incredible city. This film was the ultimate love letter and eulogy to San Francisco. It was the passing of the torch from the people that built the very foundation this city stands for to the new wave of young outcasts with dreams. Change isn't bad, as long as you never forget where your roots are. Jimmy refused to evolve with his city in a way that was admirable as it was foolish. What's incredible about this story is that it doesn't cast blame on a specific group of people and also manages to not feel preachy or political. This film was the catharsis all San Franciscans needed. It helped me realize that we're not alone and like any family, we will have rough patches. We are a grieving family and chasing after nostalgia because it feels familiar and safe; but instead we should be creating something new while bravely looking forward into the uncertain and unknown future. If Jimmy was able to bravely sail off into the bay area sunset to accept that the city he calls his home will always be firmly cemented within him no matter where he goes.

There's a fantastic scene at the end where Jimmy sits on MUNI and overhears two girls talking about how they hate SF saying that it's ""dead"". Jimmy says to them ""you don't get to hate San Francisco...You don't get to hate it unless you love it"". This sums up how we San Franciscans all feel and presented it in a very simple yet poetic way. 

Jimmy's story doesn't end there. We know he will be fine because wherever he goes he will bring San Francisco with him. Jimmy is only one story, though. Everyone here has their own story and idea of what this city means to them. We all helped one another get to where we are right now. I love my 7x7 mile home in the city by the bay and will always face changes as they come while knowing Jimmy and other characters are all by my side.

762,mangotail,1579390676,eqoed6,Nan,"I live in one of those houses with multiple units. My neighbors have been absolutely fine and usually keep to themselves. But today I received a complaint that my dining room light is too bright and needs to be dimmed in the evenings.. Although it's a dining room, I use it as a study room. I have my desk in there where I work in the evenings, usually until midnight, and because of that I do leave my lights on so I see while I work. 

This complaint is from the house next to mine. I have one big window (stretched from the floor to the ceiling) in the dining room where I have put a window film on half of the window for privacy. The other half of the window doesn't have the film so I can get some sunlight during the day. I also don't have any drapes installed, mostly because I plan to move out in the summer and don't want to waste the money. The two houses kind of mirror each other so, my neighbor also has a huge window right next mine in his dining/living room. He has blinds and drapes already installed on his windows. 

My neighbor has taped a sign onto his window that I need to dim my lights in the evenings. I've been living in this apartment for 8 months, and never had an issue before with him. There is also no way to dim the light, it's either on or off.

My stance is that if he has issues with my dining room light, he should close his drapes &amp; blinds instead of telling me what to do in my own home. I work and am going to university at the same time, so that's why I am studying late into the night in the evenings. But, I also want to make sure I have the correct stance and check if I am in the wrong. We have the same landlord, so maybe I can talk to him about it. Or, at the very least put a window film on the top half of my dining room window so the light doesn't bother him as much. Although, I still feel like I am not in the wrong here (please correct me if I am!).",sanfrancisco,Neighbor has issues with my dining room light - need advice

\[Haters of higher education, please do not comment below. Not my prose. Supporters please post elsewhere. Thank you.\]  (1/28 &amp; 1/31) Upcoming City Hall hearings to stop the cuts and restore spring schedule!  Yesterday, the Board of Supervisors Budget and Finance Committee reviewed our ordinance (sponsored by Supervisor Walton) to allocate $2.7 million for bridge funding to CCSF in order to restore the Spring Schedule. Supes Sandra Fewer and Shamman Walton voted in favor of sending it to the full board. Rafael Mandelman voted against it, saying, ‚ÄúI really do not understand this particular proposal,‚Äù Mandelman said. ‚ÄúCity College has not officially asked for this.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúCity College needs to get its fiscal house in order.‚Äù  Once again, students, faculty, and community turned out supporting our college with spirited public comment that went for almost an hour. They argued that the class cuts were misguided and implemented with no input from faculty or chairs in a surprise ‚Äúmidnight massacre‚Äù on the eve of registration. They made a clear case that the city has the responsibility to ensure that City College remain the community college that the communities in San Francisco need.  The funding would come out of the city budget‚Äôs general fund reserve, which has about $130 million in it. This allocation would be a bridge until the voters can weigh in on a Community Higher Education Fund (CHEF), this November. Similar to the voter approved Public Education Enrichment Fund (PEEF) that provides tens of millions of dollars annually to the San Francisco Unified School District, CHEF would also leverage funds from The City to pay for the kind of community college that San Francisco wants and needs.  Help keep CCSF a college open to all of our San Francisco communities! Join two upcoming hearings at City Hall on the devastating class cuts at City College:  Tuesday, 1/28 from 1-4pm -- Rally and Hearing. Join the 1pm rally on Polk Street Steps and stay for public comment to the full Board of Supervisors at their regular meeting. Supervisor Walton's $2.7M Emergency Bridge Funds ordinance could help reverse more than 300 classes just slashed from the CCSF schedule.  Friday, 1/31 from 9:30-11:30 Press Conference &amp; Hearing: Join the 9:30am press conference and stay for public comment to the Joint Education Committee. As we continue the fight for bridge funds to restore our Spring 2020 schedule, Supervisor Walton has called a Joint Education Committee hearing on the effects that class cuts have on low income students and students of color.  Mark your calendar! And in the meantime, please keep up the pressure on the Supes listed below.

We just need 2 more! If we get them, we will be able to restore many (though sadly not all) of the classes for a late start schedule. Make calls!

It's restaurant week (or, technically, 10 days, for the pedantic dipshits reading this [am I implying that y'all are pedantic dipshits? Not categorically!])!  From January 22nd until whenever-the-fuck (January 31st, don't @ me), a bunch of legit fucking restaurants are doing mildly to moderately legit tasting menus for brunch, lunch, and dinner. 

Is it a good deal? Someone on this horrendous dumpster fire of a subreddit implied it isn't. The reality? It is, sort of (if you do your research, or go to Spruce for lunch). Get your valet to do that research for you. I can guarantee that it's some sort of deal, and at least you'll be supporting local business.

If you ain't into getting the BEST FUCKING DEAL: Consider it an opportunity to try someplace new. Consider it an opportunity to try something new, or to target a neighborhood you've been meaning to have dinner in and explore. Consider it the moment you've been looking for to get out of the fucking hellhole you've created for yourself in indentured servitude to Lyft, or Facebook--or whoever owns your labor--and experience the city you ostensibly moved to in order to enjoy for the milliseconds before your email pings again with the same URGENT WORK PROBLEM you've been having for the last 3 years.

947,strobonic,1579806647,esxrby,Nan,"Hey all.  Got doored riding my bike on Tuesday on Market in SF between 4:00 and 4:10PM heading inbound (towards the Ferry Building).  I didn't sustain any bodily injuries (just a sore left bicep that I can only assume is from slamming on my front brake.)  Bike seems fine, but could possibly need some service to the front wheel, I won't have a chance to take it in for service until the weekend.  If that's all that's wrong with it I probably won't pursue anyone for any damages.  But I decided I need to file a police report just to have something on record.

While I got the driver's information, I was so disoriented after the collision that I didn't note and don't remember exactly which intersection it happened at.  Turns out I didn't have geotagging turned on on my cell phone, so the photos I took of the driver's information unfortunately don't have GPS coords.  My fitness watch's GPS info goes nuts in FiDi between Montgomery and the Ferry Building, so after reviewing it, it's of no use.  Anyway, I want the incident location information on record, if at the VERY least so there is another accurate data point for traffic incidents.

It was possibly Market &amp; 1st but I think it was more likely Market &amp; Main St.  I was filtering past stopped cars slowly on the right hand side against the curb.  It was a black Lyft 4D sedan.  A passenger threw open the rear right door suddenly and I nailed the door right in the center of it.  The exiting passenger was not hit at all.  It was low enough speed that I did not fall off the bike, just gave the completely open door a solid thunk with my front wheel.  

Please message me if you saw this collision.  Also, please don't comment with anything disparaging about cars, rideshares, or cyclists.  That's not the point of this post.  Literally just looking for accurate info about the collision.  Thank you so much!",sanfrancisco,Did you see someone get doored on Tuesday? Market St. inbound around 4PM.

About the donation:

*SWELLS: The annual Labor Day bash thrown by world-class advertising man Robert Pritikin at his rather palatial premises located on Chenery near 30th in Upper Noe Valley/Lower Fairmount caused quite a splash in the local press.*

*Pritikin confirms that he announced at that party his plan to bequeath his estate to the City and County of San Francisco, to use as the mayoral mansion or as a cultural center. He is trying to work out the details with the city now. ""This property has one of the largest privately owned areas in the city,"" explains Pritikin. ""It stretches across an entire city block, from Chenery to Dolores. I'm told it currently has a value of--and I know it sounds crazy--somewhere around $40 million.""*",sanfrancisco,"Today I learned a San Francisco ad exec offered to bequeath a $5.5 million dollar residence in Glen Park to the city of San Francisco, to be used as the mayoral residence in perpetuity. It occupies a whole city blog and is one of the largest estates in the city. The city said no."

That said, I should be the person set to benefit most from Market Street going car-free. But I‚Äôm dreading it.

I love European-style car-free streets where they make sense. But Market Street? It‚Äôs cold, gross, and it‚Äôs a pivotal traffic interchange area. Why can‚Äôt we make Valencia Street car-free instead? That‚Äôs actually a fun street with marginally nicer weather and local businesses. Plus it won‚Äôt screw up traffic all over the city if we block it off.

Construction is slated to take FIVE YEARS. And they say it‚Äôll cost a little under $700 million to do... but five year city government projects always seem to double in cost by the end. Think about what we could do to end homelessness or build housing or subsidize public transit fares for that cost!

Oh, yeah, back to the five years of construction on Market Street. I have to pass through Market every day. This is going to be a half-decade nightmare. All for nothing.

Will Market Street be safer? Well, apparently taxis will still be allowed on it, and we‚Äôll still have busses and trolleys on it, so I don‚Äôt really see how much safer and ‚Äúpedestrian friendly‚Äù this is going to be.

Why are we doing this? Why are we spending all this money and creating more traffic and doing at least $700M in unnecessary construction (with all the environmental impacts of five years of construction)? Is it all just because the bike coalition hates car drivers?! I don‚Äôt think the very marginal safety improvement I‚Äôll experience when biking down Market in five years Is worth this kind of mass frustration and waste.",sanfrancisco,Change my mind: car-free Market Street is a horrible idea

1120,mrhasselblad,1580189833,ev1a0w,Nan,"Pardon the rambling writing and poor grammar. I'm a shit writer.

I work on a tiny alley street in SOMA. Sadly it's not all that uncommon to find the occasional poo on the sidewalk, we've all seen it, some of us have unfortunately stepped in it. Fucking disgusting. Our studio space has one of those massive role-up metal doors which we like to leave open throughout the day, weather permitting. Helps with deliveries, dry times on wood finish/large glue-up furniture builds etc, it also allows us to passively and directing interact with and witness the neighborhood around us. For better or worse. 

There's a couple directly across the street from our studio, they've owned their live/work warehouse for years. Artist/writer/musician types, they can be found constantly arguing with each other up and down the block but for the most part keep to themselves. Directly adjoining their warehouse space is a relatively new condo. As of late the couple appears to be feuding with a neighbor, one of the condo neighbors in particular, one time in particular requiring a third neighbor to feel frightened enough to call the cops. Feuding neighbor is a lawyer, if I heard my boss correctly, who bought one of the condos a last year. Drives beautiful black Mercedes AMG wagon with a vanity plate (barf, it basically says ""Uniquely SF"" but a different phrase.) But I've always wanted one of those wagons. I'm trying to paint a picture of the parties involved here, hence the descriptors. He has absolutely no tolerance for people sleeping on the street on our block, understandable as he's probably stepped in human shit which would make me livid as well, his most prized possession of all appears to be his driveway. He and the warehouse couple have nearly come to blows over the front bumper of their car impeding his driveway. It's seriously a non-issue as his buildings driveway is around three-cars wide. You could blind-fold park a school bus in his driveway/garage but he's pissed nonetheless and that's his right.

This is where it gets weird. Last Friday, according to my boss, around midday he's upstairs at his desk which overlooks a large portion of our block via his office window that's almost always open. He notices a homeless man towing a cart of stuff down the sidewalk (notices I guess because he'd glanced at him pacing in the opposite direction a few minutes earlier) who then shuffles over toward warehouse-couple's parked car. He sort of half-climbs onto the hood, drops his pants and proceeds to shit a big ol' biker dump right onto their car hood. My boss rushed his way downstairs to hassle the guy and shoo him away and realized that to his total surprise......the ""homeless man"" was in fact the feuding lawyer neighbor who had apparently, by the looks of it, put together a ""costume"" then paced up and down the block a few times in a attempt to blend in? Only to shit on a car. Wow. That's all I've got. You never fail to impress, San Francisco!",sanfrancisco,Witnessed some next-level neighbor fuckery today. I must share.

They found severely corroded, rusted, old leaky pipes and said that we were lucky that we caught this when we did. They turned the gas off and it's been 12 days since we've been able to use our stove/oven. Hot water is working fine. All tenants received a note from our property management company that we would not be compensated for this because it was ""Act of God.""

A company called George Salet has been poking around the complex since last week and today, they informed me that starting next week, they would be opening up walls and would be replacing all the pipes. Because there are 25+ units in my building and they need to complete work in all of them before turning back on the gas, they said it could take 7-8 weeks. WHAT.

Since I just received this news today, I haven't heard from my PM yet, but I guarantee they will find a loophole not to compensate us. I'm trying to be proactive and want to see if anyone has any advice on what I can do. I pay $2000/month to rent a studio in SF. One of the main reasons I chose to rent this apartment was because it has a full kitchen. It sounds silly, but I do Weight Watchers and I've fallen off the wagon a bit because I'm not able to meal prep like I usually do. 

I know I can get a crockpot/Instapot/toaster oven, but that's not really the point here. Also, as mentioned, I pay $2000/month for rent...I shouldn't have to purchase these things. I also cannot afford these right now. Slow season at work and I'm already struggling.

I came into a tidy pile of money by recently cashing in on my gofuckyourself tech bro bullshit ain't telling you and after some spreadsheet fu, realized I can probably dick around around 70-100 grand on this project without even feeling it. It's either this or a kitchen remodel. 

(2) I see plenty of people sleeping in my neighborhood. Today I counted at least eleven. They're all exposed to the elements, in rotten sleeping bags cowering under entrances. I've gotten so used to seeing this that it didn't phase me until I bothered to count up each person. And then I realized even just one is inexcusable. 

(3) No, you can't fix society, you can't solve a crisis as complex as homelessness... but you can at least give as many people as you see a tent. 

Sure sure, I hear: Drugs. Poor life choices. They ship em in on buses! Mental illness. Blah Blah blah. Don't give a shit. Still a person. 

Funny thing is, I haven't been a practicing Catholic in over twenty years. But if I remember one parable that sticks out, it's Jesus giving out loaves and fishes.

No, I'm not Jesus. I'm just a tech douche. Absent of Jesus's second coming, its up to shitheads such as myself to attempt to make people suffering suffer just a little less.  

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is: 

  
(1) Buy a metric fuckton of really inexpensive pup tents on contract. 

(2) Rent a storage unit to keep them in. 

(3) Every time I see a homeless person sleeping, I'm leaving them a tent. 

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding is that given recent court rulings, cops can no longer do shit about people sleeping in tents.

  
Now I know what you think, NIMBYS. and I sympathize. Really, I do. But we can't continue to pretend its okay to just let people sleep in the rain. 

Or short of containing a shred of decency, we at a bare minimum can't continue to pretend you can do anything about an idiot like me deciding to piss my easy-earned money away on pup tents because I am sick of seeing so much human misery. 

Hence, if you suddenly start seeing a rash of cheap pup tents on the sidewalk, well, so it goes.",sanfrancisco,What if I just bought a bunch of tents from Alibaba and gave them to every homeless person I see sleeping?

I Hope it's OK to ask here. My brother is traveling to San Francisco from abroad and I asked him to buy an Ipad for me. He prefers not to order from amazon in case of delays.

1201,KrakenSteeze,1580338468,evuy4l,Nan,"I was in a skiing accident on Friday and have DVT in my right leg, a possibly torn ACL, and deep bruising in my ribs. It is hard for me to get around. 

I was on my block, crutching to my doctor‚Äôs appointment when a man/woman (it was hard to tell), asked me if I could help them. They didn‚Äôt seem completely ‚Äúthere‚Äù and approached me very close. They had a decently heavy build.

On my crutches, it was taking me a while to get around, so after ignoring them once I had to engage. This was the conversation, obviously not word for word:

Me:  I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt have the time

Them: I just have a question

Me: I‚Äôm sorry, but I am clearly injured and have somewhere to be. I cannot help you. 

Them: You piece of shit, it won‚Äôt take any time. Fuck you

(This is when I started picking up speed and crossed the crosswalk. They continued to shout at me in another language from across the street and began crossing)

Me: Just leave me alone

Them: (Now in my face, shouting) I can really injure you, motherfucker. I can push you over right now. Would you like that?

Me: I don‚Äôt want any trouble, I‚Äôm obviously injured, I‚Äôd just like to go. Please stop harassing me.

They proceeded to hock a loogie and spit on me. I turned around in disbelief, weighing the options of responding and injuring myself further, or engaging with this person. By that time, they had already started walking away and down the street. 

I called the police, let them know where they were and stayed on scene to give a report (making me late for my appointment). 

When they did arrive, they asked me what I wanted to do. I was surprised. I said, ‚ÄúWell they threatened to injure me and spit on me. That‚Äôs assault.‚Äù

They responded by saying ‚ÄúIf they have any warrants, we‚Äôll take them in. Otherwise, we‚Äôll just tell them to move along‚Äù

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So what - I have to engage in a fist fight for this type of assault to be considered serious. And even then, is it? Where is the fucking line? I feel violated; I‚Äôm already broken down from my injury, and now you say that someone spitting on me and threatening me when I‚Äôm defenseless essentially doesn‚Äôt matter?

Sure enough, I get out of my appointment and the assailant is still on the same crosswalk. I start speeding up, crossing the street, and having to avoid them out of fear of them assaulting me again. 

SFPD - what do you do exactly? I‚Äôve had it. This isn‚Äôt a healthy community or policing. I feel so fucking disgusted.

1207,Aww_Yeah_,1580345203,evwkyf,Nan,"Happened on Mission and Steuart st around 2:15pm. 

I was getting of work heading to the YMCA, when a African American male approached me asking for help. He was well mannered wearing white shoes, white jeans and a Lakers Kobe jersey. He said his sister and himself just drove down from LA. I'm always a yes person when someone asks for help, so I was like sure what can I do. He asked for my name, gave me his name(fake name probably) and told me that his sister(also African American female) was in an accident and they couldn't go home. Then said his sister couldn't cash in her check so they were stuck in SF unable to fix their car. He asked me if I can deposit the check for her. I then realized he was full of shit. I'm broke anyways so why not try to get him arrested. My bank is two blocks away so I was hoping he would followed me in there so the cameras would pick up his face.

 So we walked towards my bank, one block later on Market and Steuart his sister showed up and said she would go as well to make sure I deposit it. The man then said imma go watch the car and left me with his sister. I was like dang he got away. So I get to the bank with the woman and said she would wait outside to call her bank then go in behind me. I then immediately told the staff what this woman was trying to do and she booked it out of there never to be seen again. 

I walked for 30 minutes trying to find an officer downtown. Could not find a single one. I then called the cops non emergency number and dispatch told me officers will be there so I can make a police report. I waited an hour and a half and cops never showed up. So I left. Lesson I learned today is cops don't EVER do shit!

""Your driver is waiting. Leaving in 2 minutes"" I run around the block frantically looking but nothing. Then another message ""Your driver is at the corner of Grant &amp; Market"" so I go running over there. Nothing again. Then the driver leaves &amp; get charged.

So I try it again. Same exact thing. ""Be at the Lyft pickup location at Grant &amp; Market"" so I go running around frantically almost crying. ""Your driver is here. Leaving in 4 minutes"" so I run around begging people to show me the ""Lyft pickup location"" on corner of Grant &amp; Market but they have no idea. So that driver cancels &amp; I get charged again for cancelation. This has happened before in Union Sq. After requesting a driver and getting a confirmation they never show up &amp; then I get charged for it &amp; forget to call them asking for a refund as they know most people will. Luckily I found a regular old fashioned taxi and he got me to the meeting a few seoonds late and he was so nice. This city is so frustrating because many of the streets downtown are on way.

***Total*****: 55** **Chiefs-Niners at Super Bowl LIV -**¬† 

Written by¬†[*Lester Cullan*](https://www.redalertwagers.com/)¬†*on¬†January 21, 2020* *Vegas sports gambling analyst heard on ESPN Radio, Fox, CBS, Sirius, etc.*

Two of this year‚Äôs most impressive teams will meet on *Sunday, February 2* in **Miami Gardens** when the **San Francisco 49ers** face the Kansas City Chiefs at **Super Bowl LIV.**¬†Both teams looked strong during the **Conference Championships**, although the **San Francisco** ***(15-3 SU, 11-6-1 ATS)*** appeared to have a sharper edge, shutting out the **Green Bay Packers** in the first half before winning 37-20 as 7.5-point home favorites to claim the **NFC** title.

**The Chiefs** ***(14-4 SU, 12-5-1 ATS)*** made it back to their first **Super Bowl** in 50 years by beating the **Tennessee Titans** 35-24, also as 7.5-point home favorites. Kansas City's head coach *Andy Reid* finally gets another chance to put his name in the record books; at the end of the 2004 campaign, *Reid* led the **Philadelphia Eagles** to **Super Bowl XXXIX**, where they lost 24-21 to the **New England Patriots** in Jacksonville.  

**The 49ers** head coach *Kyle Shanahan* is also looking for redemption after coming up short against the **Patriots**. 

This is his first Big Game as a head coach, but he was the offensive coordinator for the **Atlanta Falcons** at ***Super Bowl LI*** in Houston, where the **Falcons** coughed up that big lead and lost 34-28 in overtime.

**SF 49er's:**

* 49ers are 5-0 ATS in their last 5 games as an underdog.
* 49ers are 6-1 ATS vs. a team with a winning record.
* 49ers are 5-1-1 ATS in their last 7 games after accumulating more than 350 total yards in their previous game.
* 49ers are 5-1-1 ATS in their last 7 games after allowing more than 350 total yards in their previous game.
* 49ers are 5-1 ATS in their last 6 games following a straight up win
* 49ers are 1-4 ATS in their last 5 meetings.

**KC Chiefs:**

* Chiefs are 5-0 ATS in their last 5 games after accumulating more than 250 yards passing in their previous game.
* Chiefs are 5-0 ATS in their last 5 games after accumulating more than 350 total yards in their previous game.
* Chiefs are 4-0 ATS in their last 4 games after scoring more than 30 points in their previous game.
* Chiefs are 6-0-1 ATS in their last 7 games following a straight up win.
* Chiefs are 6-0-1 ATS in their last 7 games as a favorite.
* Chiefs are 6-0-1 ATS in their last 7 games on grass.
* Chiefs are 5-0 ATS vs. a team with a winning record.
* Chiefs are 18-7-1 ATS in their last 26 games following a ATS win.
* Chiefs are 13-6 ATS in their last 19 games after allowing less than 90 yards rushing in their previous game

**Game Total** *- 55*

* Under is 4-1 in Chiefs last 5 games after accumulating more than 250 yards passing in their previous game
* Under is 4-1 in 49ers last 5 playoff games 

The betting public is leaning towards a KC win, making the Chiefs a slight favorite and there are not many believers on the San Francisco side of the line, kinda like the public was towards gays in the 90's

**Patrick Mahomes** and the ***Kansas City Chiefs*** might be a slight NFL betting favorite to win Super Bowl LIV, but ***Jimmy Garoppolo*** and the **San Francisco 49ers** are looking like a team that won‚Äôt go down quietly ‚Äì kinda like a gay man.

If you‚Äôre looking for reasons to back the ***Niners***¬†then you will be stretching for the few available reasons.The **Kansas City Chiefs** have **Travis Kelce** but the 49ers have a tight end in ***George Kittle*** that is touted as the BEST tight end in the game! *Kittle* has 85 catches for 1,053 yards with 5 TD grabs.¬†The problem is that Kittle has just 4 catches for 35 yards and absolutely no TD's in 2 games.

**KC** has a passing game that ranked them 5th in the **NFL** and they score points, also 5th in the NFL averaging *28.2* points a game, but they are horrible running the ball, the *Chiefs* rank 23rd in rushing and if **San Francisco** can shut down Pat's passing game they can force them to use that shitty run game!The **San Francisco 49ers** finished the regular season ranked 6th in takeaways, 25 of them in all, they picked off *Aaron Rodger*s 2 times in the **NFC Championship** which ended up being the difference in their biggest game of the season.

**Kansas City** not only has a crappy rush game they cant't stop the run, this could be a problem for the betting public, the **49ers** have the backs that have been under the radar this year, will this be the X-Factor? Will the rush game determine the winner of **Super Bowl 54**, running the ball controls the clock and the team that controls the clock wins.

I'm reaching out in an emergency to see if there is someone in the area that can legally marry two people in the State of California? My fiance and I have a marriage license dated for 02/02/2020 (a Sunday) and unfortunately the person that was deemed ""Deputy Commissioner for a day"" through San Francisco City Hall County Clerk office has a paper that's deemed him for the 3rd, rather than the 2nd. I'm led to believe that he won't legally be allowed to perform the marriage on the Sunday that our marriage license is dated for, since his powers are ""in effect"" for February 3rd.

We are hoping to find someone that would be legally able to marry us on February 2nd since we have tons of family that have flown in from overseas and around the country to be with us on the special day and the clerk's office is closed until Sunday.

THANK YOU &lt;3",sanfrancisco,EMERGENCY Deputy Commissioner

I usually don't pay much attention but $70+ for a 1-bedroom apartment with no heater seems pretty high.

I compared my Jan 2019 bill and Jan 2020 bill:

* PG&amp;E Tier 1 rate per kWh went from $0.20078 to $0.22981 (+14.46%)
* CleanPowerSF rate per kWh went from $0.06836 to $0.08393 (+22.78%)

When CleanPowerSF was introduced, they claimed their rates were sensibly identical and there was no point in opting out.

**Am I wrong or is this now more profitable to switch back to PG&amp;E?**

&gt;The measure, which lawmakers approved on Thursday and which is to take effect next month, is an attempt by Berlin‚Äôs leftist government to [slow the gentrification](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/world/europe/google-berlin-kreuzberg-campus.html) of a city that built a reputation on a [creative scene](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/arts/music/griessmuehle-berlin-club-closures.html) but is being squeezed by real estate investors and infrastructure projects.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWe have created an instrument that will stop the partially absurd price developments for the next five years,‚Äù Katrin Lompscher, Berlin‚Äôs senator for city development and living, said at a news conference on Friday. ‚ÄúIt is up to politicians to create the basic conditions for lower- and middle-class earners to be able to afford to live in Berlin.‚Äù

&gt;Renting is more common in Germany than homeownership, with more than half of the country‚Äôs residents renting their homes. In Berlin, a city of three million people, only 18 percent of residents own their homes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new law caps most rents in the city at 2019 levels and limits the amount that can be charged based on the apartment‚Äôs condition and amenities.

My best friend (J) is marrying a beautiful Californian girl (E) and the wedding is taking place in Grizzly Flats. We're all massively excited as you can imagine! J and E are a fantastic couple, I've known J for close to 14 years now and I've never seen him so besotted. I'm the best man (biggest honour of my life) and I've volunteered to source some instruments for the event; we're a close group of musical friends and J has spoken to me before about how great it would be to have a stage and a mix of instruments, gear etc so people can jump on and off throughout the day. I'm a bit in over my head with this, having never been to the states before and could do with some guidance on where to start. We've found a music shop that can rent us some stuff for a small fee but I'd like to see what else is available. I imagine that we'll need a generator too as the wedding is pretty rural. 

In the UK most cities have a Facebook networking page for local bands etc, but I haven't found one for SF. You'll be assisting me in making this the best day possible for my best friend and the love of his life so any suggestions are solid gold right now.

I have read several pros on cons on both sides but the portability and maneuverability aspect of the EUC had been a big thing for me, that is the reason I picked up the Pint in the first place for the portability.

This post is a bit late as I have already pre-ordered the InMotion V8-F. The trolly handle where it drives itself while you just balance it is pretty slick if you want to go into any local stores like I frequently do. However, still considering this I also don't want to feel unsafe like I do on the Pint so I guess I could still cancel my pre-order and pickup a scooter if need be, I saw a video on the Mercane 2020 WideWheel Pro that made me start to reconsider

I was really looking forward to signing up with Sonic, but apparently they resell AT&amp;T service in the building we're moving into, and they're required to rent out the modem, router, wifi unit. My question: does AT&amp;T have the same ridiculous policy? I can't get a straight answer from them. I have my own Ubiquiti setup (separate router plus wifi APs) and have no interest renting anyone else's gear, nor do I want to have to double-NAT behind some worse quality router.

Last night I was waiting to cross Potrero at 23rd. When the walk sign appeared I stepped into the street and immediately a bicyclist flew past me, missing me by inches. The bicyclist was going extremely fast, certainly faster than I've ever gone on a bicycle.

Something similar happened to me last month, except that time it was in broad daylight. I was crossing Portrero and had nearly reached the other side when a bicyclist zoomed past me at high speed, again missing me by inches. I had no hope of seeing him (and he I) since there were a lot of cars stopped at the light, blocking my view of the bike lane - and the bike lane's view of the crosswalk. It's only by sheer luck that I did not have my head smashed onto the concrete.

Please, for everyone's safety, do not disregard red lights like this. Remember that you still have responsibilities as a cyclist, and that your speed and mass might be less than that of a car but still enough to seriously injure or kill someone. Sir Isaac Newton is still a deadly SOB here on Earth!

Happy cycling, and stay safe!",sanfrancisco,Please do not run red lights on your bicycle!

I went in yesterday to make sure they knew about the problem and they told me a number of folk had already been in and it was being handled. 

Ok, sounds good. Except that later that day, ***SIX MORE CHARGES APPEARED.*** These charges are for amounts that I have spent there in the past (regular orders) and had accompanying secondary charges for tips. In total, Super Duper is holding about $200 of my money while they figure this out.

1672,bojackhoreman,1581112311,f0hktj,Nan,"I currently live in Dallas, and had gotten laid off last week from an engineering role in project management. I noticed San Francisco and the surrounding area had way more engineering opportunities than here in Dallas (approx. 5 times more.) I applied for a few positions over there as well as Dallas. I've had 2 recruiters talk to me this week from San Francisco and none from Dallas. I was making 83k a year in Dallas and paying $1850 a month in rent. The recruiters I talked to asked what my minimum salary requirement would be; which I stated would be 130k a year, and they said that's not a problem.  

&amp;#x200B;

For the Cons:   

1. Cost of living. Guesstimates: Additional rent 1-2k a month (currently paying $1850, expecting to pay $3500.) Gas for car additional 300 a month. Groceries seem about the same. Eating out seems about 20% higher (Dallas is $5-8 domestic beers, $15-30 plates, lattes $5-9). Utility cost additional $200. Sales take about the same (Dallas 8.25% vs 8.5% SF) Guessing additional required take home pay \~ $2300 monthly \[SF 130k take home would be \~$7900k, Dallas 83k is $5400 not including 401k contributions.\]
2. I should also mention I have a wife who does not work and a kid who is 1 years old. I noticed a lot of families are moving out of SF, so I'm not sure how suitable the city is for a family.
3. Also, all my family and friends are in Dallas (however we don't get help with family to watch our kid.) 

For the Pros: 

1. Career wise, I see more opportunity to grow in San Francisco. 
2. I also like the weather and proximity to national parks. 
3. My kid may get to appreciate the outdoors more.
4. If we stay, my kid would get in state tuition (I feel California universities might be better than Texas.)",sanfrancisco,Should I move to San Francisco?

My main intention for creating this app was to teach myself iOS development, which is why there isn't an Android version unfortunately. :( The app also only supports iOS 13+ because, long story short, I'm not smart enough to learn the tech that supports prior versions. 

In any case, hopefully some of you find this app useful! Data was pulled from [data.sfgov.org](https://data.sfgov.org/browse?q=popos), and I did my best to clean it up. If you notice anything weird though, please feel free to let me know.

Speaking of which, I noticed that the newer POPOS are pretty sparse on details when it comes to how to access, what they actually are, photos, etc. If anyone's had a chance to visit or would otherwise like to share some tips, I'll try to include them in the next update.

After years and year of having this vision for myself, it may possibly become reality and quite frankly, I‚Äôm getting anxious about it. 

I have the chance to potentially study/complete a 1 year residency in either the central coast (SLO) or the Bay Area, depending on which program I get into. I‚Äôm not so concerned about rent prices in SLO as they seem a bit more reasonable and the conditions of apartments/homes seem to be MUCH better. I am from New Jersey, so I am very used to seeing high rent and home values. However, NOT Bay Area high. I would say it‚Äôs comparable to NYC, but again, not exactly...

I found some apartments on Zillow in the Berkeley area for at least $2200+ for a studio or a 200 square-foot apartment and they don‚Äôt even come remotely close to being a decent apartment. They are outdated and quite obviously not in the cleanest conditions. I wouldn‚Äôt even want to pay $800 to live in them, let alone over $2000. I have friends living in NYC area who are paying that price for their own bedroom in a newly renovated complex. This is absolutely absurd. 

My genuine question is...HOW do college students in the area afford to live in off-campus housing when rent prices are off the wall insane? I cannot fathom having to take loans out to survive. Even in my undergrad years in NJ, I lived comfortably off-campus and never had to stress about money. Moving to California sounds less and less appealing to me at the moment.",sanfrancisco,Affording rent as a student

I just wanted to put this out there and **anyone** is welcome to join. My friends and I are all from the North Bay and we have been making the pilgrimage to games in San Jose for years now and have loved every minute of it. Recently, we have been a little frustrated by the lack of attendance and support for the Earthquakes as, believe it or not, the quality of play is actually very good and we wanted to improve the Quake's support. We know that passion for soccer is abundant in the bay and we want to spread it to MLS and make the Earthquakes something to be envied in the soccer world!

Our current agreement with the Quakes front office is to stand with the groups Epicentro 74 and the Faultline on the bar terrace, starting opening day,

So, I wanted to hear your thoughts on living in the Hayes Valley area. I'm a female in my 20's, would it be safe to walk around at night? Is there a lot to do in the area or does it feel dead? Is it bike-friendly? Younger or older demographic?

1910,Marutar,1581535226,f2wfsc,Nan," I've  just taken a look at my Democratic Vote-by-Mail Ballot, and it appears to violate CA law and show preference to certain candidates.

Having  your name first on a ballot is known to increase votes for that  candidate, as those who don't know anyone will just fill out the first  bubble. To combat this, CA draws random letters before an election  cycle, and uses those as 'randomized alphabetical order.'

According to the [Randomized Alphabet Drawing for March 3, 2020 Presidential Primary Election](https://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/news-releases-and-advisories/2019-news-releases-and-advisories/secretary-state-alex-padilla-announces-results-randomized-alphabet-drawing-march-3-2020-presidential-primary-election/), the order of names on this ballot is in violation of Elections Code section 13112.¬†

The order should be:

1. A
2. Z
3. R
4. C
5. H
6. E
7. W
8. L
9. F
10. N
11. Y
12. X
13. O
14. D
15. K
16. S
17. M
18. J
19. P
20. Q
21. V
22. U
23. B
24. G
25. I
26. T

However,  my ballot begins with Pete Buttigieg, and then moves on to Joseph R.  Biden. Which is not even alphabetical order for ""B"", in addition, there  are other B names which are listed separately from those two. According  to the letters drawn in the above link and released by the CA Secretary  of State, the letter B be should be ranked as the 23rd position in  'randomized alphabetical order.'

Have I misinterpreted this law? Or is this ballot in direct violation of CA election law, and designed to show preference to certain candidates?",sanfrancisco,Democratic Primary Vote-by-Mail ballots appear to violate CA law by showing preferential name ordering

6) Some of Presidio is whited out--I'm guessing because it was still a base?  Same with some of the areas around the VA.
7) Crissy Field is actually an airfield.

https://preview.redd.it/0xpx12pbirg41.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13a464a0a58db16b4af3b0c984ffb165effc6193

There were no carts or baskets available at all to shop with.

Then I went to the Walgreens on 9th and Market, and the usual security guard was not present, and no baskets or carts either except for 2-3 behind the counter you could ask for.  They were also understocked but nothing so severe as above.  

I asked the woman at the counter about it.  She said the company has cut security guards because the robberies were so commonplace at these locations and they were losing so much money even with security guards, and that the employees all feel both of these Walgreens will be closed soon.  They aren't allowed to put out baskets or carts anymore because there was so much theft of those carts/baskets.  Also she said they're not really getting any more stock sent to them at this point.

She said the shoplifting had been rampant in both locations over the last few weeks, and after Walgreens cut the security guard program, it got even worse.  She said people were even coming in and smashing the security lock containers, she said somebody ran out with their entire perfume selection.  

She said the staff at both stores is super depressed and they all think they are losing their jobs soon. 

FWIW I witnessed a man shoplifting flagrantly while I was there.

I don't know if this is the case at other Walgreens, or just the Mid-Market ones.  But looks like Walgreens is actively pulling out of at least some SF neighborhoods giving recent closings and the fact that they've given up entirely on these two.",sanfrancisco,More Walgreens closings on the way?

2007,coloredsoft,1581642339,f3kb66,Nan,"Reddit: Do you remember the California wildfires?

When the wildfires came to California, I was a suicidal barista in San Francisco‚Äôs Financial district. My girlfriend had just broken up with me. I still remember the tragic, melodramatic scene when I last saw her.

High  on marijuana and vibrating from rage and sadness, I speed walked to her car parked outside my house. Before then, as I laid in bed with tears streaming down my temples, I wondered how this could be happening to us. She still loved me, she explained--she just wasn‚Äôt ready. 

I don‚Äôt remember the conversation very well. I kept trying to crack jokes; she wouldn‚Äôt laugh. I sobbed; she was silent. I asked where she was going, she said it was her mom‚Äôs birthday. ‚ÄúBe safe,‚Äù I said gravely after exiting the car and shutting it closed. She sat still and in shock at the steering wheel, staring into the abyss that is East Oakland. 

I had gotten the breakup text shortly after one of my first shifts at the cafe. I said a serene goodbye to my coworkers and cried on the way to Embarcadero. I am going to die, I thought. I am literally going to die. 

I smoked when I got home and sat there in a daze. I fell asleep in my clothes and woke up and got high again. 

My coworkers and I got rashes. I remember us huddling around and comparing our scars. The air quality in the city was the worst in the world, and our cafe doors were built so that they were perpetually open. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. 

I was a flake, as any chronically suicidal person might be when it came to work. I was worried about my ex. I was worried about the Earth, and where I might go when capitalism finally fell. I was worried about my life. Not a career, not my family. I mean my literal heart. Would I really die by my own hand?

One day, I not only couldn‚Äôt breathe, but started to see dots in my vision. The cafe wasn‚Äôt busy because the air quality was the worst in the world, so no one wanted to be outside. I looked at my coworkers, ignoring their health concerns, ignoring each other, ignoring the sky. I didn‚Äôt think of my place in the world as a place among other people. I imagined it as me against them, or me vs. the reality of human life--in short, I didn‚Äôt care about them as much as I should have. I said I wanted to leave. I had been leaving early, calling off sick, a lot, and the shift lead froze up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay longer,‚Äù the sweet 19 year old gay boy who always cracked jokes said calmly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay.‚Äù 

And I left them, in my dust, in a daze, selfishly wrapped in my own head. The Financial District was swarmed with people covered with masks, and I did not have one. I cried in Embarcadero station to my mom on the phone because I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I remembered someone had told me that coffee helped them and I went to the cafe in the bart station and they got my order wrong. And I cried there too. Lol. 

I posted on SF‚Äôs Reddit about how I was suicidal, a barista, how my girlfriend had broken up with me. How I hated working and hated living and couldn‚Äôt breathe. Someone messaged me and said they‚Äôd worked at the same cafe. Someone who worked in the Financial District offered to bring masks to my coworkers the next day. 

I didn‚Äôt go to work the next day, but when I did go, everyone was silent and not speaking to me. My hours had been cut with no explanation. There were so sign of the masks‚Ä¶ 

I broke down in the bathroom, hating myself and my misery, and fled the city without telling anyone. I thought of jumping the train tracks. I landed in the psych ward instead. It‚Äôs been a year since then, and I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve learned how to persist. I like to think I‚Äôve learned how to support others like they support me, even when we all can‚Äôt breathe. 

So, I ask you, Reddit. Did you see that post I made? Do you remember the California wildfires?",sanfrancisco,Do you remember the California wildfires?

2313,Throwaway187768,1582165855,f6m1f4,Nan,"Here are some examples of why this ‚Äúpolice‚Äù force are incompetent and quite frankly, probably extremely corrupt, and NOT after the general public‚Äôs best interests and safety:

I‚Äôve seen three bums light up crack on the train or bus within the past few days, one of them is a regular of the 38, and has clearly never had her bad behavior corrected in the past two years I‚Äôve seen her crusty Gollum-ass on the 38 many times since. 

Another reason is, I was sexually assaulted by a gay dude in 2018, woke up with his hand in my pants on my dick at a party, immediately got up (no pun intended) and left. Then when I called the cops the next day, they basically just said it all sounded consensual and essentially hung up on me. I took the L on that one. Ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm going up against a gay dude in SF in court or wherever, I‚Äôd lose in a New York fucking minute. Plus, I had just left my job that weekend, so I figured they‚Äôd think I was just seeking money. 

My last example is when a friend of a roommate had a meltdown on shrooms last year at my house in the Richmond District. It was such a chaotic scene, the landlord and cops all got called and showed up, kicked his dumb ass out. I manage to sleep for a little bit (I was not on shrooms) and I wake up the next morning to him inside the house looking for his weed pen of all things. The dude just showed up and was in my house without any consent after the scene he caused. Our mutual friend, my then-roommate wasn‚Äôt even there, so he had NO PERMISSION.  I shove him out of the house, tell him he‚Äôs lucky I don‚Äôt have a gun, He even went as far as, his dumb fucking ass, to come back a THIRD time later on and with a cop with him to ‚Äúretrieve his property‚Äù. I refuse to let him or the cop inside, and I explained everything to the cop and she was asking me to let him in to get his weed pen. In total disbelief that this dizzy cunt cop could care less about some dude rummaging through houses after being removed the previous night by other cops and the landlord is beyond me. I told them both to get fucked and slammed the door. 

Anyhow, the cops never gave two shits about me being sexually assaulted, me having my house essentially broken into and they sure as shit don‚Äôt give a fuck about the crackheads.

Fuck SFPD, I truly hope you pathetic fucking losers all form a giant circle in Golden Gate Park and just start shooting at each other because that‚Äôd be the biggest accomplishment you cunts would have achieved since finding the Zodiac...oh, wait. 

Feel free to try and roast me, I wouldn‚Äôt post this if I was at all vulnerable to being further pissed off by any SFPD sympathizers. As you were, cheesedicks.",sanfrancisco,SFPD are the most useless losers I‚Äôve ever witnessed in my entire life.

2413,phurealz,1582352789,f7osd8,Nan,"I'm writing to express my comments about the housing affordability issue that is plaguing California. I'm not poor nor am I rich, I'm strictly a middle-class individual that has a job that pays well enough that I should be able to afford a house in and around the city I currently live in, Los Angeles. LA is now the most unaffordable city in the nation, even more than another California city, San Francisco. This is an issue many years in the making and has more visibly manifested itself with the increasing number of homeless throughout the state. These unfortunate souls are continually increasing because their leaders have failed them. These so-called leaders have failed to make the bold decisions when needed, failed to foresee a housing crisis of their own making, and now fail their constituents like never before.
The Governor's State of the State speech gave a voice to the homeless issue like never before. Declaring it to the most urgent issue that voters most complain about. However, building a bunch of homeless shelters will not solve the problem because that's not the root cause for a majority of the homeless in this state. It's simply a lack of affordable housing. Rents reaching $1,200+ for even modest studio apartments through much of the LA while the wage barely inches up is the issue. These increasing rents are driven by a lack of new housing. Rent controls will not work, they'll modestly help. If the vacancy rate shot up because of a supply of new housing, these rents would moderate or even decrease, so I'll just say this. ""Build. Build. Build. Build. Build. Build. And then build some more."" to anyone willing to listen. Anyone complaining of gentrification. To anyone complaining about apartment builds going up in their single-family residential neighborhoods. The population increase far outpaces the increase in housing. When the population increases by 30,000 a year but the number of new units only increases by 7,000 in the same year and this happens for a decade, home affordability will inevitably become a problem. Cities are more than happy to approve new office buildings but shirk their responsibility to building housing for all those people that will work in these newly approved office buildings. This feckless leadership has my blood curdling as I never expected it to.
Maybe this is just a part of a conspiracy to have Californians migrate to other states, turning them purple and then blue. If so, great plan. When it comes to voting, I've voted mostly democrat my entire life, yet I was moderate in my views when it came to fiscal matters. While I will vote for the Democratic nominee, no matter who it is. But I'll not do so anymore when it comes to my local representatives. They simply don't deserve it anymore.",sanfrancisco,Open Letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom

1. Wake up, grab breakfast, then uber to North Tower Golden Gate Parking (from hotel in Union Square)
2. Hike the half mile up to Battery Spencer
3. Hike back down to North Tower Golden Gate Parking to grab an uber back south to Presidio to continue with rest of day.

1. Is it hard to request an uber at North Tower Golden Gate Parking?  I'm sure getting there won't be a problem considering I'm starting in Union Square, but I'd hate to get stranded up north and have to walk back across the bridge...
2. I also heard cell signal is spotty in this area, but I assume this meant up at Battery Spencer.  I'm Hoping hiking back down to the parking area will solve this.

Some of the experiences I have prepared so far is 

puppy playdate: get to play with puppies for an hour with your significant other.

Stow lake boat ride: everything from reservation to snacks to rentals are handled

Paint and sip at the park: canvases, paint brushes, and easels and location all planned out

Picnic at Dolores park or Chrissy field: two popular picnic areas, I prepare everything from a fancy basket to flowers food and blanket.

These experiences are each $50 for everything but totally willing to refund anyone who doesn‚Äôt have an awesome time

""damn.. It's her! I found her... She's THE ONE!""

Unfortunately one of my friends called me and when I looked back she was lost in the crowd (very busy night at the Bamboo Hut) and soon after we had to leave :/

Anyway if you know somebody that seems to match the description, please... Oh please... Tell her to write me at

lookong4ublondelady@gmail.com

Or contact me here... I just want to be able to talk with her once.

Thanks, any help or hints in this mission impossible will be appreciated!",sanfrancisco,"Help me get in contact with ""her"" - searching for lady met at the Bamboo Hut on 28th night"

SF 
A - yes.  City college bond, $110 a year on a $1m property, really needed, good for everybody

B - no.  Public safety bond that is so broad and vague it seems like a slush fund, 3rd of these bonds but it seems we‚Äôve been paying for some of this stuff in different bonds for years - including the massive puc bonds and it‚Äôs unclear if we need all this stuff, for example SF has way more firehouses than we need (per a grand jury report and common sense) but we keep rebuilding them anyhow b/c we pass all these bonds and everyone loves firemen; I‚Äôd like to know the overall plan here and do an audit of what‚Äôs really smart and needed before giving more money to fund projects of uncertain need and value

C - yes. Fair is fair.  Couple dozen former state workers now city workers should get full benefits -paid for by us, yes sometimes we need to pony up to do the right thing folks- as the city took over what the state used to do when jerry brown dismantled the redevelopment agency.  Not much money; stupid we even have to vote on it.

D - no.  Another good intention bad mechanism measure by Peskin.  Tax on vacant store fronts to encourage owners to rent properties out for less vs keep empty waiting for someone to pay more; this could result in some retail properties landing businesses that otherwise couldn‚Äôt afford the location, maybe, for a little while, hopefully??...nice idea but economics don‚Äôt play like that; the real result will be increased commercial property prices as the market absorbs the additional carrying cost of the potential risk of having to pay the fee - the cost is minor but constant so can add up and the message to future owners is: risk lives here; the other longer term outcome is consolidation of commercial property under large companies as they are the ones that can float the risk and pay the premium (and ultimately lobby to get the rules changed again); oh and retail???? Let‚Äôs save the horse and buggy shops while we‚Äôre at it, blacksmiths unite!!; part of the issue is that city zoning championed by Peskin and others requires ground floor retail in apt buildings to encourage real urban neighborhoods vs urban suburbs (made good sense at the time) so they were kinda all-in with how the city should build up and fill in when the Amazon apocalypse boiled over and these properties became harder to rent as the neighborhoods around them became more affluent but the residents spending elsewhere on almost everything and the commercial landlords wanting their piece like every past cycle so being greedy waiting for a pay day that may never come because the games changed and they dont seem to know how to respond except to batten down the hatches and now we have this crappy piece of legislation with god knows what unintended consequences down the road...nice work guys, SF‚Äôs dysfunctional politics example A.

E - no.  Oh jeez, another stinker. The SF nonprofit housing politburo at its very worst.  Stupid beyond belief; ties office development to housing development to bludgeon and extort more money for the projects they build, run, get paid by, and use as a political platform to promote candidates and policies that created and perpetuate SF‚Äôs housing crisis; don‚Äôt give them any more control over city planning and development; this one is bad news all around cooked up by the worst actors at the teat",sanfrancisco,Becky Bayside‚Äôs election picks

2950,cutsandcodes,1583309246,fd9w8s,Nan,"I'm going to try to keep this short but will gladly elaborate where needed. Over a year ago we had a break-in on the property where all of the mail boxes were destroyed and all the mail was taken. I talked to the landlord who said ""that sucks"" replaced the mailboxes, and things went quiet for a while (or at least I didn't notice).
Roll forward about 9 months or so and one evening I found a homeless encampment on my roof deck, constructed out of my furniture. I alerted the police - who promptly took over four hours to arrive - and the property manager, who decided they'd adjust the door threshold several days later. Suggesting ""there's nothing we can do"" to further fix the door, closer, or strike. After several appeasement messages, I decided not to waste my time further.
About two months later, another surprise! I go down to throw out the trash and lo and behold I'm greeted by two new homeless people setting up camp in the lobby of all places. They're surprised, I'm surprised, and they start getting in my face because I'm intruding in their home. Another call to the police (maybe 30min response this time!), to the property manager's ""emergency voicemail"" (LOL), and an angry email to everyone at the property management office later they end up reprogramming and rekeying the front door.
Now let's get to last weekend and another break-in, two guys spend the morning shitting, smoking crack, and having sex all over the building's stairways from 9 to noon. Luckily I wasn't around for that nasty surprise.

With all that in mind now...

What is it going to take to get the property manager motivated to actually fix the door so it's reasonably secure? Right now other tenants leave, the doors get stuck ajar, and anyone can walk right in. The property manager is aware of this, but ""there's nothing we can do"". I don't feel like patrolling my building - that's not what I'm paying $4500/mo for. I was told they can't lock the rooftop doors (which allow people throughout the building) because of fire code (BS btw, I had a talk with the fire inspector).

As a tenant, what are my rights here? If something happens to me or another tenant I'm sure the property owner is responsible, but I'd like to think we won't get there. Some of my property has been damaged in the process which I was able to claim on my insurance. All I really care about is keeping people from smoking crack outside my front door.

As someone who tends to just solve problems themselves, I'm borderline considering hiring a contractor myself to fix this.

If you like pictures, enjoy...

However, the social justice dems, the Berniecrats, DSA are not like European center left parties and doesn‚Äôt understand governance at all. In fact, they show open disdain for governance. When I lived in Netherlands 18 years back, they had liberal drug policies, but they balanced it out with strict quality of life enforcement, with no open drug dealing or gross street behavior. When I lived in Scandinavia, they had solid safety nets, housing protection, universal healthcare, free college. But their economy was strong, crime was zero, streets were clean, trains were brand new, everything ran on time.

Social justice democrats are slowly taking over city government in the SF, and they are largely a bunch of clueless hipsters without any idea on how to govern. As evidenced by the Democratic primary today, overwhelming majority of Dems don‚Äôt support them. But they are stealing a playbook from the Federalist society. They are focusing on less covered down ballet elections, like Props, DA, Public Defender, and judges (see Michelle Tong‚Äôs victory). 

Their dominance in BoS and in the justice system has left the mayor essentially powerless. A mayor is held accountable for the state of the City, but you can‚Äôt do anything if DAs and judges release drug dealers with 90 felony records. 

Here‚Äôs my prediction for the future of SF
- 1) Drug dealing continues with impunity, with some lip service arrests 
2) Large tent encampments make a come back
3) Property crime continues to spiral out of control 
4) More and more taxes are passed on businesses 
5) Idiotic legislation like Prop E continued to be written and passed
6) Economy and job growth in SF is stalled
7) Housing growth is stalled
8) More new useless laws like cafeteria ban are passed 
9) Companies leave SF and probably Bay Area altogether

Almost all of my friends, and a lot of people in town on the low middle income spectrum are paycheck to paycheck service industry.... It's looking more and more like when, not if (no testing in place, exponential growth curve despite us even having good info) we are all going to be hunkered down at least for a while. 

My question is this: how are we going to handle it? If no one can work, and must be in homes to avoid disease, and no one can pay rent...... you can see where im going w/this? There is going to have to be a moratorium on rent or something or you could have a situation with thousands of people getting pushed into the streets, further overwhelming medical services.",sanfrancisco,COVID-19 and SF

And a gallon of water per day for 2 weeks and 2 people takes forever because I didn't want to carry more than 2 gallons (stupid specific weight.)

Asking since I have a booked city trip to San Francisco by the end of the month. I have already booked the hotel, the restaurants, etc, long before. I am not too afraid to travel myself (given proper precautions) but am scared that public life will shut down in SF soon and especially the tourist spots.

Is this likely to happen?",sanfrancisco,"For tourism: will travel, transit, musea, restaurants, markets, places shut down and remain shut down by the end of the month or start of April in San Francisco?"

I made the rookie mistake of not checking the street cleaning signs, and unfortunetly street cleaning was scheduled from 8-10am today. Did not think to check the sign because there were about 10 other cars parked there. 

Saw a meter maid sitting across the street, just lurking (as they often do). We made eye contact and I smiled, then continued on my way.

Returned to my car at 9am on the dot. Parking ticket in my door. $79 fee for parking during street cleaning hours AND for ""dirt covered can't read VIN"" 

My VIN is fully visible. The ticket is time stamped at 8:56am, 2 minutes after I left my car. Not a single other car parked on the same side of the street as me had a ticket and the meter maid was nowhere to be seen.

I am aware this is 100% my fault for not checking the street signs, but wow what a way to start a Friday!Gotta love the city",sanfrancisco,A great way to start my friday! Thanks so much SFMTA :)

I will be moving out with my girlfriend and dog so that will play a role on where we end up.

I will be working in Tiburon, but my girlfriend would love to be in the city where she can walk to anything she needs. That being said, we want it to be a safer neighborhood with a lower homeless population. When I was ubering through the city there were several nice areas but then I would see a few homeless people smoking crack on the sidewalk.  I want a place where my girlfriend will feel safe walking the dog late if she needs to.

Want to be near bars, coffee shops, fun shops, etc...really in the life of the city.

Budget will be up to $4000.

I‚Äôve had a bad day. Week. Year. I was real excited to go to the Tame Impala show as I‚Äôve been a fan for years and years. Even saw them at the Independent back in the day and now they‚Äôre selling out chase center. 
I‚Äôve got a bad cold going on 6 days now and I‚Äôve travelled recently (domestically) but I dont want to take any chances. Went over to kaiser to be tested and was told there are less than 1000 test kits available FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. If you‚Äôre showing symptoms, they won‚Äôt test you unless you‚Äôve been out of the country. Period. On my way home, a car flipped me off for walking too slow as I bought a huge thing of water to self quarantine myself the next few days. Even though I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs THE virus- i know it‚Äôs the right thing to do. 
Which brings me to the other part. I have two tickets to the sold out Tame Impala show Friday. Section 216. $100 something dollars a piece. But in lieu of how crappy life‚Äôs been for me lately I‚Äôd like to do something kind instead. If you‚Äôre interested, or know someone who may be, please just share one kind thing you‚Äôve done or will do for someone else. I‚Äôll pick a winner by tomorrow and the only catch is you‚Äôll have to be in SF to pick up the hard copy  üé´. Mods- please don‚Äôt deny this and just let me know if i can change anything. Just trying to do something nice since I can‚Äôt use them.",sanfrancisco,To the most deserving Tame Impala fan

3499,hanzo87,1583948308,fh10d9,Nan,"Background: I rent a drafty old Victorian in SF from a landlord who has ignored numerous requests over the years to install central heating. Our lease also forbids the use of indoor space heaters. I strongly suspected the apartment didn't meet the [minimum habitability standards of 68 degrees F](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/must-landlord-provide-heat-california-92796.html), so I used a Raspberry Pi to monitor the indoor temperature for the past two months. Sure enough, the apartment almost never gets up to 68 degrees, and it frequently drops into the mid 50's or lower. I plotted this data against temperature readings from the nearest weather station in SF using the Synoptic's [Mesonet API](https://developers.synopticdata.com/mesonet/), and learned that the apartment generally only stays on average 7 degrees warmer than the outside temperature. In other words, pretty darn chilly in the winter! 

Here's the plot with the full data, though it's kind of hard to read: [https://imgur.com/a/5qe6q1y](https://imgur.com/a/5qe6q1y)

I'm looking to file a tenant petition for a decrease in housing services, does anyone have experience with this?

It's been a hectic 24 hours, but after much back and forth, having the doctor go on the phone for hours to get approved for a kit and seeing the process first hand, it's...not good and shocking to see...

As of now, first, you have to go to a facility like UCSF even to get approved, and unless you're ""not able to walk or are about to die"" (their words), then they'll send you home. Their incompetence during this whole mess is too much to go into, but if you're high risk for spreading the virus in mass (like an educator), then you'll be referred to the Department of Public Health and CDC, where they'll call you the next day for next steps to go to one of their ""undisclosed facilities."" 

Staff and medical professionals told me that tests are super limited, literally *30 a day* with very specific conditions to give a test, with a turn around time of ""24-72 hours"" since the process to do the test ""isn't automated yet."" (it's almost an immediate turnaround in most other countries). 

So yea...I'm not one to panic and be worried about such things...but seeing how ill equipment UCSF (I can't even imagine what the other hospitals are going through), the CDC and the Department of Health are dealing with this...don't be surprised if things get a *lot worse* with much more cases popping up...

When I read about how the U.S. has responded to COVID-19, it's honestly shocking to me. Taiwan and Hong Kong closed schools when there were only a few cases. 80% of the public started wearing masks. Large events canceled. Temperatures were checked before people boarded public transportation. 

By and large, the virus has been contained in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, etc despite their close proximity to China. 

I was thinking surely the U.S. government was preparing hardcore for the coronavirus. They had more time than Asian countries to prepare. They were probably mass-producing tests, masks, preparing hospitals and quarantine housing. They must have been learning from the techniques used by Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.

Nope. Nada. Nothing. Reading about the situation in the U.S., you'd think that the U.S. has literally done nothing to prepare except to pray. It's infuriating to me because all my family and friends are in the Bay Area.

A friend just now 
From my friend:
Below is from my brother who works for the Dept of Defense at the pentagon. He has the highest security clearance possible. 
Family,
The Coronavirus is much worse than is being exposed by traditional media and things will get much, much worse in the coming weeks and months. Please, stay away from crowded places as much as possible. Wash your hands often. Don't touch your face and don't pick your nose. The virus lives in the nasal passage longer than anywhere else. If you are forced to be in a highly populated environment, line inside of nose and corners of mouth with triple antibiotic ointment. Consider preparing your own food rather than eating out. Wash store bought fruits and vegetables prior to consumption. The virus has a 6-8foot airborne reach. 
State department employees have been told that preliminary tests show that people who drink warm beverages throughout the day have lower infectious rate after exposure and those don't. Drinking lots of water is also being advised. They are recommending high dosage of vitamin D as well. If you feel ill demand to be tested and seek treatment quickly. Smokers are dying of this at much greater rates. Please make sure to keep canned and non perishable foods such as pastas, beans, dried fruits and vegetables on hand as well as bottled water. 
It is very important to keep an emergency supply of cash on hand. I personally have 5k in a safe. Here in Washington we are preparing for economic unrest that we have never seen before. Markets will not know how to respond and it will create social unrest. Additionally the healthcare care system is not prepared for the amount of ill people and with the closure of borders and ban on import we will have shortages of vital medical supplies and medications as well as hospital beds and medical staff.
If you are required to take medication, please ask your healthcare provider for additional quantities as it will likely become difficult to get.
Currently 10% of the worlds population is in quarantine. New predictions indicate that 50% of the population will become
Infected over the next few months. 
Not to panic you all but please don't take this lightly and be prepared.",sanfrancisco,"Friend of a friend ""works at Pentagon,"" is any of this verified?"

I work remote and spend most of my days alone. I do not come in contact with anyone over the age of 50 or anyone with health issues. In a typical week I really only exchanged a few words with the checkout clerk at the grocery store or someone at a fast-food window.

I have always wanted to visit San Francisco. Living on the East Coast I have typically seen tickets for $400 and up. I was able to get a roundtrip ticket from Miami next Wednesday for just $100. With very nice hotel rooms available to me for under $100.

I still want to come. Although there is talk about a ban on domestic air travel. I had no interest in seeing any shows or doing any tours. When I go on vacation I typically just walk around the urban core and Parks looking at things I've seen in movies. Eating some local food and coming home. Not your typical vacation. Probably pretty boring and sad by most standards.

That being said it's been more than 3 years since my last vacation. And that was only 2 hours away. I do not travel very much. And in fact I do not even get out very much. And I do not think I would be able to afford this trip if not for the current crisis.

Not sure where to post this so if it's in the wrong subreddit just let me know.

So I will be living in San Francisco next summer for my internship and I have just started looking for a place to live it. I thought I would post here and ask some advice on which neighbourhoods are the best for me to live in before I start looking for a place.

So I currently live in Downtown Montreal and we have this student-town, work hard play hard vibe here. Multiple nightclubs, bars, restaurants all downtown and within 20 mins walk of each other. Demographic is mostly people that are 18-25 years of age. I also like to play outdoor sports like Basketball, Soccer so a park near me would be perfect. That's the kind of neighbourhood I'm looking for, do you guys have any suggestions?

Also my office location will be around let's say: Academy of Art University - School of Motion Pictures (I'd rather not say where I will be working).

Last night while walking my dog I passed by a packed bar (granted, one with capacity under 100).  I'm disappointed in the people ignoring the COVID threat and government guidance to socially distance.  I've also seen social media posts about ""braving it"" against Corona and going out to a club.  It's not brave, it's selfish.


Please, don‚Äôt be selfish.  We‚Äôve seen what this can do in other developed countries.  Let‚Äôs learn from them.


Common rebuttals time:
1)But I‚Äôm not in the high risk group.
-Don‚Äôt be selfish.  You have a parent, grandparent or friend that is.  Given one person can infect many other, even if you distance from seniors you have risk of infecting those who are in contact.
-The ‚Äúmild‚Äù symptoms bucket is the Chinese govt classification meaning it doesn‚Äôt require hospitalization. It can still be very unpleasant and lasts weeks - more than most flus based on initial data.


2) SF has relatively few cases.  I‚Äôll play it safe when it gets bad.
-Local cases are likely understated.  Testing kits are hard to come by.
-Infection can take 5 or more days to show symptoms, and people infect on average 2-5ish people, so it can spread fast without folks knowing.  Some, like one case in Korea, can infect hundreds due to community environments.
-It‚Äôs a hell of a lot easier to put out a small kitchen fire with a fire extinguisher when the fire is small, impossible when it envelops the whole kitchen.  Distancing now can have huge impact.


3) Whatever, we‚Äôre all going to get it anyway.
-Even if true, slowing it in early stages buys time for emergency supplies and plans to be out in place
-Suppressing/slowing spread helps keep hospital resources within limits.  If it gets too bad, doctors may have to make difficult decisions about who gets the ventilator and who dies.  Spreading out the need prevents situations we‚Äôve seen in other countries with churches etc turned into makeshift hospitals.


4) If it were really bad the government would do more.
-We pride ourselves on our personal freedoms in the US, and that‚Äôs great.  But it also means we have to be personally responsible for the collective.  This isn‚Äôt China - we won‚Äôt be chaining apartment building doors shut to force quarantine, even if it could arguably be beneficial for public health.  That‚Äôs a good thing, but it also means we need to demonstrate personal responsibility.
-Don't be overly reliant on government guidance.  This week the government was crowd sourcing advice on Facebook, and has downplayed the risk due to optics.


5) I want to support local and small businesses and their staff
-Order takeaway or delivery
-Purchase gift cards
-If you must, visit restaurants where tables are farther apart, and sanitize surfaces/wash your hands 
-Write your congressman pushing for information on how they‚Äôre helping small businesses through these difficult times.
-Donate to local food banks.  Heck, several folks fortunate to have work from home jobs have started $100 'no questions asked' venmo giveaways to acquaintances that request it.


6) It‚Äôll go away naturally in April when it starts warming up
-I hope so, and early data indicates warmer temperatures break down virus faster
-Unfortunately it‚Äôs March, and this thing spreads fast.  We are seeing the virus in warmer climates, so even if warmer temperatures helped they likely won‚Äôt be a silver bullet.

I‚Äôm not saying lock yourselves in.  I am saying avoid close and/or large gatherings.  Stay away from communal spaces to the extent possible.  Wash your hands regularly.  Get caught up on Netflix.  There's no need to panic and buy cases of TP, but there is a need to be responsible.",sanfrancisco,"Going out isn't brave, it's selfish"

3763,StretchFrenchTerry,1584292551,fj4pho,Nan,"The coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, are spreading across the United States faster than we can track or test. This week the confirmed caseload jumped from 309 to at least 2,170 cases in 49 states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. A testing shortage has experts fearing the true number is likely thousands of cases higher.

Public life in America has methodically ground to a halt. This week companies instituted mandatory work from home policies, hundreds of schools and colleges closed or switched to online classes, professional sports suspended play indefinitely ‚Äî even Disney shut down its parks worldwide.

And yet, many younger Americans seem unfazed by the pandemic. Though they may be working from home or practicing social distancing during the day, it appears American night life is continuing without much interruption.

In Seattle, where one hospital is reportedly preparing for Northern Italy levels of infection and already running low on some supplies, bars in the Capitol Hill neighborhood have been full of people. On Friday evening, a Twitter search for the phrase ‚Äúthe bars are packed‚Äù yielded hundreds of tweets from cities like Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Los Angeles and New York City. On Saturday in Chicago, one reporter tweeted a photo of a line around the block for a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day bar crawl at 8 a.m.

While the federal government has issued some guidance for older and high-risk Americans, the administration has offered little definitive advice for how stringently low-risk people should isolate. And so it seems that for many it‚Äôs business as usual.

Continuing the weekend tradition of packing the bars is selfish and reckless during this pandemic. It will speed up the spread of the virus, increasing the suffering for older and more vulnerable people and for the medical workers who will be caring for them. Though the virus appears dramatically less fatal for those under 50, younger, healthier people can still contract the virus, not show symptoms and infect at-risk populations.

‚ÄúModeling suggests that the impact of distancing among low-risk people is more important to decrease transmission than its impact for high-risk people who move around less,‚Äù Sanjat Kanjilal, a lecturer in the Department of Population Medicine at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute wrote on Twitter Friday.

The idea is simple: If low-risk people don‚Äôt socially distance, then the entire containment process is not effective. Generally, there are fewer high-risk individuals ‚Äî the sick and the elderly ‚Äî and they don‚Äôt tend to move around as much as lower-risk individuals. Therefore, it‚Äôs more likely that a low-risk individual will expose a high-risk individual to the virus.

Wanting to socialize right now is understandable. People are stressed. It‚Äôs St. Patrick‚Äôs Day weekend. People (rightly) want to support local businesses. Younger people feel less vulnerable. But the consequences are dire. Just look at Italy ‚Äî a country thought to be a week to 10 days ahead of the United States in its outbreak ‚Äî where the health care system is collapsing under the strain of new cases. In The Boston Globe on Friday, the Italian journalist Mattia Ferraresi offered a chilling warning to U.S. readers not to follow Italy‚Äôs lead. ‚ÄúMany of us were too selfish to change our behavior,"" he wrote. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre in lockdown and people are needlessly dying.‚Äù

If the same holds true in the United States, it could mean that this weekend‚Äôs St. Patrick‚Äôs Day bar crawls are effectively petri dishes incubating the virus. Once it spreads without containment, untold numbers could be infected, with many not showing symptoms for days, if at all. And as these low-risk individuals move around ‚Äî visiting families, friends and going to work ‚Äî they threaten to expose others to a potentially life-threatening illness.

Social distancing is a responsibility. It‚Äôs not about panicking and quarantining to protect one‚Äôs self, but to protect others around you. You can still FaceTime or video chat with friends and family. Do a joint movie night. A virtual book club. Eat, drink and try to unwind.

And if you have the means, here are some ideas to help the businesses losing revenue under social distancing measures: Call or email your favorite bars, restaurants and businesses. If they have them, purchase a generous online gift card to front them money you will spend later. Or inquire about virtual tips you can send to service staff. But we should all recognize that even that kindness will be a drop in the bucket. We are facing a serious challenge and will need the government to take action to assist all of the people who will be left struggling.

For now, make the responsible choice and do not pack the bars and clubs this weekend. It‚Äôs proven effective in places like China, Singapore and South Korea, and it has saved lives. You can help, too.

But don‚Äôt take my word for it. Listen to Mr. Ferraresi, who is living a week into a hellish future in Italy.

3875,LeadLifeJacket,1584398730,fju2nj,Nan,"Hello All! 

I, like many SF residents, park my car on the street and I know that as of right now the city is still enforcing parking that affects ""health and safety."" 

SFMTA states ""We will continue enforcement of parking rules that impact health/safety: street cleaning (as DPW cleaners available), bike lanes, double parking, transit lane parking, yellow zones, meters (groceries, pharmacies, banks &amp; delivery restaurants will be open) &amp; driveway tows."" I am regularly calling 3-1-1 and appealing to SFMTA, but I doubt that there will be any drastic change in their plans due to one person being annoying haha. 

This means that a lot more people than usual will be stuck doing the street cleaning parking dance, and vying for more of the same spots than usual (since the normal amount of cars that empty out and turn over during the day will be much lower). 

So, I would like to propose the idea of parking sharing during this time. If I had parking to share, I would. Alas, I am on the other side of the coin. I am not entirely sure what this would look like, but I'm sure those able to pay would probably pay a fee to do so (since many people already rent garages, etc), but we should all be wary of price-gouging and taking advantage of one another in a rough situation.

I am sure that there are many people in the city that have empty garage spots that could be utilized. Or even an area in front of a garage that would normally be blocking a garage. Given the possibility that the cars inside garages will not be moving (at all or regularly) for the foreseeable future - those spots could possibly be utilized for parking now as well. Perhaps there is a way to create a posting of available spots, or a sign to put in your window that lets people know it is okay to park in front of your garage for now. 

I am mostly spit-balling and hoping that we can all come together to help one another during this time. That being said, remember to ask your elderly or immune-compromised neighbors if you can do anything to help! 

Okay, thank you!",sanfrancisco,Parking Sharing for Everyone Stuck at Home

So let's think about what's dead:

\-large social gatherings.

\-dine-in restaurants

\-cafes with seating indoors

\-rideshares and bike shares that risk cross contamination from multiple users.

\-Indoor gyms that risk cross contamination.

\-Farmers markets

\-Public schools

\-Sports

\-On site college campuses

What am I missing here? Please add to this list.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets think about things that will take off:

\-Hospitals. 2.8 beds per 1000 americans simply won't cut it.

\-Online classes for literally everyone. We're going to be hearing shortly how our school boards plan to do this.

\-Food delivery/take out windows so lineecooks dont risk illness.

\-Grocery delivery options. Amazon is hiring 100k new delivery personnel to handle growing demand.

\-Food subscription options. Farmers markets will need to get their produce to people somehow.

\-Remote work for everyone who doesnt have to physically move things/make things.

\-Target's option to deliver to your car without going int the store so produce and goods don't risk contamination.

\-Buying your own bicycle or scooter so you dont cross contaminate another bike.

\-Swimming pools? Chlorine can deactivate covid-19 and other viruses which, aside from being breathed on, potentially safe(?)

\-Running/doing cardio. In an age where we all risk getting pneumonia it'll be crucial that we all take care of ourselves, especially our lungs.

There are 2-3 units in my apartment building (small building, 2 floors) being renovated as people move out, and on any given day, there are several workers coming in and out, doing cosmetic work on the empty units (redoing wood floors, revamping bathroom and kitchen tops, painting, etc). 

Tenants were informed by the construction company and management that they would continue through the shelter in place order, business as usual, because they need to continue to make money (per the construction co.) and get the units occupied ASAP (per management). 

Definitely concerned here as my offices (as well as the other tenants‚Äô offices) have already been shut down for weeks so we have all been WFH. Needless to say, the construction makes it impossible to WFH or take any calls, so many of us have been forced to work 7-8 hours in public spaces. Now that libraries and coffee shops are shut down, and order in effect, we have no other option than to stay in our apartment as much as possible. 

Anyone know if ‚Äúessential construction‚Äù includes renovations of apartments? I don‚Äôt believe anything structural is changing. Several people including myself have already talked to management and they are not concerned, so talking to them is exhausted.

Any thoughts or suggestions? 

Id feel safer not having people coming in and out, and as a remote hourly worker, am also concerned about being able to perform my job with them here.",sanfrancisco,Is cosmetic renovation considered ‚ÄúEssential Business‚Äù?

no, sorry, not your fun aunt that let you drink at 15. im your boring aunt that buys you savings bonds &amp; books for christmas/birthdays. and, surprise! i'm here with immunity boosting tips so that you can keep yourself healthy and thus your community healthy! 

**get 8 hours of sleep** (or rest if you dont sleep well) or more ([1](https://www.health.harvard.edu/press_releases/importance_of_sleep_and_health))

""Sleep deprivation alters immune function, including the activity of the  body's killer cells. Keeping up with sleep may also help fight cancer.""

**exercise** (walking counts!) for 30 mins to 1 hour, 4 to 5 days per week ([2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/aerobic-exercise/art-20045541))

""Aerobic exercise activates your immune system in a good way. This may  leave you less susceptible to minor viral illnesses, such as colds and  flu.""

**eat well**, getting at least 8-10 servings of fruit and veg per day, thats 4-5 cups fruit, 4-5 cups veg  (hey, i dont make the rules, science does) ([3](https://time.com/4920832/fruit-vegetables-legumes-servings/), [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673617322535))

""A higher produce intake has been associated with leanness, more energy,  positive mood, better sleep, and creativity, says Sass, and it‚Äôs also  important for sustaining a strong immune system""

**reduce drinking alcohol** ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590612/))

""Clinicians have long observed an association between excessive alcohol  consumption and adverse immune-related health effects such as  susceptibility to pneumonia.""

**reduce stress** ([6](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-happens-when-your-immune-system-gets-stressed-out/))

""Stress is sometimes¬†a motivator that helps¬†you rise to the occasion. At  other times, it‚Äôs simply overwhelming. Whatever the case, if it‚Äôs  chronic, it can take¬†a toll on your immune system.""

okay, thats it! not so bad right? and, listen, when all this is over im going to drive over in my ancient 1997 prius and bring you some newbery award winning books (the ones without pictures) and a bag of sugar-free candy. its gonna be lit! now, go wash your hands!",sanfrancisco,Immunity boosting tips!

Corona is nowhere near those numbers, and even 80+ people with many preexisting health conditions have greater than 80% survival rate. Healthy adults and children have a 99% survival rate. Meanwhile, 1 in 5 people have already lost their jobs or had their hours cut. And we're just getting started. By the time this thing is over, we're looking at massive unemployment (in the millions), people losing access to health insurance as they lose their jobs, an increase I  homelessness, a now-standard ""jobless recovery"", etc...

4207,KontiErMeningslose,1584588547,fl349b,Nan,"CNN's Jake Tapper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta were not impressed by the behavior of some San Franciscans under a shelter-in-place order ‚Äî so much so they made an example of the city on air.

The segment showed the Embarcadero at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, the first day of the city's mandate that citizens stay home to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. Although it looked pretty thinned out for a normal weekday, there were a number of joggers and people taking in the fresh air.

""Look, I'm not medical professional, but I don't know how effective this, as a shelter in place, could possibly be,"" Tapper said.

""People have to social distance. They're not doing it, Jake. I'm worried about this now,"" Gupta replied.

Tapper and Gupta were visibly bothered as the clip continued to show people strolling on the San Francisco waterfront.

""I still really get the impression people in many places aren't taking this seriously,"" u/drsanjaygupta says on many San Francisco residents ignoring the shelter in place order to stay home. ""I'm worried these numbers- they keep going up.""

""\[San Francisco Mayor London Breed\] said to me that people are allowed ‚Äî if they need to go out and go for a walk and get a breath of fresh air ‚Äî they're allowed to, as long as they social distance. But that's not what we just saw. We saw people going for jogs, people going about their life as if it's normal. We're being told by the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health that this is not normal.

""First of all, we see a bunch of people who are not social distancing. they're holding hands and walking down the street ... This is actually kind of enraging. The people of San Francisco ‚Äî I shouldn't say the people, many people in San Francisco ‚Äî have clearly not gotten the message.""

The city's shelter-in-place order does allow for outdoor exercise, provided it is done with at least six feet between individuals at all times.

The segment was not well-received by some locals, who pointed out that the usually well-populated stretch was not indicative of the Bay Area's quarantine efforts as a whole.

""Love CNN and I don‚Äôt like to see this erroneous posting about San Francisco. You are clearly not here. That is empty for the Embarcadero,"" one person tweeted at the show.

""Please don‚Äôt take one picture of SF and make broad conclusions,"" added another. ""The city is shut down! A few people walking on embarcadero is not a good example!""

Over seven million Bay Area residents have been ordered to shelter in place through April 7 as medical experts fear coronavirus cases are set to peak in the United States.

""We've been talking about the testing, we've been talking about the need for hospital preparedness, we've been talking about the need for social distancing. I don't think any of those things have been done yet, Jake,"" Gupta said on CNN Tuesday. ""We're still way behind on testing. It's not at all clear to me that hospitals are prepared for what's about to happen. And I think given that, and the different sorts of patchwork of recommendations around the country, people just aren't taking this seriously...

""They don't understand fundamentally, I think, what is happening with this virus right now.""

Since March 9, UCSF Health has been testing about 60 to 100 inpatients a day with a test using ""a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique"" that's similar to the one administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""PCR allows scientists to detect very small amounts of virus in a sample obtained with a swab from a patient‚Äôs nose and throat,"" UCSF said in a statement.

I had a whole argument with her because I believe she is being selfish not taking the lockdown seriously and putting her husband who recently  had a heart attack; and everyone else living in the building at risk of contracting the virus. Plus we have ZERO hand sanitizer or wipes and I've begged her to please be considerate but just gets mad and tells me to put my faith in god. I gave faith in god, but don't be stupid and put yourself at risk. 

It's like having unprotected sex and saying - I have faith in god I won't get pregnant ... chances are you will and it wasn't the faith of god, it was your stupid decision. Not the best comparison but still.

My company collapsed mid-2019 and laid everyone off.  I made $100,350 in 2018, yet only $50,000 in 2019 supporting the same household.. My gf had some issues and I was supporting both of us for a while too as able.  

My current line of work was dissolved in a matter of 2 weeks this month, and I am currently unemployed.  

**This relief does not take into account individuals in HCOL areas, and those living in states with income taxes.  It does not take into account that because you had a good 2018, it does not equal a good 2019.**  

I assume there are many individuals here who just barely made over $99,500 and are still struggling today, rather it was in 2018 or 2019.  

What is the best course forward? 

**I've written and called every rep I can think of.  Is there anything better to do?  A petition? Is there a group/organization that rallies for these types of things?**

Please help writing reps if this affects you or not, millions will be hurting from this stimulus bill being excluded.  Also, some people were married in 2019 and had kids - so this greatly affects many of us beyond income. 

Thank you!

4362,bone-dry,1584741874,fm3qdc,Nan,"As we all know, hand sanitizer and even rubbing alcohol are extremely hard to come by these days. Vodka is plentiful (at least I've seen it around) but contains too much water to properly disinfect.

**I'm imagining a simple technique to distill vodka into high-proof, disinfecting alcohol using a crock pot. Would this work or am I crazy? Can someone with more knowledge in the area poke holes in my theory?**

1. Acquire vodka.
2. Pour vodka into crockpot.
3. Place ceramic (or otherwise heat-proof) collection bowl into the center of the crock pot. 
4. Place crockpot lid on upside down, and seal the edges the best you can. 
5. Place ice on inverted crockpot lid. 
6. Plug in crockpot, and set to low. 

At the low setting, alcohol evaporates while the water, not boiling, mostly stays behind. The alcohol vapors collect on the cold lid, and drip down the handle into your collection bowl.

Presto change-o. Add it to a spray bottle and you now have Coronavirus-killing spray solution... Or do you? Thoughts? 

**Warning: Alcohol is flammable in its liquid form at 50%. It is explosive in its gaseous form ‚Äî the alcohol steam we are producing. If a flame hit's that gas, or any gas escaping the pot, you are going to have an explosion. No smoking, no flames, no other heat sources, no electric sparks, no wearing wool on a dry day.**

It is ok to go outside. If you are with people who live in your household there is no reason to stay 6 ft apart. Its totally fine to go for a run. It's totally fine to go for a walk. Go ahead and ride your bike. Even just go lay in the grass if it's nice. It would be so good for your mental health and overall well being to leave your house.

We. Are. Not. In. Prison.

You can do all these things and still avoid other people. It's not that hard and you're not going to be spreading the virus. Wash your hands don't touch your face avoid other people.

But go outside. It's ok. There are no businesses to go to anyways, don't hang out in groups but for the love of God go outside to feel better and stop judging people for doing so.

There are other costs here beyond the virus. It's a multifaceted issue.

This is something they absolutely have to do.  

However, it had to come to this.  In fact, I never would‚Äôve expected they would have done this.

Yes, the homeless aren‚Äôt necessarily subject to the order as I‚Äôve understood it.  And I hear that homeless folks are getting this too.  That‚Äôs another issue.

I understand the notion of big city police services but this whole idea of SFPD suddenly ‚Äúdoing their jobs‚Äù is weird as hell even after I‚Äôve moved away.

I would really like it, if moving on, if people would treat basic law and order in SF as a matter of public good and hygiene moving forward rather than the sheer necessity it is right now.  And I wish that the basic street services were there to support those people that don‚Äôt have that who lack those basic needs.

Suddenly, cops doing their jobs, at least around this, shouldn‚Äôt be disregarded and disrespected.  

The sea change of prosecution in SF that has been elected should be at the basis and in close coordination with the weird flex of SFPD keeping the streets clean should begin a new normal, not be the end of it.

SF is at a new normal and I hope that this epoch moment in Western History is a chance to reboot this fucking filthy city into something else where law and order, the public good, and basic human needs like housing and health and food are met.

Hope to have you there!

\------------------

In case you haven't seen these posts yet, I host these events called Skip the Small Talks where I put strangers in a room and get them talking to each other about more meaningful and interesting stuff than social norms generally allow. My background is in social and clinical psychology research, so my approach is informed by the literature on self-disclosure, question-asking, game theory, and some other stuff that I can nerd out about in person if you end up coming to the event and are interested in hearing me ramble for a while. But basically, we use cards with questions written on them and a lot of structure to allow people to open up to strangers more comfortably and quickly than you might usually.

People have reported finding Skip the Small Talks useful for meeting new people, for becoming more comfortable in social situations outside of Skip the Small Talk, and for interacting with humans in a low-effort context. Some Redditors said some nice stuff about us [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/b0146n/experience_with_skip_the_small_talk/) if you want to check out other people's take on it.

You can check out all our events [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/skip-the-small-talk-10841599652) and you if you want to keep up with our events, you can sign up for our e-mail list [here](https://www.skipthesmalltalk.org/) (I don't spam, I don't share your e-mail address with anyone, and I really genuinely do hope you'll let me know if the e-mails ever start getting annoying).

If you do end up going and if you're feeling up for it, come say hi to me and let me know what you thought!",sanfrancisco,"Skip the Small Talk (NOW AN ONLINE EVENT!): Wednesday, March 25, 6:00 pm - 8:30 pm EST"

I live in a three bedroom apartment in the city, and our master tenant has lived here for nearly 15 years. He confines himself to his room regularly, doesn't have a SO or spouse, and we hardly see or hear from him. But because he is ritualistic about his routines (e.g. coffee every morning, laborious hair care routine mid-morning, grocery store run in the afternoon, etc.) my other roommate and I notice when something is different. He wasn't home Sunday night, and wasn't home Monday until he came back around 3 p.m. for about 5 minutes, and then left again. He didn't stay at our apartment last night for the second time, and hasn't been back today. 

Given the health crisis going on, and the order to stay home, I'm concerned he's putting me and my roommate at risk by potentially staying at another person's house (maybe his lady friend?) and then coming back to our apartment and potentially introducing us to the virus he picked up elsewhere. 

What advice do you have for us? Should we just ask him directly where he's been? Should we ask that he stay there until April 7 (when the shelter in place is supposed to be lifted)? Or is this a lost cause, and he's free to disobey the city recommendations?",sanfrancisco,Roommate bouncing between apartments during shelter-in-place

Every two or so days a small family, speaking some European language, keep returning and their two children ride their bikes for about an hour in front of my small shared apartment. The children scream, ring their bells loudly, and have begun to dry cough the last two times they have visited.

I don't mind how loud they are, and I understand that children need this time to play and exercise in a safe area. But it is a whole new feeling of uneasiness that arises when these kids could be spreading disease by coughing mere feet next to my windows. I am staying at home with my parents, who are both in high risk categories for this disease.

Is it safe for these kids to be out doing this? Is it safe for me to be inside while this happens outside? Would it be appropriate to call 511, or whatever the non-emergency # is to report any unsafe behavior like this, if they keep returning and coughing?",sanfrancisco,Children playing and coughing outside my home

By letting you make targeted decisions on what stores you need to go to, we hope to promote social distancing. If you have any issues using the website please let me know! We have another week of spring break and expect to work on bug fixes and improvements for a large part of the coming week!

So in 3 months economy restarts, you start working again.

I believe you have 90 days to pay that 2-3 month rents back but also must pay the ongoing rent. 

So how do you dig yourself out of this? Work extra job? Family help? Leave the Bay Area (and just not pay back rent)? I suppose some landlords might try to let you repay the rent over a longer period of time.

* ?sysco? sp?, ( the one with bridges) .iIi. .iIi.
* ISP spawned by the devil, *if you look at their logo you'll see the first letter is actually devil horns turned sideways*. Devil has a peacock sidekick now, the peacock is cool though.
* An electric car motor run by the real life Iron man

Tried with the top tier management consulting firms, only stands out to people who know them, they're still a best kept secret gen pop doesn't know about.

Sorry, don't have the logos for the social network or the silly spinny hats one, not a software engineer with dat **sexy** *rsu* TC. 

*feel free to donate....although I refuse to wear the logo of a tech stack I can't support.*

Not really flexing in downtown SF or SJ/Cupertino, or really any high concentration professional downtown area, you're one in a many even if the logo is top tier tech, tested for NY, Philly, Texas, RDU/RTP and midwest cities. Everyone here is a professional and is repping their colors, high salaries are free flowing, everyone is too happy/busy living their life to care.

You do this in an area that's getting gentrified or low income/poverty line/ *i think i see a crackhouse with a broken window over there*, this would be considered flexing, you'll feel bit douchy and not in the good way, it's also just downright dangerous and asking for an altercation, i do not advise, Don't do it lol!

In small towns outside major downtown areas and the boonies you'll get a reaction, normal settings at general stores and gyms gets you about the equal rate of impressed looks and gasps (especially from women) coupled with the envious stares and grimaces (both men and women).

This only applies if your a guy, other guys will see you as a threat encroaching on their game.

Had my SO (*smiley, small pretty Asian girl*) try this in the same settings, it was a much more positive experience, people were friendly came up to her and asked about what she did, conversation of all giggles and laughs, great for networking.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to feel like a celebrity, I think **small college towns** (*ivy league level just think you're a recruiter*) are the sweet spot, you will probably get attention you desire (from hot girls as well as friendly bros), **it's an ego trip**. 

These kids see the logo and they'll look up to you, you're at the level they're striving to get to (desperately), we were all unsure students without a path in life once, try not to take advantage of them too much, maybe offer some helpful career advice or even become a mentor.

It's up to you to try to make those into meaningful encounters, most of the time it's a pretty superficial brief conversation.",sanfrancisco,"If you work in tech &amp; wear company swag on your day off, is that considered flexing?"

4856,MrMiller_,1585328880,fq0v3a,Nan,"I'm in a tough spot with my apartment and am looking for advice.

Here's my situation:

4BR, rent around 5k (rent control). Two of my roommates got laid off from work for the foreseeable future (hospitality). I feel secure in my job. 4th roommate moved out mid-February and paid march rent.

Finding a new roommate has proven to be very difficult if not impossible. Of the people remaining in the house, I am the only one on the lease.

My two now unemployed roommates can pay April rent, but likely can not split the 4th room's rent with me. I really like my house, it's perfect for my dog and I, but it's looking like we don't have a lot of options besides not paying rent and waiting to be evicted.

My credit score is 830 so it won't affect me too badly, I guess, but I also just realized two close friends of mine who don't live in SF are still on the lease (they are idiots), so if we went the eviction route it would affect them too.

Alternatively, I could pay my own rent + the vacant room's rent: 2400 + \~200 utilities. I have savings but I don't want to volunteer to be on the hook for double rent for April, May, June, who knows how long.

What should I do?",sanfrancisco,"Probably can't pay my rent this month, what should I do?"

I am not using them, but since this money can only¬†be used to pay for public transit I have nowhere else to spend it -- it will go unused forever. Couldn't SFMTA request and accept donations that come from commuter cards? I know there are probably authorizations required from the IRS, for example, but in times like this I believe¬†an exception could be made...

Building on this idea, even in months where I do use public transit I do not spend the entirety of my monthly stipend. I've thought many times about all that wasted money and looked for ways to maybe donate it to low-income transit riders, or to the SFMTA itself so it can re-distribute the funds to those in need.

I am also being sickened by mold exposure; the presence of mold has been recognized by the SF DPH as delineated in a public notice posted in my building on March 10th. Furthermore, the Department of Building Inspection declared my building a ""nuisance"" on January 6th following an inspection I initiated. During the inspection the inspector informed me that the property owner has been fined repeatedly by the DBI and CAL-OSHA.

My window opens onto a light well. This past week several of my neighbors whose windows open onto the same light well have been harassing me for coughing by shouting at me and sounding an air horn. I have responded by shouting back which I admit is not in my best interest, but I am beyond angry. 

Today they called the police to report that I have been coughing on people with the intent to infect them with COVID-19. I have not left my room in nearly a week even to use the community bathrooms. I was on the phone with a medical provider when the cops banged on my door demanding that I open it. When I did they were standing within two feet of me in violation of social distancing with a billy club in my face. I slammed my door and told them as much.

The onsite property manager, Harold Dawson, supports my neighbors and claims that my coughing violates the SF noise ordinance and that I can continue to expect to receive notices of violating my lease as long as I continue to cough.

I replied via email to inform him of the law.

https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/ehsdocs/ehsnoise/guidelinesnoiseenforcement.pdf

I live in Permanent Supportive Housing managed by the Tenderloin Housing Clinic and provided by the SF Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing and the Department of Social Services under the CAAP SSIP program. My onsite case manager is an employee of THC and, while she is sympathetic, she cannot speak contrary to the onsite property manager.

tl;dr My neighbors are bored and vindictive wastes of space and my onsite property manager is ignorant to the point of violating the law*

*Previously he encouraged me to misuse the Americans with Disabilities Act to request a room change because my former neighbor was a constant disturbance due to his untreated schizophrenia and drug use, screaming and banging on the walls for days at a time. The need for sleep is not a disability for which I can legally request mitigation under the ADA.

Please let me know if you have advice on handling this situation which could see me fined or arrested as the COVID crisis escalates.

Thank you.",sanfrancisco,"Harassed by neighbors for coughing, they are calling SFPD to report me"

The one option is a private room in a house in the Bayview with 2 others. Theres a living room and dining room.

The other is a private room in a small apartment complex. No living or dining room. Kitchen very small but in Cole Valley walking distance of the heart of the Haight. Super small but $110 less a month.

I applied for unemployment the day I was laid off due to COVID-19.  Now we're two weeks later and I've finally received my paperwork to get payments started.  I've read that if you have a job to return to after the shelter-in-place is lifted you do not have to be currently searching for work(which is a standard rule under normal unemployment circumstances).

Does anyone know how I should go about filling out the paperwork for the first two weeks.  Do I just write that I'm currently not looking for work?  Any help is appreciated.  This stuff is confusing and there aren't any good resources that I could find.  All resources help with the initial unemployment application, but it's a little confusing after that fact.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

Here's the chain of events that has happened:

* Initially they had rented out to a group of 4 friends (ages 21-25). My parents were kind (and also dumb) enough to be willing to accept rent individually
* One of them had to move out. As a result, we have been missing out on one person's portion of rent for the past few 4 months
* A week ago, one of the tenants told us he had been laid off and won't be able to make rent payments for the forseeable future. We agreed that it's fine for the time being and that we still expect payment once he's back on his feet
* Just yesterday, the other two tenants are claiming they've been laid off as well and won't be able to make rent. One sent us an article regarding Gov. Gavin Newsom's c-19 eviction ban

We believe the other two tenants are taking advantage of the situation to skip on rent given the timing and the article they sent, so we asked them to provide proof of unemployment and none of them have been able to show us any documents so far.

My parents are coming to me for advice but I'm not sure what to do either. I think what's going to happen is that the tenants are going to squat around for the next few months rent-free then move out without ever planning to catch up on rent.

We're a small 'mom-and-pop' landlord and this is the only property that we're renting out. At the same time, the monthly rent payments aren't crucial to our welfare, as it might be for other small-time landlords. We're obviously not going to kick anyone to the streets if our tenants don't have any other options, but this entire situation seems very fishy and they're more than likely trying to take advantage of the eviction ban. Would appreciate any feedback on what we should be doing.",sanfrancisco,"Tenants refusing to pay rent amidst c-19 layoffs, Newsom eviction ban"

So I want to do takeout to support local restaurants - which apparently means using ubereats / postmates / caviar / etc. Which one(s) of these treat the restaurant + drivers best?

I've never used these before - actually never done delivery before, I'll either dine-in or walk in and get to-go. I've mostly read negative things in terms of how they work out for restaurants and drivers (notably re one of them not passing through tips in full) - but seems for many places those are the only options for take-out at the moment. 

Also, if you drive for any of these - what's the current situation with tipping? I usually tip cash at bars/restaurants, but we're now encouraged to do 'contactless' delivery.

1. **Use body language** to tell others where you're going. Most close sidewalk encounters come from a lack of communication. Look with your eyes and point with your feet in the direction you want to go.

2. **Commit early** to your decision. The earlier the better. Indecision increases the chances of miscommunication. 

3. Consider **the rules of the road**. Many driving rules apply (loosely) to urban pedestrians. Walk on the right. Pull over to the side if you need to stop for any reason. Don't change lanes randomly.

4. Don't be afraid to **step off the sidewalk** if there is a group of people blocking your path.

Pre-ordered some goods from Neighbor Bakehouse and walked over to pick it up today.  Never having gone out at \~10am during SIP, I was shocked to see how many people, families, and joggers were out as well!  It was literally impossible to keep distance, even though at one point several people were taking up a car lane (including a family that decided to have their little kids ride bikes).  The car thankfully was patient didn't try to force its way through but rather stopped and waited for the lane to clear of people.  So while I guess I'm glad Neighbor Bakehouse and Olivier's Butchery have long lines right now, on top of those long lines taking up the sidewalk are families and joggers adding to the sidewalk congestion.

Here are my opinions:
- the 6-foot distance in all lines will be maintained in all cases below
- every building open to the public will be required to have free hand sanitizer/other cleaning supplies on counters, elevators etc. 
- first, local travel (by car) should be allowed. Hotels should only operate at a lower capacity. Room cleaning will only be done when rooms change occupancy. Airbnb‚Äôs are allowed.
- restaurants should be allowed to open only at 50% capacity. They should introduce max times to improve table turnover, which should help make up for some of the revenue lost to lower capacity. All restaurants should be given automatic liquor licenses to help increase revenues.
- a huge ad campaign should be made to incentivize awesome tipping, or a temporary fee should be added to all restaurant/hospitality purchases

Thieves are masking as delivery people. Luckily we have 24-hour cameras and we have the person walking in, wandering around. Finding the bike racks, waiting for it to be all clear pulls out an electric saw and cuts the bike loose and rides out through the one-way exit. The man (not sure if I can post pictures) looks like a courier, backpack, helmet, looking like he was attempting to drop something off.

Filed a police report but be careful of now how thieves are adapting to everyone being home and reliant on new services and masquerading to get into areas people thought were safer when someone was around 24/7 or more active in general. This happened on a Saturday at 10pm (what would be a very active time for people normally moving around).

Quick rundown of my situation: I am recently out of quarantine, having returned to the US from my MSc program in Europe two weeks ago.

We‚Äôre currently paying rent with my brother‚Äôs Pell Grant, and I‚Äôm trying to search for a job as my mom hasn‚Äôt had any luck in the months since she and my dad got divorced and he moved out (she was a housewife for 24+ years, and he doesn‚Äôt pay anything to us). My brother, mom, nor I have any technical skills.


I know big grocery chains are hiring, but does anyone have any firsthand experience of specific stores hiring? I sent some applications to Whole Foods on Stanyan yesterday, and looking to send some to Safeway/Andronico‚Äôs today. I can‚Äôt drive, so becoming a courrier is out of the question for me.

Living in a state of pandemic 

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know exactly what this new future looks like, of course.

The airline wouldn‚Äôt be able to see where you‚Äôd gone, but it would get an alert if you‚Äôd been close to known infected people or disease hot spots. There‚Äôd be similar requirements at the entrance to large venues, government buildings, or public transport hubs. There would be temperature scanners everywhere, and your workplace might demand you wear a monitor that tracks your temperature or other vital signs. Where nightclubs ask for proof of age, in future they might ask for proof of immunity‚Äîan identity card or some kind of digital verification via your phone, showing you‚Äôve already recovered from or been vaccinated against the latest virus strains.‚Äù
