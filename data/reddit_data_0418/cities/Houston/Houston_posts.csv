Low Lights:

* Spent too much time in hospitals with sick kids

Highlights:

* Finally finished my remodel after Harvey
* Cut my commute down from 48 to 14 miles by taking a new job

After going to a few interest meetings from some of the organization he realized that it wasn’t going to be possible for him to join without paying outrageous amounts of money and going through hazing, which none of that sounded great.

Being Hazed wasn’t what he had in mind he wanted a brotherhood, he found other veterans that felt the same and we decided to start one from scratch. In order for the school to recognize us, it has taken $10,000 and now we are in a battle trying to figure out how to raise money for the insurance that’s required by the school. All in all we need $3000 for the insurance. We are asking for people to donate anything at all. Seriously enough people donating $2 would make a difference. 

It can be very lonely for veterans coming back to school and we provide brotherhood and housing and just answers to some of the basic questions that are hard to just google. We are not exclusively military, we welcome anyone that has a heart for veterans/current services members.

Alternatively, affordable isp vendors you trust?? Around how much do they run you?

This is all public record and I'm leaving off first names so this should not be considered doxxing. Some asides I found interesting at the bottom. 

Remember, all accused are innocent until proven guilty.

Harris County is VERY ""Black and White."" Under race you will not find Hispanic, because this is an ethnicity and not a race, and you will not find Asian or Middle Eastern. These are all generally grouped as White or with Asian and Middle Eastern, occasionally as unknown.

72% of all offenders are known to be citizens



Offenders who are Black were far and away more unlikely to have their citizenship identified. 

Among 2nd and 3rd time offenders, men remained at a similar percentage at 85%.  
The number of white offenders rose to 85%.  
The number of citizen offenders rose to 80%.

The oldest offender is 64 years old.  
The youngest is 19.

With over 15,000 DWI related cases this year, this is a small sample, and should not be used to make assumptions for cases throughout the year.

Please point out any errors you find and I'll make corrections.

My name is Syed and for the past year, I've been working on a Hurricane Harvey documentary called ""100 Boats."" 100 Boats tells the remarkable story of a group of volunteers who started a search and rescue operation to save the people of  Houston. This film was an extremely personal project for me as I was out in the field with this group (3P Off-Road) documenting their rescue efforts during Hurricane Harvey. I will never forget how I saw thousands of Houstonians come together to help each other and save their fellow neighbors. In the end, 3P helped rescue over 3,000 Houstonians from their flooded homes. Now, I want to share these stories with you! FYI, this film will probably make you cry but it will help restore your faith in humanity!! The groups/organizations featured in 100 Boats will also be present at this premiere! A percentage of ticket sales will go towards rebuilding a community in Rosharon that was devastated during Hurricane Harvey.

Some are matured others are juvenile, &amp; then a few kittens. I live nearby the Barc animal shelter, known for putting them to sleep.

I plan on luring them into small pet carriers &amp; sending them to Barc, however, I just want to ask, is the ""Drive thru"" option still a thing, I saw a post about it once before. Are they able to accept many animals from one individual?  How many at a time? Will they keep my carrier? I believe I just have to take my ID &amp; a bill to prove my address? 

I know that most people would want to save them, but its going to get really bad soon, if I don't take action. My neighbors feed them on the street, and you see almost a whole group run towards the food pile. They aren't going to cooperate, so I have to do something. I don't have money to get them all spayed, especially the ones that are feral. I might have just enough to get one of the semi-feral (if that's a thing) fixed and maybe even kept around. And there is one that I would like to take to SPCA do to it being a little more domesticated than most. However, she just had kittens, and well not sure if they will accept mom and kids.

Any suggestions, as of right now, I am most likely sending to Barc. I have read about the Trap, Neuter, Release, but I don't know if any organizations in NE Houston, inner loop, do these things.

We live out in Waller County, and as of a few months ago the recycling center out there only accepts #1 and #2 plastics. This has resulted in a pretty significant increase in the nonrecyclable plastic that goes through our household. SO has been setting this stuff aside, intending to try and figure out somewhere different to take it.

I've done some looking in our area and found nothing. Trying to figure out of the restriction was a regional thing, I checked out the Westpark center - which I'm familiar with from when we lived in Westchase. I see they accept #3-5 and #7 plastic. Of course, the caveat is that they accept ""recyclables at no charge to City of Houston residents."" Obviously we are not CoH residents.

Thinking back to when we used the center, I don't recall having to prove residency or anything, but it's possible my memory is bad and/or this is wishful thinking. But hell, even if they didn't check ID or anything, the Waller reg sticker would kinda be a dead giveaway.

So that's basically it - I'm just trying to figure out ways to recycle more of our stuff, but obviously the residency thing is a roadblock.

My most recent, rather expensive item I ordered from Amazon is ""still in transit"" for the last 2 weeks after being dropped off there, which is very *very* shady considering they basically lied that it got to my local post office on the tracking, but upon talking to a USP rep, it never actually got to my local USPS according to what they see on their end. Additionally, the box that my father's Christmas gift came in was *OPENED* upon arrival (I was at the door when it was delivered); the seal was broken but since they were diligent on packaging and taping it up, whoever tried to snoot around couldn't take the item out. I can't link that last incident to them, but it is shady.

Anyone else having these issues lately?? Or any idea how to navigate these situations besides the conventional route of talking to reps and being oh-so nice and considerately waiting patiently for my packages while they and the shipper work it out?

I saw it in the distance, but at an angle with the Sunlight glare, it looked like a flat strip.  Checking the mirrors, I wasn't sure I had enough room to get over. As I got closer, realized it was a huge metal ladder. Looked like I had enough room to swerve and miss it, but caught the ladder with my front left tire, which caused me to bounce. My foot came off the pedal and hand came off the wheel when I bounced.  Foot came back down on the gas instead of the brake and I swerved again, so it took me longer than I would have liked to regain control and straighten out.  Probably 2 or more stupid quick decisions on my part.

I was grateful that the cars around me were watching and gave me room to regain control and move out of the way before they sped up and passed.  Perhaps more impressively, not one person honked or flipped me off. 

Easily could have turned into a bad collision, but I guess other drivers are used to the ladder in the road scenario and it was my turn to finally be the one to hit it. Anyway, I really appreciated those people yesterday. 

And I wish all of my fellow pick-up truck drivers would take the extra 3 minutes to TIE YOUR SHIT DOWN before getting on the freeway.

A lot of companies seem to hire in the fall, but I am cold-emailing companies and applying everywhere in hopes that I can still get something. I'm really into software and am looking for any tech start-ups that are willing to take interns (unpaid) as I would love to get some experience. If you guys know of any Houston-area engineering or technology companies that could still pick up an intern, I would love to hear it. Thank you!

432,432,karostillst0ned,1578566376,em7xzk,Nan,"Hiiiiii. Goodmorning! 

I am currently 22 living with my mom and sisters in a 2 bedroom apartment on a twin sized air mattress in the living room. I've been here for about a year. I am tired and I'm sure my family is tired of me as well. I am a US Navy veteran living in Houston. Joined straight out of high school, got out in Jan. 2018. Got a quick job at Walmart while I was in school for my EMT Cert., started working as an EMT for a private ambulance company, got a new car and a new apartment with a roommate who was also on the lease. 

Everything was pretty good until 3rd months rent came around. My roommate decided that they were not going to pay their half of the rent and I don't think he ever really intended to in retrospect. He also refused to leave the apartment because his name was on the lease and started to become violent and sketchy. Long story short, I asked management what my options were and I ended up leaving. Also got stuck with a $5500 debt. Moved in with my mom shortly after. 

I could have paid the rent, I should have just paid the rent and found a way to get him to leave but management made it seem like that just wasn't an option because his name was on the lease. I also paid the total move in fees and I paid up the first 2 months rent by myself, giving my roommate ample time to come up with his half of $600. 

  
Fast forward 2020. I am working at a hospital now where I net about $1200-$1300 every other week. My car got totaled on Christmas Day 2019, luckily I had geico and gap coverage. Got a new car on the 31st in my name, car note is $568. Insurance is $291. I also have a job offer from a private Ems company $15 an hour for part time/prn. Will also be back in school Jan 21 and will receive monthly housing allowance of $1100.

I believe I am in a good spot now to move out on my own and give it another shot on my OWN. However I keep getting denied. I applied for an apt. today and was told that I did not have an eviction but rental debt. 

  
Please. I know it's a long read. I need help. I am asking strangers for help. What are my options here? Do I tough it out at home for what let's say another year? Or keep spending money applying to different complexes? 

Would also appreciate advice on tackling my debt. I recently pulled up a credit report and these were the major debts: 

Rental Debt - $5,548

Sprint - $812 (got the phone in bootcamp, literally the day I got to my command was the day the ship was going underway. Zero time to prepare. Zero internet/phone to call and place a hold on account. We were deployed for 3 months, river city. 

Speedy Cash - $1,154 

ATT - $303 (cable for previous apartment, did not want to pay for cable for my ""roommate"" to use for free) 

Toll Road fine - $1,800 (\*sigh\*, don't ask, please)

&amp;#x200B;

I make $17.54/hr , 84hrs/pay period

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again in advance..

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you know of any apartments that work with bad credit/BL/eviction, please let me know.",houston,Homeless Veteran seeking advice!

462,462,nervousnugget11,1578595569,emdyxm,Nan,"Background: I'm 23F, black, graduating in Kinesiology this Spring, typical liberal millennial blipster type (spin class and bubble tea yay). I currently work from home and I can take my job with me. I eventually want to go back to school to become a certified nurse midwife or certified professional midwife. I have my own car. I have some acquaintances in Houston but I really don't know anyone there.

Budget: I make decent money now and hopefully when I graduate I'll have more free time to make a lot. Regardless, my max budget is probably $1k based on what I make now and allowing for making more when school ends. I would love to pay something closer to $700-900 though.

Housing: My ideal is a one bedroom, one bathroom place. I don't really care what type, just something to myself. My order of preference would probably be townhouse, house, apartment, or condo. I know my price range is low though, so I'm open to one roommate. I don't have a pet currently but I do want one eventually. I also don't ever want to buy a washer or dryer lol so the place should have one or a laundry facility.

Area: This is the fun part. Of course I want to live in Montrose or Midtown (first choice). I'm also really open to EaDo and the gentrified, predominately black areas of Third Ward (second choice). Since I'm going to be working in the medical field, TMC is great too. I just want to live where I can meet people my age, go to fun bars/restaurants/ trendy museums and pop-ups, and can walk to some of the basics. 

I probably should've DM'd all this but if there are any realtors or women looking for roommates, get at me! Back to browsing HAR.com",houston,What's the best way to find housing for a single female fresh out of college?

I am not from Houston but my girlfriend is from Houston. We met in college 6 years ago. And started dating 3 years ago. She was the first real friend I ever had through college. Now, I am ready to move on to a next chapter with her and ask for her hand. I have been working on few plans to ask her to marry me. That involves her coming to Austin, or going on a camping trip. However, I want to surprise her and the great way to do so is if I come to Houston unexpectedly. 

My two original plans are:
1. Treasure Hunting in Austin
2. Camping trip to lost maples or Big Bend

Now, I don't know much of Houston, but I've joined this subreddit a year ago. I can notice y'all are experts of Houston and know it like the palm of your hand. For that same reason, I would like to ask for some help in identifying for romantic spots in Houston and it's suburbs. Any place is perfect!

So one day I got pulled over on 290 outbound, due to me failing to see the black Ford ghost unit over next to the divider. Yeah, my 1st speeding ticket in maybe 7 years. (Sigh.)

So I weighed my options and figured I'd get an attorney and avoid the DDC hassle. Eighty bucks and a court visit later, I got my ticket deferred, with the judge telling me she'd dismiss it if I didn't get any more tickets in 90 days.

Well, that 90 days came and went and (just like the 7 years before the incident) I managed to avoid getting another ticket.

So far, so good, but I'm curious: Should I get notification from the court that my ticket DID get dismissed?

We are still looking for a dentist. Went to UT dental and was told either come early and spend $25-100 for xrays and urgent care, or call for a appointment. Contacted a few denistries and either couldn't get through the phone, dealt with rude receptionist (you would think...), and still no luck. Unfortunately, we are stuck on a hmo plan, which I realized limits the providers in our region. I contacted a few companies such as Cigna for their PPO plans, and the terms were not as appealing dealing with a dental issue right now (they only had a dhmo and wanted $480/year + only pays about 20-50% (depending on basic/major) of work, plus have to be on a waiting period for months, plus wouldn't be enrolled until February).

I figured the best thing to do was to go on guardians  website and search for actual hmo providers using 77015, 77521 zip codes (I'm around channelview, laporte, baytown area, but willing to go around 30 miles around Houston). So far I only see 4 mainly: royal dental, trinity dental, lovett,  and legacy community, much of which were either poorly reviewed, or I  see people posting what I feared (necessary work thats not covered and  focused on profits over patients).

I know this is just baseball and many other sporting events will do anything but baseball, but I have a feeling for a generation if Houston’s bidding for a Super Bowl, NCAA CFP &amp; Final Four, Olympics, All Star games, etc that scandal will give the image that there’s a cheating factory or culture within Houston.

Right now I'm looking at apartments by the Astros stadium, and some others by market square park.

Potential issue: I work sorta far away from DT, and a lot of my clients I meet with are located on the outskirts of Houston (Katy, Woodlands, etc.)

My office is located near the 8 beltway and westheimer road, and I maybe meet with a client on-site once a week or so. I am expected to be in the office everyday from 8-4, so I am hoping this sort of sets me up to dodge what would typically be a worse commute. Obviously, sometimes I'm just gonna be SOL. And honestly, the fact I'll be driving all over to meet my clients likely sets me up for a bad commute home no matter what if I'm clocking out anytime after 4- I would guess.

But y'all tell me! Am I thinking with a straight head, or grossly underestimating what may be an awful daily commute?

I'll drive anywhere in Houston and surrounding areas. I have already gone to a doctor after one month of itching, Dr thought it was an STD, got a full blood panel done and everything was negative and the only other advise the doctor had was ""to drink a lot of water"".

After I opened it and started to mark it, I realized that since I don't watch TV for the Houston area, I know nothing about anyone except for Chris Bell and Sheila Jackson Lee. And what I know of them is old news.  And the judges...the only ones there I can vote with confidence for are the ones running unopposed.

I would think the Democratic Party in Texas would have a voters information site with a guide but perhaps it just isn't put together yet as all the site seemed to had was request for money and requests for volunteers - or I'm not searching using the right terms.

The Oilers always lost in the playoffs. And I'm still reminded every damn year of THE COMEBACK against the Biils in '93. The Rockets have two rings, but if you talk to anyone outside Houston, it's only because Jordan retired. 

But the Astros....that was my team. No matter what, I loved them. Nolan Ryan, Mike Scott, The Killer Bs, the Clemens / Petite era. Even in the face of heartbreak against the Mets in '86, and the White Sox in 2005....I always held on to hope. 

Even when we faced three MISERABLE seasons of 100 losses, I  had faith the team would turn itself around. 

And then came 2017. The year I had been waiting for. The year my dad and I had dreamt of for decades. The Astros: WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS. 

And in a split-second, it's gone. Vanished. ""Vacated"". Scorned. UNEARNED. ERASED. Just sucks. And who knows if they'll keep their banner. Keep their trophy. Etc. It will always be tied to this awful scandal. Another asterisk in Houston sports. Another joke.

The app is called K Health. 

You can pay $14 for a 1-time visit or $39 for an entire year. This is the most affordable virtual visit option I’ve found. You send a photo of your ID and fill out medical history. When you have symptoms, you log in and list them, Web MD style. The app will give you a few possible diagnoses before asking if you’d like to connect to a doctor. If you connect with a doctor, you’re able to text them directly and they’ll go over your symptoms. If you’re open to a prescription, they will call one in for you. All you do is send a live selfie. Both times I’ve “seen” a doctor from my desk at work. I used this a few weeks ago when I was around a friend who came down with the flu and started showing symptoms myself. Although she could not test me for the flu, the doctor called in Tamiflu and I used GoodRX to get it for $27 at Kroger. I was better 2 days later. 

Right now, I’m dealing with a probable sinus infection and I’m having meds called in to the pharmacy of my choice. Again, using GoodRX for a discount. It’s so easy!

Obviously, this won’t help you if you’ve got something serious going on or need a physical test or exam, but it has already been so beneficial for me. I’m generally very healthy but things like sinus migraines, allergies, an occasional case of strep/flu decide to ruin my life. 

The website also says they treat depression and anxiety, but I have not researched either option yet. 

Hope this helps!",houston,Just wanted to share an affordable basic healthcare option for those uninsured.

1065,1065,lisa_smithsolar,1579553244,erje60,Nan," Certainly, every electric car owner always has a question in his mind, how do EV charging stations work? An EV charging station is an electric recharging point in the USA just like a gas station, where an electric car can recharge once again.   
 

**-&gt;Types of an EV charging station**

An EV charging station can be classified according to its structure and power supply, so if we look into its structure or shape, there are two types:  
 

## a) Hardwire:

It is the simplest form that is provided with accessories free of cost. Besides, you can also connect it directly to the standard circuit board of a home. They are also known as a portable EV charger and the most important ones are AeroVironment, Duosida, Leviton, and Orion.

 

## b) Plugged:

This type contains controllers and different types of plugs.

Besides, the number of pins inside plugs can vary according to the specification of the car’s input socket. In this category, Siemens, Solar edge, and Juice box are among the best charging station. There cost fluctuates from $500 to $1000, depending on the type of electric car and its manufacturer.

Similarly, you can also compare it, according to levels, such as Level 1 EV charge station, Level 2 EV charging station and level 3 EV charging station

Furthermore, the charging time of an electric car depends on the power of the battery and the charging capacity of the charger station. The table below elaborates on the differences between levels based on certain factors.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qmmu3el0xzb41.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aea33d8c0052278bcb308265b857259b9b1bb5d9

 

**-&gt;Why Level 2 EV Charging station is the most convenient option?**

A Level 2 charging station is much better assurance for electric car owners. Its maximum output voltage is 240V and it should be installed by a master electrician and have an output rating of current up to 30-35 Amps. Besides, current and output power depends mainly on the class of electric vehicles and the driving style of the driver. You can easily find that the battery is charging 2-3 times faster than Level 1, consequently, it will save your important time. If the traveling distance is often long, and there is no charger station near your home or office or the customer doesn’t want to have to wait hours to charge the car so that it can run once again then the Level 2 charging station is essential to choose. Some companies name it as a home EV charging station.

Tesla is a car company in the USA, producing electric cars from the last 10 years. It has installed thousands of supercharging stations simultaneously throughout the countries that can charge a car’s battery in just 20 minutes. In short, these chargers are just made for Tesla cars. Other  EVs cannot synchronize with Supercharger stations. But every year, its car owners will get 400 kWh free of cost by using supercharging stations, which is enough to drive a car 1,000-1,500 miles.",houston,How do EV charging stations work?

1067,1067,lisa_smithsolar,1579553861,erjjr0,Nan,"The most frequent question asked by new solar users is, how solar panels work? When sunlight falls on the silicon cell of solar panel, the sunlight transfers heat energy, due to that heat, the electrons in the silicon spectrum start moving and generate DC electric current. This is process is called the photovoltaic effect

What are the components of solar panels and how do they work? 

### -&gt; The Aluminum Frame :

The strength of the solar frame plays a vital role to protect the solar panel. It just serves as a security guard, by providing mechanical properties such as resilience, creep and fatigue. The aluminum frame of the solar panel provides resistance against load during handling, storage, grounding, and installation.  
 

### -&gt;Tempered Glass

Glass is a highly transparent material made up of crystalline elements called silicon. Glass allows the radiation to pass through its material and store it into the solar cells as thermal energy. If the glass will be clear, more stable sun radiation will transmit into the solar cell hence more energy will be generated by the panel. It also keeps the solar cells safe, from humidity rain and dust that increase the life of the panel for more than three decades.

Most of the companies are using tempered glass which is stronger than ordinary glass and causes little damage in case of breaking because it breaks into sharp less small pieces.

 

### -&gt; Encapsulant

**EVA** is a thin sheet made by chemical ethyl vinyl acetate that is using as **encapsulate** material during panel assembly. This thin sheet has to insert between the **photovoltaic** cells and the tempered glass (top surface). It improves the optical performance of cells, saves it from humidity and keeps it dry.

### ‘Solar cells or photovoltaic cell’

There are three types of solar cells in panels which are monocrystalline, polycrystalline and thin film.

 

#### Monocrystalline*

The solar panels that have monocrystalline silicon cells, they can identify easily due to their black color. These cells are aligned at a bevel angle and have the highest efficiency of 18-22%. **Monocrystalline** solar cells can absorb a large number of sun radiations because the light ray hit perpendicular to the photovoltaic cell.

#### Polycrystalline*

Polycrystalline cells have a non-linear crystals structure. The sun radiation can enter the crystalline structure but the light can’t diffuse properly in spite of the irregular structure they show 14-16% efficiency as compared to monocrystalline cells. Polycrystalline silicon has a light blue color.  

#### Amorphous silicon*

Amorphous panels or Thin solar panels are made up of 30 to 70 number square cells, located below a blue and few millimeters thick, gray glass sheet. They are quite flexible just like paper and can absorb sunlight with an efficiency of 6-8%. But it gives better results in dim sunlight as compared to monocrystalline and polycrystalline.

#### Back Sheet*

The most sensitive material of a solar panel is the back sheet. It’s made by a chemical called Polypropylene or thermoplastic polymer. The main role of the PV back sheet is to act as an electrical insulator to protect the inside components of the panel, for example, photovoltaic cells and junction box from external jerks and humidity.

#### Junction Box*

The junction box contains both bypass diodes and blocking diodes. A diode allows the flow of current in one direction only. 

Bypass reduces the power loss of solar panels occurring by shading. Due to shading the solar panel heats up, and become consumers of electricity instead of producers. So bypass diodes give them a separate path to flow and charge the battery.

Blocking diodes keep the current in battery and does not allow to go back in panels at night.  
 

## ""Do solar panels work on cloudy days?""

The question that arises in the mind of every solar system buyer is, do solar panels work on cloudy days? The weather condition can’t remain the same for the whole day. It is a natural process of different seasons. In summer, the cloud formation is less as compared to winter. The presence of clouds directly affects the performance of solar panels but you cannot say that they are not working or producing zero volts. It depends on the number of solar rays that are passing through clouds and hitting the solar cells.

The solar panel will produce 5% to 20% of their rated power during cloudy weather due to the phenomena of irradiance. Thick clouds mostly reflect the incoming solar radiation and keep the earth’s surface cool or at low temperature while the thin or less dense clouds transfer the incoming solar radiation to surface.  
 

## ""Do solar panels work at night?""

The solar panels work on sunlight and at night they produce zero electricity. You can use a battery backup system, in daylight the excess energy generated by panels will store in the battery. This stored energy will give current to the home appliance at night. LG Resu 10KW is among the top batteries.

I need your help Reddit! On December 29 around 7:00 pm a homeless person at Grey and 45 offered to sell me an expensive stroller for $15. It was clearly stolen. He was very upset when I took his photo. He did so literally right in front of a South Central Substation. The Lt., Capt., and five different people who have answered the phone there refuse to call me back. Today, an officer notified me that the only way they would literally walk outside and ask for this mans identification is if they had a complainant. Even more, he said that if he saw a homeless person with a shopping cart filled with expensive items it wouldn't constitute ""reasonable suspicion"" that it was stolen... So they wouldn't even take down the dudes name.

**Did this happen to you? Your friend?** I've got a picture of everything. He stole some dishes and a few other random items too.

1158,1158,Ramacher,1579672286,es7pki,Nan,"Leaving to work this morning I noticed broken glass in the parking lot. I checked my dashcam footage and my rear cam captured it. My rear dashcam's quality is low (specially due to the rear tint) and there was a post blocking the view of the actual break in but from the video I got the timeline of events. I emailed that info to my apartment complex so they can look at their security cameras and get clearer video.  

Relevant info you can tell from my footage:  

Time victim Parks his car  
Time witness Parks their car 2 spaces down from victims  
Time the suspects enter garage and park their car right in front of the witnesses car.  

You can see 2 males casing vehicles using a flash light to look inside them.  
Suspects keep going back to car that was broken into.  
Later fhe witness is returning to their car and notices either the break in or the suspects being suspicious. Suspects notice her and she walks away. This part is clear you can see her face go from confused to scared.    
Suspects return to their car and drive away.   
Witness returns to her car being escorted by 2 male friends. She drives off 2 minutes after the suspects drove off.  

Again my footage isn't clear but the timeline it provides used in conjunction with the parking lot cameras should be able to get clearer footage.  

Also is it even worth bothering? I know the cops aren't gonna stop everything to look into it and that the victim's insurance is probably handling his side of things. I guess I'd just like the police to be aware of the suspect's vehicle's license plate (if it doesn't have paper plates that is) which they can get from the apartment's garage cameras.",houston,Is it possible to find the police report/case # for a car break in that I kind of caught on my dashcam?

Before I get the “just don’t speed” replies, I normally don’t speed but I had an awful set of 4 nights and sped uncharacteristically (no other tickets the past 5 years). The first one got me going 26mph over limit (no defensive driving) and the second one got me 15 over. What are my options? Can I do defensive driving for the second one, and then just pay the first one after I turn in my paperwork. The reason I ask is I believe you can’t do defensive driving if you have more than 1 speeding ticket in the system, but idk if the first one will go in until I show up to court for the payments and such.

After she hit me it looked like she started backing up and she either hit or nearly hit 2 cars in the traffic behind me. The light turned green and she took off with her phone recording what was going on behind her as she ran from the accident.
If you did and you witnessed a brown Dodge Nitro rear end a Red 96-98 Mustang GT convertable please let me know. I am looking for witnesses. The driver of the Nitro drove away, but I was able to catch up and provide the LP# to dispatch.

They told me to pull over and I filed a report with HPD.

I do plan on asking businesses to see if they have surveillance.

Once the report is available I do plan on going further than I've already done. (I've done much more than I listed in this post up to this point.)

1257,1257,DSice16,1579841296,et5het,Nan,"My girlfriend and I were walking our dog at Buffalo Bayou tonight when we came across another couple whose dog was off leash. Their dog came trotting up to us, but we know our dog is pretty dominant so my girlfriend walked up to the other dog to kinda distract him and I tried to walk away from them with our dog.

The other couples dog bit my girlfriend's hand then lunged at me and our dog and I turned and he bit my ass and left a pretty clear mark. I let go of our dog at this point so I wouldn't be caught in between and they fought, then we managed to get them apart.

We got their information and they send they'd send their dogs vaccine report tomorrow. Do we need to report this somewhere? Can we? I have a big ass bite mark on my ass and my girlfriend has a scratch on her wrist, and we want to make sure this other couple can't ghost us.",houston,Bit by a dog at Buffalo Bayou

ERG's are free and there is an app for it as well. 

I feel texting a doctor for information is misleading and potentially dangerous for the public it incorrect. Use the correct resources when reaching out to the public, especially when it's a hazmat situation. 

Assuming Propylene is the cause of the explosion, this is what would be see in the guide.

POTENTIAL HAZARDS

FIRE OR EXPLOSION

· EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE.

· Will be easily ignited by heat, sparks or flames.

· Will form explosive mixtures with air.

· Vapors from liquefied gas are initially heavier than air and spread along ground.

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise. Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.)

· Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back.

· Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices.

· Containers may explode when heated.

· Ruptured cylinders may rocket.

HEALTH

· Vapors may cause dizziness or asphyxiation without warning.

· Some may be irritating if inhaled at high concentrations.

· Contact with gas or liquefied gas may cause burns, severe injury and/or frostbite.

· Fire may produce irritating and/or toxic gases.

PUBLIC SAFETY

· CALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE Telephone Number on Shipping Paper first. If Shipping Paper not available or no answer, refer to appropriate telephone number listed on the inside back cover.

· As an immediate precautionary measure, isolate spill or leak area for at least 100 meters (330 feet) in all directions.

· Keep unauthorized personnel away.

· Stay upwind, uphill and/or upstream.

· Many gases are heavier than air and will spread along ground and collect in low or confined areas (sewers, basements, tanks).

PROTECTIVE CLOTHING

· Wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).

· Structural firefighters' protective clothing will only provide limited protection.

· Always wear thermal protective clothing when handling refrigerated/cryogenic liquids.

EVACUATION

Large Spill

· Consider initial downwind evacuation for at least 800 meters (1/2 mile).

Fire

· If tank, rail car or tank truck is involved in a fire, ISOLATE for 1600 meters (1 mile) in all directions; also, consider initial evacuation for 1600 meters (1 mile) in all directions.

. In fires involving Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG) (UN1075); Butane, (UN1011); Butylene, (UN1012); Isobutylene, (UN1055); Propylene, (UN1077); Isobutane, (UN1969); and Propane, (UN1978), also refer to BLEVE – SAFETY PRECAUTIONS (Page 368)

￼In Canada, an Emergency Response Assistance Plan (ERAP) may be required for this product. Please consult the shipping document and/or the Canada and United States National Response Centers reference document.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE

FIRE

· DO NOT EXTINGUISH A LEAKING GAS FIRE UNLESS LEAK CAN BE STOPPED.

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957) and Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) burn with an invisible flame. Hydrogen and Methane mixture, compressed (UN2034) may burn with an invisible flame.

Small Fire

· Dry chemical or CO2.

Large Fire

· Water spray or fog.

· Move containers from fire area if you can do it without risk.

Fire involving Tanks

· Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles.

· Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out.

· Do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur.

· Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank.

· ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire.

· For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn.

SPILL OR LEAK

· ELIMINATE all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area).

· All equipment used when handling the product must be grounded.

· Do not touch or walk through spilled material.

· Stop leak if you can do it without risk.

· If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid.

· Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material.

· Do not direct water at spill or source of leak.

· Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas.

· Isolate area until gas has dispersed.

CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning.

FIRST AID

· Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s) involved and take precautions to protect themselves.

· Move victim to fresh air.

· Call 911 or emergency medical service.

· Give artificial respiration if victim is not breathing.

· Administer oxygen if breathing is difficult.

· Remove and isolate contaminated clothing and shoes.

· Clothing frozen to the skin should be thawed before being removed.

· In case of contact with liquefied gas, thaw frosted parts with lukewarm water.

· In case of burns, immediately cool affected skin for as long as possible with cold water. Do not remove clothing if adhering to skin.

· Keep victim calm and warm.

I took a quick trip there earlier this month and had an absolute blast. But didn't get to see much because there's SO MUCH to do! I'll have another trip lined up before the final move. (If you need background, I've been wanting to move out of FL for years. I own my own business, and it's home-based, so I'm not really worried about a commute. If I want to do things I do them during the day when everyone is working.)

**Some of the things I'm curious about are:**

\-What are the police like? Even moving from one city to another in Florida I saw a considerable difference.

\-Where are the best areas to move? Does anyone know a good place to be nearish the city, but also get a 2 bedroom apartment for 1200-1300? Of course I know the nicer more central areas will be more expensive.

\-What is driving like? What are the unwritten rules? (IE where I live the speed limit says 50 but means 80)

\-How dog friendly is the city? Where I live it's super dog friendly, most places even have dog snacks and water bowls readily available.

\-What is the general attitude towards CBD, Marijuana, Kratom, Kava? Are there even any kava spots? (In one city of Florida this is all completely banned, but in another it's heralded, that's why I ask)

\-What is the spiritual community like? I'm talking yoga classes, reiki healers, crystal shops.

\-What is the general crime like? Any areas to DEFINITELY avoid? I'm originally from Jacksonville and it's pretty bad no matter where you live, police never show up when you call, and there's a running joke of, ""don't play with my heart because Jacksonville doesn't solve murders."" I've been looking into apartments and I've seen a lot of google reviews complaining of their cars being broken into, and someone even said they were ambushed at their door thinking it was a delivery person (don't know why you wouldn't check the peep hole first but I won't victim blame), but the apartments all looked really nice and luxurious.

\-I'm also confused, are areas like Katy and Humble still technically Houston? The maps aren't helping me grasp it.

These are just some questions running through my head! Thanks in advance for your help. If it helps I'm 25f moving on my own with my little pup.",houston,What should I know about Houston/Texas in General?

Last year about 1300 students, educators, and parents came out to see the types of work engineers do. The 115 engineers enjoyed talking to them and showing the stuff they do.

This year we have **over 140 engineers lined up**, come join us! The Clear Lake area has an abundance of engineers and this is our way to share with those who don't have the same access. 

* The nuclear engineer does environmental cleanup for a ""real job"", but makes knives as a hobby. He was the winner of an episode of ""Forged in Fire"". He'll talk about his real job, but will also be firing up the forge to show that too.
* Hilti tools will be doing demonstrations of the industrial tools they make.
* Blacklion will have solar panels up to demonstrate converting homes to solar power.
* LivaNova will show the implantable devices they have developed to stop seizures and regulate heart rhythms.
* Boeing will be there, last year they had a VR walkthrough of the ISS and more.

NASA is sending 14 of its engineers from a variety of programs. There will be engineers who train astronauts, work in propulsion (controlled explosions), space tools, and more. There will also be a few retired engineers who were active back in the Apollo days.

LyondellBasell, BP, Chevron, Intuitive Machines, Houston Mechatronics, and more!

We look forward to seeing you there!

I got in the right lane and noticed a ton of cars racing in the left lane on the ramp, I was assuming they needed to head the other way (East) but then noticed there are two lanes from beltway 8 south that goes to 59. And they were battling their way into the front of everyone. 

Who was the genius who decided to make the two lanes merge into 1 on the ramp? the ramp doesn’t require an immediate merge onto 59. Had to wait 20 minutes so everyone could blast past me to cut in line. 

Anyways yesterday I attempted to go to sugar land and it was worse, the backup was creating heavy traffic on beltway 8 due to the amount of people trying to merge into one lane, although there being no traffic on 59 itself. 

Does this ramp purposely create a traffic break on that ramp?

They have reps from Aerospace, Biomedical, Chemical, Environmental Clean-Up, Industrial, Infrastructure (electricity, water, transportation), Oil &amp; Gas, and much more!

There are over 150 engineers signed up from 30+ companies and 7 universities. The universities are sending researchers not recruiters. Come see the cool stuff happening at Rice's biomed department or the Robotics lab from UH-Clear Lake.

There will be demos of tools and equipment, like Hilti Industrial tools and Blacklion Solar Power. Some combine their hobbies in their display, like the nuclear engineer who does environmental clean up but blacksmiths in his spare time who will be bringing and displaying his forge.

It's happening tomorrow (February 1st) from 9am-noon at Clear Lake High School (2929 Bay Area Blvd, Houston, 77058).

1716,1716,gothitgotcharged,1580513802,ewx58v,Nan,"Frustrating story here. It was only a few days since I returned home from the military. My friend and I wanted to hand out, so I picked him up in my vehicle and we went out. We did basic friend stuff, later in the day, I decided to stop by a store to get an item I wanted. I drive into the parking lot of this store and start scanning the lot for available parking spots. As I'm driving through the lot (store front to my left, parking spots to my right), I notice the vehicle behind is riding my ass. I see the frustrated look on the driver. I thought maybe he didn't like that I was driving at parking lot speeds or something, I didn't think much of it, because I found a spot and was about to make a turn anyway. 

Well, I start making a right turn, but in the blink of an eye, the car behind me quickly accelerates and tries to go around my right (driving over the striped lines and handicap spaces in the pavement, mind you). By the time I see his vehicle, it's too late. I'm already mid-turn by the time I feel my vehicle scrape his, I didn't even have time to make an effort to slam the brakes. I honk my horn and pull into a parking space. For a second, I couldn't tell if he was going to come back or not, but sure enough, he did a 180 and zoomed back toward me. He parked beside me, and I could see the anger in his face when he got out of his vehicle. I was worried he would try to get physical with me, which I absolutely did not want. But, I had no choice but to approach him. We calmed down and talked for a bit. He made it clear that he was upset with me, because I was driving too slow in this parking lot. He said he frequently gets frustrated with slow drivers in the area, and that he didn't expect me to make a turn. I told him that if he wanted to pass, he should have gone to the left which is the car lane, not to the right where the parking spaces are. He called the police over, they said a report was not necessary because it happened in a parking lot, so no report was made and the cop left. We took pictures and exchanged insurance information.

After I tried explaining this to people who weren't there, I found that I struggled to adequately describe what happened. This was frustrating, so I made a [little gif](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/WeirdFaintIslandcanary-mobile.mp4) to demonstrate what happened in the incident from the best of my recollection. In this gif, I used the exact same spot where the accident happened at, found on google maps. I'm blue, he's red. Please full screen if you need to, to see the details. Notice how the red car was on my ass the entire time. Take note of the point when he decides to swerve around me and goes over the painted lines and handicap parking spaces in the pavement (he also continues to drive over the empty spots after contact). I wish I had video evidence, but this is the best I can do. The guy said he had dash cam footage, but then said he was having technical issues and couldn't retrieve the footage.

Now, I was annoyed that this happened, but I was pretty confident I was not at fault and my vehicle didn't really have much more than a scratch (his had a huge dent), so I got over it pretty quickly. I did everything right, I was driving properly. I was using my blinkers and looking both ways, as you do when driving a vehicle. It wasn't my fault someone got hot headed and tried to dangerously speed around me. There was nothing more I could do to prevent it. So imagine my surprise when I get a call from his insurance, telling me that I'm at fault. I didn't argue with the guy's insurance over the phone, because I thought my insurance would handle it.

Well, this is where it gets a bit messy. Unbeknownst to me, I was an uninsured driver that day, and I'm only finding out now (a month later). You see, it's not really MY vehicle, it's my grandmother's, and I'm usually a listed driver on her insurance plan. After the accident, I dug out the insurance papers and verified that I was listed and it was up to date. It was, so that's what I gave to the other guy to take photos of. It turns out, my grandmother had gotten a new insurance policy with a new company without me listed. The old insurance was void, despite what the insurance card said. I was driving around uninsured without even knowing it. Two days after the accident, my grandmother adds me on her new insurance, and I report the accident, but it was too late then. So our current insurance denied my claim, and I'm left to fend for myself against a big insurance company ""determining"" that I was at fault for this accident and trying to dig almost $2,000 out of my pockets.

I really don't know what to do. I don't have that kind of money, but even if I did, I wouldn't pay it lmao. Please help.",houston,"Insurance company is charging me almost $2,000 and claiming I was at fault in an auto accident. I strongly disagree and very much so feel like a victim here.

My GMA (age 88) has decided to move to independent living. She has selected and contracted with a facility, and started purging items from her home for the inevitable downsizing that will take place (about half the sqft. A small apartment).

The issue we are running into is.. she is relocating 3 hours north of her current residence. We have someone who can get her packed up on this end, and we have someone who can unpack her on the other end. As well as someone who is going to come and get HER. 

Majority of us involved are not capable of moving some of the items she intends to keep. Back issues,shoulder surgery, impending shoulder surgery. An example of some of the items: Sofa, a heavy specialized recliner, two dressers, entertainment center, 3 tables, and several other boxes (boxes we can manage). 

We are trying to find the most cost efficient way to get this move done, without any of us needing surgery or rehab afterwards. The last quote we saw for the move was close to $3,000.00 because of the distance and time it would take to drive her stuff up there.

3k is a lot of money. Even if we pitch in, and most of us are on a tight budget as well. So... as this is one of those things we all go through eventually, I'm asking for advice or insight on what other option may be available to assist us with the move.",houston,Advice on Moving Elderly Relative

Here are some things I think will help:

* Wash your hands (prevents flu &amp; reduces load on healthcare too)
* Follow the [CDC's general current guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/what-you-should-do.html):
 * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
 * Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
 * Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
 * Stay home when you are sick.
 * Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
 * Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
 * If you feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, and have traveled to China or were in close contact with someone with 2019-nCoV in the 14 days before you began to feel sick, seek medical care. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.

I am also planning to contact my representatives.  I am concerned and personally believe this situation should be taken seriously, so I want my representatives to know.  Here are some ways you can contact your reps:

**Houston:**

the UN? NGOs? Charities? MSF? Red Cross? PeaceCorps? Big &amp; Philanthropic Companies? Maybe [Matress Mack](https://www.galleryfurniture.com/community-outreach.html) would help, perhaps by helping fund equipment for hospital staff or sanitation supplies for the public?  Would appreciate suggestions.

Some precautions that I think should be taken:

* Make sure health care workers are prepared and protected
* Increase health care capacity for treating this disease
* Public health campaign to reduce potential transmission rate.  Everyone can wash their hands more. (will help with other illnesses anyway)  Suggesting #washyourhands

Over the last few years I've also provided love, life, and relationship coaching to help everyone live their most passionate lives. I have a wealth of experience with clients of all ages, orientations, religions, and backgrounds, but I would love to extend my reach even further!

I'm posting here because I want to offer you all a FREE discovery call with me, to talk about your goals and issues and see if we're a good fit for relationship coaching.

I also offer date planning services to give you and your beloved a uniquely meaningful night out - whether that means a birthday, anniversary, Valentine's Day, or just your weekly date nights!

She’s here and ready to field questions about the pioneering work being done at the Houston Forensic Science Center. The lab has had a hand in exonerating the wrongfully-convicted, helping police investigators get criminals off the street, and bringing justice to victims from across the Houston area.

Professor Thompson will be back at HMNS on Tuesday, Feb. 11, for a special evening lecture explaining how our hometown lab has transformed to be the only forensic laboratory in the world where analysts can go to court armed with the statistical data to prove the scientific validity of the analyses they perform.

A few pros and cons: 

The view is incredible and it has direct access to buffalo bayou park. I have 2 kids, 7 and 9, who will love the park. Decent amenities package but not as good as newer buildings. 

I might be wasting my money here. I'm not a huge outdoors person, don't own a dog, work long hours. I'll really only use these things on the weekend. Also, they are in the middle of a renovation that won't be finished for a year. The lobby will be out for six months and my balcony will be out for probably 2 months. 

However, I'm getting historically low rent for this unit, probably due to the construction, which management has committed to not raise more than 3% per year. 

I also hear that a lot of people love love this place and stay for many years. 

I think for my money, I could stay someplace much nicer too. Downtown and Midtown are out for me. Galleria area is nice, but not super family friendly. Is this my best option for a family-friendly high rise?",houston,Opinions on Memorial by Windsor for a first-time high-rise tenant?

He tried to kick down my back door, failed, and then snuck into a window. He got inside, started drinking some alcohol he found, then rifled through my stuff.

I showed up. I walked in. I grabbed my gun. I went upstairs and by the time I got it all together he had bolted outside the back door. He runs to my car and as I walk outside he is trying to steal my bag out of it. No worries. He ducks down when I point my gun at him and takes off. Sort of. He spends a solid few minutes shouting at me from a distance telling me he is going to come back and kill me and steal more of my stuff.

Well, I walked with him a while until HPD showed up. This is the one where I got wrongfully arrested because, well, making sure a guy that said he would come back and kill you gets arrested is threatening. The judge gave him a PO bond, so he was out next month anyways. That's why the case took so long. He no-showed the court. Not a problem. They picked him up for meth about a year later.

Today this case is going to finally come to an end. The DA called me and notified me that he wasn't charging him with burglary, but rather trespassing. Why? Well, one of the witnesses said they didn't think he had stolen anything on his way out. He didn't think a jury would believe beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to steal anything. Telling me point blank doesn't count. Being inside my home rifling through my stuff... he could be doing anything!

 The 2020 Houston Rodeo lineup is now complete, with Lizzo, Chance the Rapper and Marshmello filling previously-unannounced headlining spots.

The annual event, which is set to run March 3-22 at NRG Stadium, unveiled its partial lineup last month but omitted its three Friday-night headliners. However, organizers did tease their respective genres to generate buzz. This marks the first time all three headliners will play the Texas gathering. They join the likes of country giants Brad Paisley, Luke Bryan, Keith Urban, Maren Morris and Willie Nelson, among others. Also slated to appear are first-timers Gwen Stefani, Khalid, Becky G, Ramon Ayala and NCT 127, who will be the first K-pop group to play the event.

“The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is proud to bring such a wide range of musical genres to the RODEOHOUSTON stage,” Rodeo president Joel Cowley said in a [**statement**](https://www.rodeohouston.com/News/Article/ArtMID/494/ArticleID/2632/2020-RODEOHOUSTON-Entertainer-Lineup) upon the initial lineup announcement. “With 12 great country acts, we remain true to our roots while[(read more...)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/02/houston-rodeo-lineup-lizzo-chance-the-rapper/)",houston,"Houston Rodeo Adds Lizzo, Chance the Rapper to Lineup"

So, this is my attempt at a detailed guide to finding an apartment in Houston. 

**1) Where/How to Search**

Online Resources: [Apartment List](https://www.apartmentlist.com/tx/houston), [Apartment Guide](https://www.apartmentguide.com/apartments/Texas/Houston/), [Rent.com](https://www.rent.com/texas/houston-apartments), [Hot Pads](https://hotpads.com/houston-tx/apartments-for-rent), [Apartment Data](https://www.apartmentdata.com/EXERequest/ADC_ShowTop.asp?CLEAROPTIONS=Y&amp;VIP=000), [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/houston-tx/apartments/), and [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/for_rent/Houston,TX/) to name a few. [Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com/houston-tx/), [Apartment Finder](https://www.apartmentfinder.com/Texas/Houston-Apartments), and [For Rent](https://www.forrent.com/find/TX/metro-Houston/Houston) are all the owned by same company. [HAR Rentals](https://www.har.com/apartments/) has improved for apartments as well. Searching on a computer or tablet is much easier with map features than on mobile. All of these big sites are going to be very similar with their data, but may have differences with filters or their user experience.  

If price or availability are not listed on these major websites or their own you may need to call or visit. Leaving voicemails, sending emails, or inputting your information on their websites are hit or miss with getting prompt responses. 

Other Resources: Craigslist – apt/housing- [map view](https://houston.craigslist.org/d/apts-housing-for-rent/search/apa) allows you to filter out floor plans and search certain areas, NextDoor can be useful, but you have to verify your address in the neighborhood to search, and Facebook Marketplace now has a Rentals section as well.

Hidden Gems: Driving the areas you like and looking for “For Rent” signs can work well in higher density inner loop areas like the Heights or Montrose for smaller complexes and garage apartments. These units are usually vacant and available for immediate move-in.

Apartment locators: They can be knowledgeable about areas and complexes to give advice and may have additional resources for searching and filtering. They can take out a lot of the legwork to find exact floor plans, pricing, availability, pet policies, upfront costs, ongoing costs, etc. Not all communities work with locators or pay low commissions, so you may not get all of the options working with one. Some locators will only send options that pay the higher commissions (ex: +100% one month’s rent). Some locators won't work with clients under a certain budget (ex: $1,000/mo minimum). For the ones that do pay locators, they are compensated a percentage of rent or a flat fee by the apartment complex and their services are typically free to their clients, especially in the Houston market. Some offer kickbacks to their clients for places with high-paying locator fees.

Relocating: Signing a lease sight unseen can be daunting. If you have time to visit before your move around a month or so beforehand, it will probably be worth it. If you don't have time to or can't visit it might be a good idea to get a hotel, Airbnb, or similar temporary living for a week or two while you find a permanent residence. There are some shared spaces as cheap as $15-20/night. It may not be ideal, but it's temporary and beats being committed to an unfavorable long term lease situation. Some locators may offer live or recorded video tours for out-of-towners.

**2)** **When to look**

Timing: Most apartments require a 30-60 day notice to vacate for current tenants, so availability usually doesn’t show up until a month or two beforehand. A lot of the lowest advertised prices are for units Available Now. If a unit or several have been sitting and the occupancy drops below 90-95%, they’ll usually start lowering prices or offering incentives. Some complexes will let you hold units for up to 30 days, but others can increase the price drastically for pushing the move-in date back even a few days. It all depends on the property management company and complex. If your move-in date isn't for a month or two, you can ask the leasing agent to send you a notice when a unit becomes available. You may find property managers/leasing agents to be inconsistent with following up, so might take you checking back in periodically or looking online again to see if anything is available. Having a flexible move-in date helps a lot when searching. I would recommend having at least a few days if not a whole week cushion between the start of a new lease and end of your current one to give you time to move or for unforeseen circumstances like inclement weather.

Best times: Prices historically go up in the summer compared to the rest of the year since it is the most common time for people moving.

Pre-leasing: They don't have this in Houston for most apartments like some college towns/campuses where students rent starting in August/September for the year.

**3) Types of apartments, leases, units, and amenities**

Apartments: Most newer complexes are going to be what's considered a mid-rise apartments ranging from 3-8 stories. Building code only allows wooden structures to be 4 stories tall so that is most common. A lot of the older complexes that are 2 stories and there are a handful of high rises in places like downtown and uptown.

Lease Terms: Most long term leases are 12 months, sometimes with better pricing at 13-15 months. The longest I've come across is an 18 month lease.

Units: Efficiencies are typically less than 500 sq ft with a smaller kitchen area compared to Studios which are usually a bit larger at 500-600 sq ft. 1 and 2 bedroom units yield the highest cost per sq ft for complexes, so naturally those are the most common floor plans. 3 bedrooms are somewhat common, but are not at every complex. For what pricing is on 3 bedroom units, it might make more since to search for a rental home, which the best resource will be [HAR.com](https://www.har.com/rentals) and/or using a realtor. There aren't many traditional loft style units in Houston that were converted from existing construction. A ""soft loft"" tries to emulate some of those features like brick/concrete walls or exposed duct work. Town home floor plans are available at a handful communities that come with a private garage.

Amenities: Most of the above resources will allow you to filter apartments for amenities like in-unit washer/dryer, pool, fitness center, wood floors, pet friendly, etc. Private garages and private yards aren't very common features, but there are some out there. Units with a den/study aren't as common either.

**4) Floor plans**

Most apartment websites should have floor plans available online. They will either have fancy made up names for the floor plans, a system where A means one bedroom and B means 2 bedrooms, or just use the square footage. For the A/B system they attach numbers with these starting with this smallest square footage (ex: A4 would be their mid-sized 1 bedroom). Leasing agents will tell you these as if you have them memorized like they do. Square footage isn't everything if it's an awkward shaped unit. Be sure to know the location of the exact unit you're looking to lease. There might be a reason certain units are less expensive, like if it has a bad view or say faces nearby train tracks. Older complexes may update certain units with things like newer appliances or back splash as tenants move out and call the older units they haven't updated their ""classic"" look, which typically has a lower rent price.

**5) Costs involved**

Costs: You can expect to pay an application fee, administrative fee, security deposit, first month's rent, and applicable pet fees(more details below). Most property managers and leasing agents have set corporate pricing so there’s not a lot of wiggle room to negotiate. It can't hurt to ask for a discount, but you may only find this works at smaller owner operated apartments. You might have better luck asking for concessions on the up front costs.

Concessions: For app/admin a lot of companies do what’s called a “Look and Lease” special where they’ll waive or reduce those cost if you sign within 24-48 hours. Don’t rush into if you’re not sure or not ready. Deposits can be waived or reduced with approved credit in many instances. A lot also give options for refundable or non-refundable deposits. Some offer other incentives such as gift cards, total move-in cost that include all fees and first month's rent, discounts on the first month's rent, free rent until a certain date, free month(s) up front, and free month(s) pro-rated over the course of the lease.

Market Rent: Be aware with incentives like prorated free month(s) that your rent will be set to increase to the market rent at the end of your lease term. Renewing your lease for another long term might allow you to negotiate and is typically a lower cost compared to month-to-month market rent. They plan on your willingness to pay a higher rent instead of going through the trouble of moving.

Additional monthly costs: Many places have an additional $20-40 in monthly cost for things like pest control, (valet) trash, amenity fees, etc. that are added to the advertised rent. Be sure to ask about these and factor it into your budget.

Pet Fees: Be prepared to pay a non-refundable pet fee, pet deposit, and monthly pet rent (per pet) at a large majority of apartment complexes. Most complexes have a limit of 2-3 pets.  If you’re new to apartment living you might get sticker shock from how high these charges can be at some places. Factor it into your budget.

Expectations: Don't have crazy, unrealistic expectations. If you think you're going to find a 2 bedroom apartment in downtown Houston with wood floors, stainless steel appliances, granite counter tops, and an in unit washer dryer for $1,000/mo you're going to have a bad time. Research [median rent prices](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/tx/houston/) for the neighborhoods/areas you'd like to live and realize that additional amenities means higher costs.

**6) Reddit’s 42 Rules for Apartment Searching/Touring**

[This LPT post is 5 years old, but most everything holds true](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2rwneo/lpt_request_when_apartment_searching_what_are/) and a lot of the same info is sprinkled throughout this post. Please remember to bring a government issued ID when touring.

**7) Safety**

I HIGHLY recommend driving the area you plan on living, especially at night.

Crime reports resource: [HPD](https://www.houstontx.gov/police/cs/Recent_Crime_Map_hosted_by_CrimeReports.htm) links you to [City Protect](https://www.cityprotect.com/) (previously branded as Crime Reports) is pretty clunky IMO.

I think the [Lexis Nexis Community Crime Map](https://communitycrimemap.com/) is much easier to search.

Security features to look for: Secure entrances and exits, good lighting, security cameras, security features in each apartment, on-call or 24-hour security guard. These do not guarantee there will not be any crime, but can serve as a deterrent.  

In-unit security/safety features: Texas law requires that rental dwellings have certain security devices. For example, exterior doors must generally have a doorknob lock or a keyed deadbolt, a keyless lock, and a peephole. Sliding glass doors must have a pin lock and a security bar or door handle latch. All rental dwellings must have smoke alarms installed by the owner. Hearing-impaired residents may also request installation of visual smoke alarms. 

Alarm systems: If you do opt to get one for your apartment, there are plenty of DIY options available that are easy to setup. If your system is monitored and you’re in HPD's jurisdiction, do not forget that you are required to get an [alarm permit](https://www.houstonburglaralarmpermits.org/Citizen/City/Houston/ATB_Login.aspx) from the city that is $50/year and allows for 3 false alarms before they start fining you. Penalties for not having a permit with a false alarm are pricey and the police may not even respond to an alarm call if it is not registered and permitted. You can call to confirm your address is in the jurisdiction. Here is the one for [Harris County](https://www.hcsoalarmpermit.com/) that's $35/year with 3 false alarms too. Your apartment complex will more than likely require that they have the code if they need to access the apartment for maintenance or inspections.

**8) Flooding**

Resources: [City of Houston](https://cohegis.houstontx.gov/cohgisweb/houstonmapviewer/) (need to add flood hazard layer), [Harris County](https://www.harriscountyfemt.org/), [FEMA](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search).

Articles from Harvey:  [Biz Journals](https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2017/10/06/study-harvey-damaged-42-000-apartments-in-houston.html),  [Chron](https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/houston-apartments-damaged-hurricane-harvey-12270464.php) (sorry, sorry I hate their slideshows too), [Reddit post trying to compile list of places that did/didn't flood](https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/6zn60c/comprehensive_list_of_apartments_that_got_flooded/)

Most Flooded Areas (based on reported info in articles):

1. Spring/Tomball (3,070 units)- 21%
2. Cypress/Waller (1,228 units)- 18.4%
3. Humble/Kingwood (2,848 units)- 17.8%
4. Friendswood/Pearland (2,368 units)- 15.8%
5. Far West (4,754 units)- 15.4%
6. Greater Heights/Washington Ave (2,022 units)- 14.8%
7. Galleria/Uptown-(3,244 units) 13.9%
8. North Central (3,048 units)- 12.9%
9. Pasadena/Southeast (2,967 units)- 10.9%
10. Alief (1,953 units)- 9.9%

Others: Gulfton/Westbury (2,910 units) 9%, Downtown/Motrose/River Oaks (1,382 units)- 7%, Bear Creek/Katy (1,993 units)- 6%, Clear Lake (1,418 units)-5%, Conroe (624 units)- 4%, Spring Branch (780 units)- 4%, Sugar land/Stafford (615 units)- 4%, East Inner Loop (512 units)- 4%, Rosenberg/Richmond (369 units)- 4%, Sharpstown (717 units)- 2%

From a [KHOU Article](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/how-to-find-out-if-a-rental-property-flooded/285-495876568): Howard Bookstaff, General Counsel for the Houston Apartment Association, says landlords are not required to disclose that information to potential tenants.

“There’s no law that requires an apartment complex to notify you voluntarily whether an apartment flooded, but certainly you can ask questions,” he said.

[Chron Editorial](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/With-renters-at-risk-Houston-must-require-12920686.php) calling for a change to this to inform renter's of flooding.  [House Bill 993](https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/HB993/2019) was written for this, but unfortunately died in committee in the middle of 2019.

Be more cautious for apartments near bayous/bodies of water and in the flood plains. Pay attention to musty smells when touring and look for signs of mold. Ask lots of questions. You can opt for units on higher floors as a precaution for flood prone areas and it's in your best interest to have renter's insurance. See Renter's Right below if you find mold in your current residence.

**9) Driving to work**

Native Houstonians know this like humidity: you want to live as close to where you work as possible and avoid traffic.

Resources: [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) (desktop only): click directions, enter the apartment address and your work address, the default is “Leave now” that you can change to “Depart at” or “Arrive by.” Can also be used for walking, biking, and bus routes with a “Last available” option. [HAR Drive time](https://www.har.com/drivetimesearch/) will give you a radius of houses for sale that you can use the same area to search for apartments.

Other transportation resources: [Metro Rail](https://www.ridemetro.org/Pages/Rail.aspx), [Metro Bus](https://www.ridemetro.org/Pages/BusSched.aspx), [Park and Ride](https://www.ridemetro.org/Pages/BusSched.aspx#) , [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/TX/Houston)

**10) Apartment Reviews**

Google Maps, [Apartment Ratings](https://www.apartmentratings.com/), and Yelp. Apartment Guide has them, but seem to be inconsistent.

I’d take all of these with a grain of salt and make sure to sort by recent reviews. One thing to look for is changes in property management. Apartment complexes are bought and sold regularly, which can be for better or worse. They often change names when they switch hands if there was a bad reputation. 

**11) Application**

Here is a [standard application form](https://www.taa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-TAA-Rental-Application-For-Website.pdf). A lot of places will have online applications like Blue Moon Forms that require similar information. Should have your ID of course. Have your previous addresses and landlord information ready. Some ask for personal references and always emergency contact information. Know the make/model and color of your vehicle along with the license plate number. There is typically rental history, credit, and background check. Income requirements can range, but is usually at least x2-3 monthly rent. They may ask for tax documents, bank statements, pay stubs, or an offer letters as proof of income. Be ready for app fees from $25-75/applicant which are usually charged up front. Other fees like administrative and deposits might be due up front or on move-in day. Most places have modernized to accept credit cards, but some still require personal checks, cashier’s checks, or money orders. If you don’t have a check book, a lot of banks will print a sheet of them for you for free or a small cost. Approval usually take 24-72 hours to process. In the meantime, ask to review the lease.

**12) Signing a lease**

**READ IT!** Here’s a [standard lease](https://www.taa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-Apartment-Lease-Contract-September-2019-for-Website.pdf). Know what you’re responsible for, how to request repairs and how long they take, understand any fees or policies, community rules, guest rules and parking, pet policies, know what utilities are included or that you’re responsible for, if you can paint the walls, policies on maintenance and rules on them entering your unit, when is rent due, if you can pay online, late fees, renewal policies, subletting policies, lease termination policies, etc.

For units that are currently available, do a final walk through and document any damages with the landlord/property manager. If repairs are needed make sure it is written into your lease and request that the repairs will be made before you move in. Take lots of photos.

Ask for a copy to be scanned and emailed to you along with a hard copy for your records.

Renewals: Apartments will typically reach out to you well before your lease ends to renew for another long term. If you plan on moving, your lease should have information on how much notice is required to vacate, normally 30-60 days. Renewals often see an increase in price, but could stay the same. Review the renewal and decide if you want to stay. If you fail to renew or give notice to vacate, you will more than likely move to month-to-month terms which can be an increase in rent price as well. Even in a month-to-month, you are still required to give the notice to vacate listed in your lease.

**13) Moving in/Utilities**

Find out when/how you get your keys and/or fobs. Get any necessary access codes. Some complexes provide an [inventory and condition form](http://www.rentalmgmt.com/app/public/uploads/2843_TAA%20Inventory%20and%20Condition%20Form.pdf). You might have a grace period of a few days to fill this out once you get your keys. Don’t put this off or forget about it or it may cost you substantially when it comes to getting your deposit back. Again, take lots of photos. Request any repairs immediately.

Do a change of address through the [USPS](https://moversguide.usps.com/mgo/disclaimer?referral=UMOVE).

Learn the fire escape routes from your unit. It could save your life. [Have an exit strategy](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/fire/exit.html).

Renter’s insurance: call your auto insurance first and see what it looks like to add that to your policy. If not or if you want additional quotes, search online and should be able to find policies that are $15-25/mo. More places are starting to require this and costs are fairly low for the amount of coverage.  [Texas Department of Insurance info](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb043.html) and [Home Inventory Checklist](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb086.pdf)

Water/Sewage/Trash: this is almost always factored into rent or sub-metered as an additional monthly cost. If not here’s the link to [Houston Water](https://www.houstonwaterbills.houstontx.gov/ProdDP/Default/Default).

Gas: most apartments are going to be all electric, which I’d assume is for safety and insurance reasons. If need to get it setup, here’s the link for [Centerpointe Gas](https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/residential/customer-service/start-stop-transfer-service?sa=ho).

Electricity: Houston is deregulated, meaning the grid is owned and ran by Centerpointe, but you are allowed to choose your retail provider. [Power to Choose](http://powertochoose.org/) will allow you to put in your zip code for providers. Most apartments will probably be better suited with usage plans that have better pricing at 500kwh or 1,000kwh as opposed to 2,000kwh. If you have a 12 month lease, it’ll probably be easier to select a 12 month plan. There will be 3-6 month plans with lower pricing, but be aware if you don’t switch or get a new plan at the end of the term, you’re prices will typically jump up. It's a market so prices could go up or down. I prefer to just have it set up and forget about it, but that’s your call. **READ THE FACT SHEET** and know what you’re signing up for. There's a lot of gimmicky plans or ones with crazy fees. Centerpointe also has [My True Cost](https://centerpointenergy.secure.force.com/) that factors in delivery fees and usage. Search other posts in this sub about electricity prices for more input on this topic. Property managers should be able to give you a rough idea of usage from other tenants. Plan on higher costs for summer months. This is Houston.

Cable/Internet: You might be stuck with whoever the apartment or area has with Comcast or AT&amp;T. Ask beforehand who the providers are and try to get pricing. This will all depend on location for what’s available. Try and get this scheduled at least a week or two before move-in since there usually isn't next day appointments. Be ready for a 4 hour windows for technician arrival. You might hate these companies as much as everyone else, but please be kind to your technician. My little brother worked as one a few years back. They are on overbooked, tight schedules and get a lot of pressure from their management.

Movers: This one is tough. I’ve personally used one of the higher rated companies and had a mediocre experience. I’d still say to check Google and Yelp reviews or try to find a referral from someone. I’m not going to vouch for any of them. Just be careful not to get nickel and dimed for extra hours, additional wrapping/padding, bullied for a big tip, etc. My biggest piece of advice is to always get the FIRST appointment in the morning so you’re not waiting around if they take too long on previous jobs. Have heard countless horror stories about movers, so do your research and pray you have a good experience.

Moving boxes: Try hitting up the [Free section](https://houston.craigslist.org/d/free-stuff/search/zip) of Craigslist or stop by places like liquor stores and see if they have extras they’re throwing out.  If you’re moving yourself I highly recommend investing in 2 furniture dollies like [this](https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/b737342d-96af-48b8-b70d-8bf568affd0f/svn/milwaukee-dollies-33700-64_1000.jpg) and your move will go a hell of a lot smoother. Make sure the elevator is working before you move in if there is one.

**14) “Aggressive” Breed Restrictions**

Many of the larger property management companies have restrictions on weight limits and a list of dog breeds they consider aggressive. Emotional Support Animals are covered under the [ADA](https://adata.org/guide/service-animals-and-emotional-support-animals) and [Fair Housing](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/assistance_animals). Because of these rules, apartments typically cannot reject certified Emotional Support dogs based on their breed. You are still responsible for any damages your pet causes. Search Emotional Support Animal Certificate Texas if you would like to research this further. Use this information how you will.

**15) Felonies, misdemeanors, evictions, broken leases, bad credit, low income**

There are apartments out there that accept these, but might be tougher to search or filter on the websites listed above on exact policies for each complex. Most private/smaller communities will still conduct background, rental history, and credit checks, but might be more lenient than places with corporate policies set in place. There are some resources out there for companies that help with “Second Chance” leases, but be aware that it can be pricey as they require fees and deposits since they are essentially co-signing on the apartment. Criminal records are often case by case, after a certain period, and have a tendency to be more accepting of non-violent offenses. [Here is an article that might be more helpful](https://www.houstoncasemanagers.com/housing-for-felons-in-houston/). Broken leases or evictions often require it be after a certain period, under a certain amount, and/or paid off and may also require higher deposits. Bad credit may require a cosigner, higher deposit, or a certain amount of months paid up front. [Houston Housing Authority](http://www.housingforhouston.com/) is a resource for low income housing options. 

**16) Renter’s Rights**

Resources: [Attorney General](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/home-real-estate-and-travel/renters-rights), [City of Houston](https://houstontx.gov/housing/tenant_law_intro.html), [Request to make repairs sample form](https://www.texastenant.org/pdf_files/1034_Demand_Letter_Repair.pdf), [Texas Law Help](https://texaslawhelp.org/article/right-repairs-tenant), [Houston Apartment Association](https://www.haaonline.org/renters/), [Texas Apartment Association](https://www.taa.org/renters/). Calling 311 can also help if you need to report to the city any type of building or health code violations. If it comes to you suing an apartment complex, it will likely be through [Small Claims Court](http://www.jp.hctx.net/civil/default.htm). You can pursue this on your own or with the help of a lawyer. 

**17) Student/Senior housing**

I’m honestly not too familiar with these. For students, your university websites should have more information to be able to guide for on-campus living. Off-campus should be able to use the rest of this guide. For Seniors, some of the apartment websites above have options to filter for senior living and there are companies and websites geared toward this specifically.

**18) Short term/Furnished/Corporate housing**

Most advertised pricing for apartment complexes are for long term leases of +12 months. Complexes want to stagger when leases come up so they aren’t all in the same month. You might get lucky with pricing on a 3-6 month lease, but typically you’re looking at a huge increase in price. Companies may rent a block of apartments at a complex and rent out as corporate housing and there are companies in Houston that specialize in this you can easily find on Google. These are typically pricey as well. Some of the websites listed above have filters to search for apartments that have corporate housing, but may only list prices for long term leases and require you to call for pricing. Also check out extended stay hotels and websites like Airbnb, VRBO, or HomeAway and look for places that offer discount for stays over a month. Craigslist also has a [sublet/temporary section](https://houston.craigslist.org/d/sublets-temporary/search/sub) along with searching Facebook Marketplace Rentals.

So, this is my attempt at a detailed guide to finding an apartment in Houston.

**1) Where/How to Search**

Online Resources: [Apartment List](https://www.apartmentlist.com/tx/houston), [Apartment Guide](https://www.apartmentguide.com/apartments/Texas/Houston/), [Rent.com](https://www.rent.com/texas/houston-apartments), [Hot Pads](https://hotpads.com/houston-tx/apartments-for-rent), [Apartment Data](https://www.apartmentdata.com/EXERequest/ADC_ShowTop.asp?CLEAROPTIONS=Y&amp;VIP=000), [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/houston-tx/apartments/), and [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/for_rent/Houston,TX/) to name a few. [Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com/houston-tx/), [Apartment Finder](https://www.apartmentfinder.com/Texas/Houston-Apartments), and [For Rent](https://www.forrent.com/find/TX/metro-Houston/Houston) are all the owned by same company. [HAR Rentals](https://www.har.com/apartments/) has improved for apartments as well. Searching on a computer or tablet is much easier with map features than on mobile. All of these big sites are going to be very similar with their data, but may have differences with filters or their user experience.

If price or availability are not listed on these major websites or their own you may need to call or visit. Leaving voicemails, sending emails, or inputting your information on their websites are hit or miss with getting prompt responses.

Other Resources: Craigslist – apt/housing- [map view](https://houston.craigslist.org/d/apts-housing-for-rent/search/apa) allows you to filter out floor plans and search certain areas, NextDoor can be useful, but you have to verify your address in the neighborhood to search, and Facebook Marketplace now has a Rentals section as well.

Hidden Gems: Driving the areas you like and looking for “For Rent” signs can work well in higher density inner loop areas like the Heights or Montrose for smaller complexes and garage apartments. These units are usually vacant and available for immediate move-in.

Apartment locators: They can be knowledgeable about areas and complexes to give advice and may have additional resources for searching and filtering. They can take out a lot of the legwork to find exact floor plans, pricing, availability, pet policies, upfront costs, ongoing costs, etc. Not all communities work with locators or pay low commissions, so you may not get all of the options working with one. Some locators will only send options that pay the higher commissions (ex: +100% one month’s rent). Some locators won't work with clients under a certain budget (ex: $1,000/mo minimum). For the ones that do pay locators, they are compensated a percentage of rent or a flat fee by the apartment complex and their services are typically free to their clients, especially in the Houston market. Some offer kickbacks to their clients for places with high-paying locator fees.

Relocating: Signing a lease sight unseen can be daunting. If you have time to visit before your move around a month or so beforehand, it will probably be worth it. If you don't have time to or can't visit it might be a good idea to get a hotel, Airbnb, or similar temporary living for a week or two while you find a permanent residence. There are some shared spaces as cheap as $15-20/night. It may not be ideal, but it's temporary and beats being committed to an unfavorable long term lease situation. Some locators may offer live or recorded video tours for out-of-towners.

**2)** **When to look**

Timing: Most apartments require a 30-60 day notice to vacate for current tenants, so availability usually doesn’t show up until a month or two beforehand. A lot of the lowest advertised prices are for units Available Now. If a unit or several have been sitting and the occupancy drops below 90-95%, they’ll usually start lowering prices or offering incentives. Some complexes will let you hold units for up to 30 days, but others can increase the price drastically for pushing the move-in date back even a few days. It all depends on the property management company and complex. If your move-in date isn't for a month or two, you can ask the leasing agent to send you a notice when a unit becomes available. You may find property managers/leasing agents to be inconsistent with following up, so might take you checking back in periodically or looking online again to see if anything is available. Having a flexible move-in date helps a lot when searching. I would recommend having at least a few days if not a whole week cushion between the start of a new lease and end of your current one to give you time to move or for unforeseen circumstances like inclement weather.

Best times: Prices historically go up in the summer compared to the rest of the year since it is the most common time for people moving.

Pre-leasing: They don't have this in Houston for most apartments like some college towns/campuses where students rent starting in August/September for the year.

**3) Types of apartments, leases, units, and amenities**

Apartments: Most newer complexes are going to be what's considered a mid-rise apartments ranging from 3-8 stories. Building code only allows wooden structures to be 4 stories tall so that is most common. A lot of the older complexes that are 2 stories and there are a handful of high rises in places like downtown and uptown.

Lease Terms: Most long term leases are 12 months, sometimes with better pricing at 13-15 months. The longest I've come across is an 18 month lease.

Units: Efficiencies are typically less than 500 sq ft with a smaller kitchen area compared to Studios which are usually a bit larger at 500-600 sq ft. 1 and 2 bedroom units yield the highest cost per sq ft for complexes, so naturally those are the most common floor plans. 3 bedrooms are somewhat common, but are not at every complex. For what pricing is on 3 bedroom units, it might make more since to search for a rental home, which the best resource will be [HAR.com](https://www.har.com/rentals) and/or using a realtor. There aren't many traditional loft style units in Houston that were converted from existing construction. A ""soft loft"" tries to emulate some of those features like brick/concrete walls or exposed duct work. Town home floor plans are available at a handful communities that come with a private garage.

Amenities: Most of the above resources will allow you to filter apartments for amenities like in-unit washer/dryer, pool, fitness center, wood floors, pet friendly, etc. Private garages and private yards aren't very common features, but there are some out there. Units with a den/study aren't as common either.

**4) Floor plans**

Most apartment websites should have floor plans available online. They will either have fancy made up names for the floor plans, a system where A means one bedroom and B means 2 bedrooms, or just use the square footage. For the A/B system they attach numbers with these starting with this smallest square footage (ex: A4 would be their mid-sized 1 bedroom). Leasing agents will tell you these as if you have them memorized like they do. Square footage isn't everything if it's an awkward shaped unit. Be sure to know the location of the exact unit you're looking to lease. There might be a reason certain units are less expensive, like if it has a bad view or say faces nearby train tracks. Older complexes may update certain units with things like newer appliances or back splash as tenants move out and call the older units they haven't updated their ""classic"" look, which typically has a lower rent price.

**5) Costs involved**

Costs: You can expect to pay an application fee, administrative fee, security deposit, first month's rent, and applicable pet fees(more details below). Most property managers and leasing agents have set corporate pricing so there’s not a lot of wiggle room to negotiate. It can't hurt to ask for a discount, but you may only find this works at smaller owner operated apartments. You might have better luck asking for concessions on the up front costs.

Concessions: For app/admin a lot of companies do what’s called a “Look and Lease” special where they’ll waive or reduce those cost if you sign within 24-48 hours. Don’t rush into if you’re not sure or not ready. Deposits can be waived or reduced with approved credit in many instances. A lot also give options for refundable or non-refundable deposits. Some offer other incentives such as gift cards, total move-in cost that include all fees and first month's rent, discounts on the first month's rent, free rent until a certain date, free month(s) up front, and free month(s) pro-rated over the course of the lease.

Market Rent: Be aware with incentives like prorated free month(s) that your rent will be set to increase to the market rent at the end of your lease term. Renewing your lease for another long term might allow you to negotiate and is typically a lower cost compared to month-to-month market rent. They plan on your willingness to pay a higher rent instead of going through the trouble of moving.

Additional monthly costs: Many places have an additional $20-40 in monthly cost for things like pest control, (valet) trash, amenity fees, etc. that are added to the advertised rent. Be sure to ask about these and factor it into your budget.

Pet Fees: Be prepared to pay a non-refundable pet fee, pet deposit, and monthly pet rent (per pet) at a large majority of apartment complexes. Most complexes have a limit of 2-3 pets.  If you’re new to apartment living you might get sticker shock from how high these charges can be at some places. Factor it into your budget.

Expectations: Don't have crazy, unrealistic expectations. If you think you're going to find a 2 bedroom apartment in downtown Houston with wood floors, stainless steel appliances, granite counter tops, and an in unit washer dryer for $1,000/mo you're going to have a bad time. Research [median rent prices](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/tx/houston/) for the neighborhoods/areas you'd like to live and realize that additional amenities means higher costs.

**6) Reddit’s 42 Rules for Apartment Searching/Touring**

[This LPT post is 5 years old, but most everything holds true](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2rwneo/lpt_request_when_apartment_searching_what_are/) and a lot of the same info is sprinkled throughout this post. Please remember to bring a government issued ID when touring.

**7) Safety**

I HIGHLY recommend driving the area you plan on living, especially at night.

Crime reports resource: [HPD](https://www.houstontx.gov/police/cs/Recent_Crime_Map_hosted_by_CrimeReports.htm) links you to [City Protect](https://www.cityprotect.com/) (previously branded as Crime Reports) is pretty clunky IMO.

I think the [Lexis Nexis Community Crime Map](https://communitycrimemap.com/) is much easier to search.

Security features to look for: Secure entrances and exits, good lighting, security cameras, security features in each apartment, on-call or 24-hour security guard. These do not guarantee there will not be any crime, but can serve as a deterrent.

In-unit security/safety features: Texas law requires that rental dwellings have certain security devices. For example, exterior doors must generally have a doorknob lock or a keyed deadbolt, a keyless lock, and a peephole. Sliding glass doors must have a pin lock and a security bar or door handle latch. All rental dwellings must have smoke alarms installed by the owner. Hearing-impaired residents may also request installation of visual smoke alarms.

Alarm systems: If you do opt to get one for your apartment, there are plenty of DIY options available that are easy to setup. If your system is monitored and you’re in HPD's jurisdiction, do not forget that you are required to get an [alarm permit](https://www.houstonburglaralarmpermits.org/Citizen/City/Houston/ATB_Login.aspx) from the city that is $50/year and allows for 3 false alarms before they start fining you. Penalties for not having a permit with a false alarm are pricey and the police may not even respond to an alarm call if it is not registered and permitted. You can call to confirm your address is in the jurisdiction. Here is the one for [Harris County](https://www.hcsoalarmpermit.com/) that's $35/year with 3 false alarms too. Your apartment complex will more than likely require that they have the code if they need to access the apartment for maintenance or inspections.

**8) Flooding**

Resources: [City of Houston](https://cohegis.houstontx.gov/cohgisweb/houstonmapviewer/) (need to add flood hazard layer), [Harris County](https://www.harriscountyfemt.org/), [FEMA](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search).

Articles from Harvey:  [Biz Journals](https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2017/10/06/study-harvey-damaged-42-000-apartments-in-houston.html),  [Chron](https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/houston-apartments-damaged-hurricane-harvey-12270464.php) (sorry, sorry I hate their slideshows too), [Reddit post trying to compile list of places that did/didn't flood](https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/6zn60c/comprehensive_list_of_apartments_that_got_flooded/)

Most Flooded Areas (based on reported info in articles):

1. Spring/Tomball (3,070 units)- 21%
2. Cypress/Waller (1,228 units)- 18.4%
3. Humble/Kingwood (2,848 units)- 17.8%
4. Friendswood/Pearland (2,368 units)- 15.8%
5. Far West (4,754 units)- 15.4%
6. Greater Heights/Washington Ave (2,022 units)- 14.8%
7. Galleria/Uptown-(3,244 units) 13.9%
8. North Central (3,048 units)- 12.9%
9. Pasadena/Southeast (2,967 units)- 10.9%
10. Alief (1,953 units)- 9.9%

Others: Gulfton/Westbury (2,910 units) 9%, Downtown/Motrose/River Oaks (1,382 units)- 7%, Bear Creek/Katy (1,993 units)- 6%, Clear Lake (1,418 units)-5%, Conroe (624 units)- 4%, Spring Branch (780 units)- 4%, Sugar land/Stafford (615 units)- 4%, East Inner Loop (512 units)- 4%, Rosenberg/Richmond (369 units)- 4%, Sharpstown (717 units)- 2%

From a [KHOU Article](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/how-to-find-out-if-a-rental-property-flooded/285-495876568): Howard Bookstaff, General Counsel for the Houston Apartment Association, says landlords are not required to disclose that information to potential tenants.

“There’s no law that requires an apartment complex to notify you voluntarily whether an apartment flooded, but certainly you can ask questions,” he said.

[Chron Editorial](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/With-renters-at-risk-Houston-must-require-12920686.php) calling for a change to this to inform renter's of flooding.  [House Bill 993](https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/HB993/2019) was written for this, but unfortunately died in committee in the middle of 2019.

Be more cautious for apartments near bayous/bodies of water and in the flood plains. Pay attention to musty smells when touring and look for signs of mold. Ask lots of questions. You can opt for units on higher floors as a precaution for flood prone areas and it's in your best interest to have renter's insurance. See Renter's Right below if you find mold in your current residence.

**9) Driving to work**

Native Houstonians know this like humidity: you want to live as close to where you work as possible and avoid traffic.

Resources: [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) (desktop only): click directions, enter the apartment address and your work address, the default is “Leave now” that you can change to “Depart at” or “Arrive by.” Can also be used for walking, biking, and bus routes with a “Last available” option. [HAR Drive time](https://www.har.com/drivetimesearch/) will give you a radius of houses for sale that you can use the same area to search for apartments.

Other transportation resources: [Metro Rail](https://www.ridemetro.org/Pages/Rail.aspx), [Metro Bus](https://www.ridemetro.org/Pages/BusSched.aspx), [Park and Ride](https://www.ridemetro.org/Pages/BusSched.aspx#) , [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/TX/Houston)

**10) Apartment Reviews**

Google Maps, [Apartment Ratings](https://www.apartmentratings.com/), and Yelp. Apartment Guide has them, but seem to be inconsistent.

I’d take all of these with a grain of salt and make sure to sort by recent reviews. One thing to look for is changes in property management. Apartment complexes are bought and sold regularly, which can be for better or worse. They often change names when they switch hands if there was a bad reputation.

**11) Application**

Here is a [standard application form](https://www.taa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-TAA-Rental-Application-For-Website.pdf). A lot of places will have online applications like Blue Moon Forms that require similar information. Should have your ID of course. Have your previous addresses and landlord information ready. Some ask for personal references and always emergency contact information. Know the make/model and color of your vehicle along with the license plate number. There is typically rental history, credit, and background check. Income requirements can range, but is usually at least x2-3 monthly rent. They may ask for tax documents, bank statements, pay stubs, or an offer letters as proof of income. Be ready for app fees from $25-75/applicant which are usually charged up front. Other fees like administrative and deposits might be due up front or on move-in day. Most places have modernized to accept credit cards, but some still require personal checks, cashier’s checks, or money orders. If you don’t have a check book, a lot of banks will print a sheet of them for you for free or a small cost. Approval usually take 24-72 hours to process. In the meantime, ask to review the lease.

**12) Signing a lease**

**READ IT!** Here’s a [standard lease](https://www.taa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-Apartment-Lease-Contract-September-2019-for-Website.pdf). Know what you’re responsible for, how to request repairs and how long they take, understand any fees or policies, community rules, guest rules and parking, pet policies, know what utilities are included or that you’re responsible for, if you can paint the walls, policies on maintenance and rules on them entering your unit, when is rent due, if you can pay online, late fees, renewal policies, subletting policies, lease termination policies, etc.

For units that are currently available, do a final walk through and document any damages with the landlord/property manager. If repairs are needed make sure it is written into your lease and request that the repairs will be made before you move in. Take lots of photos.

Ask for a copy to be scanned and emailed to you along with a hard copy for your records.

Renewals: Apartments will typically reach out to you well before your lease ends to renew for another long term. If you plan on moving, your lease should have information on how much notice is required to vacate, normally 30-60 days. Renewals often see an increase in price, but could stay the same. Review the renewal and decide if you want to stay. If you fail to renew or give notice to vacate, you will more than likely move to month-to-month terms which can be an increase in rent price as well. Even in a month-to-month, you are still required to give the notice to vacate listed in your lease.

**13) Moving in/Utilities**

Find out when/how you get your keys and/or fobs. Get any necessary access codes. Some complexes provide an [inventory and condition form](http://www.rentalmgmt.com/app/public/uploads/2843_TAA%20Inventory%20and%20Condition%20Form.pdf). You might have a grace period of a few days to fill this out once you get your keys. Don’t put this off or forget about it or it may cost you substantially when it comes to getting your deposit back. Again, take lots of photos. Request any repairs immediately.

Do a change of address through the [USPS](https://moversguide.usps.com/mgo/disclaimer?referral=UMOVE).

Learn the fire escape routes from your unit. It could save your life. [Have an exit strategy](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/fire/exit.html).

Renter’s insurance: call your auto insurance first and see what it looks like to add that to your policy. If not or if you want additional quotes, search online and should be able to find policies that are $15-25/mo. More places are starting to require this and costs are fairly low for the amount of coverage.  [Texas Department of Insurance info](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb043.html) and [Home Inventory Checklist](https://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb086.pdf)

Water/Sewage/Trash: this is almost always factored into rent or sub-metered as an additional monthly cost. If not here’s the link to [Houston Water](https://www.houstonwaterbills.houstontx.gov/ProdDP/Default/Default).

Gas: most apartments are going to be all electric, which I’d assume is for safety and insurance reasons. If need to get it setup, here’s the link for [Centerpointe Gas](https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/residential/customer-service/start-stop-transfer-service?sa=ho).

Electricity: Houston is deregulated, meaning the grid is owned and ran by Centerpointe, but you are allowed to choose your retail provider. [Power to Choose](http://powertochoose.org/) will allow you to put in your zip code for providers. Most apartments will probably be better suited with usage plans that have better pricing at 500kwh or 1,000kwh as opposed to 2,000kwh. If you have a 12 month lease, it’ll probably be easier to select a 12 month plan. There will be 3-6 month plans with lower pricing, but be aware if you don’t switch or get a new plan at the end of the term, you’re prices will typically jump up. It's a market so prices could go up or down. I prefer to just have it set up and forget about it, but that’s your call. **READ THE FACT SHEET** and know what you’re signing up for. There's a lot of gimmicky plans or ones with crazy fees. Centerpointe also has [My True Cost](https://centerpointenergy.secure.force.com/) that factors in delivery fees and usage. Search other posts in this sub about electricity prices for more input on this topic. Property managers should be able to give you a rough idea of usage from other tenants. Plan on higher costs for summer months. This is Houston.

Cable/Internet: You might be stuck with whoever the apartment or area has with Comcast or AT&amp;T. Ask beforehand who the providers are and try to get pricing. This will all depend on location for what’s available. Try and get this scheduled at least a week or two before move-in since there usually isn't next day appointments. Be ready for a 4 hour windows for technician arrival. You might hate these companies as much as everyone else, but please be kind to your technician. My little brother worked as one a few years back. They are on overbooked, tight schedules and get a lot of pressure from their management.

Movers: This one is tough. I’ve personally used one of the higher rated companies and had a mediocre experience. I’d still say to check Google and Yelp reviews or try to find a referral from someone. I’m not going to vouch for any of them. Just be careful not to get nickel and dimed for extra hours, additional wrapping/padding, bullied for a big tip, etc. My biggest piece of advice is to always get the FIRST appointment in the morning so you’re not waiting around if they take too long on previous jobs. Have heard countless horror stories about movers, so do your research and pray you have a good experience.

Moving boxes: Try hitting up the [Free section](https://houston.craigslist.org/d/free-stuff/search/zip) of Craigslist or stop by places like liquor stores and see if they have extras they’re throwing out.  If you’re moving yourself I highly recommend investing in 2 furniture dollies like [this](https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/b737342d-96af-48b8-b70d-8bf568affd0f/svn/milwaukee-dollies-33700-64_1000.jpg) and your move will go a hell of a lot smoother. Make sure the elevator is working before you move in if there is one.

**14) “Aggressive” Breed Restrictions**

Many of the larger property management companies have restrictions on weight limits and a list of dog breeds they consider aggressive. Emotional Support Animals are covered under the [ADA](https://adata.org/guide/service-animals-and-emotional-support-animals) and [Fair Housing](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/assistance_animals). Because of these rules, apartments typically cannot reject certified Emotional Support dogs based on their breed. You are still responsible for any damages your pet causes. Search Emotional Support Animal Certificate Texas if you would like to research this further. Use this information how you will.

**15) Felonies, misdemeanors, evictions, broken leases, bad credit, low income**

There are apartments out there that accept these, but might be tougher to search or filter on the websites listed above on exact policies for each complex. Most private/smaller communities will still conduct background, rental history, and credit checks, but might be more lenient than places with corporate policies set in place. There are some resources out there for companies that help with “Second Chance” leases, but be aware that it can be pricey as they require fees and deposits since they are essentially co-signing on the apartment. Criminal records are often case by case, after a certain period, and have a tendency to be more accepting of non-violent offenses. [Here is an article that might be more helpful](https://www.houstoncasemanagers.com/housing-for-felons-in-houston/). Broken leases or evictions often require it be after a certain period, under a certain amount, and/or paid off and may also require higher deposits. Bad credit may require a cosigner, higher deposit, or a certain amount of months paid up front.

If it comes to you suing an apartment complex, it will likely be through [Small Claims Court](http://www.jp.hctx.net/civil/default.htm). You can pursue this on your own or with the help of a lawyer.

**17) Student/Senior housing**

I’m honestly not too familiar with these. For students, your university websites should have more information to be able to guide for on-campus living. Off-campus should be able to use the rest of this guide. For Seniors, some of the apartment websites above have options to filter for senior living and there are companies and websites geared toward this specifically.

**18) Short term/Furnished/Corporate housing**

Most advertised pricing for apartment complexes are for long term leases of +12 months. Complexes want to stagger when leases come up so they aren’t all in the same month. You might get lucky with pricing on a 3-6 month lease, but typically you’re looking at a huge increase in price. Companies may rent a block of apartments at a complex and rent out as corporate housing and there are companies in Houston that specialize in this you can easily find on Google. These are typically pricey as well. Some of the websites listed above have filters to search for apartments that have corporate housing, but may only list prices for long term leases and require you to call for pricing. Also check out extended stay hotels and websites like Airbnb, VRBO, or HomeAway and look for places that offer discount for stays over a month. Craigslist also has a [sublet/temporary section](https://houston.craigslist.org/d/sublets-temporary/search/sub) along with searching Facebook Marketplace Rentals.

**Dark Arts’ and ‘Codebreaker’: The Origins of the Houston Astros Cheating Scheme** 

**MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred’s previously undisclosed letter to Astros GM Jeff Luhnow details the team’s spreadsheet and algorithm to steal signs in one of the biggest scandals in baseball history**

On Sept. 22, 2016, an intern in the Houston Astros organization showed general manager Jeff Luhnow a PowerPoint presentation that featured the latest creation by the team’s high-tech front office: an Excel-based application programmed with an algorithm that could decode the opposing catchers’ signs. It was called “Codebreaker.” 

This was the beginning of what has turned into [one of the biggest scandals](https://www.wsj.com/articles/astros-gm-jeff-luhnow-and-manager-aj-hinch-suspended-one-year-in-sign-stealing-scandal-11578942892?mod=article_inline) in Major League Baseball history. Throughout the 2017 season and for part of 2018, Astros baseball operations employees and video room staffers used Codebreaker to illegally steal signs, which were then relayed to batters in real time. Another Astros employee referred to the system as the “dark arts.” 

This previously undisclosed information about the origins and nature of the Astros’ cheating comes from both a letter MLB commissioner Rob Manfred sent to Luhnow on Jan. 2 that outlined the findings of a league investigation, as well as interviews with several people familiar with the matter. 

Eleven days after Manfred’s letter, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, MLB announced that it had suspended Luhnow, as well as field manager A.J. Hinch, for the entire 2020 season. Hours later, the Astros fired both Luhnow and Hinch.

The existence of Codebreaker shows that it was the Astros front office that laid the groundwork for the team’s electronic sign-stealing schemes. 

During MLB’s probe, Luhnow maintained that he had no knowledge of any of the Astros’ misconduct. However, Manfred wrote in his letter that “there is more than sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that you knew—and overwhelming evidence that you should have known—that the Astros maintained a sign-stealing program that violated MLB’s rules.”

But while the league collected evidence that showed Luhnow was aware of Codebreaker’s existence and capabilities, it couldn’t prove that he knew how it was used. In response to Manfred’s letter, Luhnow presented investigators with a binder with more than 170 pages that cast at least some doubt on the contents of the initial letter, according to multiple familiar with the matter. 

These people described the situation as a “he said-he said” between Luhnow and Tom Koch-Weser, the team’s director of advance information, who sent two emails to Luhnow in 2017 that referenced “the system” and “our dark arts, sign-stealing department.” 

Luhnow opened the emails, but told investigators he did not read to the bottom of them.

Complicating matters further, Koch-Weser’s responsibilities were reduced following the 2019 season, but before allegations of the Astros’ cheating became public in a November story in The Athletic.

MLB couldn’t decipher whose account was truthful. In his final findings, Manfred said that the investigation revealed that “Luhnow neither devised nor actively directed the efforts of the replay review room staff to decode signs in 2017 or 2018.”

Luhnow declined to comment through a spokesman. In a statement released last month, Luhnow said, “As the commissioner set out in his statement, I did not personally direct, oversee or engage in any misconduct.” The Astros did not provide comment on behalf of their employees. Koch-Weser did not respond to requests for comment.

The way Codebreaker worked was simple: Somebody would watch an in-game live feed and log the catcher’s signs into the spreadsheet, as well as the type of pitch that was actually thrown. With that information, Codebreaker determined how the signs corresponded with different pitches. Once decoded, that information would be communicated through intermediaries to a baserunner, who would relay them to the hitter. 

Starting around June 2017, the system was embellished [by Astros players](https://www.wsj.com/articles/astros-players-cheated-baseball-wanted-answers-so-they-made-a-deal-11579694400?mod=article_inline). They started watching a live game feed on a monitor near the dugout and then would bang on a trash can to communicate the coming pitch to the batter. The [“banging scheme”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-astros-fan-spent-50-hours-listening-for-banging-he-heard-a-lot-of-banging-11580394165?mod=article_inline) lasted through the 2017 World Series, which the Astros won over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Manfred said Luhnow was unaware of the banging scheme.

But everything started with Codebreaker, and the use of it to steal signs continued into 2018—not just at home, but also on the road. 

Luhnow acknowledged to investigators that he recalled the intern’s PowerPoint slide about Codebreaker and even asked questions about how it worked. He said that he was under the impression that it would be used to legally decipher signs from previous game footage for runners on second base to disseminate, rather than live in games.

The intern, Derek Vigoa, currently the Astros’ senior manager for team operations, told investigators that he presumed Luhnow knew it would be used in games because that was “where the value would be,” according to the letter. But he said he didn’t recall whether he explicitly told Luhnow that Codebreaker would be used during games.

Vigoa’s presentation wasn’t the only time Astros employees say Luhnow was informed about Codebreaker. Koch-Weser, the Astros’ director of advance information, said he discussed Codebreaker with Luhnow in one to three meetings after the 2016 season.

Koch-Weser told MLB that Luhnow would “giggle” at the title and appeared “excited” about it. Koch-Weser also said that Luhnow sometimes entered the Astros’ video room during road games and made comments such as, “You guys Codebreaking?” 

Luhnow denied Koch-Weser’s accounts. 

Other Astros employees told MLB’s investigators that they believed Luhnow knew about Codebreaker, but they provided no definitive proof. Matt Hogan, now the Astros’ manager of pro scouting analysis, told investigators there was no effort to hide the use of Codebreaker in front of Luhnow when he visited the video room. In fact, he told them, “it would have been something to show we were working and get validation of our work.” Luhnow denied seeing evidence of sign-stealing during those visits.

In October 2018, Luhnow met with Koch-Weser to discuss a potential contract extension. In preparation, Koch-Weser outlined his arguments for an extension in a Slack post that included the term “dark arts.” He wrote, in part: “Lastly, I know the secrets that made us a championship team, some of which he\[’\]d definitely feel a lot safer if they were kept in-house.” Koch-Weser told MLB investigators that during his meeting with Luhnow, he used either the term “dark arts” or “codebreaking” to tout his efforts. Luhnow denied that Koch-Weser referenced either of those things.

Koch-Weser also used the term “dark arts” in the Astros’ Advanced Scouting Department’s 2019 budget Excel spreadsheet. Luhnow acknowledged that he reviewed the document but denied reading the tab “dark arts” was written in and denied that any discussion of “dark arts” took place during the budget meeting.

In Manfred’s public report last month, he said that Luhnow received at least two emails that mentioned the Astros’ sign-stealing. His letter to Luhnow expanded upon the content of those emails.

One was sent by Koch-Weser on May 24, 2017, and was titled “Road Notes (April-May).” The five-page email included six underlined topic headings, with the fifth one called, “The System”—a reference to what Koch-Weser described to investigators as “all kind of covert operations,” including sign-stealing. Luhnow told investigators he didn’t read the full email because of its length, and that he was unfamiliar with the term “the system.” Two people familiar with the matter said it was generally known in the Astros front office that Luhnow expected his staff to put pertinent information in the first page of any email.

Luhnow responded to that email a day later: “These are great, thanks.” He wrote another email about three hours later. “How much of this stuff do you think \[Hinch\] is aware of?” Luhnow asked Koch-Weser.

On Aug. 26, 2017, in another “road notes,” Koch-Weser wrote: “The system: our dark arts, sign-stealing department has been less productive in the second half as the league has become aware of our reputation and now most clubs change their signs a dozen times per game.” He added that struggling teams like the Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics “seem not to care as much.” 

Luhnow responded two weeks later. 

“Tom, this type of write up is very helpful,” he wrote. “Seems like our baserunning is still pathetic. What the hell happened to our pitching this series? I mean that was historically bad…” 

Nonetheless, Luhnow told investigators that he did not read the full email because of its length and that if he had, he would have followed up because the reference to “dark arts” sounded “nefarious” and “sinister.”

The evidence led Manfred to believe that Luhnow knew about that element of the Astros’ sign-stealing. In the last paragraph of Manfred’s letter, he wrote: “I intend to hold you accountable for the egregious rules violations that took place under your supervision…” 

Luhnow was suspended by MLB for a year on Jan. 13. He was fired by the Astros hours later.

If any of you know any NPs or FNPs I’d love your thoughts on a few questions 

* what pay and benefits (including tuition assistance?) are typical?
* what are the best and worst hospitals to work at?
* is it common to work at a mixture of inpatient (hospital) and outpatient (local clinic) within a single system?
* given the restrictive licensing in TX, how crucial is it to partner with a supportive physician and how can one be identified?
* are there federally qualified health clinics, serving vulnerable populations, that are also good places to work?

In manhattan, our rent is 3,800/mo for a 1 bedroom floor to cieling double corner unit in financial district. I wont factor in costs of cable and utilities because I’m not factoring it in for houston as well. We dont have cars, we walk to work so no monthly subway bs. We do take ubers places, though. 

We’re looking at apartments in Houston, and nice ones since we’ve read of apartment break ins and car break ins. 

We also need TWO cars + insurance

The apartments were looking at average 2,500/month. Plus $1-200/mo each car for parking, and $100+ amenity fee.  

So with two cars, average, thats almost $3K/mo on an apartment alone. 

Now two cars - were looking at leases between $4-550/ month. Plus insurance, for both of us. So say $500, for each of us, plus $150/mo each for insurance. 

Thats another $1,300/month without gas. 

So now were up to 4,300/month, to live a nice life in Houston. And no offense, and I like Houston a lot, but its not Manhattan. So to pay this much a month off the bat is starting to look insane to me. 

What am I doing wrong here? I’m not going to downgrade on the apartments as safety is important to me, and I want to be atleast 8+ stories up (flooding, safety).

Over the past year or so I've really got into hiking and doing stuff outdoors. While I do love hiking alone and find it very peaceful, I'd love to meet a few people I can go out with and enjoy trails together. I've tried to get some of my friends to come out with me but unfortunately none of them are really into hiking... I know there's meetup groups out there for this sort of thing and I'm eventually going to get around to trying some of them out but I'm more interested in going out with a small group of a couple people than I am going out with a large group. I think that going out with a large group would kind of ruin the feeling of serenity I get from being out on the trails.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a pretty casual hiker I'd say, I prefer to walk at an average pace and take in the sights as opposed to power walking or running. I usually like to go out for a couple hours at a time and will walk anywhere from 2 - 7 miles depending on what I feel like that day and how much time I have. I currently live near the Willowbrook area so my go to trail has been the Cypress Creek bike trails because it's super close. A couple of my other favorite trails are the ones in the Addicks Reservoir and the Memorial Park trails. I also love going to the various state parks that aren't too far away from Houston. I love biking too but I'm kind of stuck to biking around my home for the time being because the hatch on my SUV is broken so I can't get my bike in the back :( Hopefully I can get that fixed soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really prefer to meet people in my age group with similar interests, so anyone between the ages of 21 - 32-ish. I'm a 26 y/o almost 27 y/o male. Some of my interests besides being outdoors are:

\- Movies and a love for cinemas. While there are some TV shows  and Anime that I enjoy watching I'm definitely more of a movie guy. I love all genres but if I had to pick a favorite it would probably be horror, especially horror-comedies

\- Music. Nothing beats hanging out with some friends and spinning some records. I also love concerts, they're honestly one of my favorite places in the world to be. I listen to a little bit of everything and can appreciate all genres, but metal and psychedelic rock are definitely my favorites. I used to be halfway decent at playing piano and guitar but I stopped practicing... I need to get back on that

\- Tech. I love checking out all the latest stuff going on in the tech world and seeing all the new fancy products that I won't be able to afford for a while lol. I love building PCs even though I've only gotten to do it a few times. I'm currently working on transitioning into the I.T. field and making a career out of my passion for tech

\- Video games. I like playing video games even though I barely have enough time for it these days. I'm more into single player story driven games than multiplayer online games. Although I'm always willing to try multiplayer games out with friends

\- Animals. I love all animals, especially dogs so feel free to bring your dog if you join me on the trails! I love to go out with my dog when I can, but she's pretty tiny so I can't always bring her

&amp;#x200B;

Wow this post ending up being longer than I thought it would but anyways, if you have similar interests and want to go out and enjoy nature together hit me up!

Back in December I had a neighbor move out of our neighborhood in W. Houston. These people were always shitty neighbors with an entitled brat of a son, but that's a whole other story. Anyways, these shitty neighbors moved out of the country, but decided to leave their kid's broken down car in front of my house. This car is damaged pretty bad in more than just a cosmetic way and I was told by a neighbor that it doesn't even run. It's parked on the curb which I know is legal, but it has been there for nearly 2 months now (right in front of my house). The house these people had has gone on the market and has since been sold, so I know for a fact these people aren't coming back for their car. My question is, how can I get this car towed? I'm tired of seeing it every morning and just want it gone already.

Castle dental center really likes to find ways to make money anyways. Does anyone know of an honest doctor that could possibly help me? If it's the second or third to the back of my mouth I would hate to lose it but the amount of pain I'm in right now is just certainly not helping it. I've been taking Tylenol 4's like crazy and it's just stinks. It's going all throughout my jaw from my lymph nodes in my neck should making the bottom of my eye twitch and I'm just so much an agony.

He then stopped and harassed multiple people in front of a small store while yelling and screaming.  He was manic and likely having a psychotic episode (maybe drug related?).  Multiple people were on the phone with 911 and building security came running and surrounded the guy and kept him away from people.  

A large crowd gathered to watch, mainly men willing to help restrain the guy if needed, while everyone waited on HPD.

The man needed help, could have been arrested for trespass, disturbing the peace, and assault (he went hands-on several people).  There were several points during the 20 minutes where it looked like the guy was about to get physically violent (great job by building security to deescalate).

HPD never responded and the guy left (followed by security) after 20 minutes.

Tonight (Valentine's Day 2020) I went out to eat with a friend at [Sumo Hibachi &amp; Sushi Bar](https://www.facebook.com/sumohibachiandsushibar/?__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARDivGhpJsc8gjTyScn2lO49nDC8UnUDmb0GWmAg1ATvXHVfOCem8J3mP4sy7kFB4aMp9DT1D7MJdtlf&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC3EYaJ1eBOsvvTqMGhy4ctbtOwujW8Mp6G8LFjMtp1pkGVwRloBNqo7jsAJR5Mux8qU5CUSGqldpCP5JNxxysF2ibNzTJU0yhDmltsFerfRRxf0gaiPirTsfV4K9aqoIQqsJ35IQwJcqbsV1Rc0Dyc9J8ZNg4AJtb-7XMgvWurza7oI_jmkT5t_3WxFpN7MI4lFEZYw2YP) in Houston. At a table across from us was a family with a young daughter around the age of 8.

I took notice of this family immediately as the beautiful blonde wife appeared to be dealing with Parkinson's disease or a similar neuromuscular disorder. All dinner long I was amazed at how good of a husband she had, as he displayed uncanny patience and love while helping her eat, wiping her face clean etc.

During the meal the husband and I briefly exchanged small talk after I laughed at one of his jokes. This appeared to be enough for him to perform possibly the kindest gesture that has ever been done towards me by a complete stranger.

As our meal was concluding, the manager walked up to me to inform me that this man had picked up my friend and I's dinner tab. I was in such shock and awe that I was unable to catch his name and when I called the restaurant back they said that they could not disclose that information.

I know the odds are slim, but if this family sounds familiar to anyone please let me know as I would love to reach out to them in someway to return the favor by sending the wife flowers and making a charitable donation in their family's name.

2418,2418,AJ7217,1581792340,f4do4i,Nan,"If you aren’t aware already, Houston is home to one of the worst homeless animal crises in the nation. Animal shelters are overwhelmed and shelters euthanize daily. Houston animal rescues (501C charities that rely on donations) mainly utilize fosters to help make a difference by placing strays that aren’t claimed by owners or animals pulled off the euthanasia list at full shelters in volunteer homes to give them a safe place to find a new forever home. 

These rescues provide everything you need - food, medicine, bed, crate, toys, etc. Animals are fully vetted (neutered/spayed, vaccinated, microchipped, etc.) before being made available for adoption. Potential fosters and adopters both go through an application vetting process for the safety of the animals. 

A large number of rescues rely on a core set of foster families to help but we need more to be able to help more animals. Some rescues only need temp fosters because they work with partners to transport dogs up north where there are rescues not overflowing with homeless animals and people lined up to adopt. Other rescues need people that can foster here in Houston until an animal is adopted by going to adoption events around town or posting online.

Not all rescues are created equal and not everyone knows about the homeless animal problem in Houston. If you are interested in opening your home by becoming a foster, please  PM me so I can point you in the right direction. I volunteer with one rescue out in Katy that needs fosters but know of other rescues in multiple areas. This post is to help get the word out and hopefully connect any interested people with rescues looking for fosters. 

Here’s just one example of a sweet boy looking for a foster or adopter that was pulled from the euthanasia list with minutes to spare:

Are you still looking for a forever Valentine?? Good news - Bobby is still available 💕 He’s a single bachelor with gorgeous brown eyes that wants to be your one and only. He loves long walks, playing with his friends, and sitting on the couch while you watch tv. 

Bobby wants all your love while at home so he will do best as an only dog but does enjoy playing with other dogs outside of his home. He’s potty trained, vaccinated, neutered, walks well on a leash, and likes to play with tough toys. He is hw positive but he is being treated and the treatment is paid for by the rescue until cleared.

Just moved to Houston and would like to start playing adult hockey as a hobby/means of staying in shape/socializing.  I played my entire childhood including a couple years of AAA in my high school years but haven't touched a hockey stick in about five years.  I've tried to look for some info online but a lot of the rink websites don't seem very up to date or informative. Seems like there are a couple of leagues around though.

For starters, are there stick and puck sessions at any of the rinks?  I'm not too worried about skating coming back to me as I've skated a couple times in the past few years but I'm very worried about my hands.  I definitely feel like I need some time to get myself back into it.  

Next, any suggestions on how I can get more information on the adult leagues in the Houston area?  Additionally, what is the quality of play/culture like?  I know adult league usually goes from Novice -&gt; C -&gt; B -&gt; A but the corresponding quality really varies depending on location.  B in Minnesota might be A in Florida for example.  How does one get involved joining a league/team?  Are there tryouts?  Do you need to know somebody?  If I realize I'm rustier or in better shape than I thought, is it easy to move up or down levels?  Are the leagues at one rink better than the leagues at another?

Really just looking for any info to help me figure out how to get back into playing hockey here in Houston as it is something I've started to miss.  Appreciate the answers!",houston,"Any tips on the adult hockey scene in Houston? What are the leagues, quality of play, best rinks, etc?"

I live in East Downtown off Delano and believe it happened early this morning. First off, I know I'm an idiot for leaving my wallet in the car but it was an honest mistake. I left it sitting on my passenger seat after picking up some takeout. 

Discover messaged me at 5am asking if I tried to use the card at Handistop 20 which I believe is a gas station. When I Googled the name it shows somewhere off 59 near Fifth Ward/Kashmere Gardens/etc... I don't know if my wallet made it that far but at least the cards did. 

I've cancelled my cards &amp; filed a police report. I know it's a longshot but if you're out and about and notice a brown wallet (Saddleback Leather Co) randomly thrown to the side please let me know. The wallet, cards, cash can be replaced but there was something sentimental in the pocket. My dad gave me a prayer coin before he died nearly 20 years ago. I've carried it in my wallet since then and that's honestly what's killing me most about my dumb mistake.

Our brave speakers present their bad theories in front of a live audience and a panel of judges with real science credentials, who together determine who takes home the coveted BAHFest trophy. And eternal glory, of course. If you'd like to learn more about the event, you can check out these articles from the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-this-conference-scientists-spout-bogus-theories-on-bugs-yawns-and-belly-fat-1417395149) and [NPR's Science Friday](https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/festival-of-fake-hypotheses-generates-real-laughs/).

I (32 F) was in a yellow mustang and my car suddenly died. This was in extremely hot weather July/August. I was stuck in the middle lane on 610 near 69. I could see the community college from the highway. I was afraid to get out, had my emergency lights on. 

Called roadside assistance and they told me nothing they could do while I was the middle of the highway. I had to be on the shoulder for them to help. I called police and they said they would come. 

Suddenly an older extended pickup truck with a bunch of Hispanic guys in the bed pulled in front of me and the guys jumped out of the extended cab and bed. A white semi truck driver honked his horn, pulled up next to me and blocked the two lanes next to me. One of the guys in the pickup told me to put my car in neutral and they pushed my car to the shoulder as the their driver stayed in front to the left of me with his emergency lights on. I assume to keep his friends from getting hit by a car trying to pass. The semi driver kept his vehicle behind me as he kept the guys from getting run over by blocking traffic until we were on the shoulder. 

He asked if I had anyone to help me. I said yes. Then they all took off so fast and I never got to say Thank You to all of them. I am ashamed I never said Thank you to them. 

I’m amazed by the friendly and compassionate people in Houston. Especially the construction and truck drivers. Thank you all. Bless those men wherever they are. This all took maybe 5 minutes. It ended up being my bad alternator. I live in San Antonio, never forgotten the kind, hardworking men that helped me. 

I wasn’t on the book of faces back then. If this is the wrong place to post this, mods feel free to delete. I just always reminded that H town has really kind compassionate people in it. Police got there a little before the tow truck. 

Why I’m posting now. I’ve realized how many times in my life I have had earth angels come through helping me of a bad situation. I really felt the need to thank them. Thank you to the people who stop to help someone in trouble, just because.",houston,Have to get this off my chest

I myself like to push the cart near the corral and leave it just outside the corral to deliberately aggravate these people.  i even photograph it so I can post it on their sites.

But why do I do it?

One: it provides valuable work for the buggy boy.  If everyone was neat about it, he'd lose hours.  (I rounded up doggies myself in my youth and speak from experience.)

Two:  it gives the buggy boy 15 minutes or more to get out of the store, check  his phone, and get away from the madness inside.

Three:  it gives you a break from dealing with that one female cashier with the huge student loans, horrible attitude, and caustic personality because her degree in folklore, didn't pan out. 

In talking to a counselor friend of mine, I asked her, ""why do people take it upon themselves to hassle people over such trivial things?""  She replied that because in their personal life they mooch off of parents, steal, have discernible job or life skills of any kind, and feel guilty about their debauched and moral-less lives, they try to gain some upper ground by fighting these types of battles.

2673,2673,slumdogbillionaire,1582222620,f6x5cu,Nan,"I wonder why I cannot find a zero-waste store in Houston.  I therefore wonder, to what extent do Houstonians care about the planet where they would willingly spend more money and inconveniently, head out to a specialty store. Perhaps this post will encourage potential entrepreneurs to provide a solution to a problem I care deeply about.

Zero-waste products/companies emerge everyday. But the general public isn't aware of the plethora of solutions out there. A zero-waste store would educate citizens who care about the climate on best practices and new solutions.

Such a store would include:

Kitchen:

\- Silicon baking mats and liners

\- re-usable k-cups for coffee makers

Bathroom:

\- natural cleaning sprays that you re-fill in metal canisters/spray bottles

\- cleaning tablets you add to water (as opposed to buying a plastic bottle of Windex)

\- bamboo toothbrushes, plastic-free floss

\- refillable lotions, shampoos, etc (all in glass bottles) (bring old glass container we will wash/reuse so you can conveniently but a new glass bottle).

\- zero-waste skin products (glass/steel for recyclable)

\- bidet attachments (education provided)

Living Room:

Other:

\- dryer balls

Educational sessions:

\- DIY toothpaste, soaps, etc.

\- products that are socially conscious and deserve your $support

*and obviously much more.* 

Any feedback would be appreciated.

Parking: I live a little less than 2 miles from the NRG stadium.

Tickets/entrance: There is literally too many things listed to do that it gives me a headache. If I just buy entrance, would that allow me to walk around, see what's up, find food and possibly ride some rides?

&amp;nbsp;

**Why I’m asking for help?**

Beyond loving skating, this roller rink, and its owners, history has shown that roller rinks are closing at an alarming rate and any time a community growth event, such as an adults-only night, tends to generate undue hate to those that just want to have a good time. Many rinks will have the police called due to noise violations, even when they’ve been open for decades and the only thing that changed was the age of folks allowed in. This sort of behavior is petty but effective in stifling the growth of roller skating and community involvement.

&amp;nbsp;

Your help in spreading the word goes a long way to supporting our community and the loving family atmosphere it provides.

&amp;nbsp;

**When?**

Starting Wednesday, February 26th at 7 pm, Houston Just Rolling will be having a weekly adult night once per week on Wednesday for a 3-week trial. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Who can attend?**

Adults 18 years of age or older. Beginners are encouraged to show up and ask for tips. Every walk of life welcome!

&amp;nbsp;

**What to bring?**

Bring your own skates or rent some while you’re there. A fun attitude and a willingness to say hello. A towel to wipe off that dancing sweat.

&amp;nbsp;

**Where?**

Houston Just Rolling Skating Rink
7505 S Sam Houston Pkwy E B
Houston, TX 77075

&amp;nbsp;

**Things to note:**

1.	Live DJ, awesome sound system, a gigantic mirrored ball, and a baby rink for beginners to practice in.
2.	No free entry, even if you just want to look inside. This keeps the trouble makers out.
3.	There is a metal detector and may be armed security guards.
4.	No liquid containers allowed, even see-through.

I graduated from UH may of last year. Still struggling to find a full time job (surprise surprise) so only working part time atm. I don’t have insurance. I live with my dad, and he doesn’t have insurance either. He works for my aunt’s company as a truck driver which isn’t provided with insurance and tbh he doesn’t really go to the doctor as much. 

Do I have to account for my dad if attempting to apply for the Harris Health ‘gold card’? He doesn’t really give me money anymore but not asked to pay bills or rent so that’s obviously helpful. If I live with my dad and he makes x amount of money and I don’t have dependents does that mean I won’t qualify? I make $12 an hour at my job which is max 30 hrs a week. :/ 

Honestly what I’m looking more towards right now is reduced mental health services. If maybe someone here has any recommendations on that? I truly can’t take it anymore. I’ve held off on help for so long because paying out of pocket fees is so much, but I can just feel myself mentally deteriorating and I’m tired of having to push through everyday without help. My dad doesn’t really like fully comprehend mental health so I don’t want to ask him for money to help for therapy, etc. 

Thanks in advanced. ❤️",houston,"Do i qualify for Harris Health ‘Gold Card’ ? Or, any other forms of reduced health care?"

There is a parking garage next to Izakaya and signs posted all over the garage say it’s a Text to Pay or use the parking booth. 

We park and a guy in a hoodie and reflective parking vest asks us where we’re eating, how long we’re staying for. An hour was “$6.50. Cash only.”  

My s/o questions it as the signs indicate we can use the booth. He says it’s broken. The only cash we have is $20 so he hands it (stupid decision). He asks if we need change (of course we need damn change, why would I tip you after parking my own damn car). 

He says, “I need to go get change. Please stay here (about 5 times, super fishy at this point but he has our cash). I need to go over *there*. Please stay. It’s for my job.”  He walks into the distance and around the corner. 

15 seconds in we realise something is wrong, my s/o walks around the corner and he’s gone. I walk to the restaurant and describe the situation. Immediately the hostess’ faces change; I knew it. We’ve been scammed. She calls her manager who then calls for security and asks me to describe the person. 

We got scammed off of $20 and I was so pissed, the only thing I could do was drink and cuss this lowlife POS a lot under my breath.

Now obviously, being a college student, I do have some experience with alcohol, but most of it is just drinking a bunch of shots of vodka before running out to party, which really isn't that great. Since I'll be turning 21 and I really want to gain a lot more knowledge about stuff like mixers and cocktails and all that, I was wondering if anyone knew any bars around the Medical Center or easily uber-able/METRO-able places downtown (I live right off the Memorial Hermann/Zoo stop on the Red Line).
It's a little embarrasing to ask other students about alcohol (I literally just found out what a Jack and Coke was a few days ago), so I'm hoping to just spend some time talking to bartenders here and there so that I have some idea what's even going on.

Since I grew up in Cypress, I don't actually know much about downtown Houston despite having lived here for about 1.5 years. I'm hoping to get to know downtown a lot more so that I can have fun in my mid-20s and such when friends/colleagues probably want to do that sort of stuff. Right now I have no friends who are interested in exploring nightlife like comedy clubs/bars/etc. in downtown Houston, so I'm just hoping to go out into Houston myself learn about this stuff on my own I guess. 

Right now I have a list of cool places I'm hoping to check out like Avant Garden, The Secret Room, etc. and I'm just hoping to add more to that list so that I can start hitting them up once I'm 21.",houston,Cheap Bars/Clubs Near Medical Center To Learn About Alcohol/Nightlife?

Where can I buy calcite granules for water treatment? They usually come in a 50-lb bag and are used in an acid neutralizer, to bring acidic well water up to a normal pH. 

It's just pieces of clean marble. I'd like to find it for $20-35/bag and am willing to pick it up locally. I'm aware it's online for $54-100/bag, with shipping accounting for about half of the cost. I need 4-5 bags (each is 0.5 cubic foot).

&amp;#x200B;

I've checked with the following supply houses:

* Culligan: $48.50/bag
* Grainger: $60/bag
* Pumps of Houston: I have a call in to them.
* Morrison Supply: $45+shipping, 3-4 week lead.
* Ferguson: Used to carry it locally, but no longer. Now it would be shipped from AL, CA, etc.
* Quality Home Products (Rainsoft dealer):  Doesn't have it.  
* Moore Supply: Doesn't have it.

I've checked with these suppliers:

* Lancaster Pump: Refers to Ferguson.
* Columbia River Carbonates: Refers to Pumps of Houston.

Houston isn't the world's capital of human trafficking, but it's a major center. Due to port proximity, interstate access and lack of zoning, the reality exists that untold numbers of modern-day slaves are suffering in the city.

Two TCU professors are studying Houston's regular-looking massage parlors (like those next to major retail stores), which are part of the gray market where legal and illegal industries coexist. 

In illicit massage businesses, most trafficking victims are adult women from Southeast and East Asia,  said Vanessa Bouché of TCU's political science department.

“They’re told they’re going to be working in a massage business but not always told that they’re going to be engaging in sex acts — oral sex being the most common,” she said. “They are told that if they come to the U.S., their flights and visas will be paid for … and so they don’t have to worry about that. But once they arrive, they’re not paid a fair wage until they pay off their debt, which is often associated with some exorbitant interest rate.”

This is knowledge worth having. Read more in TCU Magazine: [https://magazine.tcu.edu/winter-2020/human-trafficking-massage-parlors-texas/](https://magazine.tcu.edu/winter-2020/human-trafficking-massage-parlors-texas/)",houston,Your neighborhood massage parlor could be a front for human trafficking

Here's the thing though- I've never stayed in H-town for more than a day trip before.
So, this post is extremely vague, but does anyone have any general advice about living in Houston as a newcomer? Is the metro safe for females in their 20s? Is there a safe (not craigslist) way to find roommates in Houston that aren't necessarily grad students? Is there a safe-ish nightlife in Houston, and if so, where is it? What's the best movie theater in Houston (real question- who has the best popcorn)?
I've already been researching this stuff, but most of the results are from like 5/6 years ago and I'm assuming Houston's changed a bit in that time.

However, *if* it comes to the US, and there's a decent chance that it will, there will be a run on the grocery stores. The worst part about it will be other people freaking out. 

The responsible thing to do is buy some groceries so you don't have to leave the house that much, hole yourself up, work from home if possible, and avoid being a vector for passing it around. If you prepare now, it will be a little less hectic for people preparing at the last minute.

For about 2 weeks, I was the maintenance person for a local apartment complex. During my short stint there I seen units unbearable to walk in because of the odor (tenant left food in fridge and freezer and left w/o notice. Power was off for 2 weeks before management noticed). They wanted me to change the locks, I opened the door and literally threw up. Nothing has been done to remedy this issue for two weeks, except throwing fridge out. Unit still smells horrendous. 

I've been asked to do multiple mold hides. This complex has main drain line plumbing leaks in nearly every unit. (And vanity leaks). Residents have been dealing with them for months,  if not years. Those that were ""fixed"" are leaking again. It has mold buildup. I was told to bleach it, scrub it and hide it - because ""it's not really mold."" 

In shower rooms there is mold buildup because the exhaust fan isn't properly ventilated. It vents directly into attic. Which causes mold in attic. 

I do carpentry for a living. I know mold when I see mold. Drywall should have been cut out and dealt with at source. Not cosmetically. 

A 2nd story balconies have rotted beams. I was told to marry 2x6s to it. Not per code when it's running 8x8 beams. 

They had an electric fire just last week due to a plumbing leak dripping onto a hanging stove outlet. 

Ya, the 220v stove outlets in most units are not mounted and just hanging. 

The AC closets are mold filled. Not properly sealed causing mold buildup. 

Many door locks dont work. Missing window locks. Missing slide door locks. 

There is so much shady work that was previously done. 

When I started this job I noticed these issues and spoke with owner. Told him I would not do work that was not done correctly. He was fine with it for a bit.  Until he realized how much shit was actually wrong and what itd take to fix it. Started asking me to cut corners. I told him no.  And was promptly let go. 

Just wondering how to make EPA [or proper agency] aware of this situation.

Falk is a paleoanthropologist whose interests include brain evolution and the emergence of language, music, analytical thinking and warfare in humans. 

Imprints of brains stamped on the insides of ancestral skulls (called endocasts) provide clues about the evolution of intelligence. The same kinds of analyses used to examine the bumps and grooves on the brains of apes, early ancestors, and modern people have been used to study the cerebral cortex of Albert Einstein.

Although the size of Einstein’s brain was average, the form of his cortex was extraordinary. Einstein’s brain verifies that, in addition to increased brain size during human evolution, alterations in the brain’s wiring were crucial for the emergence of complex thinking.

This is reflected in the archeological record of material culture, which progressed from simple stone tools in early ancestors to the relatively recent invention of reading in Homo sapiens and the subsequent development of complex problem solving, like Einstein’s theory of relativity.

This lecture event is co-sponsored by The Leakey Foundation.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. If it’s not I am sorry.

3178,3178,mvrybel,1582838289,faj4rp,Nan,"Hello Houston reddit, I am coming to you hoping that maybe you guys have some advice or guidance regarding my current situation as a foster for the Harris County Animal Shelter.

On February 1st, I agreed to be a part of the short-term foster program. The contract that I signed that day detailed that if I decided to adopt the dog, I could do so if I notified the shelter at least 5 days prior to a scheduled transport for the animal. I would not have agreed to foster an animal if I had not been given that option.

Within the first week of fostering, I did make the decision to adopt. There had not yet been a transport date set. I made the request on February 8th, at which point I was told that I could not and that all short-term foster animals have to be transported. I pointed out that the contract I signed stated that if I notified the shelter within the 5 day time frame, I could choose to go through the adoption process. The foster staff I was speaking to went to talk to the foster supervisor. When she returned, she reported that it was a error in the contract and that line shouldn't have been on there and that they would be removing that line from all future contracts.  

On Monday of this week, I was notified that the transport for my foster was scheduled for this Friday, February 28th. That evening, I emailed the transfer program supervisor, and once again made a request to be allowed to adopt my foster. She responded that she would reach out to their receiving partner and that it would be highly unlikely they will be willing to drop the transport hold. I have not yet received a response from her.

I have made various efforts to find a way to adopt my foster, including reaching out to a volunteer through the Best Friends organization. She mentioned that this is a problem she has seen occur several times, where a foster family is not allowed to adopt their dog and they are forced to return their animals to be sent to rescues out of state. 

I contacted the transportation supervisor at the Animal Humane Society in Minnesota, where my foster is scheduled to go, and he told me that he didn't have a hold placed on the animal and he stated that ""I don't want more dogs. I want more dogs to find homes"" and that he would prefer that I adopted the dog if I wanted to. He told me that I should contact either the Harris Shelter or the tranportation agent, Houston Petset, to see why I was getting this push back.

I called Houston Petset at that time and told them about my problem. They said that they would not drop the hold because my dog had already been accounted for. I asked them why they couldn't replace her spot with another animal, and they responded that they have to ensure that an animal is healthy prior to the transfer, which is why they have the short term fostering program set up through the shelter. The lady I spoke to said that I 'was not the first foster to make this request' and that she understands that it was difficult when you got attached but that maybe I could just adopt another dog because there are plenty of other dogs that need homes. 

On their twitter page, the Houston Petset page states that their mission to *end homelessness and suffering of companion animals and elevate their status in society*.

The fact that I am not the first foster who has made the request to adopt the dog or cat they have integrated into their home, and have been denied in favor of sending them to a rescue group several thousand miles away seems like a systematic issue to me. I understand that Houston Petset is helping the community by alleviating the burden of our very overcrowded shelters, but if their mission statement is truly what they say it is, they should account for the fact that may inadvertently find homes for dogs in their own community by the fostering program they have set up for their transporting resource. 

This is has all been very emotionally distressing and the fact that other people in our community have faced the same issue makes it even more difficult. I have gone through crazy lengths to keep my beautiful foster, Ella, and its making me feel like a bit of a Karen at this point, but I love her too much at this point to not keep fighting. My significant other and I are seriously considering the possibility of driving out to Minnesota to adopt her there if we are not able to change their minds.",houston,Short term animal foster not allowed to adopt dog

[MORE INFORMATION](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/drinking/creating-storing-emergency-water-supply.html)

My wife and I live in an apartment, so storage space is limited. Nonetheless, we have 10-days worth of water stashed in small places throughout the apartment. It's convenient right now because, instead of boiling water as the city recommends, I'm just cycling through my supply.

Personally, I prefer store-bought single-gallon jugs. They are easy to carry and easy to store in small spaces. Because they are store-bought, they are sealed, and I don't have to worry about bacterial or algae growth. My experience is that the plastic jugs the water comes in will break down and may leak after a few years, so I like to date the jugs with a Sharpie, and then cycle through the old ones first to keep them fresh. 

Regardless of how you do it, please keep an emergency water supply on hand. You can go for a day or two without food. But in the case of a natural disaster like a hurricane where the power may be out, and you could be without air conditioning, it will be difficult to go too many *hours* without clean drinking water.",houston,PSA: The water main break is a good reminder that the CDC recommends keeping an emergency water supply.

I know that it's a long shot, but if for some reason you come across a random black backpack with a little pin on one of the mesh pockets, that's mine. 
   Also, be on the lookout for some random person who obviously doesn't work for Goody Goody, even if their jacket says otherwise. This happened in broad daylight while a hundred or so people were lined up in front of the Select skate shop. There wasn't anything of value in the thing, just a wrinkled black tshirt and a dirty towel. 
   From reading various stories about how car break-ins seem to be a common occurrence in the Montrose area, I haven't seen a lot of them happen during the daytime. Especially while the surrounding area is so heavily trafficked. Anyways, maybe someone will stumble upon it, and maybe I'll be able to have a good laugh.

I worked for TDCJ in 2018 and accepted a $5000 bonus. I signed a contact that stated I needed to work for a year (I didn’t) and now I have to pay it back. The state used the net or 3500 I received after taxes and said I needed to pay it all back. They took my last paycheck when I quit and I then had a balance of around 1400.  My question is, what will happen if I don’t pay back the 1400? It has been two years and all I get from them are invoices saying I need to pay them back. They don’t deduct from my IRS returns and they don’t deduct from my current job (I work for another agency in Texas).  Would they ever send me to collections or make a warrant for my arrest?

3306,3306,Colonelwheel,1582971742,fbanzt,Nan,"Hey everyone. I'll try to make this as short as possible. I have a physical disability that makes travel a TASK. Not the actual trip itself! But the planning is a nightmare for me because I have to figure out how I'm going to get around and whatnot. Even in my own city, really. Sidewalks not existing, finding a ride, weather, etc. Since I'll be there for Skankfest at The Secret Group downtown, I was wondering if some of you could help me out with the planning a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to be able to stay within ""walking"" distance of it because there's no real disability Uber counterparts. So if I can't be close to it, it'll really complicate things, but so many airbnb'ers and hotels are really spiking prices. If you know of any way I can avoid $1,000 for roughly 4 days of just using a place to sleep, that'd be fantastic, but I knew that was definitely a good possibility. If someone is going as well and would like to split the cost of an airbnb I would absolutely be down for that. Home accessibility really doesn't matter at all. I usually always have someone who is willing to help carry me up/down stairs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard that it's a pretty dicey area, but I know that shit can happen anywhere. Are people exaggerating, or should I be a little extra vigilant? 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I'll also be with my parents and sister, but a full weekend pass was $365 and they won't be coming with me to the event. We just figured we'd all go to Houston for a small vacation.  Any suggestions on how I can make sure that they also have a blast? Attractions, best food, entertainment, etc. Bonus points for any nearby comedy open mic places for me. It'll be from the 27th to the 29th, but we may show up a day or two early.

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all help or suggestions/advice would be incredibly appreciated :)",houston,Visiting Houston for the first time at the end of March for Skankfest. Advice/help please?

We got through the opening band (Piñata Panic, from San Antonio, they were really fun) and during the break my partner went to use the women's bathroom. Inside, they were physically accosted by a drunk woman. She cornered them, put her hands on my partner's stomach, and put her arm over their shoulders. She told them, ""I bet this makes you horny."" My partner got out of the bathroom and told me about what happened. We immediately spoke to security.

I don't know if this is so wildly uncommon for the House of Blues to encounter, but needless to say nothing was done. Security walked the woman out, then let her back in moments later. We left. We felt unsafe. There's someone there, right now most likely, who cornered someone in a bathroom, put their hands on them, said sexually explicit things them, and nothing will happen because of it.

I don't know what I want out of this post. I guess I just want to get it out there. If you go to the House of Blues, be safe and be vigilant. Security won't be there to help you and good luck if they even act like they believe you.

I have order confirmation for it! The tickets are picked up through will-call at the hotel upon arrival and I will transfer the package to your name through the official vendor that sells the travel packages- valley music travel (VMT). I'm asking $3,000 which means I will be losing a bit since I will have to pay the vendor to transfer the tickets to your name. If anybody knows of anybody looking for housing and tickets to Coachella this is the perfect package, please message me if interested.

Any crawfish festival that says ""All You Can Eat"", specially in February, is likely a scam, so look out. This one had tons of ads on Facebook from one of the major newspapers (I think the Chronicle?) 

We got there around 3 hoping to eat some crawfish and get out of there, as I think everyone in the group grew increasingly weary of it. There were HUGE lines to get in, this event was way oversold. And they didn't start letting people in until roughly 30-40 minutes after it was supposed to open, and there was a consistent line the whole time I was there that moved slow...and doubly slow because the only exit was the entrance, which was a clusterfuck. Once you got in, you had to wait in a stupid long line to get a half pound, maybe a pound of unseasoned probably cold crawfish, and had to wait in the line again to get anymore. There were only two of these stations for this with stupid large lines.

Our ""VIP"" ticket promised a table and a server. We at least had a table (not reserved, but an extra area with tables) but no waiter. Long lines for water and beer too. And some mediocre cover bands playing and that was it. There were other food trucks there that people were going to instead because of the wait for the crawfish. Thing was a mess. And when we left around 530ish there was still a huge line wrapped around the park. I'm guessing they certainly expected people to be leaving after a short time because the lines were so long that there's no way they had a safe amount of people in that tiny park if they let everyone in. Plus as mentioned, the exit was the entrance which created a mess. Very surprised if this thing wasn't shut down by a fire marshal. 

I honestly kind of assumed it would be like this and only went because I felt bad for my friend needing to fill his spots for his ticket, but man, that was a mess. It was put on by Green Light Events and this is a PSA to be weary of them or any all you can eat crawfish fest in the future. 

The facebook page for the event is filled with similar reviews.",houston,"The ""King of Crawfish"" Festival yesterday was terrible and basically a scam"

I have been googling around trying to find out more information about the ballot propositions during this Primary Election. I found the Association of Texas Professional Educators website to be helpful in explaining:  [https://www.teachthevote.org/news/2020/02/07/beyond-candidates-2020-texas-primary-ballot-propositions/](https://www.teachthevote.org/news/2020/02/07/beyond-candidates-2020-texas-primary-ballot-propositions/)

 An excerpt:

""In many elections ballot propositions pertain to bonds, referendums on local ordinances, or even constitutional amendments. But ***what are ballot propositions*** with regard to primary elections? Perhaps the best definition I’ve seen comes from the Republican Party of Texas website, which states as follows:

&gt;*“Keep in mind that \[ballot propositions are\] an opinion poll of \[primary\] voters and not a policy referendum. When you vote YES or NO, you are telling us what you think should happen. You are not voting to make a law but merely saying you agree or disagree with the statement.”*

Each party, Republican and Democratic, has put forth a set of value statements and is asking those who vote in the party’s primary to give their opinion on those statements.""

I am a current student at Rice University looking to interview a Midtown resident for my neighborhood study. I'm looking at natural disaster infrastructure in the area, focusing specifically on how the infrastructure has held up and affected the Midtown neighborhood/community following Hurricane Harvey. I'm looking for a resident (preferably long term) that has lived in Midtown, has an opinion of the neighborhood's culture (good or bad), and, of course, was in Houston and in the Midtown area during Harvey. The interview would be about an hour long, in-person (and preferably at the Rice campus, although we could meet at a Starbucks in the Midtown area), and happening sometime during the week of the 9th or the 16th.

I have been so excited about adopting a doggy from the HSPCA and all I wanted was a mid-size Shepherd at least 2 Yrs old.  My SO finally agreed to get a dog and on Saturday, I woke up super early to be first at the HSPCA.  I found my doggy, Shepherd mix, mid-size, 3 yrs old.  I fell in love, and was so excited.  My SO clearly saw how my whole persona just changed completely.

I went to the Management office months before and asked what exactly they needed from me, vaccinations, spray/neuter records, and a picture.  They briefly spoke about restricted breeds and I gave them my specifications and they were like you should be fine!  I never received a list of the restricted breeds.  Finally, after picking out my doggy, I go to the office and the only associate there asks for the papers.  Well, apparently Chow-Chow is a restricted breed!!!

Now I am not stupid, but I only have a general mental list of restricted breeds, German Shepherds (which they approved when I first moved in), Rottweilers, Dobermans, Pitbulls, etc.  My doggy does not even look like a Chow Chow, so I went back to the HSPCA and they removed it from the paperwork.  We went back, and the associate refused to take the paperwork and basically escalated things.  

Finally, my SO goes back on Monday, and speak to one of the manager's and explains the situation.  The Manager was like ""Oh, if the HSPCA doesn't deem him a dangerous dog, and you have paperwork to show it then it should be no problem!.""  So we are waiting on a determination. 

In the meantime, I have been diagnosed with PTSD and Anxiety.  And in retrospect, it has gotten worse after my doggies passed of old age about 2-3 yrs ago.  They were about a yr apart and both died at 16.  If it does not go that way, I want to get help on how to have him make him an Emotional Support Animal the right way.  Pics of the doggy in comments.  I've been in this community for approximately 6 yrs. we love it, but I feel that our last resort is moving in order to be with the doggy.

Any advise will help!!

TL;DR: make sure to get with you Leasing office and obtain a restricted breed, the HSPCA will work with you if you find your doggy but your Leasing office may not.",houston,"UPDATE: I posted about adopting a dog by February, please help!"

Due to some personal issues, I have decided to move away and live alone in a 1B1B unit preferably in SW houston inside the loop but honestly anything within a 15-20 mile radius of UTHealth in the TMC is what I need. I am not tied to living in the med center and honestly would prefer a different neighborhood anyways.

I am not originally from here but have kind of familiarized myself with the neighborhoods within the past few months. I love the montrose/midtown/museum area but those apartments seem to all be out of my price range. I am looking to stay under $800/$850 for rent per month.

I am very concerned about safety being a woman living alone as well as pests. I have heard that older complexes carry pests more so and I know the cheaper the less safe USUALLY. So I know reddit can give me the tea on places.

Some complexes I liked but am not sure about are The Crossings at Berkley Place, Chateaux Dijon, and  The Village at Piney Point. The second one is in [St. George](https://St.George) neighborhood by the galleria close to Richmond which I know can be kinda crime heavy. The first is off N.Braeswood and the last is off Westheimer.

It used to be a very quiet residential street until that club opened. Now on weekend nights, and even sometimes during the week. They have very loud music and DJs and it’s loud enough to make it hard to sleep. I’ve clocked 60+ decibels from inside my apartment at 11:30PM. Also, the guests at this club hang around outside and make even more noise on their own. They yell at each other down the street, honk their horns because traffic moves slow down the street now, or blast music in their cars with all the windows down. They’ve even started parking their cars up on the sidewalks or in my apartments “no parking zone” loading dock area. 

I’m just wondering if there’s anything we can do to get them to keep the noise down. I understand it’s a business and they are popular, and that’s great.

What should I do next? Should I go for a Masters/PhD? Should I look into the medical field? MD Anderson? Should I stay in oil? Does Houston have green chemistry? Am I even qualified to work with solar panels/wind turbines, or is that chemical engineers?

We’ve been working the past few months to expand our app Drinker's Edition to Houston from Louisiana, and finally got the update out on Wednesday night.  I think about 20 minutes before Tom Hanks made his announcement and they cancelled the NBA. But, for anyone who is still going out eating &amp; drinking (and please tip big if you are, one of us is a bartender who’s already being hit by the slowdown), check it out, and find a good spot! And if you’re staying in, you know, plan ahead for a celebratory post iso happy hour, you’ll deserve it. 

Also, this is our first expansion out of Louisiana into a really big market, and any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Further the members are not reimbursed the lost time on their membership.

LA can’t claim force majure so their case for doing this is weak at best. So if anyone wanted they could easily make this into class action as far as I can tell.

“  TEXAS BARBECUE STRONG

     I've done two things for a living in my adult life.  1.  Serve our country in the United States Air Force.  2. Cook Barbecue.   The next 15 days will be the most stressful of the restaurant industries life. No restaurant is fully prepared to go from a sit down establishment to strictly 100% togo.  We all understand that this has to be done but it doesn't make it easy without any warning or preparation.  During this time we ask for your continued support.  Here at Roegels Barbecue we pride ourselves on not only putting out great barbecue but also providing you a clean and safe environment to enjoy your meal. Being forced to close our dining room and only being able to serve togo orders is heartbreaking for me and my team.  We love looking over the counter and seeing you all enjoying the meal that we have prepared for you. 
      We will be making some menu changes for the time being to make it easier for you all to come and get some ""grab and go"" ROEGELS BARBECUE.   

Feel free to call ahead or email me your order. We will do our best to have it ready when you get here.

4862,4862,Commentwoanxiety,1584476425,fkcb34,Nan,"My specialty department is closing down thanks to the hoarders. All the trucks need the space for grocery items that you guys keep buying. So we won't get any product in for who knows how long. I actually still have product in the freezer I can make but they don't want me to because other parts of the store need help. If you want items from specialty departments remember you're not getting them because of the hoarders. If everyone buys bottled water for example, then that's what they are going to send in mass. No deli, bakery, seafood or floral. No sodas, just multiple trucks of bottled water, canned goods and toilet paper.

They sent me to help bag groceries today. For some reason this really triggered my social anxiety. In my department I'm fine because I'm use to doing my skill and talking with customers about my department. Even when they throw a hissy fit I'm still semi OK because I can laugh about it later. But today I was scared someone would yell at me because I bagged their groceries wrong. I felt so awkward without my apron and with my hair down getting in my way. I don't worry about makeup in my department so that's not part of my routine. Yeah I talk to customers but I'm not constantly exposed to them like up at the front. So I already felt awkward and my anxiety was acting up. 

The first 2 hours bagging the customers weren't so bad.  People were very nice. A lot of people said thank you. Usually when people tell me thank you I just say your welcome or thank them back without much of a thought. When I was just sanitizing things the day before I didn't think much of it either. Just cleaning around the store was boring and I hated it. A couple people said thank you but I was angry and bored out of my mind so I didn't care. But I really appreciated the people who said thank you to me when I was bagging. Because it meant they weren't mad about how I bagged things. I tried to put things together that were the same and double bag the glass stuff and not squish anything. But I'm not used to bagging so I was awkward and slow. Plus some people were buying tons of stuff. They'd still be loading their groceries onto the belt and I would be running out of room for everything! I felt so overwhelmed. Some of the cashiers scanned stuff so fast. One kept scanning as all the groceries collided together then got mad at me. Then the customer got mad at me. Some cashiers told me to do stuff I had never done before and acted like I was stupid. Some threw customers tote bags at me. One nice guy opened them all first before scanning but another older lady just threw 5 of them at me. Some of the customers were very rude and picky about how their stuff was bagged. One just threw a fit and started ripping bags open to re bag them.

It was especially hard when the customer wouldn't give me their cart to put things in. Or had a tiny cart for tons of stuff. Some were still loading stuff onto the belt but a lot of people just kept their carts way back and to themselves for no reason. Then I had no were to put the groceries and got overwhelmed. 

So in short be nice to everyone exposing themselves so you can buy your groceries. People are getting pulled out of their specialty departments and have to do other things they aren't used to.

Sister's wedding day arrived and leading up to this day, everyone was telling me I should eat more, enjoy myself, enjoy a cheat day so I started the night before the wedding....and how it reminded me how much I loved eating with no limits.. so that continued for a few days telling myself I would stop each day so I don't gain too much weight. 

However I looked back at the day of the wedding and noticing how a lot of the people who are overweight/obese were happy...and I wasn't...so that's what kept me continuing to eat. 

I'm not even down about gaining weight, I'm just down about not knowing what the fuck to do to look forward to everyday besides food. 

I know I needed therapy but it was too expensive for me, hell one therapist quoted $95 a session and recommended 2 sessions a week. That's over $700+ dollars a month!! So I tried to figure this out myself but nope...I'm going to have to do therapy.

So I left from Houston to Miami, from there I I drove to key west. and 4 days later (today) i flew from key west to houston with layover in orlando. i actually was pretty happy because i thought orlando should be safer due to disney closures, but i didnt bother to check the exact dates.

on the way there no biggie, if i didnt know from the media i wouldn't suspect anything going on. island stores are similar to ours tp and water is gone, but not everywhere. (i did mostly fishing and we cooked our own catch, didint go to restaurants or other attractions, just basic supply run for water and spices). 

anyway, getting to interesting part now. SO MANY PEOPLE tried to go to  orlando before it closed, it boggled my mind. on the flight from orlando to houson person next to me was coughing heavily and tried his hardest to suppress it to the extend his face was red half the the time. i didnt speak much to him, until we met again at the baggage claim and we exchanged few words about how we keep meeting, and he said he was coming back from disney before it visited with his family. i said i mostly fished etc. 

ok well they risked, went to disney its ok. now i catch a shuttle to the spot parking lot, and 2 other families join us, and it was pretty silent until we got to the lot and it was very empty. its hard to estimate but JFK the spot, i'd say was at 20% capacity. so i broke the silence i said that i never seen lot empty like that, then few others joined in saying same thing. and then i mentioned how a guy in my next seat was traveling from disney before it closed. at that point father of young family says we went to disney too, and i kinda felt like an asshole for pointing it out. so to break the awkwardness i said jokingly that if i get sick I'll blame them and laughed out loudly (not that loud). and the dude responded: its okay, if u want to knwo the truth we came back from the cruise last week too. 

dead silence in the shuttle. faces turned pale. i didint have anything to say at that point too.. i was glad they stopped at my car first and gtfo'ed to clorax all my luggage. heh. 

TLDR: lots of people dont give a fuck and travel to heavily crowded places. im part of the problem too (altho give me a break, i got invited by CEO to fish dry tortugas. I can’t say no to that.)

also, we agreed to quarantine ourselves when we get back home with CEO's blessing, so there is that.",houston,houstonian reality check. my observations from recent travel.

They will only test in-house if we are admitted in the hospital, and will only be paid to be off work if we are told to go home because we had direct contact with someone that tests positive. Everyone knows there are not enough tests, and they are taking advantage of that knowing we can't easily be diagnosed aside from the symptoms (which take days to appear). They are also not documenting who are screening, only when we are at certain locations, making it near impossible to trace if we had direct contact with someone, despite being in personal-space-range of people who are sick.

I feel like the US overall has been lulled into a false sense of security due to the overall lack of testing. Here in the Houston area, we've been told that there were a small handful of cases in Fort Bend due to a Egyptian cruise, and a few other presumptive cases scattered around Houston. Sure, the number is growing, but to the average dolt, less than a hundred cases in a population of 2+ million is nothing to be too concerned about.

Now that is testing is being rolled out, however, I expect those positive numbers to skyrocket and put us right in line with what's being seen in the UK and parts of Europe. People being shocked to learn they're symptomless carriers, or that the dry cough and fatigue they've had for the last week was just allergies.

Seeing as I will have a lot more down time with the quarantine and all, I would like to take another cut at the list.  I have tried a ton of these places since then and have a better feel for the landscape in general, but that being said the entire point of this list is to get a crowdsourced list from the community.  I hope the list gets popular again and we can patronize some of the places trying to stay above water given the worsening situation .

Please feel free to chime in opinions below on newer places that may not be included on list, any big exclusions from my initial list, places that have tailed off badly in quality and should be re-reviewed.

5263,5263,Aqepoty,1584805067,fmgswx,Nan,"TXRX is raising funds and looking for volunteers to help with supply chain/purchasing, sewing, laser cutter operation, and 3D printing.

On March 19, (36 hours ago) TxRx  launched the manufacturing of face shields, washable procedure masks with disposable inner filter, replacement n95 respirator, replacement Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR), and substitute Tyvek suits.  This equipment is in critically short supply and Houston will need literally thousands and thousands of these items to protect our front line medical works.

Right now TxRx is running this operation on a shoestring with a handful of volunteers who are working around the clock.  Within 24 hours of launch, they have produced high quality face shields, and have gotten approval from a local hospital for TxRx-designed and manufactured face masks.

I have tried to share their GoFundMe link here, but the post was automatically removed. If you search “TXRX” on the GoFundMe website, you’ll see their fundraiser.

TxRx is a non-profit “maker space” which already runs on a shoestring.  They need to raise $50,000 ASAP in order to build an inventory of raw materials of 3D printer plastics (PLA), clear plastic for the face shields, clothe for Tyvek protect suits, and specialized filter material for N95 face masks.

In addition to financial resources, TxRx needs volunteers who can help out in the following areas:

Crowdsourced 3D Printing: TXRX needs makers who own 3D Printers to help them print parts for face shields. After you have printed 25+ you can drop them off at the lab, or they can have a volunteer come pick them up. 

Supply Chain and Purchasing - some of the materials are in short supply, and TxRx needs a dedicated volunteer who can work around the clock sourcing materials. 
                             
Crowdsourced Sewing – TxRx is going to stand a program of volunteer and professional sewers who can make masks and protective suits in their homes.  TxRx will supply pre-cut materials and instructions.  TxRx needs volunteers to distribute materials and collect finished products (details to follow, but we hope to be in business by Monday morning).
 
Laser cutter operators – TxRx needs these folks to work at TxRx.  Some skills in this area will be helpful.",houston,"TXRX Labs Begins Manufacturing PPE, Medical Equipment"

5343,5343,HTXLFC,1584843034,fmrylt,Nan,"Just a few tips and comments from your neighborhood E-commerce manager. 

I won’t name the grocery store I work for, I just wanted to give a few tips for people placing drive up and go/ delivery orders. 

We have tons of orders coming in most of which are new customers(to our online services)

Help us Help you, when placing an order adding shopper notes about items help us a lot and will allow us to do more for you. 

Example: you want a box of barilla penne pasta, if you add a note saying any brand of penne pasta will be fine. You will most likely end up getting a box penne pasta. If you don’t add a note, we check to see if you allow substitutions, my team has been notified to be more lenient on this. meaning if we didn’t have the barilla penne in stock, we would give you the store brand or another penne we had. If the item is more expensive than what you ordered we scan the shelf barcode for the item you wanted, so you won’t be overcharged(not supposed to do this but I’m trying to make sure people get as many items as I can for their orders)
-if you put  “no substitution” then i’m very limited on what I can do for your order. -


Order times: If you really want TP or high demand items it’s best to choose the earliest time slot, as we shop those orders 3-4 hours before the pick-up/delivery time

If you want dairy/meat/produce, the 10am-5pm slots are better as our perishable trucks have not been coming until 8-9am sometimes later. We do try to call customers and ask if they’d be okay picking up at a later time if we see there’s a lot of produce or anything that’s coming on the truck. 


charges: The order confirmation email you get is NOT a receipt, the price it shows is an estimated total. As we shop, we scan available items into the system, the same way scanning items at a register works. If we do not have an item, you will not be charged for it. I get about 10 calls a day asking why they were charged for item that was out of stock. After we finish picking your order, you will receive another email stating your order is ready for pick up along with a receipt that shows any out of stocks we may have had.",houston,Online Grocery Ordering
5344,5344,mytwentythredditid,1584843363,fms1i6,Nan,"About the author: Single white guy in his 30s who got a new 100% remote position and whose lease is about to be up. I have been looking at places to move because I live in New England and I hate it. I grew up in TN and am not liberal/progressive so New England is a bad fit for me in many different ways. My visit to Houston was during the week of 3/8/2020 to 3/15/2020; during the outbreak of TeberculophasyphalAIDS known as COVID-19. That will color some of what happened; mostly traffic.

For those who want a tl;dr: I am not moving to Houston because of the humidity. It was 80 and humid in March. I don’t want to experience July and August. It reminded me of all the summer days in Tennessee I didn’t enjoy, and whenever I move, I want to be able to go outside and visit people. There’s no shortage of things to do in Houston, but I want to be able to walk outside, or ride a bike, without feeling like I’m trying to breathe boiling tomato soup instead of air.

#Where should I live?

Your budget is going to be the biggest deciding factor here, but if you are an engineer, or similar person, who can afford around $1k/mo to spend on rent, then I’d say target Spring, The Woodlands, or Katy. You can, of course, pick other towns, but in general you’ll want to live either north or west of the city. Why? Flooding. The entire land area is one large slant into the sea, and it isn’t until you are outside US-99 that you’re high enough above sea level to not worry quite so much about flooding. Still, check the flood plain maps and insurance claim maps of what happened during Harvey to get an idea of how prone your given choice is to flooding.

And to be clear, I’m not talking about 6 inches of water type flooding. I’m talking about an interstate that was 30 feet in the air relative to the surface roads being completely underwater during Harvey, and that 30-foot water not just being that one highway, but in every direction for at least half a mile. It’s flat in Houston. When it floods, it floods *everywhere*. Take flood risks seriously. 30 feet of water won’t be common, of course, but it can happen, and that’s more than a lot of places can say.

If you like living among trees, go to The Woodlands. If you like the open farmland of Illinois/Kansas, Katy will be much more your speed. That’s really about the only difference between them.

#Home / Apartment Prices

I planned to move into an apartment, but when I moved up to New England, I neglected to look into home prices. I won’t make that mistake again. Unlike where I live now, as you get closer to the city the prices in Houston don’t really seem to go up. $1000/mo in Conroe gets you about the same quality of apartment as it does in Aldine. The Aldine apartment might be a little smaller (like, 50ft^2) but that’s really not anything to worry about.

Once you get under $800/mo or so you might end up finding rent controlled apartment complexes or places you don’t want to live. One feature that is pretty ubiquitous of the nicer apartments (IE: those that are properly maintained, no junked cars sitting out, etc) is that they are completely gated communities. As in, if you want people to visit you, you’ll have to provide them a code to get into the complex’s main gate. And you’ll need to gate in/out after normal business hours. I personally find this concept horrifically annoying.

The reason for this is parking. It’s to prevent random people from using the apartment complex as a parking lot for whatever they want to do nearby. You would think that this means there is a lot of competition for parking spots, but there actually isn’t. It seems more like a solution to a problem that only kind of exists. The biggest thing it keeps out is the people who buy cheap cars, drive them until they break, and then ditch them in the nearest parking spot. It does keep those people out, and that’s the #1 problem for anyone who owns parking spots in Texas.

Homes are super cheap. Homes in a nice neighborhood in Spring will run you ~$220k in a non-masterplanned subdivision. If you go out to Katy you’ll find home prices more in the $350k range. If you’re moving from somewhere in New England, you’ll see these homes and think that they should cost in the $500k-$1,500k range. No exaggeration. Homes here are GORGEOUS for how cheap they are!

#Talk to me about the Tollways

Houston has toll roads. Unlike Boston, you don’t have to use the toll roads just go get in/out of the city in a timely manner. In fact, I ended up driving on the toll way for about 5 miles at one point (to get back to the car rental place near the airport) and I wasn’t charged a toll for that particular stretch of the tollway. Cool!

When I was in Houston it was during the great Toilet Paper Hoarding Simulator event of 2020. Lots of people were working from home / not able to work, so the roads were far, far, emptier than normal. Many posts on /r/houston from the same time period were from locals commenting on how empty the roads were. It is entirely possible the tollways become super helpful for getting around once there is a normal level of traffic. The only people I saw actually using the tollways were people who wanted to drive &gt; 100 MPH. That’s not a joke.

#Driving in/near Houston

The road network is very well laid out. There are ‘feeder’ highways that run parallel to the interstate at 45mph, and every 2-3 miles there is a place to get on/off the interstate. If you miss your exit, you can drive forward 2-3 miles, take a loop through the underpass, and be on the feeder going in the opposite direction to get where you wanted to be. It takes a bit of extra time, but it’s really not bad, and all but ensures people merge onto the highway at speed, rather than causing massive traffic shockwaves at every entrance and exit.

Generally speaking, exist and entrances are done via ‘exit only’ lanes, so if you have “keep right” drilled into you, you’ll want to think of the right-most lane as the ’exit only’ lane, and stay one lane left of that.

But there is one drawback to Houston roads: they are LOUD AS FUCK! They used this horizontal cross-hatch pattern in the road surface to help move water off the road during rains, but it has the side effect of making the highways deafening. As in, 100 feet from the highway it’s going to be around 100 db. My hotel room was maybe 300 feet from I-45 and inside the hotel room it was 60 db with the door shut. 60 db, for reference, is about how loud people speak normally, when it’s a 1:1 conversation. Loud PC case fans, or box fans at full-power, typically max out at 52db.

Houston drivers say that driving on the roads there is tough, and traffic can be hard to deal with. If you’ve lived near any large city (NYC, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, etc) you’ll not see a difference from what you’re used to. If you’re coming from a smaller city (say, 1 million people or less) then, yea, it will be a culture shock. The number 1 piece of advice I have for those of you coming from smaller population areas is this: **If your rear bumper is ahead of the front tire of the car in the lane next to you, you own that spot in front of them.** This applies to things like lane changes into exit-only lanes, zipper merging, and lane collapses (right lane ends, left lane ends). It doss NOT apply when there’s a yield sign (IE: getting on the interstate).

When merging onto the interstate, you only own the space if you’re driving fast enough to actually be ahead of them, otherwise, tap that brake and slide in behind them, and accelerate better next time.

One thing Houston had a big issue with was reckless drivers. I’m talking about people who would go 15+ relative to the traffic around them (so, 25+ relative to the speed limit) and then weave across all lanes of traffic. If you spend an hour driving on I-45, you’ll probably see at least 10 people doing this. The way you keep yourself safe when dealing with such people is that before you put your signal on, you look in your rear/side view mirrors and see how fast all the cars behind you are going. If someone is coming up fast, wait to move until they pass. Then, when you think it’s safe to move, you put your blinker on, move over confidently, and wait to hear a car horn. The reckless people will invariably honk because how dare you not notice them cutting over 3 lanes of traffic at 90mph! The blinker is there to tell them how to get out of your way and try to help them not hit you.

Yes, the onus is on them to not cause an accident, but you aren’t Judge Dredd. Your job is not to bring justice to those people, it’s to keep your car moving safely. If they want to be asshats, that’s on them. Let them wreck someone else. Don’t give them a target.

The final thing to be aware of is the car modding culture of (probably Texas, if not just Houston). Here are the car mods you’ll see/need to care about:

1. Wide tire club (tires that stick out past the frame of the vehicle – mostly just aesthetic, not a problem)
2. [Scythed Wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythed_chariot) During my entire time in Houston, I only saw one car with scythed rims, but the scythes stuck out 6-8” from each tire. This is a major liability to both vehicles.
3. Emissions system deletes: Get ready for a lot of smelly car fumes because so many people remove their catalytic converters. “Hey, let’s shit on the environment AND offend the people behind us for 2 more MPG and POWAAAAA!!!” … Grow the fuck up.
4. “Legally meets the requirements of being a muffler”. Lots of muffler mods, insofar as they basically remove the muffler. Less of a problem when driving and more of a problem when trying to sleep and someone drives their mustang by.

#What are the people like?

Super friendly. Everywhere has mean, toxic, and bitter people. But overall, the people in Houston love strangers and are friendly to talk to. They want to know about you and what you’re up to and are happy to have a conversation that isn’t just superficial. If you’ve only ever lived in New England, Chicago, or LA this will be a huge culture shock for you. 

A great example of the difference became apparent when I got back to New England and talked with one of the checkout ladies at the local grocery store. She, like almost all of the New Englanders I know, assumed that the mass hoarding of goods that I saw at HEB and other stores was because people were hoarding for themselves. The reality, though, is that largely those people were hoarding for their communities. See, in Texas, there’s a social contract to keep and eye out for those around you. If you see your neighbor doesn’t have power, you offer them food, or shelter, or heat, or water. Whatever they need. You help your neighbor because they are there. In New England and other liberal areas, people expect the government to provide for these needs, and in turn, they pay the government taxes. Texas has a totally different mindset: it’s the individual’s job to keep the people around them up and going, and the government's job to stay out of their lives.

I want to be clear, both systems have their merits and problems. I want the reader to understand that two very different systems exist. Which one the reader prefers to live under is up to them, but if you move to Texas, you WILL be living in the one that requires you, rather than the State, to provide for basic needs. This is why the taxes are so low. This is why everything is so cheap; so that you can afford to do that. People who have plenty hoard so they can provide to those who don’t have enough. The road to Hell is paved with just as many good intentions as assuming the government could solve the same problem any better.

#What about food?

BBQ is amazing here. Avoid chain restaurants of all sizes. The chains will still be good, but worse than what you could get elsewhere. Rendezvous, in Memphis, TN, remains the best BBQ I’ve ever had full stop. But the BBQ in Texas was at least as good as Rendezvous.

Blue Belle Ice Cream is also a native of Texas; get some. It’s better than Ben and Jerry’s and ½ the price.

#How about parking?

I didn’t need to pay to park anywhere. Now, when visiting the Museum of Natural History, I did choose to park around ½ a mile away so that I could avoid paying to park right at the museum, but that was my choice. In general, you’ll find free parking at/near wherever you want to be. The city is laid out for people to drive around within it, and almost every store or restaurant I saw had a parking lot of some form.

#Public Transit?

It exists, but...seriously, look at the size of Houston on Google Maps, and then compare it to the 4 public transit lines they have. For all indentured porpoises (sic) there is no public transit.

#Is there stuff to do?

Hell yea brother! There’s stuff to do all over. You don’t have to live in Houston to find things to do. There are plenty of dog parks scattered all over, and people are friendly enough that even if you don’t have a dog, you can show up and just talk to the people who are there, while also getting to pet the dogs as they come by. Do wear clothes that can get muddy, wet, and slobbery though. It’s a dog park. Dogs are rarely clean.

There are malls, shopping centers, bars, and other activities in most of the more well-off neighborhoods (indoor Skydiving near The Woodlands and a few others I saw, but don’t remember where). And, if you want to get into the city itself, Katy and The Woodlands are both a 30-40 minute drive or less. K1 racing has indoor electric go-karts that go like 40-50 MPH. It’s hella fun. A bit pricey, but fun. There are plenty of shooting ranges, and they don’t require you to buy your ammo at the range to shoot there.

Meetup.com is fairly useless in the city, but that is a problem with a lack of providers for content, rather than a lack of people who want to participate. Most of the meetup groups want to make money off being a meetup leader. If you just want to hang out with people, make a group, host some events, enjoy people’s company. Or, go to a church (once the Human Malware outbreak passes) and meet people there, if so inclined.

#How about dating?

The couples I saw were all about the same attractiveness. If you can look in the mirror and be honest with yourself, and are attracted to people about the same beauty level as you are, the odds are you’ll find someone without too many problems. If you want to punch above your weight class, regardless of gender, you are going to have a bad time. The city is mostly an app-based dating city though. There are no singles meetups or groups I could find. People tend to either meet ‘in the wild’, at church, or through apps. I see it as a blessing and a curse. It gives you a reason to improve yourself to the point that you are the peer of the person you seek to date, but it also means that if you wanted to trade (overweight, but a good provider) you’re SOL because there’s a good provider who is also attractive just around the corner.

#Closing thoughts

Overall, I like Houston. I’d visit it again, and if I ever win the Bitcoin Lottery, I might have a winter home there. Katy, TX is the exact ideal of the life I want once I find a wife. Whether we have kids or not, both the master-planned and organic subdivisions in and around Katy are the exact type of place I want to live. That said, the humidity is just too much for me to deal with year round. I’ll need to find somewhere more north to live until I’m rich. Thoughts on Indiana vs Utah?

Her and I are looking for a place to rent with a few other people, and I'm honestly not really sure how to go about this. But if anyone needs roommates, we really need somewhere to live. 

Our budget isn't very high, maybe $300-$450 monthly. Neither of us are rich, but I'm good at cooking and baking if you're a foodie. I don't take up a lot of space and can keep a low profile.

Long time reader, first time poster here...

My partner and I had twin boys here in Houston a little over a week ago. They came a month early due to complications and they are so tiny, but in good health, getting stronger and putting on weight well.

I am hoping for a little support from the community in the form of hand sanitizer/alcohol wipes/travel size Lysol (if there is such a thing) to help us all get back to CA safely, for the 4 of us but also for the boys 5yo sister on the other end. You can imagine, being in an unfamiliar place, with pre-term newborns, in these times, looking for some of the most sought after products... we are trying to keep it together, but we are a bit at our ends. I was able to order a small box of exam gloves from Amazon, but after the TSA gets their hands all over everything, who knows... So we would like to up our game a little. 

Please feel free to DM me with questions or to set up a meet. We are in the Galleria area.

Thank you for your time.",houston,"Just had twins in your beautiful city, need a little help before we board a flight home."

Keeping you updated on the latest confirmed active cases in the Houston Metro area, this post will be edited to reflect new data collected across the region, so check back often.

This [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14KJLmP51BIbYXehB5i9oSLfEsX27Gnu6wKC-XRiehYw/edit?usp=sharing) has raw data compiled from various county public health sites across the metro area if you would like to dig into the reported numbers

\*Note: Harris County confirmed case reports exclude the city of Houston, in order to get an accurate count of active cases in all of Harris County, you must combine City of Houston and Harris County confirmed cases.

\*\*Note: The chart above excludes confirmed ""recovered""  cases, only displaying **active** confirmed  cases and the number of associated deaths.

**March 24** \- started off with a stay a home order issued by Harris County which later in the day saw a spike in positive cases from a large batch of test results. Harris County, including the City of Houston, saw an additional 56 positive cases today. Fort Bend County followed suit in the afternoon issuing their own stay home order after having cases rise by 4. Montgomery County increased their positive cases by 4 and currently is showing 9% of their tests return positive with another 128 tests pending. Brazoria County had 9 positive cases, Galveston 3, Chambers 2 and Liberty holding at one. At this point, every county in the Houston Metro area has at least 1 confirmed positive case identified in Waller and Austin counties.

**March 23 -** saw a jump in confirmed positive cases, adding 29 cases across the Metro area with 2 confirmed recoveries. Of the 7 counties reporting cases, Fort Bend has the largest increase with 13 new cases, however, Fort Bend did not report new cases on Sunday so we can likely attribute the rise to both increased testing and a reporting lag. The city of Houston reported 1 new case and their first 2 recoveries. Harris county (excluding Houston) reported 3 new cases, Montgomery reported 4 new cases, Brazoria reported 2 new cases, Galveston reported 6 new cases and Liberty and Chambers Counties did not report any additional cases. Montgomery is one of the few counties reporting the number of positive (19), negative (117) and pending (147) tests.",houston,Houston Metro Timeline

My friend is helping out restaurants build their own online order flow on their website for curbside pick up and delivery options at no cost to keep restaurants funneling orders. It's about a 24 hour turnaround time to get the site going! 

No need to go through third-party apps for pick up orders who are still taking % of profit. I know some are waiving start up fees &amp; commission for a month, but we don't know how long that will last. For now you can benefit from managing your own online pick up orders without any 3rd party assistance!

Keeping you updated on the latest confirmed active cases in the Houston Metro area, this post will be edited to reflect new data collected across the region, so check back often.

This [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14KJLmP51BIbYXehB5i9oSLfEsX27Gnu6wKC-XRiehYw/edit?usp=sharing) has raw data compiled from various county public health sites across the metro area if you would like to dig into the reported numbers

\*Note: Harris County confirmed case reports exclude the city of Houston, in order to get an accurate count of active cases in all of Harris County, you must combine City of Houston and Harris County confirmed cases.

\*\*Note: The chart above excludes confirmed ""recovered""  cases, only displaying **active** confirmed  cases and the number of associated deaths.

**March 25 -** began the first full day of expanded stay-at-home orders across the metro area with Harris, Fort Benda and Brazoria counties issuing order that went into effect today. Other hard-hit counties including Montgomery and Galveston have yet to issues such sweeping orders. Harris County saw he biggest single day jump ever with 40 additional positive cases identified. The City of Houston saw an increase of 11 new cases. Both Houston and Harris Counties have a current testing capacity of \~250 patients per day. Montgomery and Fort Bend Counties each had 8 new cases while Galveston and Brazoria saw 6. 

CORRECTION: There is a correction to yesterday's count. I erroneously reported an active case in Waller County. This report is not confirmed at this time and has been removed from the list.

**March 24** \- started off with a stay at home order issued by Harris County which later in the day saw a spike in positive cases from a large batch of test results. Harris County, including the City of Houston, saw an additional 56 positive cases today. Fort Bend County followed suit in the afternoon issuing their own stay home order after having cases rise by 4. Montgomery County increased their positive cases by 4 and currently is showing 9% of their tests return positive with another 128 tests pending. Brazoria County had 9 positive cases, Galveston 3, Chambers 2 and Liberty holding at one. At this point, every county in the Houston Metro area has at least 1 confirmed positive case identified in Waller and Austin counties.

**March 23 -** saw a jump in confirmed positive cases, adding 29 cases across the Metro area with 2 confirmed recoveries. Of the 7 counties reporting cases, Fort Bend has the largest increase with 13 new cases, however, Fort Bend did not report new cases on Sunday so we can likely attribute the rise to both increased testing and a reporting lag. The city of Houston reported 1 new case and their first 2 recoveries. Harris county (excluding Houston) reported 3 new cases, Montgomery reported 4 new cases, Brazoria reported 2 new cases, Galveston reported 6 new cases and Liberty and Chambers Counties did not report any additional cases. Montgomery is one of the few counties reporting the number of positive (19), negative (117) and pending (147) tests.",houston,Houston Area Timeline

If you live in that building please contact me, anonymous is okay. I’d love to hear more about your relationship / experience / opinion of the landlord. 

Gonna be honest here trying to find a first hand source to create a compelling argument as to why the instinct to jump to the defense of the owning class is silly. I may be wrong but I believe that if this landlord was a landlord with empathy and a contingency plan, the strike would not have happened the way it did.

Since I doubt one of the 32 residents will come across this reddit, any info on 32 unit buildings or “I know someone who lives there” is a better start than any.

I'm not optimistic that it will happen. 

The magic date I'm looking at is 4/25. It's my hope that on that date the new infection numbers should decrease by that day. 

It's my hope that a sharp increase over the next 3 days will scare people enough to take this seriously.   If not, and I'm looking at you, Gen Z; 4/25 wil be an optimistic scenario.

Todd Ackerman, Dylan McGuinness; Houston Chronicle

March 25, 2020 Updated: March 26, 2020 7:11 a.m.

The person-to-person spread of the coronavirus in the Houston region would peak in two weeks and burn out by mid-May if the stay-at-home order invoked Tuesday is continued until then, according to modeling by local scientists. The total number of cases would reach nearly 3,500.

The modeling, which informed Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo’s order, considered the effect on the spread of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, if she’d taken the stringent intervention immediately or waited a week or two weeks to act. Spread would increase exponentially had she waited, it found.

“From our modeling, it was clear that waiting is not a good thing,” said Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the University of Texas School of Public Health, who conducted the study with a biostatistician at that Houston institution. “The numbers are sobering, but the message is clear: early intervention is better than late intervention and more stringent intervention is better than less stringent.”

The efforts also came a day after Hidalgo’s order closed most businesses and directed residents to stay put, except for groceries and errands. She said she was heeding the warnings of health experts, who’d called for the order to prevent Houston hospitals from being overwhelmed with cases.

The UTHealth modeling, shared with city and county officials Monday, provided data backing the warnings. It found that intervening immediately would limit the number of cases in the region to a peak at about 150 a day around April 7 and stop the spread around May 12. In that time, the cumulative total of cases would reach nearly 3,500, it found.

Cases would peak at more than 1,000 a day on April 15 if Hidalgo had waited a week and more than 6,600 a day on April 22 if she’d waited two weeks. Transmission would last until May 29 under the first scenario and June 16 under the second.

All three of the scenarios are based on the premise the restrictions would continue until mid-May. Hidalgo’s order is scheduled to expire April 3.

The UTHealth researchers are currently conducting modeling research to look at the effect on COVID-19’s spread if the restrictions are lifted after two weeks and after one month. Boerwinkle said he hoped to have that data available by the end of the week.

Boerwinkle and UTHealth colleague Momiao Xiong used artificial intelligence to create the modeling system. A paper on its use to analyze the virus’ spread globally is under review by a top-tier journal. There is no planned publication of the local research, which focuses on not just the Houston area but other metropolitan regions in Texas, because it was done as a service to those communities, said Boerwinkle. The modeling, originally based on the virus’ spread in China and Italy, incorporated the U.S. spread as well. Boerwinkle, former chair of the UT public health school’s department of epidemiology, human genetics and environmental health said the Texas coronavirus picture looked good, at least compared to New York and California, when the team analyzed it March 16th. But by March 23rd, he said, it had taken a significant turn for the worse.

“That’s what got the mayor’s and judge’s attention,” said Boerwinkle. Under the modeling, had Hidalgo waited a week, the cumulative number of cases would climb to nearly 23,800. If she’d waited two weeks, the number of cases would exceed 153,000.

Nine counties — Harris, Brazoria, Fort Bend, Galveston, Montgomery, Austin, Chambers, Liberty and Waller — constituted the Houston region under the modeling. Boerwinkle said if the restrictions remain in place until mid-May, he’s confident the community will have gained enough immunity to the virus that their lifting would result in no more than a small second wave and even smaller third wave, not a major resurgence.

Boerwinkle added that he understands that the burden on health care setting is just one aspect of the issue, that the social fabric and economy are also considerations. “The intervention taken Tuesday is what’s necessary to stem the tide,” said Boerwinkle. “But area residents should know this isn’t like hunkering down for the weekend for a hurricane. This is longer term than that.”",houston,Coronavirus spread in Houston could burn out by mid-May under stay-at-home order; According to University of Texas School of Public Health

&amp;#x200B;

**Offer 1 POTENTIALLY CLAIMED**

I originally signed up for a writing class through WriteSpace that was in-person attendance. I work in healthcare, so once things started becoming serious, I had to drop out (didn't want to potentially expose all my classmates). They were kind enough to offer me my money back as a credit for a future class. Right now all their classes are online, I signed up for a short one since that's all my schedule can handle for the foreseeable future. But I still have a pretty hefty credit left. This is first come first serve, but if you are stuck at home and interested in taking an online creative writing class, please PM me and I can give you the code. If you don't use the full amount, let me know so I can have them re-issue a code for the remaining amount and I can pass it on to someone else too.

The credit would be for: $189.36

These are the classes they offer that are available for you to pick from:

Also, I've been taking language lessons through Skype for the past couple years through [www.italki.com](https://www.italki.com) until my teacher moved off that platform. She's fantastic, so we're doing the lessons independent of that site. But I still have credits specifically for italki lessons. I reached out to them and they let me know that I can transfer these credits to someone else if they make a site profile. If you're interested in foreign language dabbling during this time, now's your chance. You select the teacher for the language you're interested in and you have one-on-one lessons from them through Skype.

The credit would be for $145

Who doesn't have regrets about what they missed out on or how they lived their lives? Sadly, these regrets are just a passing thought as we live our daily lives, until death knocks on our door. An elderly man who lies on his deathbed has a lot of time to think about what he missed out on or should have done differently. His taste for alcohol and money ruled the way he lived, but was that really a way to live? As he lies dying with chronic liver failure, he questions his entire life.

2. Hopefully seek out some more donations from folks to help so hopefully we can get to everyone on the list (we have a huge hill to climb) 

3. Get some testimonials from folks who were helped to encourage people to help more


**Total Families Helped**: 69

**Total Money Sent**: $13,800
(Raised on Venmo + People who sent funds directly to families)

**Raised on Venmo from you all!**: $9,565

**Remainder to disperse from Venmo**: $3,450
(Combination of weekly disbursement caps on Venmo/PayPal/CashApp has made it slow to get money out)

**Families still in line**: 177
**Funds still needed**: $35,400

Notes:
In full transparency we are sharing the numbers to date (3/28/2020, 1:00pm) of the efforts to share $200 grants with people/families affected by employment issues due to social distancing. Caps on various cash transfer apps, and locks on my Venmo/bank account because of automatic fraud alerts, are causing minor logistical issues. But we’re working on getting the money out as fast as possible.

We’re trying to see if there are other groups who can help, but in the meantime:

**If you’re able to sponsor a family directly - send me or u/tejasimo a DM on here and we will connect you!**

**If you prefer to donate, send funds to @Isabel-Longoria on Venmo** or contact me via DM",houston,UPDATE: Helping our Houston homies - small grants to our neighbors

I am a senior in college from Louisiana, taken a summer internship in pasadena tx. I am not familiar with the area (or texas) at all really. If theres anyone whos done something similar, I could really use a hand. I'm not sure if I should be looking at AirBNB (not many options that fit my needs), extended stay hotels, apartment listings on craigslist, or what. 

I am looking for a place with: \~45 minute commute to the pasadena area max during traffic (if possible, can be an hour), a kitchen area with a stove/oven, decent location for events, and ideally a loft for 1 guest. I can pay probably up to 1500/ mo if the boxes are checked. Even if theres something a little bit outside of the houston area that could fit these requirements I'd be in love. I just dont want to live in the center of Houston and have a 2 hour commute (I'm not sure how bad the traffic would muck up the 30 minute usual commute im seeing from Google Maps).

When I was there, I rode public transit quite a bit and biked around. I'm in Spring now, so I probably won't be able to bike much of anywhere, but I've gotten quite spoiled on public transit and not having to get in a car and drive literally everywhere I went.

But at the moment the closest stop-and-ride is 8-ish miles away, at the Spring Park-and-Ride, so just to ride the damn bus downtown I'd still have to buy car insurance and pay for gas and whatever. Cost-wise it's barely even worth it besides the smaller cost savings in gas (which is more than offset by the  cost of insurance,) and really the sole reason would be an environmental one (which I don't mind.) But I'm heckin annoyed at the extra expense at being able to do something that *should* be saving me money.  


I would really, really like to walk/bike to a bus stop and be able to go to school/work that way - rather than drive 8 miles away to do the same thing or just drive straight there myself.

The problem is, the person who fixed the leak went MIA (completed the repair) and now they have no receipt or proof of purchase to submit when turning in the leak adjustment paperwork. My concern is, they are elderly and even if the leak adjustment were to be approved to knock the bill ($4k) down ($2k), this is a lot of money for them to pay at once and would deplete a large portion of their savings. They have no problem paying it as it was a leak on their property but I noticed the payment plan is about 3 months and thats not enough time for them to pay it off.

I am a manager for a local HEB.  I had one of my partners come up to me today to ask if I knew of any cheap computer or laptops (she know's I'm tech savvy). They are in need of a laptop or desktop for her younger kids to do their school work. Money is really tight for them as their spouse has recently been laid off.

Seeing if anyone out there has a old system or laptop laying around that they be willing to part ways with, I'll throw a few bucks your way. Even if it isn't in 100% working condition, I can definitely invest some money/parts into it. I have some spare parts/monitors/keyboards laying around but not close enough for an entire system.

This is an an amazing HEB that does so much for my store behind the scenes.

Thanks ahead of time to anyone willing to help out!

Please learn and try and follow a few general rues of safety and etiquette - makes it a lot more enjoyable and and safe for all of us.

Passing one runner on the far right with you on the far left doesn't require much thought. But with two runners/walkers absolutely calls for an outcry of ""on your left""

Runners/walkers both to the left and right does not give you clear sailing through the middle - even with an ""on your left"". Slow the fuck down until there is sufficient space.

Lots of kid carts being pulled - guess what - they tend to go slower and may back up traffic - tough shit - wait until sufficient space on both sides.

If the trail is slow going and you pass on the actual dirt bayou trail side make sure you communicate - saying ""on your right"" in this case may confuse the shit out of people not used to the whole concept.

Ive been riding/running White Oak for 5 years and this is the most crowded its been by a large factor - but it is what it is and is and probably going to remain very crowded until times change. Definitely tough seeing little kids just having learned how to ride or even on push scooters but people are looking for a release,especially for their kids being stuck in the house - give them a break - its supposed to be the way we always brag about being here in Houston.

And wear a god dam helmet - have seen way more uncovered heads lately - Avoid a crowd and go to a bike shop or buy one on line. Falling of a bike at 20mph or hitting another bike can cause a major head injury.

White Oak is fairly empty early in the morning if you really want to push it and generally not that crowded above 43rd street",houston,Bicycle Etiquette and Safety

Because shortages in medical (name it:  people, supplies, etc) is a guarantee to happen in Houston to some degree at this point.  


Will the majority be fine, yes, but push the message hard out now.  

Post on FB where the majority of naysayers are.  Provide nothing but factual information &amp; credible resources/Links backing up everything you say online, text, etc.  

If you say the words ‘I think’ in an debate on this topic, just don’t say it if going against a non believer.

It’s still sooo early there, so crazy early. Most know that reading this but most around you don’t, MAKE THEM AWARE.

In these crazy times, a lot of places are kind of making things up as we go, and/or offering things that aren't normally offered, so we are trying to find something neat like that. 

We have found a handful of these types of services, but we have found that a lot of them are curbside only. These places consequently are not on the list of Uber Eats or other ride-share delivery services as a result. Is there some kind of way to put in a custom order? In other words, just go pick up my curbside and bring it to me? 

Thanks!",houston,Delivery recommendations and how to navigate custom orders with uber eats?

6636,6636,princexisor,1586013805,fuvhdt,Nan,"If anyone is curious about air quality in Houston, here are some excellent resources:

You can view high quality data on Particulate Matter (PM) and Ozone here: [https://airnow.gov/](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&amp;zipcode=77007&amp;submit=Go)  and enter your zip code.  This is data from state and federal reference  monitors, of which there are a handful of PM monitors and a dozen or so  ozone monitors across Houston.   This is a good website to check on a regular basis, because Houston has  a lot of high ozone days during the summer, and you can save yourself  some lung damage by checking these numbers before exercising outside. 

This is a map of some low-cost ($230) PM sensors: [https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/mAQI/a10/cC0#10.25/29.7637/-95.3631](https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/mAQI/a10/cC0#10.25/29.7637/-95.3631)   These sensors are not as accurate as the reference monitors, and the tend to read higher, especially when temperature and/or humidity is higher (they can't tell the  difference between moisture droplets and other, more harmful  particulate).  But they still provide useful data, and there are more of  them in Houston than there are state monitors, so you get a better  resolution picture.  Plus, you can see thousands of them deployed across the globe.  If you are wondering about that one monitor in Houston that's showing insane PM numbers, that's on one of the houses behind Turkey Leg Hut.

And if you want dig  really deep, there is a truly amazing amount data available directly  from the state's monitoring network here:  [https://www.tceq.texas.gov/gis/geotam-viewer](https://www.tceq.texas.gov/gis/geotam-viewer)   It's not the most user-friendly website, but you can view the map of air monitors in Texas and select a monitor to view all of its data, some of which is real time and some of which takes weeks to get processed and posted.  This is not limited to PM and ozone, it includes hundreds of pollutants, depending on the location.  The data is harder to parse because it is just raw values, and different pollutants are measured in different  ways and at different scales, etc.  I think a city with this much heavy  industry needs better monitoring than we have now, but we do have among the most sophisticated monitoring networks in the country.  It's interesting to see the trace amounts of literally hundreds of different toxic air pollutants just floating around our city.  Nobody has ever studied  low-level exposure to that many different toxics over a long period of  time, but the state has decided that risk is acceptable.  And I'll stop soapboxing because nobody needs more shit to worry about right now.",houston,Local Air Quality Information

I posted this a few months ago and received some great recommendations:

I’m moving to Houston this spring and was wondering if anyone has a recommendation for a psychiatrist. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and taking medication for several years, and I would like to find a new psychiatrist in the Houston area. I’ll be living in Midtown so the closer the better, but I’m happy to travel to someone great. Any recommendations are appreciated! Thank you.

I made an appointment with someone who seems lovely. However, she is not doing online consultations, and I’m living with my significant other who is severely immunocompromised. I just can’t risk his health by interacting with a doctor and assistants who have been seeing multiple patients a day. Does anyone know of a psychiatrist doing online consultations through Skype or whatever? I really appreciate any assistance. Thank you!",houston,Psychiatrists doing online or phone consultations?

M/52/Married / Houston / Writer / Public Speaker / Consultant [http://www.chrisdancy.com/about](http://www.chrisdancy.com/about) 

200K annual small business, Sole Proprietor

All events / consulting canceled through fall 2020

**OPTIONS**:

1. EIDL -10K grant
2. PPP- Forgivable 20K loan
3. Unemployment -3-4K a month
4. Ride It Out with Savings, Deferrals and Expense Reduction
5. Bankrupcy -Wipe out current credit card and other debt, resort to optioin 4.

**PLAN**:  
I created a database to track my options and contacts: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/buj78wjpltuhuz1/CleanShot%202020-04-07%20at%2012.26.51%402x.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/buj78wjpltuhuz1/CleanShot%202020-04-07%20at%2012.26.51%402x.png?dl=0)

**RESULTS**:

1. **EIDL** \- Is not going to workout because it's not 10K, it's just 1K for me, if and when they ever figure it out.
2. **PPP**\-Small banks are only taking their own customers, and my bank Wells Fargo, decided they can't handle the demand.
3. **Unemployment** \-
   1. Filed April 2, 2020-Application number granted.
   2. Check April 3, 2020 -“TWC needs additional information to complete your claim for Unemployment Benefits.""
   3. April 3, 2020 -Start calling and tracking results and options for TWC and Unemployment [https://www.dropbox.com/s/jol4kems2leeuzm/CleanShot%202020-04-07%20at%2011.57.53%402x.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jol4kems2leeuzm/CleanShot%202020-04-07%20at%2011.57.53%402x.png?dl=0) 
   4. April 7, 2020 - Reached operator. **Sole Proprietors need to have TWC MANUALLY** push their claim through. My operator pushed it through. Now I need to wait until the 12th to request payment. N**OTE: TWC has NOT received guidance** from the federal government for INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS / SOLE PROPS for Texas yet. 
4. **Ride It Out** \- I created a view of my monthly bills tied to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs [https://www.dropbox.com/s/roggrgszxg97ber/CleanShot%202020-04-07%20at%2013.12.24%402x.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/roggrgszxg97ber/CleanShot%202020-04-07%20at%2013.12.24%402x.png?dl=0) so I could focus on what HAD to be paid, vs what we could defer or request help on. 
5. **Bankrupcy**\- Investiaging local lawyers and preparing my bills, and debt in another database to attend a 341 hearing to make this process go as quickly as possible.

1. Sign up for an airtable [https://airtable.com/invite/r/qcnqAOMb](https://airtable.com/invite/r/qcnqAOMb)

3. If you need one/one help, I can also walk you through anything via a zoom or phone call. Text messages back and forth make my brain hurt.
4. You will feel alone, you're not. There are people like me who want you to benefit from what we are learning.

197,197,suicideyourdarlings,1586287372,fwqspr,Nan,"Hi! This might be a stretch, but I was wondering if anyone knows anything about a homeless man who assaulted me and some other people (only women, so far as I saw) outside of the CVS at Katy Freeway and Wirt today around 11AM. I'm wondering if he's a known presence/offender around the area.

He was wearing a green shirt and had dark skin, perhaps of southeast asian descent (he may have been black but honestly this happened very fast and I was trying not to make eye contact). He had dark brown ratty hair with - I think - a bit of grey, that was unkempt and stuck out sort of like Chuckie from Rugrats (lol first thing I thought of), and a beard and facial hair. He had an object he was carrying with him, which was sort of in the shape of a long piece of thick wood plank wrapped in what looked like a pink tarp.

I live in ny (left the city to come here for the time being for obvious reasons) and I encounter a lot of homeless people, so I know how to deal when someone is following behind and screaming at me for spare change. I felt more threatened by this guy than I ever have by any stranger on the street in ny or otherwise. It shook me up perhaps more than it should have, given, but this is a relatively well-policed area and I've never known any of the homeless people who hang around to attack anyone in their line of sight (particularly at that CVS, which I've been to hundreds of times since it was built).

I should clarify: \*I\* was not physically assaulted. He screamed and jumped in my face and when I didn't acknowledge him, followed me back toward the store doors while using his body to block my path (I am a young woman). He did physically assault a woman who came in ten seconds after I reentered the store. Yes, I called the police and was told that I was not the only person who reported the incident.

On another note, nobody in the store, customers included, was any help, so big on y'all! I asked a man exiting the store if he could help me to my car and he didn't even look at me, lol. 

Let me know if this is the wrong place to post this. Thanks! Apologies for rambling.",houston,Assault By Homeless Man at CVS Katy Freeway

I have also recorded our progress since he has come home to stay with me. 2 reasons why I post this, 1) doggies only want to be happy. 2) Any pro tips you have I am open to try!

Pros:

Super sweet, cheek kisses are the best (endorphin and oxytocin overload), 

Enjoys walks at the park, super smart (mimics things he's seen humans do 30+ mins before (that's why I know he knows why I'm scolding him when he gets a bad progress report after a walk))

Cutest form of communication, I call it a 'rowl' because it's a mixture between a howl and a growl. By no way is it a form of agression but he lets you know he's upset. Either because you woke him up, or didn't rub his belly, or wants to know where THE F have you been ALL day (work). 

  


Cons: 

Has all these cool new toys but prefers to play with paper towels and shoes! Still training him on that and looking for toys that better fit him 🤔.

No respect for personal space! JK that is definitely a PRO we love snuggling with him!!! 😍🥰😍🥰. 

  


Progress report:

He is no longer barking at the neighbors passing by (except during late hours) and learning the 'Rules of the road'. That is, no barking at joggers and cyclists at the park. 

No longer nipping for attention, knows that snuggling will get it STAT. 

Like young infants, when I leave the room, I have ceased to exist until I reappear. I find him laying on the floor upset waiting if I will come back.

Learning how to keep himself entertained u loved chasing squirrels.

Still cute as ever. 

Life quality for me 1000% improvement hope it is the same for him.

I feel retarded, for a few years now I've struggled with itchy eyes, boogery nose, constantly rubbing my nose. 

I was speaking to a friend last week and mentioned to him how it's hard not to touch your face when your eyes and nose are always fucking itchy!! 

He asked me why, and I had honestly not thought about it. I just thought it was normal? It would come and go, looking back on it I assume it would depend on the pollen count.

Anyway, based off his advice I started popping one Benadryl with my breakfast since I'm quarantined and if I get drowsy it doesn't matter at all... and I feel so fucking alive! For 3 years I've struggled with this shit. My nose cleared up almost instantly, I can breathe through it! And I barely touched my face or itched the fuck out of my eyes.  

Not Sure what pollen it is, or what I'm actually allergic to, but almost 40 years of my life never bothered me. 

Anyone else just pop allergy pills every day? Is there a better alternative to Benadryl? Any more advice to an absolute retard of a human who just realized he hasn't been constantly sick for years and just has allergies?",houston,Just found out all these years I just have allergies

**Question 1:**  for a contactless delivery, if I leave a tip in an envelope outside the door (under the mat, taped to the door, whatever), are y'all worried about germs on the envelope or money inside?  Would it make it better if I included a note saying I'd doused everything in my hand sanitizer, which is why it may smell like bourbon?  Would you rather the envelope be in a sandwich bag?  Or does it even matter to you?  I'm trying to be extra careful and want to make sure y'all stay safe too, and I'm gonna fucking tip if you're delivering stuff.  

**Question 2:**  if I were to leave a little bottle of hand sanitizer out for you, but it's in an unmarked travel bottle, would you take it if I put a note on it saying what it is?  I have a very large bottle from a distillery and a shit ton of little unused travel bottles (for some reason).

 Houston’s NRG Stadium, which was just slated to hold the Houston Rodeo before it was cancelled, will go under transformation to become an ancillary medical site.

Earlier this week, construction crews began to create a medical shelter to help hospitals in the Greater Houston area who are currently trying to handle the surplus of patients due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. According to Community Impact, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo told reporters that hospitals within the area were operating at 70% capacity, citing reports from first responder data system The Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council.

The site will be set up in the NRG Stadium parking lots, rather than inside. This will help prevent respiratory illnesses from spreading as deconstruction of rodeo facilities is still underway. Hidalgo said that she hopes it doesn’t get to a point where[(read more.....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/04/nrg-stadium-medical-site/)",houston,NRG Stadium To Serve As Ancillary Medical Site

4. Requested payment the first day i could 

5. March 30th my payment was transferred 

6. Although i have direct deposit, my first check was mailed to me.

7. The next day i got an email correspondence saying “you were mailed documents that can’t be emailed” - this was my check. Even on the payment status, it said “amount deposited”.

They said the estimated wait time was 11. In the words of Maury, THAT was a lie. 

It took 3.5 hours on hold, but I finally got through! You can and should file online, but I had to call to file a complaint against my previous employer not reporting my wages at all in the time I worked there during 2019. Several thousands, just not reported at all, which kept me from qualifying because they said I didn’t “make enough.”

Anyway, that’s what I did. It’s the only way I could get the phone to ring and it finally paid off.

Houston-based restaurateur Tilman Fertitta is in search of a lender to provide a massive cash infusion to keep his massive hospitality empire afloat.

Fertitta is reportedly [willing to pay a whopping 15% interest to any lenders that are willing to offer him a $250 million “lifeline” loan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-06/landry-s-brings-first-u-s-leveraged-loan-in-almost-a-month), according to Bloomberg. In addition to this potential loan, Fertitta, who is worth more than $4 billion, has put $50 million of his own money into the company in an effort to keep the hundreds of restaurants he operates under the Landry’s umbrella, including the recently acquired chains Del Frisco’s and The Palm, along with his Las Vegas casinos. 

This isn’t the first desperate measure that Fertitta has taken, either. Earlier this month, [his company furloughed more than 40,000 workers](https://houston.eater.com/2020/3/25/21193867/tilman-fertitta-furloughs-40000-employees) across the country. Before that, Fertitta’s company sparked outrage after employees at his posh Post Oak Hotel in Houston were told that they would not be able to take any paid time off for the foreseeable future. The company eventually [walked back that decision](https://houston.eater.com/2020/3/18/21185488/tilman-fertitta-eliminates-paid-time-off-post-oak-hotel-employees) for employees who were not impacted by furloughs.",houston,"Tilman Fertitta willing to pay 15% interest on $250,000,000 ""lifeline loan"" needed for hospitality empire"

Keeping the #houston love alive with our #gratefuldead #houstonrockets #stealie mashup with lyrics taken from the widely popular song, ""Truckin"" by Jerry Garcia and company.

Lyrics: Robert Hunter

Music: Jerry Garcia/Bob Weir/Phil Lesh

The full lyric is ""Dallas got a soft machine

Houston too close to New Orleans"" and pretty much everybody and their mother knows this one even if you aren't a hard core fan of this type of music.

""Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, and James Harden have been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the Rockets, for a total of four MVP awards. The Rockets, under general manager Daryl Morey, are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to sabermetrics in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.""

457,457,RefinedElephant,1586570502,fyu70a,Nan,"My favorite part of Houston is the food and the people. We are a unique melting pot of Texas and the rest of humanity. I've been looking for ways to support and sustain what I believe represents the heart of Houston: our world class restaurant scene. 

The two ways I have found to do this so far are:

1) Buy ready-made means from your favorite restaurants via H-E-B. Houston staples such as Underbelly Hospitality from big name chef's like Chris Shepard are available for pick up at your local H-E-B with all proceeds going directly to the restaurants. This just make sense and I hope it continues even after things get back to normal. Shout out to H-E-B for supporting some of Texas's most beloved restaurants and for being the best grocery store on the planet (#H-E-B2020). 

2) Buy take-out meals directly from small family owned restaurants through store websites instead of apps like Grubhub. ***These middle man delivery companies can take as much as 25% or more from each online order***. This means more expensive food for consumers and less income per meal to the mom and pop joints who need our support right now. Some organizations are proactively trying to help restaurants that don't have big name chefs but are just as important to what makes up Houston's identity. Local business have started doing weekly features on local restaurants - such as this one by Houston Properties Team on Nara Thai. This restaurant is a personal favorite of mine for ordering take out when I don't feel like cooking after a long day of working from home. 

Link to the weekly video featuring Nara Thai, it's a short video and there is a drawing for a $50 gift card for take out from Nara Thai-  [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1082558265454493](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1082558265454493)

This bird has gone to The Wildlife Center of Texas where it is being evaluated for any current injuries and either a previous injury to the back or hip with possible nerve damage versus having a genetic bone disorder (I'm presuming they suspect something like hip dysplasia).

Paul has a video clip of the fall. The bird fell and then got caught in the squirrel guard at the base of the tree. Paul was able to free the bird from the squirrel guard. 

It then ""ran"" away, rather than trying to fly or even flap away, so Paul thought it might be injured and caught it in a cast net. He also called The Wildlife Center of Texas to collect it.

Paul himself, who is 80, suffered and hand injury when the bird- who didn't grab the branch very well- did manage to grab Paul quite well! 
Paul got medical treatment and a Tetanus shot and is healing. 

Interesting, The Wildlife Center of Texas reported that they had been watching Paul's video clips and had concerns about this younger bird: that it didn't stand much and that they were concerned that it has suffered an previous injury, but that they also generally don't interfere unless necessary, and that they hadn't felt it necessary until Paul called about the fall from the nest.

Looking at the video of the fall you can see that the bird had difficulty grabbing onto a branch. It's sibling seems to have given it a final push! (They aren't all that nice to each other, which is normal.)

So this bird is now in the good hands of The Wildlife Center of Texas being evaluated and a treatment plan developed. 

It is unlikely that this bird will be returned to the nest- it needs testing and treatment. They expect a 6-12 month stay.

That bird is huge! 
Lots of pics and videos on the ""Paul White Webster, Texas"" Facebook page (the only place he posts about ""Ma and Pa Webster"").

Getting an FHA loan with 3% down = 7.5k cash. With pmi, you are probably looking at $1900 a month mortgage. Now, a 250k townhome does afford you the ability to have a roommate, with $800 all Bill's paid contract, you can find a responsible roommate and be under the 1200 a month you are currently paying.

We want something that's been simmering in a pot all day with simple ingredients, not some factory-made crap that came off the back of a Sysco truck. So local joints, not regional or national chains. We generally like taquerias, as they cook it old-school. You can generally count on a H-Town taqueria to have a pot of soup simmering on a burner all day, with chunky-cut carrots, onions, and squash, rice and limes on the side. When you order, you're always gonna be asked ""pierna o pecho""- leg or breast, dark meat or light. I've never been turned down when I reply ""vegetariano"". It's not vegetarian, I'm just asking for more soup and no meat. The Tepatitlan group has suffered quality issues from store to store owing to ownership changes but the location under 59 at Chimney Rock is a consistent pleaser. La Tapatia, too, though the original Montrose location is much more consistent than the one out by the Galleria. Teotihuacan on Bellfort is better than the other two locations. Used to be, all I'd ever order at Andy's (on 11th in the Heights) was the carne guisada when I was drunk but it turns out that their soup is pretty good, too. Spanish Flower, Ruchi's, Antonio's (Bellaire and Buffalo Speedway; it was a longshot, I know) are no-gos now for us.

659,659,johnwhicker,1586824656,g0vcsa,Nan,"Can anyone please share their personal experience or guidance on a full house DIY solar system project?  I've done some research and based on my math if I go with any external company I will end up paying 60% or more in profit margin and it will take me around 30 years to break even.  Don't get me started trying to understand why so expensive.   That being said I am inclined to go the DIY route as I can source the material and labor in a very reasonable priced way.  This system is just the panels connected to the house and back into the power grid via the inverter, no batteries.

But the key to this entire DIY project to be truly successful and cost reasonable is securing the service of a qualified and experienced master licensed electrician who can supervise the job, do all the paper work, permits and make the final connection into the inverter and the electric grid.  I wonder if anyone can recommend such individual and what the price for this service will be. Below are the details related to the licensed master electrician work where he/she will need to supervise all these 5 steps and do some of the work in these steps as well.

1. Design and size your **system** based on energy needs.
2. Purchase your **solar** equipment (**solar** panels, inverters, racking)
3. Install the racking or mounts for the panels.
4. Connect the **solar** panels to your racking equipment.

Hi y’all!

Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during this time.

I am going to be moving to the area soon, coming from the space coast of Florida. 

I am a biracial female. I also don’t really know much at all about the area. What is it like living in this area? I will specifically be moving to Porter if anyone can provide insight on that, but I have friends in Humble and Kingwood (well my boyfriend’s friends, also he is white if that matters). I am planning on being a social worker in the area so I’d love to just get any insight on the culture and people in this entire area! 

Also, is there any social media groups or pages I can join for the area? For example my town has their own little facebook group they run that I always get a kick out of.

814,814,Truthamania,1586997786,g24o6p,Nan,"I say this with the upmost respect, because I know all of our lives have been turned upside down unexpectedly by this climate. And I know that the year's worth of work that our FBISD teachers had prepared, including lesson plans, testing strategies, semester plans, etc have all gone out of the window in short order thanks to the current situation we find ourselves in. We're all just doing out best.

That said, as a working parent still working 40+ hours a week for a company that is just looking for a reason to cut costs via a few layoffs or furloughs, the amount of resources I'm having to dedicate to homeschooling via Schoology, rather than focusing on my job, is very unfair.

I have two sons in elementary school and assumed that there would be a much greater levels of independent work. I also assumed perhaps the teachers would be homeschooling via Zoom, perhaps 50% of the kids at a time, 8am-12pm and the other 50% 2pm-4pm?

Instead my sons are having to not only use Schoology itself, but then there are apps within apps - Clever, Kiddle, BrainPop, WeVideo, all requiring registrations, usernames and passwords. Sometimes the password is a simple series of numbers, sometimes it's their lunch number, sometimes it's another ID number all together. Some parts of Schoology don't load on tablets, others don't load on Chrome, or Safari, or Explorer. I've spent more time on the phone with Technical Support than I have checking in with certain family members.

Every five minutes, my poor sons are asking me for something:

- download this .doc into Microsoft Word, complete, and reupload into Schoology.
- draw a picture, take a picture with your phone, send to your email, download to your desktop, download as an image and submit to schoology as an assignment.
- open this power point presentation, complete the work, save it, upload it and submit.

And that's just for ONE course. Nevermind the social studies, science, math, language arts, reading, etc.

I'm sorry but this is absolutely ridiculous. No working parent trying to work 8-5 to keep a job and keep a roof over all our heads possibly has the time and energy to be doing all of this for ONE child, nevermind those with multiple children. Is this really as good as it gets? This is a full time job unto itself and now that the the district is closed throughout the remainder of the school year, I don't understand how working parents are expected to keep this juggling routine up before something gives.

I know it's not y'alls fault and this comes from the admin and the districts, but this is seriously an awful system. Not all of us have more than one parent in a household in order to balance the load, nor are we not working or working part time, etc with time to devote to our kids like this.

If anyone knows of anything coming down the pike to relieve some of this pressure, let me know. And if any working parents out there have coping strategies for balancing these roles (in addition to being chef, entertainer, cleaner and the usual household roles!) it would be appreciated.",houston,"Questions for any teachers (preferably FBISD), with a small vent."

I’m all for it and not complaining I’m just curious how the authority on it works. I understood judges to be the arbiter of disputes between individuals (civil) and the state/individual (criminal). Was there a law or order issued from the state or federal level that was being interpreted or do I misunderstand something about judges?(I’m sure I do). 

Can the governor or a mayor issue a similar order? Or only judges? Is it because this is Texas and we just decided only judges can do this and in other states it is an executive thing? I’ve searched online and all I found was mess articles saying a judge did it but not why they can.

Would really appreciate some guidance from locals on pros and cons on some neighborhoods that have popped up in my research. 

I’m a single dude in my 30s and looking for a neighborhood with some chill bars / restaurants - perhaps In walking distance and decent shopping. 

Montrose seems to check all these boxes - but finding it difficult to browse effectively not having visited with the sole purpose of feeling out neighborhoods.  There seems to be a bunch of newish construction buildings with very nice 1 bedrooms for 1,500 or less (which is awesome)

Midtown / downtown also seem interesting.  

I’ve primarily been searching on Trulia / Zillow - not sure if there’s a better resource to do so.  

Also: by far my favorite type of housing are commercial loft conversions : any former industrial neighborhoods with these types of buildings ?

953,953,LordTay3,1587172613,g3esvu,Nan,"I went on an amazing ride this afternoon and it got me thinking of all the places I could access that I couldn't a few years ago.

Think of how far this city has come just in the past 5 years when it comes to cycle infrastructure. Key connectors to parks, bayou greenways, the lane on Lamar, the latest work in 3rd Ward, the upcoming lanes on Austin and Polk. And it shows ---- wayyyy more people out on bikes as a result.

As someone who loves cycling (not the Lycra racing kind, just the crusing/commuting kind), it makes me so proud of my city and I cannot wait for the next steps in the next decade -- Memorial Park and BB Park will connect, Buffalo Bayou East, the Spring Branch trail, high quality trails in Westchase and Katy are coming, as are eventual key north -- south connectors via centerpoint utility trails.

For years on HAIF, twitter, reddit I've read the comments about this being a car city etc. and its just not true. When the infrastructure is built, people use it. We have 9 month of the year cycling weather, it is flat, and even in the 3 months it is inhospitable, cycling is still feasible in the early morning or night.

As for everyone who complains about cyclists not following road rules, most drivers do not either, plenty of running stop signs, red lights etc. I'm not condoning it and I will actually get on cyclists I see do it on paths, but enough with the cyclist bashing. The not following street rules unfortunately is an all vehicle problem.

I think in a decade we will have the bones to be one of the most bike friendly cities in the USA. Things I'd like to see:

1. Some high quality paths through Montrose. A lot of people there talk the talk about climate change but then get very NIMBY. Something safely getting cyclists from Buff Bayou Park to Braes Bayou.
2. Safe connector of Terry Hershey Park to Buffalo Bayou Park, if the rich folks won't let us access the Bayou, make a way wider sidewalk or street path on Memorial Drive.
3. Something high quality and safe through the Galleria area (here is where to think big, something elevated like in Copenhagen? I know super expensive, but isn't this one of the parts of town we show off?)
4. Perhaps the most important, more political will from our leaders to support this stuff (i.e the recent 527 spur decision). So frustrating that the city will give more credence to commuters who have chosen to live far from work rather than people who live in the city and would rather cycle or walk than drive to everything.
5. The more paths off of streets the better. Nicholson trail is a great example, widen the sidewalk and repave. Better for everyone.
6. Is there a way we can get a path underneath 610 on Brays Bayou? Is that in the plans? Right now it is above and you have to cross a busy feeder.
7. Some plan to clean the paths, especially the street ones. Was on Houston Ave bridge and the paths are nice but already see debris, and trash that could cause flats.

I truly believe in 10 years there are going to be so many cyclists commuting to work / or just doing it recreationally and being healthy. Both of these things (taking cars off road, limiting healthcare costs) are so important for our city and will pay for the trails themselves.

Curious what everyone else would like to see.

In my Montrose area i only see like 30% ppl wearing masks. We are one of the largest cities in America. Theres no way this has blown over that quickly already right?

My intepretation of the article is that we are allowing gyms to open next month. Is it just me or does it sound too early and we are being too easy about this?",houston,Thoughts on allowing elective surgeries as soon as next week?

The brand is “The Safety Zone”. 

The box also says MFG# GNEP-MD-1P. 

Who needs them the most? Hospitals? Grocery stores?

They are probably at least 5 years old but have been stored inside a home, and like I said - the box is unopened.

I don’t mind dropping them off to a hospital or a grocery store in the area (Clear Lake), I just want them to go where they’re needed most.",houston,Who needs medical grade gloves the most? Found an unopened pack at home.

I want to make signs, go yell at some people, make reassurances, anything. But there's not a single thing I can do. The best case scenario is I go out there and look useless and pandering, and I daresay the worst case scenario is getting stabbed, given the shape a lot of these interactions have taken. Racism is the greatest shame of this country, and it always has been, and I feel so naive in having let myself believe that maybe at least a little progress had been made.

If you're Asian and reading this, than I am sorry for this situation. I know my apology doesn't mean or do anything, but I still am. I know these kinds of terrible things happens even in the best of times, but what is happening now in the worst of times is going to re-open old wounds for decades to come.

If you're the kind of person whose out there doing this kind of thing and you think you're being ""brave"" or ""patriotic"" or any other lunatic buzzword you apply to yourself to make you feel like a hero for being a goddamned fool. I don't know what else to say other than: Stop. You aren't helping anyone, you are a disgrace. Stay home and let decent folk do what needs to be done, unhindered.
