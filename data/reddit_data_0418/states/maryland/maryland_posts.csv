Notes:

* She may have used the name Jasmine or Jassy.
* She had dark brown to black, wavy hair with a widow’s peak on her forehead. It was shoulder-length
* She has brown eyes.
* Olive complexion.
* A sedative drug - Chlorpromazine, was found in her system which could mean she was institutionalized or suffered from a mental illness, therefore her killer(s) could be tied to such a location.
* Her blood was O+.
* One scar on her left thigh.
* Several scars on her knees.
* Ears were pierced.
* Several teeth were previously extracted, rotation of one tooth indicated she did not receive orthodontic care.
* She had a crude tattoo the letters ""JP"" or various combinations of the letters ""J,"" ""S,"" ""P,"" ""D"" or ""B."". The tattoo may have symbolized Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts or initials.
* Clothing:   
 Beige or white pullover  
 Corduroy Levi jeans that were beige or yellow   
 Leather, tan moccasins  
 White bra  
 Rawhide necklace with a turquoise bead.  
 Two keys on a safety pin, believed to be for a night latch and a house.
* She was found lying along a road near a cemetery. 
* She was likely killed elsewhere and had been transported to the side of Dogwood Road near the backgate of the cemetery. It is possible that a Ford Econoline van may be linked to the case, as one was seen near the location of the body an hour before it was found.
* Her body was covered in a white sheet - consistent with those provided at inpatient institutions -  and her face had bandannas and a bag for grass seeds covering it. The bag read ""Farm Bureau Association Grass Seed, Lexington, Mass."" The grass seed bag was connected to a factory in Buffalo, New York. It had been sold exclusively in the Massachusetts cities of Waltham, Rochdale, Lowell, South Weymouth, and Greenfield. Years before the murder, production of this type of bag had been halted.
* A piece of the grass seed bag was found in her throat. This was determined to have been the cause of her death, along with ligature strangulation.
* She was bound, beaten, and was strangled with a ligature.
* The victim had been violently raped which caused bleeding to seep into her clothing.
* Isotope testing indicated the victim likely spent time in a populous region of the Northeastern United States, such as Boston, Massachusetts or New York State. At least one of the keys she carried was manufactured in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and had ""DB09212"" stamped onto it.
* In 2015, a tip was submitted. It linked the girl to a family from Puerto Rico or Colombia that immigrated to Boston and resided in Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts. She may have also attended school near that location. Police have not released the name of the possible identity and wish to receive more information from the public. The family of the girl has not been located.

80,80,OriginInfinity,1578255814,ekiigk,Nan,"I grew up in Chicago, Illinois (21 years) and have lived in Columbia, Maryland for the last 3. 

I’ve been back to visit family in Chicago a few times and each time I have I noticed what I would describe as a significantly higher level of racial tension. Specifically in Columbia, Maryland there is a diverse racial population with most of the people being Caucasian and black. I’m white and in Maryland I’ve never had an encounter with a black person that wasn’t friendly. I as a white person open the door for a black person and they say thank you, a black person holds a door open for me and I say thank you. This is just an example of what my interactions with black persons are like in Maryland. 

In chicago I hold doors open for black person and they act like it is your duty to do so, no thank you mo acknowledgement. In Chicago if a black person was to walk in a door ahead of me they would let it shut on me rather than hold it open. This is also just one example out of many. 

The only reason I can think black persons are like this in Illinois is that most of Illinois was highly segregated up until the last 20ish years where I feel like Maryland may not have been this way, hence leading to more time for white and black persons to co exist. 

Does anyone have any input on this?",maryland,Has anyone else experienced less racial tension in Maryland than other States?

Good Afternoon everyone! I would like some help with my New Years resolution. To have real life friends that I meet occasionally.

Basically I have come to realize that I have no friends in real life and do not go out of my way to meet new and interesting people. I would like to rectify that this year, and at least try to get out of my comfort zone.

I would like to meet people with the intention of going out to lunch, no pressure to go further than that. No preference on Race or Gender, and I just ask that you be over 21.

Some things about me:

1.I work in Corrections so I have a lot of cool stories that happen at work.

2. I am an avid Gamer, and am always looking for a Co-op partner.

3.I have a dog, Rookie. And he loves meeting new people as well.

4. I go hiking and just started going to the gym.

5. Is located in Cambridge MD

6. Will answer every message with a picture of my dog.

7. Do not like sports

8. Can Cook for groups of people.

9. Would like to start tabletop gaming

10. 35 year old male

Anything else please do not hesitate to ask.

What I would like from you:

Tell me a little bit about yourself and what area of Maryland you are from

The intent of having at least lunch, or an alternate plan

Thank you to everyone that has read this entire post, even if you are not from my area. I hope you all have a wonderful 2020",maryland,Good Afternoon Maryland

So I just moved down here for school, and up in New Hampshire I had quite a lot of rivers and lakes/ponds to choose from where I could pretty much just park on the side of the road and hike the perimeter of the water without worrying about trespassing or getting a ticket for parking on the shoulder.

Down here, I'm not really sure what the ""norms"" are in terms of this sort of stuff. Almost everything seems to be private property and I never see anyone else park on shoulders which makes me nervous to leave my car alone without the police ticketing it or something. 

I'm just looking for some locals to give me some more info on ""etiquette"" when it comes to fishing down here in terms of access, but also general suggestions for good fishing waters around Nor. Baltimore County. I tried loch raven and I wasn't too thrilled as it was cramped and crowded (at least from where I accessed it).

I was wondering if anyone who have previously received and filed for the MD Student Loan Debt Relief Tax Credit in the past, or this year will be able to share what they did or would be the best method to file their state taxes in addition to the Tax Credit? Last year, I used Credit Karma because I didn't have anything extra to file for, but when asking them about it they said that they do not support the 502CR form that the Tax Credit is on. Is turbo tax able to file both my normal state tax return and the Income Tax Credits for Individuals (502CR) form online/electronically? I want to avoid going through a tax preparer/accountant because when I went to one in the past when I first moved to the state, they messed up my return so I would like other options besides that. Thank you!",maryland,Best way to file Student Loan Debt Relief Tax Credit (502CR) with MD State Return (502)?

Are you motivated to serve your community? Do you want to tackle social justice issues in a meaningful way?  Are you dedicated to personal growth and the growth of those around you? Join us for a transformative year of service investing in youth, supporting families, and building community.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke4wlbw4hsa41.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54b22f0dd2f56603b0a8bebcc5421f82f9e746f5

**The Basics**

This AmeriCorps position is a one-year, paid, service-learning opportunity through UMBC's The Choice Program and The Shriver Center. Our AmeriCorps Members serve as advocates and work to connect families to self-identified, needed resources and reinforce a strengths-based, anti-racist, approach to youth development.

The Choice Program’s guiding principle is anti-racism, which we uphold through our accountability to the following values: 1) being youth-centered, 2) dismantling hierarchies, 3) practicing holistic development, and 4) believing in humanity. AmeriCorps members collaborate on teams that serve youth through individualized, strengths-based services and focus on restorative practices. 

Choice has served Maryland’s youth for over 30 years and currently has several exciting service opportunities based in the Greater Baltimore area, Prince George's County, Howard County, and Montgomery County. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What You’d Do**

Serving within a team model, AmeriCorps members share case management responsibilities for program youth, including welcoming them into the program through intake meetings, helping them to set goals for their time with Choice, checking in with them along the way through service plans, connecting them with community resources, and offering classroom and/or legal support. You’ll make meaningful connections with the young people you serve, offering informal counseling/mentoring on recreational outings, community service activities, arts programming, home visits and beyond. 

To us, youth development means: being available to our youth consistently, often making visits to meet with them on a daily basis; using a strengths-based approach to promote positive self-image; using a holistic approach to honor every aspect of a person’s life; developing high expectations and holding youth accountable to their own progress on goals; forming a mentoring relationship that is built on trust and rapport; engaging with families and assisting as a communication link; fostering self-sufficiency by building life-skills; providing opportunities for meaningful engagement through structured after-school, weekend and summer activities.

Service is completed collaboratively at Choice, from case management of youth to organizational decision making. In addition to day-to-day case management responsibilities, you’ll participate in cooperative projects, team-based decision making, and organizational committees. 

Due to the nature of the workflow and youth needs, AmeriCorps members must be flexible with their schedules. Members should expect some weeks to include serving hours beyond a 40-hour week.

**You’ll serve your full year of service in one of two programs**

*Department of Juvenile Services Intensive Advocacy*: This program aims to keep youth out of detention centers and connected to their communities. This is carried out through the service plan model, supporting youth in creating and attaining personal goals that bolster their personal success and aid in disentanglement with the juvenile justice system. (Locations: Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Prince George’s County, Howard County, and Montgomery County)

*Choice Jobs*: This program provides youth with job readiness training in a classroom and workplace setting. This is carried out in our three social enterprise locations as well as through partnerships with community employers. (Locations: Baltimore City)

I have so many questions though. Like, how is the trash getting there? Do people just not care anymore and they’re throwing trash out of their car, is it falling off of trash trucks and other vehicles? Are we not spending the money anymore to clean it up? Do we blame Hogan for this or what? 

Also, as citizens what can WE do? I pick up trash in my neighborhood on a weekly basis that blows through my yard from god knows where. Neighbors who don’t care? The shopping center up the road that doesn’t put their trash in the dumpster? If feels like people don’t care anymore, and as a Marylander, I care.

It was parked in a gas station without permission, so I am not contesting that I should not have left it there. 

My main issue is that it's a large amount and I would rather pay by credit card and not cash. When I called, they demanded cash only. I found this suspect and looked up the laws on towing. In both Montgomery County and Prince George's County, the law states that they must accept credit cards.

 Sec. 26-142.14. Fees.  - Prince George's County Law based on their official site.

 (d) A towing company shall accept payment in cash or by a major credit card with a credit card slip validly signed by the vehicle owner or the owner’s agent for the amount of all valid charges. The towing company shall accept the two (2) most widely used major credit cards of MasterCard and Visa.   

Montgomery County Law based on their official site below.

 **Payment**:   Many disputes occur because of payments.  Tow companies, must accept cash, traveler's checks (with ID) and credit cards (*e.g.,* Visa, MasterCard). Tow companies may accept another form of payment, but cannot demand cash only. Tow companies must accept a credit card regardless of where the vehicle is registered.  

In PG county they are also supposed to inform you within 3 days via certified mail. I did not get this notice. Not sure what my recourse is. Should I just pony up the cash or can I fight to use a credit card?",maryland,"Motorcycle towed - company won't accept credit cards per the law, what can I do?"

I have been looking at Howard or Montgomery county. It was suggested to me that most of the younger people at my job live in the silver spring area, and I see that Columbia is a very highly rated area. I will work in Laurel and I would prefer a 20-30 min or less commute if possible. 

I am in my late 20's, female. I will be living alone until my boyfriend gets a job in the area. I have lived in a very large city and I loved it, so I do like being in walking distance from things to do. But for the past 5 years I have been living in a suburban college town and I have also enjoyed that. Nightlife is not a huge concern, but I don't want to be too far in the middle of nowhere. I've been in graduate school with very little social life, so I would like to regain some social life in my new location. 

I would prefer to rent a house or townhome over an apartment, if possible. I should be able to afford a rent $2,500 or less, but would prefer less so I can save up for a house down payment faster. 

Any suggestions on good areas to live? Any suggestions on the best websites to use for rental places?

My girlfriend bought and paid off her car (&lt;7 years old) in NY and is getting it titled and registered here, within the 60 days mark. I understand that she will have to pay money to Maryland if she paid less than 6% in taxes when she bought her car. 

My questions is, does this include local and county taxes? In total it says on her car bill of sale that she paid 8.75% in taxes, but a quick google search shows that New York State sales tax is only 4%.  The remaining 4.75% must be from local and county taxes. 

Will the MVA only charge the $100 minimum excise tax, or will they demand 2% of the value of her car?

569,569,FamiliarVibes90,1580621102,exjm4s,Nan,"Today my friends and I went to Forest Haven Asylum for the first time. I did some research and heard some stories about this place. I was excited, nervous, and scared. There are rumors are abuse, stabbings, hauntings, and records of experiments on patients. But the biggest thing I was mostly concerned about was the police patrolling the area. One of the worst thing that could happen is getting caught, fined and arrested for trespassing. Another shi\*\*y thing that could happen is rolling your ankle on a loose stick before even reaching the buildings, or having your car towed even after you had a great time in the area. Anyways, none of those things happened, Thank GOD!GODDESS!G.O.T's OLD GODS AND NEW! We actually had an awesome time! Thanks to MANY Reddit users we decided to park at the bar located down the street where the facilities are. The bar is called ""The Bank shot Bar &amp; Grill"". It's surprisingly nice and clean in there! I thought it was just going to be some side road hole in the wall because the area is so wooded and there isn't a lot around. Just one of those drive-thru towns. We parked there even thou it was kinda a hike up. I mainly wanted my car to be safe! Parking in an actual parking lot kept my mind at ease. We walked alongside the road until we hit Old Portland rd. it turns off the main road and there's a little dirt lot off to the left. With only google maps ""rerouting"" on my cell to guild us, we started following the road until it lead us behind the storage business because I remembering reading that there were ""Clear"" paths to the buildings. (Also we didn't park there because we went on a Saturday and my car would have been the only car in the lot) we didn't get very far when a little black car came zooming past us and pulled up off on the side of the road ahead of us. 2 people hopped up in a hurry and started B-lining towards the tree line. I notice that the driver (guy) hopped out with a camera (pro looking) in his hand and the passenger (girl) with a backpack. They looked back once at us and started off. We, of course, decided to follow them. We assumed they were heading towards the asylum too. We kept our distance at first, we didn't want to come off as creepy or following them. Once we got into the woods, we got a little tense. We talked about patrols, cover stories if we get caught, things I've read online. It was getting real really fast. We noticed (while following the 2) that others before up spray-painted red circles on the trees, marking the way to the grounds. Once we figured out the red circles was the way (dis is de way my braddah) we started picking up our pace until eventually, we caught up to the 2. I ended out calling out to them. Turns out they knew where we were going because they too were going there and have been there a few times over the years. They were super cool and very helpful. They actually calmed my nerves a lot. They were there for a school project. They pointed us to the main building and knew what building was what. They told just to move quietly and stay off the main roads due to the patrols. We parted ways but ran into each other once or twice scaring each other in the process. We all being so silent and cutting corners and all. We decided to explore the first building which a lot open and let more light in. There's a lot of graffiti, penises, and devil symbols are drawn everywhere. There's a mutant raptar-dragon thing, a weird SpongeBob, a crazy grrr-ing bear (with a penis), shelves and beds turned over, doors rusted shut, and broken glass...lots and lots of broken glass. We started to the morgue where you see the icon building and the basketball courts. I thought it was really cool that I spotted some of the things that were pictures on google images and Reddit. They were all untouched waiting for the next trespasser to snap a pic. Ironically, I found that it was actually safer being in the buildings rather than being out in the open. We explored about 3-4 buildings. All of the basements of the buildings were floated and we didn't have bright enough flashlights so we didn't go down there. Upstairs we risky. We were afraid that we may fall thru if we went up there. But we moved slowly and were careful not to group in an area. There are some funny pranksters who set a chair in the middle of a room with some duct tape and splattered some red paint on it to make it seem like someone was tied up and tortured. It was creepy looking but like you could totally tell it was paint and the even left the paper towels the used to wipe their hands on the ground in the hallway. But thats the building where we heard IT. My friend and I exploring a kid's room. We were taking pictures of some shoes on a bed when we heard laughing. At first, our bodies froze and ears perked up. We both heard it. I started rationalizing the sound because it was faint and it did sound like it was in the distance. I chalked it up to it being the 2 kids laughing, However my other friend told me that they were on the other side of the building opposite of where the laughter came from. So, our senses went back up like automatic car windows when your girl just straightened her hair. We whispered to each other trying to figure out if we were hearing things, or if there was another group but then we heard it. It was the sound of a loud, mighty voiced man. It shook all of us to the core. (we were in a building on the second floor in a connecting room with some closets) The man shouted with authority, and he also sounded like he'd be the guy to say ""left, left, left, right, left, companyyyyy, HALT!"" But whatever he shouted it wasn't audible, but it sounded like he was trying to get ""them"" to stop because, shortly after we heard warning shots fired into the air. Or about least some loud ass bangs (3 quick ones). We all scattered away from the windows trying to stay out of sight, trying to stay quiet. I was pressed against a wall next to a wardrobe, one of my friends stood inside of the closet and another was in the room right across the hall. We waited for a few minutes. Once it was quiet we B-lined in it to the woods. We were close to the church. When we exited out of the building, the church was off to my left. We knew the patrolling officers were nearby so we tried keeping quiet, tried staying out of sight, and tried keeping off the main roads. Once we saw the woods, we just climb up the hill quick, fast and in a hurry. Wasnt even a path there just took all those thorns and sticks to the face. Once was got far enough into the woods, we finally exhaled and unpuckered our buttholes. Whilst we were leaving, another group (maybe 4) was heading to the facilities. I wanted to warn them, but I think they also heard it because they stood there for a while, as did we. I think they were debating whether to go in or not. We ended up walking through the woods blinding until we found old portland rd. to follow back to the bar. It was fun and we had a great time! I wouldn't mind going back again.

But if the 2 kids that were there helping us and you're reading this. I hope it wasn't you and you guys got away.

I am intrigued and confounded at the fervorous appetite for Old Bay and the local identity attached to this hot sauce and brand.   I have yet to try the hot sauce given it sold out but I am excited to give it a shot.  

Having recently moved here from Texas, I find this interesting to say the least.  Back there Old Bay is just another seasoning in the grocery store. 

I would even find it comical but then I have to remember Texans take pride in the smallest of things.  The reality is that for everything like Old Bay that folks attach some level of local identity, Texans probably have 10 trivial things they take great pride in. 

It’s funny to see the small things that people associate with in different states. 

Just FYI, here’s a *very* short sample of things folks back in Texas love to talk up:

* HEB grocery stores
* Buc-ee’s absolutely unnecessarily large gas stations
* 85 mph speed limits
* anything that is big for no good reason
* Asian lady donut stores 
* the fact that you can drive for 10 hours at 70+ mph and still not leave the state (in fact you might still have an hour or two left to go)
* BBQ 
* high school football
* TX has it’s own power grid vs other states having to share
* the TX state capitol being higher than US Congress’s capitol
* the fact that TX was once its own country, all the while ignoring that it was basically broke and falling apart at the time
* Six Flags over Texas theme park
* big steaks, big bbq servings, big roads, big guns, big people, etc.

There’s probably another 50 things I could add to this list off the top of my head.  That said, I still find Old Bay intriguing.",maryland,Old Bay Hot Sauce — a recent Texas transplant’s perspective.

I have looked online and from I can tell, Waldorf is plagued with mismanaged rental properties. The majority of the places i found are overpriced ($1400+) for a 1bd/1ba less than 700sqft. Not to mention, the noise, trash, pests (rats,mice,roaches,?drain slugs), people smoking marijuana and sleeping in the hallways, management not really caring to change anything, lack of free parking on the premises, lack of security, theft etc. 

I’m seriously starting to regret accepting the offer in this city as it sounds utterly horrible and unsafe. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for safe, clean places to live in Waldorf or somewhere close by?

I am interested in moving. It's abrupt. Didn't plan on it being so soon. I have very little money for it but circumstances are what they are.

I am unsure where to land. I would prefer to be a bit southern of Fort Washington. Along the 210. Or at least have access out that way. But even if that isn't viable i would accept the nearest to there. I live in an alternative transportation heavy city now. Meaning I've never had to learn to drive and dont know how to. I will change that but it wouldnt be able to immediately.

776,776,throwawaybaltlaur,1581783894,f4bmno,Nan,"We sold a house outside Philly and moved here in 2018. Wife was laid off and had a job opportunity at a federal agency.

We moved into a 2-bedroom apartment in a faux-luxury building in Laurel, PG county, which gave her a ~30-minute commute. I work from home, so not a consideration for me.

She went to school partly in Northern Virginia. I'd vacationed in Maryland often. My sister went to UMBC. We had a positive opinion of the region coming in. In our minds it didn't seem like it would be all that different from what we were used to.

On the contrary, the experience of living in our apartment has been consistently bad. I've lived in a lot of different places in my life - urban, suburban, crappy areas, nice areas, shit-tier apartments, modest ones, row homes, duplexes, single-family. Somehow 95% of the worst neighbors I've ever had have all been in this building. It's the nicest apartment I've lived in, but it's been the worst living experience by far. Check my comment [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/el4be9/moving_to_maryland_dont_know_where_to_live/fdmm23i/) if you want specifics. It's not just us. [Reviews](https://www.yelp.com/biz/evolution-at-towne-center-laurel-2) for the building match our experience. 

Our lease is up in June, so we're looking to move in the coming months. The trouble is, as far as I can tell reading reviews and hearing stories from my wife's co-workers, the housing challenges and apartment issues people face here don't really change if you're living anywhere near civilization in the metroplex. In the $2k+/month range, there are a lot of mismanaged buildings and a lot of inconsiderate or outright terrible neighbors. I think we'd lose our minds if we got locked into yet another nightmare of a building for a year, only to have to move again.

After being here for almost two years, I can't shake the sense that the metroplex in Maryland feels somehow... schizophrenic. Like, it's just nonsensically laid out, with wacky public transportation and super high class diversity everywhere except the NIMBY pockets, which tends to result in people with very different expectations living right on top of each other. After trying to find an apartment loosely in the commuting range of Silver Spring that isn't a repeat of this place, my impression is that it doesn't really exist, even throwing a good chunk more money at the problem.

(Am I mistaken? Am I missing something? Has our experience jaded me?)

We've considered renting a town house, but many of them don't want cats, and I'm not confident it wouldn't just result in another situation with intolerable neighbors. 

So now we're looking at single-family homes. If we're going to commit to buying one sooner than we intended, when we might not decide to stay in it even medium-term, we'd like it to be way, way under budget, up to about $250k (we'd qualify for more, but don't want that weight right now). This has us looking out in the sticks. We're even considering moving up route 83 into PA, and just dealing with the absence of civilization and a long commute on the two days/week my wife has to be in the office. After being traumatized here, we're willing to trade a lot of conveniences just for some peace and quiet.

Any thoughts or advice on where or what to look for would be appreciated. Or tell me I'm wrong. Tell me the Old Bay culture makes it worth it.",maryland,Have we not given Maryland a fair shake?

I am a student at Fortis college in Landover, Maryland in the dental hygiene program.

In order to graduate I need 53 people to come in and receive treatment from me!

Each appointment is 3 hours long and it would take 3 appointments to finish everything.

What is included?

Oral cancer screening, radiographs, periodontal and dental charting, vitals, a dentist referral, scaling and polishing of your teeth, fluoride treatment, and sealants if you are applicable!

The amount of time needed is because I am a student and I am learning, everything that I do needs to be checked by my instructor who is a registered dental hygienist.

Please reach out to me at vmad28@gmail.com to ask any questions, or if you are interested in scheduling. It will be well worth your time and you too will learn a lot!

Right now I have openings on Wednesdays from 8-11 am, please reach out if you are interested!

thank you.

again it is 40 dollars with no insurance required, and if you are interested in bringing in your child it is 20 dollars.

My concern is that the previous owner installed size 245/35/20 tires instead of the stock 245/30/20 tires.  This causes the speedometer to under-report speed by 2-3mph @ 60mph.

 Across the country, the idea of armed officers in schools has grown more contentious as calls for stronger protections against external threats rub up against concerns of police brutality and racial inequities. A spate of horrific school shootings has led to calls for greater police presence on campuses, including from President Trump.

895,895,boh_savage,1582390401,f7v4fb,Nan,So I’ve been out in charge of planning my BIL’s bachelor party. The issue is that my BIL works in an industry that basically puts him in bachelor party scenarios every other weekend minus the strip club. If there is a brewery he probably knows the owner. He has an all access relationship with top golf. MGM casino is a client of his as well. This is making it very hard for me to plan something that won’t feel like another day at work for him I feel like. Does anyone have  ideas for something in a 3 hour range of Annapolis that might be a little more unconventional? He not super outdoorsy so that makes it harder. Any feedback would be appreciated.

I appreciate everyone's input and the great comments on both Maryland and Texas identities.  I still haven't tried Old Bay hot sauce and I hope you all will one day be able to stop by a Buc-Ee's on one of your drives.

Speaking of driving - why is everyone here **SO BAD** at driving?

Maryland and D.C. have BY FAR, the worst drivers!  Why is this?  Everyone seems nice and pleasant when you meet them in person but when it comes to driving people are so rude and selfish.

The biggest red flag for me that I have noticed is that people here **do not slow down for school zones**, nor do they slow down and move over when an Ambulance is coming through.  I have also seen many instances of a school bus stopping to pick up or drop off kids, set up the big red lights, and people are still driving around the bus!!  I have NEVER seen people disrespect these basic rules anywhere else.  Sure you have speeders and aggressive dumb drivers in other states, but they at least have some basic level of respect for safety rules.

Another thing that blows my mind in D.C. is that with speed limits at 30 to 40 mph pretty much everywhere, people are still weaving in and around lanes between cars as if they were Dominic Toretto.  

It's been shown over and over again that speeding and weaving around in traffic, especially at low speed limits, doesn't get you anywhere faster.  You can even see it in motion when people are splitting lanes and speeding on a 30 mph road and then you see them a minute later at the stop light.

Look - I know everyone says ""oh we have the worst drivers here at X place"" but the fact is those statements should really only apply to the DMV area.  I'm not trying to make this a Texas v. Maryland thing - this is purely a statement on Maryland drivers compared to the rest of the USA in general.

I love doing roadtrips and as a result I've driven all over the country.  I drove all the time in Texas since I lived there, but I've also done road trips across the western US - covering states like California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, etc.  I drove around Hawaii to see all the National Parks there.  I've driven on the east coast going from MD up to NYC or south towards Virginia and the Carolinas.  I've hit the midwest, the pacific northwest, and everything in between.  I can tell you from experience, no where has drivers like MD does.

Again - not trying to besmirch Maryland or its people.  I really like it here since moving and I like exploring the state as it has so much to offer, but in doing so I just couldn't help but notice the selfishness and rudeness of drivers around the area.",maryland,A Recent Texan transplant's experience - pt 2 - WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR DRIVING

Hello all,

We are George Mason students developing a new dating app called SpecUdate for people 18+ in the DMV area!

The SpecUdate mobile Application will initially serve to help singles in the DMV area to connect online! The main difference between SpecUdate and other dating apps will be that on SpecUdate, users will create their own personal ""Get to know me"" games for other users on the App to play (Two Truths and a Lie &amp; Truth or Lie). When two users connect, the result of this game will be used as an icebreaker tool before chatting. The beta version will release May 2020. We have almost 1,000 email sign ups in the Virginia area. If you are interested in the app, please sign up with your name and email at [Specudate.com](https://specudate.com/) to be notified upon beta release! Every sign up counts! Thanks of listening, you can learn more about SpecUdate at [Specudate.com](https://specudate.com/) or check us out on social media (@Specudate Instagram/Facebook/Twitter). Inquiries can be sent to [info@specudate.com](mailto:info@specudate.com).

Best,

We did have a weird experience once in Cambridge MD. This was back in 2015 I believe. My husband and I started fishing for hobby and decided to visit Cambridge since his family lives there. There is a bridge on route 50 that has a pier and a tiny little park. We decided to throw some lines from the pier and got some small white carps. 

Then he wanted to walk to the park. We are walking and the bushes started to move but there is no one there. There is no wind or animals visible at all. The place is fairly quiet. My husband and I keep walking to the other side of the path and come back. Again no wind no visible animals

We pass the same bushes and they start moving again! I am literally freaked out and get ahead and sit on a bench. From the bench I can see the bushes moving! I can't understand why. You can see thru and there are no animals or wind or nothing. 

On the bench there is a in memoriam plate. I googled the names on the plate and realize that in this very spot back in the 90s a father drowned his 2 very young children to get back at his estranged ex. We believe the spirits linger there.

This is a concerning trend as it constitutes IP theft. No one has the right to other's property or hard work. To help alleviate this problem, we are going to implement some new policies.

 1. All posts to domains with paywalled content will be automatically tagged with a ""Paywall"" flair when posted. /u/AutoModerator will also comment on all articles with this flair to remind users of this policy. Comments that try to circumvent this will be removed and the users may be suspended or banned if they continue this behavior.

We will need to build a ""greylist"" of paywalled news sites, if you have suggestions of some sites that are frequently posted here, please comment them below. 

 2. Editorialized post titles have increasingly become a problem in this subreddit. Please use the title of the article that you share. If the article title is ""Hogan votes against Kirwan due to concerns over the associated costs"", don't change it to ""Hogan hates schools"". You may add a small clarification if the title is unclear, but a majority of the original title should still be there. This one is slightly harder to enforce and will be done on a case by case basis, especially since online news media has been known to change the article titles well after the article is posted.

3. In the past, we've counseled, suspended and even banned accounts that post only content from their site and do not otherwise participate in the subreddit. Going forward, it is our stated policy that we may counsel and discipline users who behave in this manner. We welcome representatives of media companies to engage in our subreddit, but we request that they do so organically. Reporters and editors should comment on the posts in the subreddit rather than only post their websites. Editors and reporters: please reach out to moderators about scheduling AMA's and other projects. 

If you see any of these behaviors, please report them. Please remember our other rules with civility and reposting recent comments. Thanks for making this the best state subreddit!

If you have any questions or concerns, please leave them in the comments or send us a modmail.

1150,1150,idunmessedup,1583509226,fef783,Nan,"xpost r/Baltimore 

This is speculative, but informed, information about the three linked cases of COVID-19 that were announced in Montgomery County. It might be a serious reason for our current state of emergency. Maryland and Hogan may have a very similar situation to California, in which it may not allow cruise ship to port until testing is possible.

The Sun reported a week ago about a cruise ship that disembarked in Baltimore on the **20th February:** Flu outbreak sickens 82 on Royal Caribbean cruise from Baltimore; none met coronavirus criteria, cruise line says.. The reason that passengers and crew of the Grandeur of the Seas were not tested is because we had no tests ""None of the passengers had transited the COVID-19′s regions of impact or interacted with anyone in those regions within 14 days of the onset of their symptoms."" This has proven to be a terrible standard for testing. It is also presumable that the crew remained mostly the same between voyages, and the crew of this cruise ship would have had 2 voyages in the preceding few weeks.

Regarding yesterday's news about 3 patients testing positive in Maryland:
According to the Washington Post, ""Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) said he was told by an aide to Hogan that the **individuals were on a cruise.**"" In the same article, ""Fran Phillips, Maryland’s deputy secretary for public health, said **the three people returned to Maryland from the same overseas trip on Feb. 20.** Officials declined to specify where they had traveled."" 

Again, presumably, much of the same crew stayed with the Grandeur of the Seas, which left for another cruise on the 21st February,the day after the passengers with ""flulike symptoms"" arrived. That cruise returned on the 28th, disembarked, and set sail yet again. It is currently on it's way back to port at Baltimore,  complete with passengers and crew.

I hate to malign one cruise ship or its passengers, and truly hope that there has been no further spread, but I sincerely hope the governor/country is prepared for the possibility that this ship might have crew members and passengers (past and present) who are infected and contagious (if the Grandeur of the Seas is, in fact, the same vessel in question). Damn.",maryland,Grandeur of the Seas?

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Why is it that the renewal for registration is $135.00 every two years and emissions is only 14 bucks? If you already have my personal information on file, why don’t the mva just automatically renew my registration and send me the damn 5 dollar stickers for my plate for affordable price. So there is 440,000 adults in Anne arundel county and say every person has a vehicle under 3,700lbs which is $135for registration renewal (vehicles over 3,700lbs are $187), that means the state is getting 59,000,000 million dollars every two years on just registration renewals. It’s a scam for a sticker and someone to take 20 seconds to make sure my address and vehicle is up to date. Same with Anne arundel county income taxes going up $5 dollars on each paycheck(get paid biweekly), so 440,000 adults x $5 tax increase x 26weeks = 57,200,000 a year extra from $5 dollar tax increase. I writing this because I can’t imagine all the money Maryland is making for all the small things they charge us for. Im not sure if anyone ever thought of this above. I live a comfortable life but I don’t like the fact that I’m being charged additional fees and taxes, which is money that can help me save for my children college/future, for emergency purposes, or hell my own retirement.

1193,1193,gamergirlsriseup,1583691819,ffgl4j,Nan,"So, to preface, I live abroad and am a native Arabic speaker. I applied for an Arabic customer service position through a job posting site. It didn't specify where the job would be so I assumed it was the area it was listed under (not in the US). I later found out when I got an email from hr, it was actually at Medstar Harbor Hospital. I was sent some interview questions to answer, after sending in my answers, they emailed me with the job offer. They offered me a rate of $35/hr (which I know is unusually high) for 8 work hours, 5 days a week, in addition to accomodation, health insurance, paid overtime, plane ticket and preparing my work visa. I was a bit skeptical considering I don't have any experience in customer service (applied because it didn't specify required experience), I do have a BA in media and communication though. They also specified that I have to join within 1 week if I accept the offer, and the email had a lot of grammar and spelling errors which I thought was kind of weird.

Then I noticed that the email sent to me was from info @ medstarharbors .org, i looked it up on google and right away got medstarharbor .org which is copyrighted 2020 as opposed to medstarharbors .org copyrighted 2019 and all scam-check sites say was only made 4 months ago.

So, yesterday I sent an email to info @ medstarharbors .org asking why the hospital has two websites, I haven't gotten a response yet but I realize it could be because it's Saturday.
I also called the inquiry number on medstarharbor .org and got the answering machine saying they're not available on the weekend. I then called one of the numbers listed in the email I got and on medstarharbors .org, a man answers and confirms they're hiring for that job position but when mentioned that I noticed there were two websites and asked if they were both legit, I was met with silence til I hung up because it's an international call lmao.
I sent a message on Facebook to the verified Medstar Harbor page, it shows read but no reply.

At this point I'm so confused and feel like I'm being scammed. Is this kind of thing normal? Could it be they have a separate website for international hiring? Would appreciate any advice",maryland,"I got a generous job offer, now I think it might be a scam."

I asked every neighbor, no one knows. I called the police to report an abandoned vehicle but was told, I shit you not, that because it was on my personal property there was nothing they could do and to call a tow company. I asked what if it’s stolen? Same answer. Ok BCPD, ok. 

So I call the first of many many tow companies. No one will tow this freaking car off my lawn. I keep being told “we don’t do that” when I explain I’m trying to have an abandoned vehicle towed off my front lawn. 

I’ve called private tow companies. I’ve called the tow companies the county uses. The county tow companies told me to call the city tow companies and the city tow companies told me to call the county back. Some have told me they can’t tow it because I’m not the owner of the vehicle, others have told me they can’t tow it because it’s on my private property.

I mean what??!?!! Am I losing my mind here?

I’m literally willing to pay to have this thing towed to whatever lot handles abandoned vehicles. I’ve scoured the MD state and county websites for resources on this. The contacts listed are the ones I’ve been calling for months. 

I just want this thing off my lawn.

As you may know, the COVID-19 disease (commonly referred to as the Coronavirus) has arrived in Maryland. I want to assure you that our local, County, and State officials are taking this situation very seriously, and have taken steps to limit the outbreak of the disease.

So far, three Prince George’s County residents have tested positive for COVID-19. The Maryland Health Department has reported 94 negative COVID-19 tests and 9 positive tests throughout the state. 

Our School System

The Prince George’s County Public School System will continue to listen to the guidance and recommendations of the County and State Health Department. The school system encourages students to stay home if they are sick and will no longer require a physician’s note for an absence of 3 days or more, however a parent's note is still required.

Today, PGCPS was notified that an individual affiliated with Eleanor Roosevelt High School and College Park Academy had close contact with someone who traveled to a country under a high-risk COVID-19 warning. As a precaution, both schools will be closed Thursday, March 12 and Friday, March 13. PGCPS will utilize guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to sanitize each school during this closure. Students and staff will return Monday, March 16.

PGCPS is holding a telephone town hall on Thursday, March 12 from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. with CEO Dr. Monica Goldson, County Health Officer Dr. Ernest Carter, and Dr. George Askew, County Deputy Chief Administrative Officer for Health, Human Services, and Education.

4. Tip well. Not everyone can work from home.
5. Be thankful. Enough said.
6. Be positive. Society has been through worse. It will be ok.
7. Be helpful. If you can help a neighbor or donate to food bank then do so.
8. Use positive words and actions when interacting with others. Let idiots have the last word if necessary. Let someone go ahead of you.
9. We are all in this together. It sucks for everyone, remember that whenever you may be upset at the situation. We are the adults.
10. Listen to what's being asked to be done and try to do it. The government is doing what it can. We don't follow blindly but we should try to remember that it's about protecting others.

Once normalcy returns, I'll be splitting working time between the NCI Shady Grove and FDA White Oak campuses. 

As expected with the current national conditions, all leasing offices are doing Virtual Tours Only - which means I can't get a great sense of a place that's not through the leasing agent's eyes. Google maps can only do so much.

My main criteria/hopes:

1) **Max Price: $2,600/month** (not including parking, utilities and other similar fees) for 1bd (or 1bd + den or other combos). 

2) I have a 35lb Australian Shepherd whose health and happiness is my biggest priority. We both do extremely well in places with lots of people going about their day to say hello to. We're currently in Canton and love it, if that means anything to anyone. **Safe night time walking and proximity to green space or walking trails is a need.** On-site pet wash/relief area is cool. 

3) Other factors: distance to work sites (commute driving under an hour), in-apartment laundry, ""luxury living"" is really nice but dog's needs come first.

Their regular products such as bourbons, rums, and liqueurs will be available as well; they've entirely switched over to distilling alcohol for making hand sanitizer for now, but are trying to use up inventory to ensure they can stay in business. I can assure you the owner isn't aiming for price gouging or taking advantage of the pandemic, he's pricing them as low as possible to cover the cost of materials ($4 for 4 oz, $8 for 8 oz).

They're located at 1029 E Gude Drive, Rockville, and will be selling from a stand outside to promote social distancing. Please be mindful - hand sanitizers are limited to two per household to give more people an opportunity to access it. Sales will begin at 8am and run until supplies last. 

Even if you're stocked up on sanitizing/cleaning products (thank you for not hoarding!), for everyone looking to restock on liquor during the quarantine period, please consider patronizing a MoCo owned and operated business!

1680,1680,DasNath,1585000085,fnsq45,Nan,"I was impressed with how Governor Hogan was handling Coronavirus until today. Today he closed ""non essential"" businesses using federal guidelines. However, the guidelines are vague and allow many businesses to operate normally which is still putting thousands of Marylanders at risk of exposure. Many companies aren't even allowing for telework. 

These vague guidelines are allowing businesses to squeeze into a category in order to operate business as usual. For instance, I saw in another thread that a cabinet maker is operating business as usual because they supply the construction industry. Let's be honest, no one need a cabinet bad enough that cabinet makers need to be operating business as usual. I'm sure there are other examples of this. 

I feel as though stricter guidelines need to be in place. At least force businesses to telework or close. The businesses that should be allowed to remain open should be essential to the function of society (I.e. grocery stores, pharmacies, critical infrastructure, public works, medical, etc.) A cabinet maker is not in the group. A commerical construction company building a strip mall is not essential. But businesses are trying to make this case.

I expected empty roads and some fun driving in my GTI and it was backups, heavy traffic and busy stores. Do people want to die?

1735,1735,Telkk,1585149950,fos5nd,Nan,"We all know why we need help right now because we're trying to serve our communities, but too many people are coming in and crowding up our stores so we're much more likely to get sick.  Many of us, of course, are vulnerable to the disease and we live with loved ones who are.  On top of that, the customers who are responsibly shopping because they need something are in danger now, so they'll take the virus back to their homes and infect the people they're trying to protect.

So, here's an idea and it's a little unethical, but fuck it.  Desperate times calls for desperate measures.  For those of us in MD who are young and healthy and have time on our hands, I urge you to go into stores with your cell phones and shame all the customers you see buying things they don't need or can purchase online.  Also, people who are standing too close to each other.

Then upload it on social media calling these people out so we know who to blame and chastise for putting our lives in danger.  **But please do it safely, by wearing a surgical mask or better and adhering to the 6ft rule.**

If enough people get called out and their identities are put online, we can implement crowd justice and harass them enough to stop these behaviors.  It's ugly, I know, and perhaps some innocent people will be harassed as a result, but we need to instill fear so that people will think twice when they go out to grab their lattes or cosmetics.  I want people to be worried when they shop so they can do it responsibly by keeping a distance and only buying shit they need and can't get online.  

So again, those of us who are young and healthy who can safely do this, please come into these stores and call people out because our government is being too soft and by the time they get tough, it'll be too late.  I want our friends and families to be healthy and safe and I want them to purchase the things they need, but right now I'm seeing waaaaay too many people treating this like it's not a big deal.  We have to correct this behavior and its getting to the point where we, as individuals, need to start taking aggressive actions.  

I would do this, but then I'd be fired.  However, other shoppers can definitely do this and I encourage you to do it.",maryland,MD RESIDENTS! WORKERS ON THE FRONTLINE NEED YOUR HELP!

The State of Maryland now has 580 confirmed cases of COVID-19—an increase of 157 new cases, which is by far the largest one-day increase to date. There are more than 1,200 confirmed cases in the National Capital Region—in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia.

We are only at the beginning of this crisis, in our state, in the National Capital Region, and in America. As I have repeatedly stressed, we should continue to expect the number of cases to dramatically and rapidly rise.

Today, we are also seeing an unprecedented increase in the number of Marylanders filing for unemployment. We are going to do everything we can to help people and small businesses get back on their feet.

This battle is going to be much harder, take much longer, and be much worse than almost anyone comprehends. We have never faced anything like this ever before, and I continue to urge the people of our state to stay in place at home and stay safe.

I want Marylanders to know that if we continue to lead and work together—if we rely on and help each other—together we will get through this crisis.

There are now more than 1,500 confirmed cases in the National Capital Region—in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia—4.5 times more than there were just one week ago.

Governor Larry Hogan today issued the following statement:

“Over the last three days, the number of COVID-19 cases in Maryland has more than doubled. Cases in the National Capital Region have more than quadrupled over the last week alone. There is no timetable and no model that can tell us exactly how long this will last or how bad this is going to get.

“The federal administration’s swift approval of our request for a Major Disaster Declaration will drive more resources to our coordinated response. As chairman of the National Governors Association, I will continue to press for additional federal resources, including a Title 32 designation for Maryland and all the states to fund National Guard missions.

“Later today, I will convene conference calls with my full Cabinet and our Coronavirus Response Team of Maryland’s top doctors and public health experts to continue to address this crisis. I cannot stress this enough: Marylanders need to stay in place at home to help slow the spread of this deadly virus.

“Our state has already faced and overcome daunting challenges before, and we will do so again.”

PLEASE stop complaining about the fact that you actually have to pay for online journalism. Here are a few sample comments from Facebook, found this morning on posts about the virus:

""This is BS that during a National Emergency you still charge the public to read your articles.. SHAME SHAME SHAME""

""Can’t read it. Baltimore Sun shame on you.""

""Cant read it, so dont know if there is anything important the general public needs to see.....Ridiculous when it's a public health and safety issue.....""

Comments like these make me irate. You're not asking your gas station to give you free gas. You're not asking your grocery store for free food. So many people have the attitude of ""it's online, so it must be free"" and it reeks of entitlement. If you really want free news that badly, turn on your local news station. Go to the CDC website. Whatever you want, just stop demanding that a business provide you with a free service just because you think it’s important. If anything, the fact that you think it’s so important proves that the publications in question are providing a valuable service and deserve some financial support, right?

What really irks me is that these people are acknowledging how important local journalism is, and yet still refuse to offer any kind of payment for the time, effort, and money that went into researching and writing these articles.

Journalists work *so* hard to bring you these stories and it drives me crazy to see people act all outraged that they might potentially have to pay for the service. Do these same people expect a free copy of the Baltimore Sun to show up on their doorstep every morning? If you refuse to pay for your news, pretty soon you won’t be getting any news at all when places start going out of business.

Normally I can ignore comments like these, but they have become so much more prevalent in recent weeks, to the point that I felt compelled to write this. 

I get it, this is a stressful time, you want to stay informed. But that doesn't mean you have a right to these articles. Local newspapers need to make money. It's $0.99 (that's 99 cents) for a three-month trial of the Baltimore Sun. They're asking the bare minimum. If you can't afford that, you have bigger problems.

Thank you for reading, sorry for the ornery tone, stay safe.",maryland,Please stop complaining about local newspapers charging you to read articles about the virus

A lot of states have issued non-essential/essential businesses lists and are closing the non-essential businesses. 

I'm not sure that governments have had to make this distinction before. I think there should be rights extended to essential employees. I'm not sure what those rights should be. 

First, there should be a distinction between essential and teleworking vs. essential and going to work.

Some ideas would be: 

- Essential employees should get hazard pay if their employer makes their employees physically go to work. This would make employers consider telework and/or closing the business. This is regardless of whether they are hourly/salary/part-time. 

- Essential workers that have to go to work should be able to get workers comp if they test positive for the virus/are told to self quarantine by a physician. 

- Essential workers should have readily available access to hand washing/sanitizing/cleaning supplies. 

- Essential workers should be able to anonymously call OSHA/Health Department if their work place isn't following government guidelines. 

- Essential workers should be able to file for unemployment, but not be fired/laid off, if they are in the high risk category and choose not to work. 

- Essential employees should not be charged for COVID-19 testing or treatment. 

- Essential employees should receive paid two weeks off if they contract the virus or a physician orders them to self quarantine. This time does not come out of their regular PTO.",maryland,Essential workers rights?

Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

1912,1912,wonderlandsfinestawp,1585561137,frnr2p,Nan," I'm not sure how many people will even see this, but I thought it might be worth putting the offer out there. I design signs for the hotel I work at and have done a couple for local stores with everything going on lately. With too much time on my hands now that my hours have been cut back, I want to do my part to help where I can. So if there anybody needs signs to convey important information to consumers/patients/whoever, let me whip them up for you free of charge! 

 I like to convey a bit of humor in my signs when possible.  But I can also give them a more polished professionalism. Just let me know what you want! You can tell me word for word what you want the text to be or just give me the general message you want to get across and let me handle the wording myself(my managers speak English as a second language so this is the route they normally take). 

 Let me know the size you want the sign designed at and I'll send you the file once it's done. I wish I could offer to print and send them to you, but my supplies are limited and my budget tight now that my hours have been cut back. 

 While a lot of the signs I've been doing lately have been related to the pandemic and that continues to be one of my biggest concerns personally, my offer does extend beyond that. Whether you need motivational posters for employees, advertisements, ect, just let me know what I can do to help and I'll try to make it happen. This offer also extends beyond just Maryland owned businesses, I'm just not really sure where to post it that it would be on topic. I do reserve the right to add anything I produce to my portfolio if I like it enough though and ask that you don't try to resell my work(not that I think anyone would, just trying to cover all my bases here).  

Since I'm not sure what kind of response this will get, for now I'll ask that people only submit one request at a time. If you like the end result and want to ask for another, we can cross that bridge when we get there.  

Anyway, thank you for reading and I hope I can help some of the businesses braving this situation to make sure people have access to the resources they need. Below are a few examples of recent signs I've made.

The American people are getting fucked. Its infuriating to watch rich fuckin pieces of shit try to stay rich and in power during an epidemic, and then watch people i know argue as if basic help is a ""political issue"" .

Our only income is my husband driving for Lyft and because of this we’re really struggling.  If Gov. Hogan would just say those 3 words, we’d be able to get help. As of right now rideshare drivers are considered essential and since the new aid bill hasn’t reached its ultimate end, we can’t apply for unemployment. Even when we can, it won’t reach us in time.  Lyft will help when the area has the order, but not before.

I’m very concerned. My husband almost died several times a few years ago because of a still unknown auto immune disease. They can’t figure out what it is and have come to the conclusion that it’s sero-negative.  If he goes out right now there’s a very big possibility that he will become infected. Not to mention the fact that there’s no rides to be had.  We’re running low on food and weren’t on the SNAP program before all this and the food pantries are closed too. 

We can’t be the only ones in MD having this problem and our state is all but shut down. I realize that there’s people that don’t have a job or place to live right now and there’s so much pain and death. 

I’m scared. More than I’d like to admit. My daughter doesn’t understand what’s happening and is still so excited that there’s no school. I’m scared for her. I’m scared for the world.

Asking mainly because a manager I talked with at my job pulled over two days ago at 11pm by a cop asking him where he was going (work) and he replied ""Work. I work at XYZ."" And the cop asked to see an order/proof that he is and works somewhere essential (fortunately, he had it).

So I've been watching the data in Europe carefully. 

Spain also might be reaching its first wave peak:

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/)

But the is more data for Italy. 

Italy's lockdown order came on the 9th, Spain came on the 14th. The peaks of infections are also about 5 days apart. 

MD took the major actions to close stuff on the 16th and the 23rd (schools/hospitality on the 16th and then most other stuff on the 23rd).

It took 12-13 days for infection rate unnormalized to stop major growth. It remains to be seen if the MD orders will be as effective as I don't fully understand the scope of Italy's orders but given all the chatter about mayors yelling at people I think they are pretty hard to get cooperation from as well.

To me that suggests that we should see something by this weekend in MD (if we are going to see a positive effect). 

Today we saw the first downward point:

Relevant Info:

Since October I’ve been a W2 employee on a television show. We are now shut down due to the virus. Before that, I’ve been gigging and have a mix of 1099’s and W2s (but mostly 1099’s). This goes back years.

I am non-union. I work in Maryland, though most payroll companies are in California.

Question:

My understanding is that the current Maryland unemployment system only looks at W2’s for the past 18 months from the date of filing. With only 6 months of “real” W2 work, is there a way to have them look at my 1099’s before that? How many employers would that be considered?

Basically I’m wondering if I should bother to file given the above information, or if I should just wait for them to roll out their application for gig workers. I’ve been unable to get through on the help line.

Based on this information from the MD Division of Labor website, I am guessing I need to wait, but wanted to make sure.

2042,2042,ExtraThrowaway316,1585670406,fsfhiv,Nan,"Maryland State Police Superintendent Colonel Woodrow Jones III has directed troopers to continue their public education and enforcement efforts regarding the Governor’s Executive Orders and last night issued specific instructions regarding the stay-at-home order.  Those instructions are as follows:

- Enforcement of the expanded Governor’s Executive Order will be conducted by Maryland state troopers.  However, troopers will not make traffic stops simply to ask drivers where they are going to determine if their travel is essential or not.

- If, in the course of the regular performance of his/her duties, such as during a crash investigation or a traffic stop, the trooper develops information indicating the individual was engaged in non-essential travel, enforcement action can be taken, in consultation with the state’s attorney’s office in that jurisdiction.

- While it is not necessary for drivers in Maryland to have documentation about the purpose of travel, having such documentation may help resolve questions.

- Troopers will continue to initiate enforcement action when a business or group of more than 10 people is observed in violation of the Governor’s Executive Order.

- The Order does not prohibit people from going to the store to get groceries or prescriptions, seeking medical attention at an urgent care facility, getting cleaning or laundry supplies. In addition, the Order does not prevent people from going out to get necessities for pets or other livestock.

- The Order allows for travel to care for a family member, friend, pets, etc. Citizens are also permitted to travel for transporting family, friends, pet or livestock for essential health and safety activities.

- The Order also allows for travel to and from an educational institution to receive meals or instructional materials for distance learning.

- The Order allows for outdoor exercise activities (done in accordance to with social distancing guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and crowd gatherings of 10 people or less. However, such actives may not be done at a park that has been closed by state or local government.

- Restaurants can be visited if obtaining food for carry-out or drive-thru only.",maryland,Per the Maryland State Police regarding the stay-at-home order (MSP facebook):

Those of you who live in households of many people it might be harder to implement but for me one of the harder things to deal with is the risk to others rather than the risk to myself.

The issue is the delay of onset from the time you are infected. Given the incubation period of about 2 weeks I think I can mitigate my contribution to society by modifying my behavior to do pulsed contact with others.

I need to go to the store and I need to sometimes go to work. If I do these things on two consecutive days every other week then I can effectively end my transmission probability to others. 

If I get infected on the first day then I will almost certainly not be highly infectious on the next day. I can go to work get my food for two weeks in these two days, then I can go back home and still go for a walk in the evening far away from people but stay very much out of the way. If I get sick, then no one will be exposed without me knowing.

With NY state being #1 in cases of COVID-19, and experts saying Maryland being the next blow-up state, precautions have to be taken. I believe any car with NY plates should be pulled over and asked what is their reason to be in Maryland and do they have proof of reason? (Housing, business,  and/or college). Reading over the Hogan's new executive order that if you are pulled over for a traffic violation, and you are out for a non-essential reason, than you will be fined.

""What if they left NY because they did not want to risk getting Corona?""

Well they ironically could be spreading it and clearly did not listen to the whole quarantine part or no out of state travel. I am not one for big government intervention, I disdain of it, but I am also working in the field of medical practice and in the future of rehabilitation services. I understand the restrictions that must be made in order to keep this virus at its heels.

On that note, please be safe and sanitary.",maryland,Unpopular Opinion: Pull over cars with New York tags

While other grocery chains have installed shields for cashiers, institutes social distance spacing for checkout lines, and patrol the store to attempt to keep people separated within the guidelines laid out by the state, the Rockville Whole Foods has done NOTHING. There are new employees hired off the streets sleeping and living in the break rooms, no masks or PPE provided, no required social distancing policy, no protective shields for cashiers. Sheetz and Starbucks are paying more for hazard pay than one of the most profitable locations in the mid Atlantic for Whole Foods. 

The people still working there will only be given sick leave if they are confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, and it is questionable whether paid leave would be allowed for doctors orders to isolate without a positive test. Employees are told they can use their PTO only, with approval. The store is crowded like the day before thanksgiving every day, the work load is grueling, and it is a giant risk for shoppers and employees during this pandemic. 

Please consider this when you choose to go out shopping. This is disgraceful corporate behavior from one of the leading grocery chains, and counter to their cultivated image of being a great employer and health conscious business.

New Jersey is being hit hard now with over 25,000 infections. PA has over 7,000 infections and Philadelphia has a growing number of cases. It looks like the infection is creeping down the eastern seaboard...

Now Northern MD and Western MD is fairly rural and so is much of PA. Will that protect us? Or should we be putting in place check points to attempt to screen Drivers coming into our State? Should we be putting up Barricades on our secondary roads? Where would the man power come to enforce any of this?

Hi, I am filing for unemployment in Maryland and have some questions.

I  have not received any benefits yet and have been receiving letters  about my benefit amount etc. Today i received 3 letters in the mail  explaining that i needed to be available on the 6th to resolve 3 issues.  The first issue is that i selected that i was in school while filing my  second webcert (This is true, im a college student and was working 30+  hours a week before i was laid off from my restaurant job due to  unemployment.) Will this be an issue? The second two letters were  regarding employers, I only worked for for about 3 days each, out of the  entire year, (CVS and a local grocery store chain). Both of these  employers are saying I voluntarily quit (which i did, i hated the jobs  and left right after training to return to my old restaurant job) Can  this affect my benefits? Thank you. EDIT: The jobs where i earned over  90 percent of my wages for the year did not contest the claim only the  two corporations that i worked for very briefly.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess to make this brief, can a past employer who made up less than 10 percent of my wages deny my unemployment claim. I haven't worked for either of them in over 6 months and the total wages i received from them added up to less than 2 percent of my gross income",maryland,Unemployment question

I'd like to know if there is anyone else who's been put in my predicament, and if so, how did y'all handle it. Is there any real hope for me to get through the unemployment process as is, or would i be better served just pursuing temporary employment elsewhere. 

The way I personally see it, there is no way that I'd be able to complete the process, so I'd better find atleast 2 part time temp positions to help keep me afloat, or something that would pay similar.

The father of my child has never been able to locate his father. He was adopted at 3 years of age. His last memory of his father was seeing him pull off on a Harley and the last he'd heard, he up and left to move back to what was considered his home, the state of California. After that, the man has been off the grid. Without trying to make an extremely detailed past into an extremely detailed story, I'm going to attempt at keeping this short and factual. I have the mans name - or at least, what is believed to be his name. I also have a photo of him with my childs father birth mother (who is now deceased, Susan Kelly). I have done my own research on many different platforms and have come up empty handed. The clarity any information would bring him is unreal and I am reaching out in this way because I know his pride is too big to do so. The internet is a powerful thing and I am sincerely hoping for any direction in this matter. His name (believed to be,) is Edward Champagne. MD Case Search does hold records for this individual, all of which are Closed cases. Please reach out to me further and I can find a way to get a photo over to you by different means seeing as reddit may not allow this.

Ed Singer’s mobile phone rang at 2 a.m.

Pleasant View Nursing Home was running out of oxygen, a hospital official told Singer, the health officer of rural Carroll County, Md. Without 16 additional tanks, some of the most fragile [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_3&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_3) patients might not make it through the night.

The day before, 66 of the 95 residents of the nursing home in Mt. Airy, Md., had tested positive for covid-19. One, a man in his 90s, died in his bed. By morning, another resident would be gone.

The nursing home’s medical director was nowhere to be found, according to two government officials, who said the doctor later explained he was self-quarantining because he believed he had been exposed to the virus. Nurses with limited supplies and little supervision were struggling to treat rapidly deteriorating patients. Singer had spent hours the previous day searching for backup, to no avail. A paramedic who responded to a 911 call found the halls eerily quiet, with staff members masked and not talking, and ragged coughing audible from behind closed doors.",maryland,Two cases.

Hello all. 

I am an 18 year old senior from Charles County looking to attend McDaniel College in the near future. I was debating between McDaniel, Hood, and some out of state schools, but so far McDaniel has been so nice to me, wrote me a hand written letter added to my acceptance, and had been showing genuine interest in me as a student, unlike any other college I’ve applied to, which makes me very interested in attending. 

However, after reading more and more about the town of Westminster, I’m not quite sure if that’s the environment I’d like to spend 2-4 years in.

The main things that I’ve heard are that Westminster is 1) Republican, 2) boring, 3) redneck, and is 4) a heroine hotspot. 

1) I’m conservative so Westminster being Republican isn’t a huge deal to me. 

2) From the looks of it, there are eateries and whatnot in Westminster, so I don’t think I’d get TOO bored. It’s a decent size town, and as long as it’s not completely rural I think I’d be fine.

3) I’m not one to automatically associate the south with racism, but as a non-white individual idk how okay I’d be walking the streets in a so called “redneck” town. This one is mostly what’s keeping me from 100% committing to this school.

4) I’m not a drug user so I’m not worried about this, but I don’t know if this will make the town less safe.

I know that I will be on campus the majority of the time, but if I do plan on going out into the town for a job or shopping or food, I want to know that I can do so in a good area. My other top choice is in NYC, and the fact that I’m even thinking about choosing this town to spend college in over a nice big city is a big deal for me. I just want to make sure that I’m making the correct decision in all of this.

Thank you all in advance.",maryland,"How true are the Westminster stereotypes, and what is it like to live there?"

in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza,
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Our family is about 20 people, mostly children under 10. We’re three households. Everyone has been mostly at home, but one household hasn’t kept their kids from some of the other neighborhood kids, actually just one other neighborhood family who has a parent that is a front line worker at Costco. Their kids have kept playing together like nothing has changed.

One of our households just had a baby too and it’s not clear what kind of measures have been taken for their groceries and needs related to the baby.

No one has any symptoms and there’s been at least a significant, but not total, reduction in movement. I keep going back and forth feeling like the risk for us is low and it’s not a fight I should pick, and also feeling like I really have no idea what our risk is and I should fight it. 

I want to postpone this and just get together later, but my family seems like they’re going to do it anyway. They’ve also more or less just cut me out of this discussion, presumably because they know I’m going to push back because of the risk. But I’m worried about my father in his 70’s, and I have mild asthma when I’m sick. 

This is going to be a fight if I try to put a stop to it right now, and I don’t know how to think about it. I need some feedback or advice, or if there’s some official guidance I need to see it.

So, I know nobody is an expert here but I just need some thoughts and feedback before I start a fight and potentially lose my standing to help keep the family safe with more critical behavior.

Form the last few weeks, when ever there's a spike in infected, one group panics and the other makes excuses.  Usually having to do with back logs or more tests given. Individual positives don't matter as much as percentages. 

Make sure you're panicking about the right numbers.  What you want to do is find the percentage of infected.  Yesterday was 1158 infected and 5629 negative. That's 21%  we've been riding at 16-23% daily.. with a few spikes into the 30s.

What I'm saying is that it doesn't matter if there are 10k kits tested tomorrow, if 1500 people are infected( flattening), that's good news. If there's 3000 people were going up(curving).

These are the guidelines from the inventor of the N95 mask on how to properly and efficiently sterilize masks with five different methods (including a home oven) for reuse. One mask turns into seven with these methods. 

Wearing a mask for an hour or two in a public setting does not by any means mean that you should throw it out. Sterilize it in a bag, let it air out for an hour or two, and then use these methods listed by the creator of them for re-use.

If creating a cloth mask, make certain that you put two plies of hand paper towels in between cloth as a filtration system. In order to test the efficiency of your mask hold a lighter up to your face and if you can blow out the light through your mask that is not efficient filtration, add another ply.

I’m in Worcester currently and I don’t know any doctors at all around here to certify. I read online that it needs to be a bonfide relationship.

A real liquor store is preferred here.  I don't have the type of income where ordering curb-side beer pick-up from a restaurant is sustainable.

Ideally, I'd order  and pay in advance (either online or via phone) so when I'd show up, they'd verify my name or my plates and dump the beer in my trunk (Minimizing person to person contact), but I'll verbally give them my order and/or exchange a credit card through a rolled down car window if absolutely necessary.  I'm of course willing to press a driver's license or whatever up against a window for age verification regardless.

&gt; Ok, now do the regular flu 

I had been wanting to do the comparison myself, so I figured that was as good an excuse as any. Fortunately, unlike many other states, Maryland keeps pretty good track of adult flu deaths during the season, making the comparison possible for our state. Data comes from the following two state sources:

[MDH FluWatch](https://phpa.health.maryland.gov/influenza/fluwatch/Pages/Index.aspx) 

[Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak](https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/) (using history from u/Bautch)

Since flu season began in October, and Coronavirus reached Maryland in March, I pegged day zero as the date of the first confirmed death from each disease. So, this shows the progression of each outbreak over the same timeframe. So, without further ado, the results.

Fatalities:

**NOTE:**

*If there is an issue with the numbers or my math, please let me know. I want this to be accurate. Feel free to use the data as you wish. Please keep in mind, I am not a statistician. I am just collecting data. I, gratefully, am essential and have to go to work every day. On that note, some days I may be late in creating this thread. This is especially true now that the* [*Maryland Coronavirus website*](https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/) *does not update at 10 a.m. anymore but instead, ""during the 10:00 a.m. hour."" Thank you.*

**NOTE (4/12/2020):**

*The state is now releasing cases by zip code. I'd love to include this formation but there's a lot of Zip Codes and listing them all individually takes up a massive amount of space in the post. Does anyone have an idea for how to include this information? Please remember, it has to be a relatively fast way to post the information daily. I'd even settle for a link if someone could find one.*

*Also, not a big deal, but the state has now changed how I can screenshot the map they publish. Unfortunately, unless they change it back we'll have to settle for a smaller map.*

*Lastly, I've seen some comments on these threads wondering why I post them daily. It's really three reasons. One, it gives a thread for people to comment and have a conversation on/about the data. This is probably the biggest reason. Two, it provides historical data &amp; analysis. What makes this data even more unique is that this is information that commenters have requested to see. Three, it provides simple and easy to understand graphs based on that data.*

457,457,WizKid4LyF,1586707052,fzz6sv,Nan,"The USPS is an American institution. Please send this email/letter or a modified version to your representative.

Dear Senator Van Hollen,

As a resident of Maryland, I am writing to encourage you to support postal reform legislation and financial assistance for the United States Postal Service (USPS). The USPS accomplishes its Universal 
Service mandate to provide postal services that are equally accessible to and affordable by citizens 
throughout America. Without it we would see corporations provide unaffordable and criminal rates to citizens in ""unprofitable"" areas of the country.

Post Offices serve as vital community assets and touchstones to the Federal government in small and 
rural communities. In small towns, Post Offices are a crucial component linking such towns to the rest of the nation. For 
example, package delivery has accounted for a significant and growing portion of USPS revenues. 
Rural Post Offices are used by commercial package delivery companies to provide delivery services to 
citizens who might otherwise find their ability to receive packages inhibited by both the difficulty 
encountered in reaching them and the prohibitive costs.

The complexity of the financial difficulties faced by the USPS requires cooperation among all 
stakeholders. Solutions involving modernization of the current network can benefit communities and 
the USPS alike. Additionally, we encourage restructuring postage rates in a way that improves the 
financial viability of the USPS and is reasonable for consumers.

Furthermore, USPS continues to be one of the most trusted government organizations year after year in national polls. In addition, USPS employs over 600,000 Americans, many of whom are veterans, only second only to Walmart. Without financial support and legislation, these jobs and service standards would be at stake.

There are some in Washington who would like to see USPS suffocated financially and sold to the highest bidder. Greed and lobbyists should not dictate the future of this American institution that was created by the people and for the people. We urge you to take action!

Sincerely,

An American Citizen

I have worked 2 part time jobs the entire calendar year. On 3/9 I completed an onboarding to get a new full time job while I planned to retain one of my other part time jobs. The next week they shut down by order of the governor. I was able to retain my other 2 part time jobs but one of them quickly shut down too. They payed me for 2 weeks, but have ceased. 

I am now still employed by one of the original part time employers, the pay period prior to last week, I worked 92 hours but my hours have now been significantly reduced as other full timers return, who took short leaves of absence. I am only receiving 15-25 a week.

I filed on the first of April in anticipation of this, and have reported my income for the prior 2 weeks. One week being 700 or so, the next 440. Next Sunday when I report, it will only be 300-350.  

I have received no word from them about my eligibility or if I will be receiving anything after 2 weeks. I cannot get through on the phone. Others I know have already received their card and/or told how much money they will receive.

Last few points:

-I only worked the last month part time of 2018, but filed my taxes.

-I am a student at a university

-No one files me as a dependent

-I am still guaranteed my position at the full time job I was hired at before the outbreak, once they inevitably reopen

-I am technically still employed by all 3 companies in regards to me being in their systems (except maybe not the newest one because I hadn't worked a payed shift yet)

I'm sorry this is so long. Does anyone know if I will be able to receive some type of compensation? I am the only one making income in my family right now as the other 2 were self employed. I NEED this money if I can't get my hours increased again soon.

Thank you so much. If you need any further information that would help you answer my question better, don't hesitate to ask. 

Stay safe in these difficult times.

After growing up in Cumberland and  living in a few other cities around the country my opinion of HOME is much better than I  expected.  We moved back home in 2012 after being out on the range (South and West) for close to 20 years.  No two cities are alike, so it's not worth comparing Cumberland to other places we lived.   In my opinion the pros out-weigh the cons for this area and I'll state several reasons why.  Cumberland and Allegany County have so much to offer if one chooses to see its assets!!  This also applies to towns surrounding ALCO and as a whole we are actually a METRO..  Neah sayers?  Wiki Cumberland and google metro.  Considering that Cumberland is a metro can be confound when comparing to larger cities, but it is true.  This is another hidden reason why I believe the area is highly under rated.  There is enough culture and diversity to compete with other places but it seems to be hidden in plain sight.  Once you get to know the area it is easy to see the unique  and interesting qualities.

Moving home was actually calming in several ways.  A decent house on the west side that needs some tlc for under 100K!   My thought was..I'll pay it off as soon as possible!  It's an easy way to avoid interest..aka the bankers cut.  A renovated house in Cumberland worth 150K would be worth 350K+ in other cities.   Btw--I'm currently in need of a vehicle with lower mileage.  An affordable home with a relatively low mortgage payment will allow a vehicle update relatively easy.  Note: The area offers a level of financial freedom that is more difficult to attain then other cities.  Financial freedom is equal to less stress and anxiety in my world.

Home improvement contractors are reasonable and comparable to larger cities.  Contractors have enough work that it can be tough to get on a schedule at times.  Quotes always range from wowzer ""that seems high"" to hmm ""that reasonable"".  Generally there are plenty of renovation experts in the city ready to work for 15-25 an hour.      Last weekend we observed the neighborhood and almost every house in view has been recently updated in one way or another.  The past 5 years have been active in terms of home maintenance.  It shows there is a sense of pride and this is visible all over.  Regular home maintenance is ongoing and it only takes a one project a year to make significant improvements.  Keep up the good work Cumberland..it's obvious that people care about their properties.  There is deferred maintenance and blight in Cumberland.  This is mainly near Interstate 68 or desirable home locations.  A few long time rental streets have even seen improvement in recent years.  In my opinion, focusing on the enforcement of City housing codes would help and more creative tax breaks could be designed for improvements.   With 10K homes in Cumberland, it would not take much to swing this city into an hip spot.

The entire area is Walking/Biking friendly.  That is without riding on the C&amp;O Canal or Great Allegheny Passage trails.  All of Cumberland's neighborhoods are connected with streets and sidewalks.  I've never felt unsafe anywhere at anytime.  We commonly walked and bike from our door step to downtown and places such as the Constitution Park or Riverside Park with no concerns.  We have walked and biked most streets never having a single problem.  I lived in South Cumberland for several years and visit family and friends regularly.  The unspoken rule is don't bother people and they want bother you.  Being friendly or stick to yourself will be reciprocated.  Very simple.  If you hear anyone say this area is unsafe, I would sincerely disagree.  Crime is petty and low tolerance policing is a common theme for folks in poverty.

So about work..jobs...  WORK FROM HOME is growing and Internet speeds in Cumberland are comparable to most cities.  High speed Internet is available through ABB.  Otherwise, jobs are here!!!  There is a need for experienced higher educated individuals.  Basically if you want to work there is work here.  In fact, there are a lack of workers in a few career paths.  Lets take tech for example.  IBM has been growing (400+ employees) and continuously hiring out of town people because the qualified pool of technical staff in the area already have stable careers.  There are high, mid and minimum wage jobs.   Northrop Grumman is a huge company with high paying jobs and there are many small government jobs at ABL-Rocket Center.    UPMC hospital has a number of medical field jobs.  Higher education is abundant with several colleges to note. Rocky Gap Resort and Casino employs several hundred.  Also there are factories such as American Woodmark, Hunter Douglas and Superfos.   That's just naming a few.

Over the years I have heard there are no high paying jobs in the area.  I highly disagree and rationalize this statement with context.  These statements typically come from people seeking 60k+ jobs with no college degree and organized skill-set.  My response to these types of comments:  ""Allegany College of MD has an excellent Continuing Education program full of night and online classes.  Additionally, financial assistance is available if needed"".   Or: ""There is a shortage of small restaurants serving healthy food at a reasonable cost:)"".

Moving forward, the Appalachian mountains are lush and beautiful with comfortable fall, spring and summer temperatures. The variety of hard wood trees is staggering. Wild berries and mushroom galore throughout the mountains.  Cumberland has several surrounding State Parks and natural areas.  Rocky Gap -Green Ridge State Park - Buchanon - New Germany ..and a few others.  The parks and trails are typically empty or maybe a few hikers.  A vast majority of the time the forest is all yours without every seeing another person.

We are not game hunters (deer,turkeys,etc.) but hunting is prevalent during winter months.  Hunting seasons are posted online and DNR regulates policy on public lands.  If you meet a hunter and be very very friendly there is a chance they will share a pack of venison steak with you.  It is delicious.  I've never seen anyone hunting off season on public land in several hundred hiking expeditions.  Public land is shared with unconditional respect.

Fishing opportunities are abundant. The lakes, creeks and rivers are full of fish.   Lake Habeeb has great fishing.  Wills Creek, Evitts Creek and the Potomac River all run through Cumberland.  Kayaking, Canoeing or floating on a tube can all very relaxing.  Being on the water seems to reset the soul.  Floating the South Branch Potomac has been popular and this activity is becoming more common on the North Branch of the Potomac.  Delfest Bluegrass festival seemed to spawn more floating action on the North Branch.   There has been an expansion or update of river access locations along the North Branch Potomac in the past years.

There are a wide variety birds in the area because of the River and creeks.  Eagles and hawks are around and if you keep an eye out you will surely spot one.  In the winter, an assortment of ducks are on the Potomac River just below the Blue Bridge.  We take binoculars to the overlook near Canal Place to view all of the types.  That's a nice winter air-out activity.

If you are not aware, there is a biking trail that spans over 300 miles from Washington DC to Pittsburgh and guess what is in the middle??  CUMBERLAND!  Cumberland is the western terminal of the C&amp;O canal.  Bike from you door step to DC or Pittsburg in 2-3 or4 days..   Also, Rocky Gap has a 5 mile mountain bike/hiking trail that loops Lake Habeeb.

A pro tip: After a long bike ride hit a Dive Bar with really cold beer. Cumberland has more than a few.  The D.A.M tavern is one of my favorites.  Everyone is friendly and beers are cheap.  Most of the dive bars are enjoyable once you understand the culture.  Dive bars in this area are another under-rated asset.   Warning - the local police have given DUI's to bikers or DUP's to staggerers..

Have you ever heard of duck pin bowling?  Look it up!  Diamond Bowling Alley is a spot to visit at least once in a lifetime.  Bowling clubs fill the lanes several nights a week.  It's free to watch.

There are quite a few clubs to note.  Anything from knitting, Bee keeping to Archaeological and Drone clubs.  If you are looking to meet people with like interests there is a good chance it's here.  If you don't find what interest you start a club and they will slowly come.  Let me emphasize slowly because the area is moving at a slower pace than some cities/metros.  This is a Good Thing..relax and enjoy life.  There is always tomorrow.

Traveling around Cumberland is simple once you know the city.  Within 10 minutes one could drive anywhere.  Drive 2 hours to Washington DC or 2 Hours to Pittsburgh or take a shuttle.  There are countless cities under 2 hours drive.  The Amtrak passes through town twice a day.  DC to Chicago anyone?  The Amtrac will accept bikes. Leave your Cumberland door step, load your bike on the Amtrac and head to Chicago for a long weekend.  DC is the other direction and the National mall is free!

This is just a few things the Cumberland METRO has to offer :).  A positive attitude opens your eyes to endless possibilities.   It is April 14th and we are being told that Morel mushrooms are popping up in the lower elevation areas.

I hope you enjoyed the information.  Pass along good vibes.

I applied for unemployment in mid-March, before we were drowning in COVID. My initial claim was denied, because my MD employment quarters were split between 2019 and 2020.

The unemployment office was very helpful, and said that even though my claim was denied, they would reach out to Virginia and bring my out-of-state employment into my claim. At that point MD would be able to pay out my UI benefits.  I know that the MD UI office has put in the request to VA. I don't know if anything has happened since. As of this moment, my UI claim is denied.

At this point, I'm considering just filing in Virginia and withdrawing my MD claim. I know I qualify in VA, and it should be more direct than whatever is happening in MD.

Found a few jobs in MD mainly at JHU that are in my field of psych. I have seen a few jobs pop up with the State or various smaller hospitals in my job field. My Wife is an LPN. So finding work don't think would be too much of a challnenge.

What is your thoughts on MD?

Would it be a good fit. My Wife and I are bibliophiles and love book hunting. I am a runner. Love camping and hiking. Enjoy being outdoors fishing  and kayaking. Also geeky as well enjoy anime and be in an area can go to conventions.

Also have one child and hopefully more to add to the brood. So want to be in an area with okay schools and safe neighborhoods. Also be close to places to bring the kids do activities and sight such as going to the aquarium. Also we are trying to find a place within an hour from the beach.

So what is your thoughts on MD?

705,705,CGos25,1587051142,g2h4d9,Nan,"The point of this post isn’t to advocate one way or the other for pass/fail. My point is to illuminate the fact that the board of education made a decision based on misinformation and misunderstanding that will impact every student in the county. I want them to take a look at the facts of what they voted for and take their decision back, then move forward with whatever better solution they come up with. 


Last night around 2:00 am, the AACPS Board of Ed ended a meeting. This meeting was used to determine grading policies for the 2nd semester of the 2019-2020 school year. Superintendent Dr. George Arlotto recommended to the board (based off of the recommendation provided by State Superintendent Dr. Karen Salmon) that AACPS move to a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (essentially pass/fail) grading system only for the 2nd semester of this school year in order to be fair to all students. Receiving a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory would not impact the students’ GPAs. 

However, with the idea of “equity” in mind, Vice President Melissa Ellis proposed the Board reject Dr. Arlotto’s recommendation in favor of a choice for students. This choice would allow students to choose to receive letter grades like normal or move to receive a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grade. She believed this would be fair to all students, especially those who’s GPA would be improved by receiving a letter grade. Ultimately, the board of education voted 5-4 in favor of Mrs. Ellis’ proposal. 

Now, on the surface, this all sounds fantastic. Every student can choose what best suits them. Sadly, the Board of Education was woefully misinformed about what they were really voting for. Here are the biggest issues with what the Board just voted for:
- Student Member of the Board Rida Alvi provided data from an (admittedly un-scientific, but nevertheless important to consider) poll of about 300 AACPS students who voted 79% in favor of Pass/Fail. The Board heard this number but chose to ignore it. That is such a large super majority, I’m not sure how anyone could ignore it. 
- As Dr. Arlotto pointed out (at least 3 or 4 times), the vendor AACPS uses for grades (PowerSchool) does not currently have the capability to give each individual student the choice of receiving an “S” or a “U” for a class. Every student in the class needs the same type of grade. It would take vast amounts of money and many months to change the system to accommodate this, even under normal circumstances. However, we are not in normal circumstances and we have 6 weeks to make the change. Dr. Arlotto estimated 6 months would be needed. 
- Many members of the Board were obviously confused as to what they truly voted on. Many were under the impression that this choice would be available this year (despite warnings from Dr. Arlotto). One member seemed to be under the impression that there was a magic button Dr. Arlotto could push to instantaneously “upgrade” the system. That is not the case. 

The Board directed Dr. Arlotto to contact PowerSchool and get information regarding upgrading the system, which he is presumably doing today. 

All of this means the AACPS Board of Education just voted to keep the current letter grade system in place for the remainder of this school year as there is no feasible way for the new choice system to be implemented in time. By trying to give students a choice, they took the choice away and left them with the worst option. 

My compromise would be to implement a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading system for the 2nd semester for the time being and make every effort to find a way to give students a choice later on. As it stands, this is their current option, but it is a letter grade system for the 2nd semester while they try to give students the option instead. They have placed the desires of a select few students who want to boost their GPA above the needs of many others who do not have the luxury of focusing all their attention on school. 

Please, please, please contact the Board of Education at boardoffice@aacps.org and voice your opinion! They will not go back on their decision without significant pressure from the public. 

I know this is a very complicated, nuanced matter. However, it is also extremely important. Please respond with any questions or confusion and I will try to clear them up. Thank you.

We've all seen the posts about the issues people are having with the unemployment system in Maryland right now and I want to tell that story. The unemployment that the state and country is facing right now is much worse than the official numbers are showing. Not only are the phone lines completely clogged in Maryland but those freelancers, self-employed, and gig workers that are now eligible can't even apply  because the system still won't accept them more than three weeks after the bill was passed.

If you're willing to allow me to document the struggles you're having because you are unable to collect unemployment because of the failed systems, please send me a message on here.

These people are terrified. Some may even have good intentions. But most of them probably don't. They are selfish. They want what's there's and don't care who gets hurt, who gets sick, who dies. They aren't bothered with the idea that you might die as long as they get to go to the store again. Shame them. Call them out. Fight for your right to live. If you are an essential employ thank you for braving the storm, you earn the title of hero but do not be comfortable with martyr, fight for what you need. If you are listening to the warnings and staying home, thank you as you are preforming a service for everyone and keeping us safe, these are frightening times but you are helping, stay strong. To my fellow first responders, ain't this all just a Neverending shit show? Haha stay strong brothers and sisters we will make it and I'll be damned If we give up.

There is such a divide of open it all up and shut it all down.  Both sides don't seem to understand the other. We need to save lives but there are so many struggling on how to survive. Unemployment isn't paying out to help those that have almost lost everything. Some of us are lucky to not be in that position but I worry about others that aren't  that fortunate.  Right now, we don't know.  Opening up some of the economy isn't a bad thing. If I can go to Costco with a mask, than why are  nonessential stores forced to be closed?  There foot traffic is so much less. It  will always be our decision on where we decide to go.  Wear a mask. Social distance away from your fellow man.  I just think we shouldn't sacrifice one for the other. There's a lot of people that have a ""can't happen to me"" attitude.  While that may be partially true,  we need to look at the big picture. It seems to me that there is a public feeling of either healthy or dead.  That's not the case.   The numbers will eventually show that Sorry to ramble. I just wanted to get it out.  Everyone stay safe. Together we stand, divided we fall.  (Pink Floyd)",maryland,What to do

So what, you protest Governor Hogan, get him to reopen the state, so we can go back to work and...thousands more die?
