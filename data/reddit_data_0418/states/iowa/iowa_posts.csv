I’m posting on behalf of my son. He has had a lot of struggles in his life: he was separated by divorce, he bears the challenge of autism, his mother passed away suddenly six years ago and changed his world. I have not known how to help him or be his beacon. I’ve struggled not knowing what will happen to him. I’ve laid awake at night panicking about his future and what will happen to him without having the tools he needs to survive in life. 
Scavo changed all that. 
He went from zero attendance his freshman year to actually completing his high school degree next month, and is looking forward to attending college in the fall and taking his place in society.
The support that Scavo has provided him cannot be measured by dollars. It can only be measured in the strength and determination he needs to succeed in life which is provided by the caring and nurturing staff at Scavo high school. It’s not possible to have that same connection online. Please, on behalf of my son and the countless current and future success stories Scavo has and will enable, step up, stand together as a community, and resolve to support Scavo in it’s mission to help the hundreds of students who need the hope and support only Scavo’s teachers and infrastructure can provide.",Iowa,Save Scavo high school!

1) VS. TRUMP

Bernie +2.6, Liz -0.2


2) NEW HAMPSHIRE

Bernie 21.5 (leading), Liz 14.8 (4th)


3) NEVADA

Bernie 19.7, Liz 17.3

(Note: Due to lack of recent polling, this average is pre Bernie surge. A Meyers Nevada poll released today has Bernie leading with 29, Liz 14)


4) SOUTH CAROLINA

Bernie 15.0, Liz 14.0

(Again, few recent polls. The Fox poll of this week is Bernie +4 vs. Liz)


5) CALIFORNIA

Bernie 21.0, Liz 19.6


6) NATIONAL

Bernie 20.3, Liz 14.8


7) SUMMARY

If you want to elect a progressive, the best shot is Bernie, who could parlay an Iowa win into victories in the first three states and kill Biden's electability argument. 

If moderates were to somehow rally around Biden and Joe wins Iowa, then all progressives will be left holding the bag.

After following him for a year with a camera -- the stories kept coming, and it was actually hard to stop filming. This guy turned out to be the Forrest Gump of street musicians:

✅ Wrote quite possibly the ""greatest song ever since Frreebird?"" Check.

✅ Family turmoil and death threats? Check.

✅ Former bandmate that dresses like a Pirate FULL-TIME? Check.

✅ The realization that happiness is relative, and this guy's life is pretty kickass? Check.

Also, /r/Iowa users should know that /r/Iowa mods unilaterally, arbitrarily censor political posts that they don't like, while allowing political posts they do like.

The posts that /r/Iowa mods censor ""lean-right"", which is why /r/Iowa has a reputation of being a liberal shit-show, in spite of Iowa being majority right-leaning. 

It time for new mods at /r/Iowa. 

When /r/Iowa was founded, no posts were censored for any reason. If someone was ""spamming"" /r/Iowa, we would politely explain to the submitter what SPAM is, and give them ideas for how they can promote their products in a less-spammy ways...

Please don’t  judge anyone for who they vote for or what party they affiliate with.  Our country doesn’t realize how much social media has affected our behavior in the past decade.  Did it seem like our country was so “divided” ten years ago?   Do you attribute that change with Obama or Trump? What we need to realize is that political affiliations are influenced by our core beliefs.  No matter what I do or say to you is not going to influence your core beliefs.  You have built those beliefs through your life experiences, your life experiences are not the same as mine, and please realize that your experiences are different than everyone else’s.  Social media’s exposure has rapidly grown since the last election and it continues to tear the country apart because we the people struggle to comprehend this simple fact.  We now know everything about hundreds or thousands of people in each of our small communities, compared to the small knit friend structure we were all used to.  Step back for a second and think about how much you judge people you hardly know personally because of what they post on social media.  I am 1,000% guilty of this and I’m just now realizing how childish it is.  Ask yourself this:  Is it the right thing to do?  Does it influence your relationships with people?  Does it affect your opinion of me if I say that I’m a republican and a Trump supporter?  As a new father I believe in the right to life because I’ve seen first hand how precious and special it is.  I’m not a republican robot though, I firmly believe everyone should have the right to marry and love whoever they want; I’ve learned that through my life experiences amongst many other things.  However, the Republican Party currently aligns with the majority of my beliefs.  We don’t need to “come together” like everyone suggests we just need to realize that we’re all different and maintain open thoughts.

The issues came from “inconsistencies” found in the reporting of results. The count was being done by a specially created smartphone app that was to organize the totals across all precincts. As backup, officials were also using paper cards on which attendees wrote down their preferred candidate.

Issues with the app has led to using photos of the caucus groups and the paper trail to verify results. There had also been reports that some caucus officials struggled to download the app.  

Mandy McClure, a spokesperson for the Democratic Party said, [“This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion.

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Thanks Iowa Democrats! Way to show the World how you are ready to lead America. 

what did you do? hire the same people to build your totally unnecessary app, as Obama hired to build his totally unnecessary ObamaCare website? remember that one? Dems spent over a BILLION dollars on a website that didn't work?

NO, the Iowa Dems didn't hire *those* particular incompetents, but they hired some other incompetents who did just as shoddy of a job...

SO from what i gather, the Team that put this app together is a bunch of ""diversity hire"" post-turtles. 

Also, Pete Buttigieg supposedly spent his own money developing this app ? 

Ask yourself... if you were a candidate for President, competing in the Iowa Caucuses, and you had limited resources like everyone else... whereabouts do you suppose ""building a new app to count iowa caucusers"" would fall on your priority list?

And then, as if by magic, Pete Buttigieg ""wins"" the Iowa Caucus, after a suspiciously-long delay. 

______

SO anyway, today would be a good day to talk about election and ballot integrity. 

There have been countless problems with so-called ""electronic voting machines"", endless videos on youtube of someone voting for one candidate, and their vote being registered for the other candidate. 

this is not a bug. this is a feature.

And you pay support electioneering, so long as your candidates are the beneficiaries of the cheating. 

But what would you do if someone like Trump came along and hijacked the election apparatus and controlled it for his own purposes?

Do we want free and fair elections? i think we do.

do we want to have confidence in our elections, even if our candidates don't always win?

there are 2 easy things that can be done to address our election problems. 

1) you have to show an ID to vote. 

sorry, its not ""racist"" just because you assume POC can't figure out how to DMV.

2) paper ballots, with receipt. 

i call them ""tally stick ballots""

tally sticks built the British Empire. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick

A) Ballot is perforated up the middle, so it can be torn in half. 

One half goes to the County, to be optically scanned, photographed, and uploaded to their website in real time, so anyone can see and verify the ballot instantaneously.

The other half goes home with the voter, so the voter can go to the County website and verify their ballot. 

B) Ballots come with serial numbers in the corners, like a Dollar bill has, so that once the ballot is torn, each half retains its serial number. 

C) Ballots come in blocks of 100, and every ballot must be accounted for, because we have serial numbers now. 

D) Serial numbers allow us to track how many ballots were produced, how many were used, and how many are left over. 

E) Serial numbers also protect the anonymity of the voters, by not linking any serial number to any voter.

661,661,ryooan,1580999490,ezt53c,Nan," Here's my proposal for how the Iowa Democratic Party should do their primary.

1.) Switch to paper ballots with ranked voting. People could now vote absentee and the polls could be open all day so no one has to miss out. This is more representative, less complicated, and less time consuming. It will raise turnout.  
2.) The paper ballots allow voters to rank candidates. If the party wants to make it electronically readable just list each candidate's name next to a row of bubbles from 1 to the total number of candidates next to it. People bubble in their order, for example bubble 1 next to Buttigieg, 2 next to Sanders, and 3 next to Warren if that's your preference. Leave a candidate blank if you do not want your vote transferring to them under any circumstances.  
3.) When it comes time to count the ballots place them in piles by first choice and tally each pile. Document how many first round votes each candidate got.  
4.) Realign. Start with the candidate with the fewest ballots in their pile who doesn't meet the 15% threshold. Redistribute their ballots to the piles of the other candidates based on second choice. Repeat with the next lowest who is still below the 15% threshold. If that candidate received some second choice votes from the first candidate eliminated, move them to a new pile based on their 3rd choice. Repeat this process until no one is below 15%. Some candidates initially below 15% may reach the 15% threshold and become viable during this process, just like in the in-person caucus. If at any point a ballot lists only candidates who have been eliminated it gets placed in a separate uncommitted pile.  
5.) Repeat steps 3 and 4 from scratch and make sure your totals match. If they don't match, do it again until you get two consecutive matches.  
6.) Report final realignment values and apportion delegates based on those values.  
7.) Alternatively, steps 3, 4, and 5 could be done automatically with computers if the party used computer readable ballots and developed a simple program. All results would still be verifiable by doing it by hand. But by hand would be simple to do as well.

That's it. Easier and less chaotic and also more accessible for those unable to physically caucus. It would need some rules developed for if two candidates tie for the fewest votes how you go about realigning them, but I think someone could come up with some fair rules for that. It would work almost exactly like the caucuses now and it would also be flexible so that if rules about delegate assignments or viability ever changed you could use this process with some minor tweaks.

677,677,BrainDeadUnit,1581033150,f01m15,Nan,"Look at how much the media sources we know are biased against Bernie and want a moderate instead are railing hard against the caucuses. Look at the fake Bernie supporters saying we shouldn't vote democratic at all (and occasionally even saying to support Trump instead) because the caucuses cheated Bernie. IMO, it's clear that the people who aren't favored by democracy are the ones most against the caucus system.

When we have the caucus, even if Bernie doesn't win, it is undeniable that he has support from a major segment of the population. Anyone can show up at the caucus and see the room half-full of Bernie supporters (at least anecdotally, Pete supporters seem to largely be people who chose Pete as a second choice when their first choice didn't meet viability).

They want a primary where Bernie supporters are divided -- where anyone can walk in, and see no obvious signs of Bernie's support. Where a person who thinks Bernie is the guy we need, but is worried about viability, will just cast their vote for an alternative candidate, so they can beat Trump, and where Pete supporters will think he's a long shot and vote for Biden (remember, Pete is establishment's second choice, they'd go with Biden if they could), too. They want a primary where Biden supporters will show up and never think twice about a second candidate, let alone realize Biden doesn't actually even have the support to meet viability in many places.

The caucus system, I believe, is the reason a very moderate state like Iowa can show so much support for Bernie at the polls. Sure, Bernie would have his loyal supporters, regardless. But what about people on the fence? What about people who's first choice between Warren and Bernie is dependent on whichever one is more viable? At the caucus, unity is on full display.

Primaries are low-information events. Most people will have only the information the establishment provided them. Caucuses give a lot more information as to how your community actually feels about issues and topics -- where the community can figure out what the community actually wants, not what the establishment says the community wants.

And that's why I support the caucus. It's a system that allows the community to come together and form consensus with the community, itself; not a consensus with the establishment.",Iowa,In defense of the caucuses.

I first started feeling bad for the people of Iowa when I volunteered to text bank for my favorite candidate. I was informing Iowans about free events the candidate would be at near them. What responses I got, most were very pleasant. A few were 'PLEASE STOP! PLEASE. PLEASE STOP!' and other variations of that statement. (If you were one of them, I apologized and immediately marked a box to remove you from the list). That's when I realized that you guys had been getting bombarded by all 200 candidates constantly. If I were one of you, I honestly would have put my phone in the toilet and flushed it lol. I also got one death threat and a couple dick pic's. Lol. The majority, though, were very nice. Whether they were supporting my candidate or not. 

When everyone starting complaining about Iowa going first, I  felt bad for you. When all the drama happened after the caucus, I again felt bad for you. You have all endured a lot these past few months. A lot of you worked your butt's off for your own chosen candidate. And those of you that caucused didn't get the excitement of seeing who won. 

Now to the reason I came here. Do not think I am pitying you. You all got to meet amazing people I will never get in the same room with any of them probably. You got to ask them your own questions! You all also made history. AGAIN. 

Iowa, you have chosen the first black man, the first woman &amp; now the first openly gay candidate (technically you also chose the first Democratic Socialist candidate) to be your nominee for president. To be the first nominee of an entire state. You picked them, all on your own. You didn't have the luxury of multiple states going before you, telling you they were a popular choice for a nominee. You just voted with your hearts. You have forced progress and change upon the rest of the nation. Three different times!  You all should be damn proud of yourselves. 

Your tv may tell you otherwise, but the majority of the nation is proud of you! The MSM has not learned their lesson from 2015-2016. They are the ones who started acting like the national power grid went down 5 minutes after they were expecting the caucus results and didn't get them.  They could have just said the state was counting the votes to ensure accurate reporting and that once Iowa was sure of the results, we would know. They could have said how serious the state was taking it and how great that is because our elections are under attack right now. We need to do everything we can to ensure correct results. That is more important than instant gratification. 

So if you're feeling down about how everything has gone, stop it. You are awesome Iowa!",Iowa,Hi from Indiana!

What happened?  Did Bernie win the last satellite caucus or not?  Where there 600 or more people who voted in that caucus to trigger more sdes, or not?

742,742,brunettedude,1581375854,f1yqlw,Nan,"I've been dating this guy for the last month and I want to make sure he has a great Valentines Day. I've dated people in the past, but never anything official. He's had girlfriends in the past, but since coming out, I'm the first guy he's been with. He's going to be my first Valentine, too. 

Usually we go out to eat, watch Netflix, and cuddle. We've gone out for sushi, breakfast, coffee, etc. I love spending time with him. Last night he made me supper and hung around his place. I love it, but he confessed he's worried he's too boring for me. ""All what we do is watch movies."" 

I'm planning on having Hurts Donuts deliver donuts to him in class. They hire a person to dress up as Cupid to deliver them and dance. His friends think it'd be funny. Sadly, they require a 4 hour window, and since he has lots of different classes Friday, I can't guarantee he'd be in one spot. So I'm going to surprise him on Thursday instead- as soon as I find out what classroom he'd be in 😅

I thought it'd be fun to go to the Crossroad Mall and go to build a bear, but apparently that closed down. He's a sweet, caring, affectionate guy that loves Disney. Whenever we go out somewhere, someone always knows him. I want to make sure he knows I care.

There's just not much to do in Cedar Falls. Does anyone have any advice? What's everyone else doing? Friday its going to be ~11 degrees out. If it was warmer I'd take him to get donuts and have a little picnic. I could just default to just a movie and supper, but I also want it to be meaningful for him too.

Any ideas? I was hoping someone else here would be a UNI student or Cedar Falls resident that could help me :)

Thanks!",Iowa,Need help with Valentines Day ideas. UNI student + first time Valentine! Advice? :)

838,838,xeroblaze0,1582301023,f7d6q6,Nan,"Dear Mr. Hay:

Thank you for taking the time to contact me with your support for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. As your senator, it is important for me to hear from you. 

The question of whether or not to impeach and remove a duly elected public official, in this case the President of the United States, is an extremely serious one that was contemplated by the Framers and addressed in the Constitution. Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that ""The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" Those are the sole bases for impeachment.

On December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives voted to adopt two articles of impeachment against President Trump. The first article provided that President Trump should be removed from office for “abuse of power,” and the second article provided that he should be removed from office for “obstruction of Congress.” Unfortunately, this marks perhaps the most partisan impeachment in the history of the United States. In fact, the only bipartisanship the American people witnessed during the House’s vote stood opposed to impeachment.

The Framers of the Constitution warned against using impeachment as a partisan weapon. They were rightly concerned that impeachment would be determined by the strength of political parties instead of by real demonstrations of innocence or guilt. But that’s one reason why the Framers didn’t leave impeachment solely in the hands of the House of Representatives.

On Wednesday, February 5, 2020, following a full and fair 11-day trial in the Senate, I voted to acquit the President of the impeachment charges brought against him by the House of Representatives.

As I explained in my recent statement on the floor of the Senate, which you can view here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB7lN9EodsM), a vote to convict or acquit the President on charges of impeachment is perhaps the most important vote a senator could cast. Before this presidential impeachment trial, it had happened only twice in our Nation’s history. That’s for good reason, and it’s something that should never be done lightly. Accordingly, I took my role as a judge and juror seriously.

The impeachment trial began with a full and fair debate on the rules that guided our process. We considered and voted on 11 amendments for over nearly 13 hours. Consistent with precedent, the Senate adopted rules allowing the same length of time for arguments and questions as was agreed to unanimously in 1999, and it engaged in a robust debate on calling witnesses and pursuing additional evidence. In total, the Senate sat as a Court of Impeachment for over 70 hours. The final vote to acquit the President was the product of a fair and judicious process, consistent with precedent.

I couldn’t say the same of the articles of impeachment adopted by the House. After fully considering the record and the parties’ presentations, I concluded that what the House was asking the Senate to do is constitutionally flawed and dangerously unprecedented.

First, the House’s “abuse of power” article described objectively legal conduct. A president is within his authority to request that a foreign leader assist with anti-corruption efforts. To make up for this hurdle, the House’s argument rested entirely on the President’s subjective motive. This is a vague, flexible standard that cannot be sustained. Under such a standard, future majorities in the House of Representatives could impeach presidents for taking lawful action for what a slim majority thinks are simply the wrong reasons.

The House argued that motive by itself is sufficient to prove the illegality of an action. But this flips basic concepts in our justice system upside down, and represents an unprecedented expansion of the scope of the impeachment authority. With limited exception, motive is offered in court to show that the defendant on trial is the one who most likely committed the illegal act that’s been charged—it doesn’t make an otherwise lawful act unlawful.

The House also provided no guidance on whether conviction—and therefore removal from office—should rest on proving a single, “corrupt” motive, or whether mixed motive would suffice under their theory. In its trial brief, the House argued that there’s “no credible alternative explanation” for the President’s alleged conduct. But once the Senate heard from the President’s Counsel, the House changed its tune. Apparently, even a credible alternative explanation shouldn’t stop the Senate from removing the President.

Re-shaping their own standard mid-trial, however, only served to undercut their initial arguments. And simply asserting at least 63 times that their evidence was “overwhelming” didn’t make the House’s allegations accurate or prove an impeachable offense.

Even after arguments had concluded, the House managers started repeating the terms “bribery” and “extortion” on the floor of the Senate, while neither appears anywhere in the articles. It’s not the Senate’s job to read into the House’s articles what the House failed, or didn’t see fit, to incorporate itself. As I made clear, articles of impeachment shouldn’t be moving targets. The ambiguities surrounding the House’s “abuse of power” theory gave me reason enough to vote “not guilty.” If we’re going to lower the bar of impeachment, we better be clear on where the bar is being set.

Second, the House’s article for “obstruction of Congress” was equally unprecedented and patently frivolous. I know a thing or two about obstruction by the Executive Branch. Congressional oversight—rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse—is central to my role as a senator representing Iowa taxpayers. In the face of obstruction, I use the tools the Constitution provides to this institution. That’s the very core of checks and balances.

For example, I fought the Obama administration to obtain documents related to “Operation Fast and Furious.” Under the House’s “obstruction” standard, should President Obama have been impeached for his failure to waive privileges during the course of that investigation? We fought President Obama on this for three years in the courts, and we still didn’t end up with all we asked for. We never heard a word from the House Majority then. So, the hypocrisy here is on full display.

In this impeachment, the House issued a series of requests and subpoenas to the Executive Branch. But the House failed to enforce its requests. When challenged to stand up for its subpoenas in court, the investigating committee simply retreated. The House may cower at defending its own authority, but the Senate shouldn’t have to clean up a mess of the House’s own making. For the many ways in which the House failed in the fundamentals of oversight, and for the terrible new precedent the “obstruction” article would’ve set, I voted “not guilty.”     

There’s also been debate about the whistleblower whose complaint motivated the House’s impeachment inquiry. Now, I’ve worked for and with whistleblowers for more than thirty years. I’ve sponsored numerous laws to strengthen whistleblower protections. Attempts by anyone to “out” a whistleblower just to sell an article or score a political point aren’t helpful. It’s not the treatment any whistleblower deserves. 

However, it’s important for investigators to talk to whistleblowers, to evaluate their claims and credibility, because those claims form the basis of an inquiry.  My office does this all the time. When whistleblowers bring us significant cases of bipartisan interest, we frequently work closely with the other side to look into those claims. I know the House committees have followed that course in the past. Both parties understand how to talk to whistleblowers and respect their confidentiality. But why no efforts were taken in this case to take these very basic, bipartisan steps is baffling. I fear that, to achieve its desired ends, the House majority weaponized and politicized whistleblowers for purely partisan purposes. I hope that the damage done will be short lived. 

Furthermore, as a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I’ve always made it a priority to hold judicial nominees to a standard of restraint and fidelity to the law. As judges in this case, we too needed to consider those factors which counseled restraint. To begin with, the articles came to the Senate as the product of a flawed, unprecedented and partisan process. The House Majority’s inquiry ignored many of the procedural rights that were given to the investigating Committee’s minority in previous impeachments. When the articles were voted on by the full House, the only bipartisanship was in opposition. 

Moreover, the Iowa caucuses have already occurred. The 2020 presidential election is underway. Yet we were asked to remove the incumbent from the ballot, based on an impeachment supported by only one party in Congress.

The Senate refused to endorse the dangerous new precedent this would’ve set for future impeachments.

Finally, I want to briefly address the issue of witnesses. Over the span of two weeks, the Senate conducted a fair and thorough examination of the House’s articles of impeachment and supporting materials. That includes more than 28,500 pages of evidence, interviews with 17 witnesses and 192 video clips. The House managers themselves argued that the evidence they provided was “overwhelming” and “uncontested.” Accordingly, the Senate did not need to take the unprecedented step of hearing from witnesses that were not already part of the House’s record.

Now that this impeachment trial has drawn to a close, the American people are more than adequately prepared to decide for themselves the fate of the President in November.

This decision belongs to the People.

Once again, thank you for taking time to contact me. I urge you to keep in touch. 

Sincerely,

Chuck Grassley
United States Senate",Iowa,Sen. Grassley's response on impeachment
839,839,xeroblaze0,1582301201,f7d8eu,Nan,"Dear OP,

Thank you for taking the time to contact me about the impeachment process. It is important for me to hear from folks in Iowa on matters such as this.

On September 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry. Upon completing its investigation, the House Judiciary Committee introduced two articles of impeachment on December 10, 2019 - Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress. The House Judiciary Committee voted to advance these articles to the full House of Representatives on December 13, 2019. On December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives approved these two articles. Not a single Republican voted to approve these articles, while a handful of Democrats also voted against the measure.

The House delayed sending the articles to the Senate for nearly a month.  Finally, on January 16, 2020, the Senate began the process of hearing evidence from both the House impeachment managers and the President's defense team. Both sides were given the opportunity to present their cases, and we heard statements from over a dozen witnesses and were able to review over 28,000 pages of documents. After hearing all of the evidence, there was an opportunity for the Senate to hear from additional witnesses. On January 31, 2020, the motion to hear from additional witnesses failed by a 49 - 51 vote. After much thought and consideration, I chose to vote against hearing from additional witnesses. I believe that it was the responsibility of the House to hear from witnesses, and in the 28 days that the House stalled in sending over the articles, they could have been using that time to subpoena witnesses. Further, given the exhaustive evidence already provided to the Senate from the House, I felt that additional witness testimony was not needed to render judgement.

On February 5, 2020, the Senate voted on the Articles of Impeachment. The President was pronounced ""Not Guilty"" on the first article, Abuse of Power, by a 52 - 48 vote. The President was also found ""Not Guilty"" on the second article, Obstruction of Congress, by a 53 - 47 vote. 

I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and I take that oath very seriously. It’s clear to me that the Constitution intentionally sets a high bar for removing the President. This is because the Founders were rightfully concerned that impeachment might be used to upend the electoral will of the American people. This vote was not about liking the President or agreeing with his policies or even approving of his conduct. We had one job during this process: to decide, based on the evidence, whether the President committed an impeachable offense. Upon reviewing the record, as well as hearing the arguments from both sides, I chose to vote against both articles of impeachment because I did not believe these charges met the high constitutional standard of ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" 

Thank you for the opportunity to explain my votes and to hopefully answer your questions regarding this process.  I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts and views with me.

Hi! I’m working on a video project about the Midwest region and for it I want to have anonymous confessions from people. You can be from any area in the Midwest and it doesn’t matter if you live there currently or have lived there in the past. The confessions can be lighthearted and funny or they can also be maybe more personal or a issue you have the region. Everything will be completely anonymous but it will be used in a video I plan on making. I know the Midwest is a very general and wide area to talk about and I’m only from one part of it so that’s why I’m doing this to get some different perspectives.Also I don’t really understand how to use reddit lol so I’m doing my best. You can respond to this by sending me a message directly or responding to this? Can you do that? I don’t know whoops but if you can that works. Thanks!",Iowa,Hi!

I have looked for a coherent answer on how to go about setting up a courthouse marriage in Johnson County and all I can find that really is consistent is that everyone seems to agree that I need to file the Application for Marriage.  After that though, how do I get a courthouse marriage lined up -- do I just call the Recorder's Office, or is there a different branch of government with its own court system to handle marriages? Has anyone else done this? I understand I need two witnesses and that the judge will legalise the marital relationship upon pronouncing us married.

My wife and I are planning a trip to Iowa to dig into family history.

The plan is very loose outside of this. We can go at any point between April-August, we will have a car, and we just want to make the most of our trip.

Is there anything that goes down in the area at any point during the summer that we would be fools to miss? Example: If someone was planning a trip to Kentucky around April-June I would suggest they go in May to be part of the Derby festivities. We are down for anything fun!

However, I was told I still had to take the road test. 

I have never driven a motorcycle on the street before, only in a parking lot during the test. I haven't ridden since the course (I bought an old bike and have gotten it running, just need to replace the tires). As such, I feel I am out of practice. I'd like to go and practice maneuvers at a parking lot across the street from my house, with permission from the owners. I'd walk my motorcycle down the street there, ride on the lot, then walk it back. I'd go for a permit, but I don't know anyone with a motorcycle license (except for my dad, who lives in my home state of Texas), and I doubt anyone would take time out of their day to watch me do loops around a parking lot.   
I have never had a license before (I'm 29 and autistic, driving a car is difficult for me, but a motorcycle is small and I have clear visibility). Looking on the DMV website, it says that if you successfully pass a MSF course and provide documentation, they waive the road test. However, I was told that I still had to take it. The DMV workers were confused, as I was going solely for a Class M (they actually had to take about 10 minutes to look it all up).

993,993,helpfulsmile2020,1583588320,fev8bd,Nan,"Hy-Vee, for the first time in my 20+ year career with the company is laying off employees. About a month ago every store director in the company was called to Des Moines for an emergency meeting where over 80 store directors were demoted and received paycuts ranging from 20-45%. They were then tasked to go back to their respective stores and reduce the number of full time employees and cut wages. Some employees were offered positions working overnight at a lower wage, some were reallocated to local Aisles Online fulfillment centers (announced they are shutting those down yesterday), and some were let go on the spot. Experienced, loyal employees were targeted due to their higher wage. 

Failed concepts and programs over the last 10 years have led us to this point. Market Grilles, Clothing &amp; Basin departments, centralizing fresh food production (lower quality), product and celebrity endorsements (Mark Wahlberg), just to name a few. Hy-Vee lost its identity trying to be something it was not. We sacrificed operating a clean, service-oriented grocery store with a wide selection to try and sell you a bath bomb and a sit down meal before you shop.

Hy-Vee operates 4 Aisles Online fulfillment centers in its trade area. 500+ employees at each location will be let go as of March 24th. There are no guarantees of placing existing employees into Hy-Vee stores. 

When you shop at Hy-Vee you are paying a premium, you can get the same items at competitors significantly cheaper. You're paying for the better service and selection that is lost at most retailers today. Hy-Vee is now no different than its competitors other than being priced higher. When you shop your local Hy-Vee, take a look at the employees or lack thereof. Morale is at an all time low, employees who weren't let go now suddenly have 2 or 3 extra jobs to do. Fully stocked shelves with product that is properly rotated and not out of date will be a thing of the past at Hy-Vee.

But, unfortunately, I still have questions and won't be able to get in to see him again for a while.

I have the petition for name change all done and filled out. All info on there is correct. Meeting with the lawyer, I found out that I had to submit my birth certificate on eFile as an ""Other Event,"" and redact my DOB. However, I noticed after meeting with the lawyer that, on the top of the petition, that ""this form requires protected information and the filing of a separate Protected Information Form. He didn't mention that. And i'm not sure what exactly to do with that form. While I've redacted *my* protected info (my date of birth) on my birth certificate, my mom and dad's DOBs are both still on there. I'm unsure if I should redact their DOBs as well, because that is protected info, albeit not mine. I don't want to incur additional fees for accidentally screwing up my name change documents, so I want to get it right the first time.

Moderators of /r/DesMoines:

I am not a public health official or medical professional - merely a concerned Iowan.  People have begun making anonymous posts (two linked below) on /r/DesMoines claiming to have inside knowledge about Covid-19 at area hospitals.  

At best these posts are made by people with actual firsthand knowledge who are exercising poor judgment and spreading this information in a haphazard manner.  At worst, they are individuals intentionally trying to spread fear.  Either way, these posts need to be brought under control.  The moderators of /r/DesMoines need to do whatever is necessary to make sure this subreddit does not become a conduit for misinformation and fear-mongering.

You can read more about her here: [https://www.kimberlyforiowa.com/meet-kim](https://www.kimberlyforiowa.com/meet-kim) 

Currently, Kimberly Graham has the most name recognition out of any democrat running to unseat Joni Ernst ([https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2020/03/07/joni-ernst-job-approval-below-50-but-plurality-of-likely-voters-say-they-would-definitely-re-elect-h/4977479002/](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2020/03/07/joni-ernst-job-approval-below-50-but-plurality-of-likely-voters-say-they-would-definitely-re-elect-h/4977479002/)). 

If you are looking for an Iowan who will fight for Medicare For All, a Green New Deal, reproductive rights, ending Citizens United, raising the minimum wage, ending Big Ag, and so many issues affecting Iowans, look no further. 

As you might imagine, we are a grassroots movement, our campaign is funded by small dollar donors who believe in our message and is run by passionate activists all across the state.

If you like what Kimberly's about, and want to get more involved (perhaps, find something to do amidst this coronavirus quarantine), look no further!

Do you vote regularly? If so, what is the most local elections you vote in and why?

All I need is your last 12 months of electric usage, which is typically on your bill, and I can do the analysis for you remotely.  Then we can set up a Google Hangout or phone call to talk about how it all works. No need to worry about Coronavirus transmission!

I work for Moxie Solar, Iowa's #1 solar company. We have a great bill swap financing program with no money out of pocket and for most customers, you'll be saving money immediately. I've seen Alliant customers who save over $50 month!

Tax credits are still available (26% federal and up to 13% Iowa) and we all know electricity rates will keep going up over time! Solar is a great investment especially considering it's money you're already spending every month.

The changes allowed by the FDA are now reaching effect. National ""reference"" labs have started accepting tests and Iowa hospital systems are now sending lower risk tests to these labs.

Tests for higher risk patients meeting the state's stricter criteria will still go to the State Hygienic Lab in Coralville. These results are a bit faster and are sure to be no charge, even if you have no insurance.

If your doctor wants you to get a test and you don't meet the strict SHL criteria, then the clinic's send-out system will route it to the private national labs. If you have insurance, this should still be free. 

But, please... Trust your healthcare provider's advice. If he/she says you don't need a test, then just follow that advice. There is still a national shortage of some testing chemicals and supplies, so you doctor may feel you don't have enough risk to waste supplies getting a negative test just to make you feel better.

If you have a high risk person in your household, tell your doctor about that. It might be enough to push the decision over the line and get you a test.",Iowa,Getting a coronavirus test if you've been rejected.

1220,1220,Slurms_McK3nzie,1584808192,fmhmmm,Nan,"I, like many, am now watching Gov. Reynolds' press briefings during this Covid-19 pandemic. I'll start by saying that her office has taken swifter action than many states. I believe this is due to the fact that Iowa essentially went from 0 cases to roughly 16 immediately which jolted them awake.

Many times I've heard Gov. Reynolds say ""if you're sick, stay home"". While true, I am concerned that many Iowans take the inverse to be true by assumption, ""if you're not sick, you dont need to stay home"".  This isn't true, this virus is very stealthy and efficient. Someone could have it and not know it at all, but still be contagious. Someone could be infected for up to 14 days before they get health issues. I think she needs to be honest, and inform the public that you can be ""sick"" before you even know it. Lots of people could make better choices with more clear guidance from leadership.  Essential people of all types are going to have to continue functioning, so non-essential people need to pitch in by staying home. You could be a spreader for 14 days after your last interaction in public.  

The virus also lives on surfaces. Most things say hard surfaces, like metal or plastic, for up to 3 days. That's why you need to wash your hands. I think the Governors office would do well to explain WHY we need to wash our hands. And to emphasize that the virus will die eventually on it's own, which is a good thing. In theory, you could leave an item you obtained in a room for 3 days and hopefully it will be decontaminated.  We CAN slow it down if we start considering these things.

 
Finally, we are all in this together. Help others as best you can.  And take care to slow the spread. 

Thanks and be safe fellow Iowans!",Iowa,Opinion: Gov. Reynolds needs to optimize her message to all Iowans

Tell your Senators and congressional representative how the virus is affecting your life. Encourage them to allocate the funds needed to fight this virus.

Let's face it -- the Federal government has been one to two months behind on this. The shortage of test kits is embarrassing. I read how a patient who had been to a US party returned to South Africa and was tested and came back positive ***in one day!*** 

We in America can't get tested unless we're being hospitalized. The test situation is getting better, but is nowhere near what it should be. 

Our healthcare providers are working with ***home-sewn masks.*** What century is this? 

Thanks to everyone who is helping with the situation, whether you're a emergency worker continuing to risk exposure, a healthcare working helping save lives or one of the many people helping make masks. 

Also, thanks to everyone who is following the stay-home recommendations. Get your kids to follow that rule too. Trust me -- I know how angry they can get about it. Every time you avoid getting the virus, you break a link in the epidemic chain. You're not only protecting yourself and your family, you're helping save lives in Iowa.

We're not New York or Chicago. Right now, Iowa's containment is working pretty well. Check the numbers over the next seven days. If we stay on pace at about 5 patients per day, we will be very lucky to be living here.

My family member (Z) got really sick and had to be hospitalized in a small community hospital in Iowa. The physicians decided to test them for Covid and this sample was then supposed to be sent to a secondary testing company called quest. 

A week goes by &amp; no results- then they find out that quest “canceled” the batch of tests?! I’m dumbfounded at this point but luckily my family member has gotten much better and was discharged from the hospital but still- WTF? Does this sound as fishy as I think? I get that having a positive or negative test probably wouldn’t have changed his course of treatment b/c he was able to fight it but this sounds super fraudulent. I’m not really sure who to trust or blame- the small hospital that says they tested him, the larger institution the hospital sent the test to, or the outside laboratory that’s being blamed for “canceling the batch”. 

This doesn’t bode well for my trust in Iowa’s testing capabilities or adequate case tally. I’m just honestly confused and worried. My family member has decided to be safe and remain quarantined as he’s getting better along with his family. But seriously WTF?",Iowa,Covid-19 test canceled by Quest diagnostics?

Most stores are doing replenishment orders 7-10 days out, and they try to do their best not to over purchase on perishable goods. (Produce, milk, eggs, butter, etc) when the initial panic buying began, the replenishment orders coming in only had 3-4 days of forecasted demand, and people were buying 2-3 weeks of product. Starting this weekend, we should see better fulfillment rate because all the retailers are reacting accordingly to the change in demand. However, there’s still issues at the mainland warehouses, they are depleted, and need at least a few weeks to resolve. 

There were also rumors that our ports were closing down, which definitely didn’t help the panic.

Hope this helps and everyone should see much calmer shopping patterns starting this week, and just be patient and give the stores a chance to get caught Up. I am Still  open to help Much more. Whether it’s dropping off groceries or some other task that require labor/transportation.

 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

But there is a movement among healthcare systems to recommend *all* Iowans make/get homemade cloth masks and wear them when out in public. These masks alone are not great at protecting **you from** the virus, but they are good at **protecting others from you.**

COVID-19 can be contagious before you notice symptoms. The early signs can be like allergies or a mild cold. You can spread the disease to your coworkers, friends and family before you know you're sick.

A cloth mask helps. If your mask catches virus-filled droplets from an unexpected cough, that may save one or more people from getting your infection.

###Don't get me wrong: a cloth mask might keep YOU from getting the virus. It isn't fully effective, but it is much better than nothing. 

To fully protect yourself, you'd need an N95 mask, plus training on how to put it on, take it off and disinfect it before reuse. 

Instead, cloth masks let you protect those near you, and gives you some protection, too. For this level of protecting your coworkers, friends and family, all you need is a cloth facemask. You can wash it at night to disinfect.

To learn how to sew a mask, check the website of your local hospital. There are detailed instructions. I've also heard that some fabric shops are donating supplies, even precut and ready to sew.

If you can't sew, consider trying to buy a regular face mask. They're tough to find, but you might get lucky. Also, some hospitals may start giving out extra homemade masks. Cloth masks can be sterilized and reused, so the hospitals will reach a point where they have enough and can start to share.

Keep an eye out for this coming announcement from local hospitals. But, don't wait... Sew a mask for everyone in your family. Then sew more for your local hospital. It will help you and all of Iowa.",Iowa,Iowa Hospitals Beginning to Recommend Cloth Masks for All

# It may be time for everyone to mask up

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is [**having second thoughts about masks**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/cdc-masks-coronavirus.html?campaign_id=154&amp;emc=edit_cb_20200331&amp;instance_id=17231&amp;nl=coronavirus-briefing&amp;regi_id=120519662&amp;segment_id=23454&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=e9cb4bb1f113e9ca3c0bce3f0c004be1). For weeks, it (and we) said that ordinary citizens in the U.S. did not need to wear them unless they were sick and coughing or were caring for someone who was.

Now, with the number of cases in the U.S. doubling every three or four days, it looks as though [**that may not have been the best advice**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/health/us-coronavirus-face-masks.html?campaign_id=154&amp;emc=edit_cb_20200331&amp;instance_id=17231&amp;nl=coronavirus-briefing&amp;regi_id=120519662&amp;segment_id=23454&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=e9cb4bb1f113e9ca3c0bce3f0c004be1).

New data cited by Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., shows high rates of transmission by people who are infected but don’t know it yet. An infected person can be contagious for 48 hours before developing symptoms, if they get them at all. Having a mask on could cut down on the number of transmissions from asymptomatic people.

So the C.D.C. is now considering whether to recommend that more people — maybe everybody — wear a mask when out in public.

Not a high-grade N95 medical mask, though. Those are scarce and should still be saved for those who need them most, medical professionals and others on the front lines. One reason the C.D.C. hesitated to advise universal mask-wearing was to avoid making shortages of those masks even worse.

But for this purpose, you don’t need that type; ordinary surgical masks and even homemade masks will do. They will help slow transmission in the community, even though they don’t ensure complete protection for the wearer.

And there’s a side benefit: Wearing any kind of mask, even a bandanna, will make you less likely to touch your face — an important route for infection.

Make your own mask. It isn’t difficult, and you may already have everything you need at home. [**Here’s a guide**](https://www.nytimes.com/article/how-to-make-face-mask-coronavirus.html?campaign_id=154&amp;emc=edit_cb_20200331&amp;instance_id=17231&amp;nl=coronavirus-briefing&amp;regi_id=120519662&amp;segment_id=23454&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=e9cb4bb1f113e9ca3c0bce3f0c004be1).",Iowa,Wear a Mask in Public -- CDC is Now Following What Cedar Rapid's Mercy Medical Center Said Today

*""These numbers feel made up to me. \[Insert location\] had \[insert rumor\] test positive a few days ago, yet it is not showing in \[insert county\].""* 

I replied to one of these in today's post and thought I'd add this here. 

* **Cases are counted where the patient lives**. The person may work somewhere else or be tested somewhere else, but the case count goes to the residing county. (My thanks to the user who pointed this out.)
* **Word of mouth can get messed up quickly**. I exchanged messages with a husband who insisted there were no test kits in all of Cedar Rapids. He insisted for a few days. Nice guy, no bad intent. He checked back with his wife. Turned out, he misunderstood.
* **A lot of healthcare workers have their own health on the line each day -- we would be screaming if the numbers were faked.** Many, many people have visibility into the data. A lot of hospital leaders are watching and planning for when ICUs will fill up. Again: If these numbers were being faked, **we would be screaming.**
* **It would be great if we could test everyone, same day.** 
* **Results in Iowa are running from same-day (two major hospitals) to up to five days.** I'll update this bullet point if I can share any more exact data. 
* **Yes, it can take up to 14 days to develop symptoms, so there are more cases** than what the maps and counts show. But...
* **Scary fact: 20-40% of cases appear to be symptom-free, walking around spreading the virus without knowing it. You, dear reader, might be infectious right now.** That's why there's all the talk about everyone wearing a mask.

I only make these posts as a private individual. I cannot and do not make statements on behalf of my employer. Look at my profile: Some Random Guy.

But I *can* tell you that I'm ass deep in reporting this stuff.  I do these graphs as I can, but I spent the *whole day today* making sure these tests are reported... and I'm not done yet. When I'm done with that, I get to look at some billing stuff so we stay in business. (Do I sound frustrated? Because, I'm sick of this pandemic, and I'm not even ill or directly in contact with the ""dirty"" patients.)

If it helps you evaluate the reliability of my info, I can tell you that I'm at a major medical center in a large Iowa metro. I see a good cross section of what's happening.

1498,1498,Jelfff,1585781143,ftagi6,Nan,"Below is a link for an interactive COVID-19 map that I produce as a public service.  **Authoritative data** for the map comes directly from the same GIS (Geographic Information System) server that feeds the map produced by Johns Hopkins University.  The team at Johns Hopkins updates the data multiple times during the day.  Each time you open the map or click on a symbol, you will see the **most recent data** that is hosted on the GIS server.

The map has **multiple GIS overlays** that you can turn on/off/restack.  These overlays include:

\* Cases by county (USA only)

\* Deaths by county (USA only)

\* Cases by state (World)

\* Deaths by state (World)

\* Testing locations (USA)

\* Hospital data (USA)

\* A layer with links to each state’s COVID-19 website (USA)

When the map opens, the overlay layer showing COVID-19 cases by county is displayed.  If you zoom in you should also see blue lines that are the county boundaries.  If those lines do not appear then the federal GIS server hosting that data is likely too busy.

Looking for the legend?  Need help?  Please read the **""Map tips""** \- link in upper left corner. 

If you take a moment to read the ""Map tips"" then you can learn (1) **how to make your own custom map links**, (2) how to make any overlay clickable and (3) learn more about the data the map can display including links to more information about the Johns Hopkins data.

Finally, be careful in interpreting the small yellow and magenta circles on the map.  Together they show counties (or states) where there is less than 10 \*reported\* cases.  There could easily be additional cases in that area that have not been tested.  Remember, people can spread the virus even when they are not showing any symptoms.

\--------

Sorry for the stress the pandemic is causing you! We all feel your pain. We appreciate the retail workers on the front lines! We know you don't get unemployment if you quit, so you may feel stuck and powerless. 

Here are some facts and ways to protect yourself and your family. 

**General Coronavirus Facts**

* First, don't panic!
* Yes, you've probably already been exposed. In retail jobs, the odds are good.
* 25% of cases have no symptoms. So, you or your co-workers could have the virus and be spreading it to customers. That's an unhappy fact and why customers should stay home.
* Even for those with symptoms, 80% of cases are mild. The younger you are, the better the chance of a mild infection. 

**Recommendations to Protect Yourself in Retail**

* The regular cleaning supplies you have will kill the virus. Just wipe down your work area often. 
* Wear a homesewn, cloth face mask. This gives you a bit of protection, but also protects your coworkers and customers. If you have a no-symptoms infection, those little coughs or everyday sneezes could be spreading the virus. 
* Wear gloves. Cloth work gloves are great. The gloves don't protect you from the virus, unless you have cuts or broken skin. They do help you **notice** when you touch your face. Face touching is the primary way the virus spreads, along with breathing in when an infected person coughs or sneezes near you. 
* If you have glasses, wear them instead of contacts. It helps you not touch your eyes and protects you from sneezes and coughs.
* Try to stay six feet away from your coworkers and customers. This can be difficult in some work environments, but do the best you can.

For the recommendation for cloth, homesewn face masks, you should [watch this video to know how to wear and remove them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OABvzu9e-hw). Washing the face mask at night will kill any virus. Wash or disinfect your hands after touching or removing the mask.

For the gloves, wash or disinfect your hands after you remove them. If  you wear cloth work or gardening gloves, wash them at night to disinfect. When you're using cloth gloves at work, you can use hand sanitizer or disinfectant wipes on them to kill any germs.

When you get off work and get home, consider yourself contaminated. Without sitting down (if possible), take off your clothes and wash them immediately. If you can't, place them in a laundry basket and be sure nobody touches them until you can do the wash. After removing your clothes or doing the laundry, wash your hands. 

After removing your ""contaminated"" work clothes, consider taking a shower. At the least, wash or disinfect your hands.

If have to sit down to remove your clothes, do so on a wood or plastic chair. Wash down or disinfect the chair after your done. 

**Work With Your Manager or Higher Leadership**  
Present these recommendations to your manager and encourage that all staff use these guidelines. If you manager won't let you wear the cloth mask and gloves, consider calling your local health department and discuss these recommendations. Ask the local health department if they can call the manager or company leadership to push for you.

Ask your management if the company will hire someone to sew cloth face masks for the staff. Disposable masks are being reserved for healthcare workers and patients. If the company won't do this, make a mask for yourself or find someone who can sew to do it. (See below for instructions.)

**Recommendation If You Are Higher Risk or You Live With Someone Higher Risk.**  
Higher risk people are:

* Those over 65 years old and older;
* Those with chronic health conditions. 

See [this CDC guidance for more details](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fpeople-at-higher-risk.html). If you are higher risk, contact your doctor for guidance. You may not be able to keep working retail without significant danger.

If you live with or care for a higher-risk person, you and that person have some tough choices to make. Ideally, a different job would be best. If you must keep working retail, be sure to use all the protection steps listed above. 

**If You Have Proven COVID-19 Exposure**  
If someone at your work site tests positive for the virus, your company should consider sending you home for 14 days on paid leave. The company should also do a deep-clean of the work site. The company will probably already be working with the local health department on this. If your company isn't following these guidelines. call your local health department. 

To find your local health department or get more information in Iowa, call 2-1-1. That hotline is running 24/7.

""When you think about the use of public health mitigation strategies, which is what we have right now while we await additional tools like medications or vaccines, these strategies have to be put in place carefully and consistently in order for them to be effective. So in some ways it wouldn't be enough if somebody you know just sort of stopped in place for two weeks. What we would do in that situation is delay a peak. And what we're trying to do is flatten that peak. It's not that I want to push it out, it's that I want to keep as many people as healthy as possible for as long as possible. And so that's in part why we think about using the strategies we have, and also why, I know this has been a hard time for everybody, but it is so important that we all remind each other wash our hands, cover our coughs, and stay home when we're sick.

---

&gt; Dear digitaltransmutation,



&gt; In response to social distancing directives issued by federal, state and local government officials working to slow the spread of Coronavirus (COVID‑19), Mediacom is implementing new precautionary measures related to service installation and repair appointments.

&gt; We are asking for your assistance because we know you share in our commitment to helping prevent the spread of this virus.

&gt; Our goal with these new measures is to keep both you and our employees safe by limiting in‑home contact between our technicians and members of your household.

&gt; * New Appointments: Before scheduling a new installation or repair appointment, Mediacom will ask if you or someone in the household can assist in completing the interior work related to your requested install or repair. If you answer ""yes"", the appointment will continue as scheduled. If you answer ""no"", the appointment may need to be rescheduled.

&gt; * Pre‑call and Appointment Changes: Before your scheduled appointment, you will receive a pre‑call from Mediacom to confirm your appointment. Once at the appointment location, the Mediacom technician will alert you to his or her arrival and then proceed to complete all necessary work outside the home. Upon completion of the exterior work, the Mediacom technician will ask for your assistance in completing work inside your home.

&gt; * Your assistance: From a position of at least 10 feet outside the entrance to the home, our technician will provide you with instructions on how to activate or repair your Mediacom services. These instructions may include a combination of verbal, written, pre‑recorded video or live chat video directions. Your assistance will be critical in these final steps in order to make sure your services are working correctly. Any equipment needed to complete the installation or repair will either be shipped to your home before the appointment or dropped off at your doorstep by the technician.

&gt; * Electronic Instructions: Included with the equipment will also be written installation instructions. Additional instructions and troubleshooting tips can be found using the following links:

&gt;    * Connecting new equipment: Internet, In‑home Wi‑Fi &amp; Phone set‑up, Wireless Network set‑up, and Video TiVo and HD equipment set‑up.

&gt;    * Troubleshooting tips: How‑to Videos, Internet or Phone repair, Optimizing Internet speed, and Answer Center.

&gt;    * Digital Tools: Download our MediacomConnect MobileCARE app or visit us online and log in to your account at Mediacom Support. You can manage your billing account, troubleshoot services, check for outages, control your home Wi‑Fi service, and more!

&gt;    * Text Care: Text us at 66554 and talk to our digital assistant Molli with questions about your account. And if Molli cannot help you, she will connect you to a live agent.

&gt; Please know we are advising our technicians to enter customer homes only when absolutely necessary and only after the customer has verified that no one in the home has exhibited any signs of illness. Additionally, to help facilitate governmental directives, Mediacom is currently prioritizing requests related to installation and loss of essential services only. If you call to make a service appointment that deals with a non‑essential issue, we may not be able to accommodate your service request at this time.

&gt; As the situation continues to evolve, so will our plans for how we support you and our employees. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience these new precautionary measures may cause you, but we believe they are for the collective good of everyone.

&gt; Thank you for being our customer and for your continued trust in Mediacom to keep you connected.

&gt; Please stay safe and healthy.

&gt; Sincerely,

1686,1686,Blaze5546,1586200425,fw4wyv,Nan,"Throughout this pandemics development, Governor Reynolds has had a fair amount of backlash due to her decision to hold off on issuing a Stay At Home order. I personally support this decision for many reasons and would like to share with others so that others may consider keeping an open mind and trust in our governor. 

The first reason is in regard to the workforce. Many are pushing to have Governor Reynolds to issue this Stay At Home order, but as per the Governor’s daily public addresses, nearly 80% of the workforce would be deemed essential, limiting the actual impact a Stay At Home order in the state of Iowa. 

The second reason is in the actual effectiveness of a Stay At Home order. It is nearly impossible with our current police force to enforce everyone to stay home 100% of the time. It simply would not be effective or efficient in any capacity to enforce by threat of punishment. Governor Reynolds has already issued a proclamation limiting gatherings of 10 or less individuals. I may be naive but I do hope we as a state can be trusted to listen to officials and not need the babysitting of a Stay At Home order. 

My third point is in regard to many people citing Dr. Fauci’s teaching in the situation. While I do believe Dr. Fauci definitely knows what he is doing, he is only able to go off of models and models are representative of the data in our current situation and can be trusted to a certain point. In the Data Science discipline, models are trusted but must be viewed at with understanding that outside sources can change models in a moments notice. This point exposes a potential flaw in models that don’t necessarily make them unusable, but rather means you must handle them just as Governor Reynolds has, setting benchmarks and when the benchmarks are hit, respond appropriately. Not looking at models and potentially overreacting with data that may as well not be representative of the current situation and the future situation. I compare it to the forecast of weather. We understand the weather much more than we do of COVID-19 and it’s development and trends so why do we trust those models more than we do of weather models that are multiple months out? Again I do not completely throw out the predictive models as they do have a lot of predictive power, but they should be applied with logic and utilize Data Science understanding just as Governor Reynolds and her administration has done.

In short, I believe that Governor Reynolds and her administration has done a great job in dealing with the COVID-19 situation. They have put state health, freedom, and economics first in her decision to keep the state open as much as possible, while keeping a watchful eye on the developing situation and closing what she deems is necessary based on her information about the state. I do hope everyone here is doing well and staying safe in this bizarre time.",Iowa,Governor Reynolds COVID-19 Response

* Today we'll likely pass 1,000 cases.
* As many of you note, this isn't the full scope of the epidemic. Only certain groups are being tested. Take a [look at this graph.](https://i.redd.it/5x0uz8d0m3r41.png) You'll notice that there are almost no confirmed cases in people under 18, what the state groups as a ""child."" We all know that teenagers have this, they just have mild cases or even no symptoms.
* If your county's numbers seem low, [look at this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/fwdpdb/for_those_of_you_asking_why_didnt_my_county_have/). A study estimates the odds that your county is having an outbreak, even if your numbers are zero or very low. The NY Times made that into a graphic.
* We've had discussions in the past about how fast test results are coming back. A good source told me that the State's lab, which only takes results for more ill patients, is running between 1 to 3 days. Two large hospitals have started testing on site, so those results are same day or next day: UIHC in Iowa City and UnityPoint Methodist in Des Moines. The other results are going out of state to large national labs. Those results are taking between 7 to 10 days.
* Many of you point out that we need to test more people. Right now, we're only testing when the doctor thinks it will help the clinical care. (Yes, this is correct... the doctor can definitely order a test for you if he/she thinks it will be clinically helpful. But, that order might go out of state, so it will take 7 to 10 days.)  Right now, because of protective supply shortages, doctors are choosing not to order tests for people like teenagers and others with low risk.
* There's a problem with expanding the testing. When we do it, the daily case counts won't be as valuable. Right now, we can compare the daily case counts to each other because the testing criteria has stayed the same for a while. Once we expand testing, the daily counts will increase because we're testing more people. It won't mean there are more cases in the community.
* The death rate is going up. This is because cases end up hospitalized about 7 or 8 days after symptoms start. After that, if they are going to die, it can take a while longer. Take a look at this visualization of [what COVID-19 does to the lungs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/fwdx1z/this_visualization_of_what_covid19_does_to_the/).
* I said yesterday that we seem to have flattened the curve. Hopefully that is true. That doesn't mean today's numbers may make a dramatic move, either up or down. That's just normal variation, just noise in the data. Basically, we want to see a trend lasting one to two weeks. So, if the numbers jump one way or the other, I'd suggest not jumping in and commenting that it proves anything.
* Finally, please...  let's all hope that things get better. For various reasons, people seem to be hoping for things to get worse. The death numbers *will* get worse for a while. Even for those who survive, ""recovery"" can be a terrible thing.

128,128,_Raspootin_,1586372355,fxcgn8,Nan,"Apologizing in advance as this quarantine has me a little on edge, emotionally speaking. 

I moved to Iowa a little over 3 years ago from Illinois and noticed there is a stark contrast in people. I know an imaginary border doesn't really change much, but most of Iowa's border with Illinois is separated by a river which I think has a bit of an impact.

Now please keep in mind, these can be rather broad generalizations and these are my own observations and actual accounts and observations of your own might be totally different, and I completely respect that.

When I lived in Illinois, usually large areas would either be blue or red, democrat and republican. 

When I moved here, I noticed it's rather strange that the concentration of people who are either democrat or republican is either if they live in or near a large city, or out in the country. 

Driving out to ""deep rural areas"" is like driving into parts of hillbilly country. Strange as it seems, I was all over the upper half of Illinois and never noticed such extreme polarity in rural areas. 

Some towns in Iowa are in complete shambles. The local Casey's, Dollar General, Subway or bar seems to be the only economic unit keeping the town from turning into a ghost town. 

I've been to some towns where entire streets of houses are worn down and look nearly impossible to inhabit, akin to driving through some areas of Detroit. Broken windows, old, falling down siding, grass growing a foot tall, broken down cars in the yard.

I've been to rural areas near Weaver and the outskirts of the fertilizer plant where yard after yard was filled with piles of junk. Washing machines, old refrigerators, you name it.

Now some areas of the US are impoverished. It's a simple fact I have no issue with. Some areas just have it rough and the people who live there find it harder to better themselves, either due to lack of better paying jobs, unable to afford to move, etc.

But what I find even more strange is how many of these people in these downtrodden homes support Trump. I've been to towns where there were gigantic Trump flags flying on flag poles. As if they literally abandoned calling themselves Americans and have turned the small town into ""Trumpistan"".

Now I'm not going to open a can of worms to bash Trump, but Trump is not for the poor. Trump is a businessman and his policies are for corporations and businesses in the form of tax cuts and less regulations. A lot of republicans believe in the whole ""boot strap mentality"" and think everyone can just climb some imaginary ladder and become a millionaire or billionaire (in reality it's nearly impossible).

The middle class and those who live below the poverty line have almost always benefited from democratic policies. Most policies that have offered a helping hand in one form or another have been passed by democrats. Social security, medicaid, medicare, food stamps, better working conditions, etc have almost all been written into law, supported by, and expanded by democrats. 

So it makes little sense why the impoverished person living in a house worth less than a new car would support Trump or republicans in general. Pretty much everything they do does not support them, in fact it usually ends up hurting them.

If we look beyond policy, the attitude in general of these people are usually less desirable than a democrat. Again, my own observation, but it seems like these people only wish to help other people who support the same person they do, or someone who lives in the same town as they do.

It's almost uncanny, but these people can sense if you are not from their town. Their attitude will quickly change and they will be more than likely to just not want to talk to you, or do business with you at all. Of course, no politics or anything resembling politics are even discussed. It's like they can smell the blue on you, when you walk into their store.",Iowa,I feel like I need to rant about people and politics (my own observations). Bit of a read.

I've only been here a few times (visiting family, southeast of the state) and it feels like the state should be a lot more red than it is, considering it is HEAVILY white, rural, uneducated and has an aging population.

I'm not being pejorative here, I'm just trying to describe how demographically it seems like it should be a more red state. It is over 90% white, and majority are not college-educated (and the state is seeing heavy ""brain drain"" as well, with the educated people leaving in droves and not many choosing to come in). Same goes with age demographics; a lot of young educated leaving an aging population. That should imply it is solid red instead of purple.

The state is really rural and ""backwater"", and in terms of its views, a lot of the population is as... retrograde as the demographics I've described would imply. Honestly feels southern to me in that sense, if not in others.

What is it about Iowa that makes it not a red state in spite of its demographics (white, rural, post-industrial, uneducated, relatively old) implying it should be?

207,207,wotsenter,1586624593,fz9r3u,Nan," Bob Vander Plaats' most recent attack on Planned Parenthood claims to be driven by the desire to preserve the PPE used in abortions. ([Des Moines Register, April 10.](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2020/04/09/opinion-planned-parenthood-medically-irresponsible-during-covid-19-crisis/2967513001/)) The gloves and masks used for an abortion are a small fraction of the PPE that would be needed for a full term pregnancy. (The gowns, gloves and masks needed for delivery room personnel, as well as the gloves and masks for repeated physical examinations, ultrasounds, and venipunctures during pregnancy.) If preserving PPE is his aim, Vander Plaats should advocate for increased abortion access. His attempt to falsely malign Planned Parenthood with a seemingly righteous call to preserve PPE exposes the devious attempt by some to use the current pandemic to advance other agendas. 

Vander Plaats cites a ""statement signed by the Association of American Physicians &amp; Surgeons and the American College of Pediatricians,"" misleadingly implying some sort of medical consensus. In fact, the statement was put out by a highly biased group of organizations: the Catholic Medical Association, the Christian Medical &amp; Dental Association, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), and the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds). Wikipedia notes that [AAPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons) is a conservative organization that ""advocates a range of scientifically discredited hypotheses."" Wikipedia describes [ACPeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Pediatricians) as a small conservative advocacy group whose main focus is advocating against abortion and gay rights. Neither is widely respected by the medical profession. (Note to Des Moines Register: how about some fact checking now and again?)

Vander Plaats sanctimoniously says ""every American is making sacrifices to stop coronavirus deaths, but Planned Parenthood is demanding to do business as usual."" Vander Plaats should sacrifice the hypocrisy that leads him to violate the ten commandments prohibition against bearing false witness.",Iowa,Vander Plaats Slanders Planned Parenthood

I just left New York to return to Iowa... and fuck man, reading it really drove home how much it sucks to be somewhere where I know without a doubt that most of the gov't doesn't give a shit about me or anybody around me. 

I live in Cedar Rapids, and nothing has changed here much. As far as I can tell, nobody is taking this seriously at all. Weird looks for wearing a mask, traffic seems to be the same as ever, people aren't even capable of figuring out how to read a fucking 2' wide arrow in Hy-Vee. Bike paths were packed with walkers last week when it was nice, and I'm sure the firing ranges nearby are absolutely packed full. I'd be there too, but I'm not going to do anything to raise the risk of my family dying because I wanted to shoot some bang bangs. Even if it is a very slight increase in risk, that's enough and it should be for everybody else as well.

The East Coast coalition got a Republican on board. You know how crazy that is? A Republican governor chose the lives of his own people over Trump's advice. Meanwhile here our governor can't even pretend that she knows we exist. Hell, an SIP order exempting church and pools would be better than nothing whatsoever. It's just gotta be enough to make some people go 'Oh hey, maybe I should act like there's a global epidemic that has killed over 2.5x as many people in NYC alone as 9/11 did, instead of continuing my life like everything is completely normal'. People won't take care of themselves and the people around them without somebody telling them they need to.

It's a pretty neutral article, so I thought I'd share. 

Mainly, the difference seems to have been that SIP orders immediately applied restrictions, which helped reduce the number of cases. Governor Reynold's method left many loopholes for weeks, which she has worked to plug.

At this point, there are still some places that might be closed, like car dealerships, etc... but it is probably too late for a SIP to help much.

## Iowa operates in reverse from ‘stay-at-home’ states 

A Des Moines Register review of states’ “stay-at-home” and “shelter-in-place” orders shows they are far from uniform, though they all work to limit unnecessary social interactions.   

Early adopters like California and Washington enacted a blanket ban on nonessential work and social gatherings, and then carved out exceptions.  

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a March 19 directive that he would “order all individuals living in the State of California to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastructure sectors.”  

His office later identified critical infrastructure workers in key industries like health care, agriculture, energy, government and transportation. Those align closely with federal guidelines.  

Rossana Rosa, an infectious disease specialist at UnityPoint Health in Des Moines, said measures preventing social interactions are critical to preventing the spread of the disease. 

“Physical distancing is the only tool that we have to fight off the virus,” she said. “We don’t have a vaccine. We don’t have reliable treatments to either prevent or cure the virus. So, all we have is physical distancing and handwashing.” 

**►More:** [What's still open in Iowa? Craft stores, livestock auctions and car dealerships; not bookstores and flower shops](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/02/coronavirus-iowa-heres-whats-open-closed-across-state/5087821002/)

Iowa, though, has operated in the reverse. Reynolds has individually identified the types of businesses and gathering places that must close, which critics argue has created loopholes that allow nonessential businesses to remain open. 

Although she acted swiftly [to close bars and restaurants](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/03/17/coronavirus-iowa-reynolds-state-public-health-emergency-covid-19-social-distancing/5067571002/) to dine-in customers March 17, some other retailers remained open for weeks afterward.  

About [a week later](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/03/22/iowa-governor-kim-reynolds-holds-news-conference-coronavirus-covid-19/2894030001/), on March 22, Reynolds ordered salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors, tanning facilities and swimming pools closed. On March 26, she ended elective medical procedures, shut down dentists and closed retailers like clothing and bookstores.

And it was Monday [that she closed](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/04/06/iowa-gov-kim-reynolds-monday-briefing-coronavirus-covid-19-data-matrix-shelter-in-place-stay-at-home/2951642001/) amusement parks, music shops, bowling alleys, libraries and malls. Adult toy shops, [which had remained open](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/04/03/coronavirus-iowa-sex-toy-store-romantix-remains-open/2940714001/), also were closed when the governor singled them out in her proclamation Monday. ",Iowa,Shelter-in-Place Order vs. Governor Reynold's Method

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) --Two employees have died following a coronavirus outbreak that has sickened scores of Tyson Foods workers at a large pork plant in southeastern Iowa.

The deaths of the workers at Tyson plant in Columbus Junction are the first known to be linked to an outbreak at a meatpacking plant in Iowa.

The company said that it was ""deeply saddened by the loss of two team members"" and that their families were in its thoughts and prayers.

The plant has been idled since April 6, when Tyson announced that more than two dozen workers were infected.

The company said Monday that it would continue the plant's suspension this week after more workers tested positive.",Iowa,Tyson Foods says 2 dead after virus outbreak at Columbus Junction plant

Peoples Clinic co-medical director Dr. Sharon Duclos declined comment through a spokesperson Wednesday.

A person who teaches English to some Tyson workers said Tuesday those workers say employees from closed plants were being moved to Waterloo with no quarantine time in between.

A separate individual Wednesday said at least some positive cases in Black Hawk County were residents of Columbus Junction. Tyson’s Columbus Junction location has been closed for an outbreak since April 6.

The teacher said workers also said they were not being provided with personal protection equipment and alleged hand sanitizer stations were not being filled. The teacher did not want to go on the record for fear of outing students and risking their jobs.

332,332,sa130r,1587068266,g2mq5e,Nan,"Good afternoon my friends! I was just put under my second quarantine for COVID-19 after a slight return to work and I though I might share my story so far to help paint a picture of what this situation has looked like for me so far. 

Some background: 24/Male; living in Linn County; working in the construction industry.

On Sunday (04-05-20) I came down with an extremely mild cough (I have allergies typically so I never think anything of light coughs). The next day I go to work still with the light cough. After \~30 minutes of time out of the house/at work I knew for sure I had something more (I hadn't gone anywhere or done anything except work and groceries for the last two weeks prior to social distance.) Just walking \~30 yards was leaving me winded like I ran a 5k.

At this point I called the doctor from my truck and was told to Self-Isolate until I was 72 hours healthy. 

The next three days following were by far the worst. Hours upon hours of laying in bed coughing; just waiting to get enough energy to get out of bed. The symptoms started to fade away and my fever was gone for 72 hours so I was able to go back into work yesterday (Wednesday). I was able to get through a full day, but I had an absolutely horrible pain in my left lung. This morning I called the doctor to confirm their statement was solid for me being non-contagious, but after telling them about how I was nearly collapsing from the pain in the lung I was referred to a respiratory clinic. 

It turns out the news articles about a second wave hitting if someone has a quick recovery were true, they landed on the idea that it's either an entirely separate infection taking advantage of my weakened immune system or it's COVID returning for a stint. Now I get to spend my 25th birthday this weekend trying to recover... Fun stuff

&amp;#x200B;

What's the point of this post?

I'm sitting at home in self isolation for the second week in a row without any idea when I'll be free this time so I need something to do. But some key points to note:

* I never once have been able to get an actual test. I've spoken with family that works in healthcare as well as my standard doctors and they simply cannot test someone my age and in my career field. This is worrisome because I've been noticing more and more people at the jobs with small coughs or the occasional sneeze fits. I have no idea how many people are actually getting sick or not.
* Working for a family business does have its perks. Without any question, pause or doubt; my company paid me out for my missed time so far (even though I'm hourly). They've been constantly calling to check up and offered to deliver groceries, medicine, TP, etc if needed.
* A lot of the ""tough guys"" that aren't afraid of the virus are actually deathly afraid. The day I was cleared to go back in I received more shunning then a pedophile at a preschool.
* Last but not least: Your health is just as important to worry about as spreading the disease is. Even though I was cleared to go back to work I should not have gone. The doctors were saying that had I simply stayed home a couple extra days instead of putting stress on my body and re-exposing my weak immune system to whatever else can be floating around I would likely not be having as much trouble with this second infection.

Anyways guys; please be careful if you're in the Cedar Rapids area right now. I thought I was going to be untouched since I distanced and was outside all day, but it looks like those precautions weren't quite enough. 

Anyways, this has been my TED talk, let me know if you guys have any questions about what the process has been like so far in Iowa specific.",Iowa,A Post To My Fellow Iowans from a COVID-19 Patient

LINN COUNTY, Iowa (KWWL) - Starting Friday, law enforcement throughout Northeast Iowa can arrest people, or cite them with a misdemeanor, if they gather in a group of any size.

That's because Governor Reynolds [issued stricter guidelines](https://kwwl.com/2020/04/16/gov-reynolds-issues-stricter-mitigation-orders-for-region-6-covering-much-of-northeast-iowa/) for Regional Medical Coordination Center region 6 Thursday, which take effect Thursday at midnight.

The governor says the region, comprising 14 counties, has reached a level of 10 on [the state's assessment scale](https://kwwl.com/2020/04/03/what-would-it-take-for-iowa-to-issue-a-shelter-in-place-order-new-documents-show-the-benchmark/); which takes into account things like outbreaks at long term care facilities and the rate of hospitalization for COVID-19.

Despite their new authority under this declaration, law enforcement throughout the region say arrests and citations are something they'd like to avoid.

""That's going to be a last resort; if we just can't come to an agreement,"" Sergeant Alex Dinkla said, public information officer for the Iowa State Patrol.

The state patrol and the Iowa Department of Public Safety are coordinating with law enforcement in the region as the state's response to the virus intensifies. Dinkla says they'd like to stay focused on education and information in the coming weeks.

""Our primary focus is to help educate and encourage folks not to interact in those types of environments,"" Dinkla said.

Cedar Rapids Police Chief Wayne Jerman and Black Hawk County Sheriff Tony Thompson both agreed Thursday (at separate news conferences) they'd like to stick to warnings whenever possible.

Linn County officials also reminded people Thursday exercising outside of the home *is still okay,* as long as you maintain a six-foot distance from others.

""Exercising is an important part of mental health and it is encouraged to exercise with proper social distancing,"" Chief Jerman said.

Chief Jerman added four people *have* been cited for social gatherings but that's only because the individuals [were involved in a planned fight](https://kwwl.com/2020/04/15/suspects-arrested-facing-covid-19-related-charges-in-bever-park-shooting/) and subsequent shooting at Bever Park.

As of right now, this order is set to expire on April 30.",Iowa,"Police want to avoid arrests, even with stricter orders in Northeast Iowa"
