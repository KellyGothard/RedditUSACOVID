The gig was scheduled to take place on Friday, January 10 in Northfield, Ohio. However, Monday afternoon, the show was cancelled due to “circumstances out of the artist’s control.” Neil was set to perform amid a string of solo gigs in 2020; he’s still slated to make stops in Columbus, Ohio and Lawrenceburg, Indiana in March, followed by two gigs in Durant, Oklahoma in April.

Being a kid who was forced to move around a lot, though I am seldom able to make friends because I never live anywhere long enough at the very least I'm able to get a few acquaintances I can occasionally drink or chat with. No such luck. Everyone here has their head stuck up there ass. 

In a bar you aren't allowed to have a friendly conversation with anyone even if it's just stupid smalltalk. The bartender will get on your ass about it. I actually almost got kicked out of a bar for politely asking how much a bag of chips cost once. Back in Florida no one gives a fuck if you ask questions like that.

Oddly enough, most of the bars are totally dead. Actually any place people would go to hang out here is fucking dead. The entire place is like a ghost town. Usually you only see 2-3 people in sight and usually they are old people, not anyone in our age range (we're in our 20s.)

At night when we go out for walks there's never anyone out walking around after 5pm. In fact you never see anyone during the day either for the most part. See what I mean? Ghost town. The one time we saw someone out we went out round 10 for a smoke and were followed for two blocks by some creepy drunk guy singing happy birthday to himself.

We had another creepy experience. That same night we had to leave cause my maintenance guy showed up late and he was gonna be there for a while. So we went out for a walk. I got thirsty so we stopped at the only place that was open - a bar called The New Chapter - and asked for a bottle of water. 

Back in Florida, also evidently Michigan you could just go into a bar during business hours, ask for a water and no one would give a fuck. The bartender (change of management. Old one used to be chill) got really snippy with us and was like, ""Well, you have to pay"". It's like she thought we were homeless even though I had my wallet right there in my hand and just seemed really fucking suspicious of us. Also, when I left for 5 minutes to use the bathroom she was really fucking rude to my girlfriend.

People just have a fucking stick up their collective asses in this town. I mean everyone. These are far from the only times we were just there doing normal things and people got really weird towards us. Like when I was at Walmart, asked to try on some pants from the boys section then got bitched at because the lady assumed I was a girl because I was short. Do that shit in Florida or Michigan and you might get a few funny looks but no one's gonna stop you or tell you you need to pay for the damages because some idiot ripped the tags off before you found them. 

We have had people try to run us over. On purpose. We had the right of way at the crosswalk and some guy went to a complete stop like he was going to let us go then once we were walking past suddenly stepped on the gas and tried to hit us. That same scenario has happened multiple times actually.

Anyway, I want to know if any other Fairborn residents have noticed how weird this town is? If they've noticed that people act all suspicious and hostile over stupid insignificant shit. If they've noticed that this place has a really weird vibe and seems like a ghost town (I came from a town not even half this size and there was more going on). If they've noticed how when you go outside, night or day, that no one is ever around? If they've noticed the weird sounds at night that sound like someone running their fingers along the rim of a crystal glass? And how no one seems to live here but angry old people. And how many of the drivers are outright psychopaths who will try to hit you on purpose (the drivers here are actually crazier than the ones in Florida. I didn't think that was possible). Any other Fairborn residents completely weirded out by this place or know why it's so weird in the first place?",Ohio,Anyone Else think Fairborn is Fucking Weird?

Yesterday I posted a version of this map that - oops - used old data for the legislative district boundaries.  Earlier today I found a government GIS that has the current legislative district boundary data for Ohio so I am reposting.

The date for the house shows district 97 with no color on the map thus indicating a vacant seat.  That is wrong and I have asked the server admin to update their data to show Adam Holmes (R) representing that district.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Below is a link to an interactive map I produced.  When the map opens the **Ohio state house districts** are displayed with semi-transparent coloring (red=R, blue=D).  The data for the map is hosted on a GIS server operated by the state.  I am \*assuming\* the data is current.

To change the map so it shows the **Ohio state senate districts**:

1. Click the basemap button (Next to the ""Menu"" button)

2. Look under the ""Overlay"" heading (mobile users scroll down)

3. Click the house layers to turn them off

4. Click the senate ""fill"" layer and then the senate ""boundary"" layer.

It may take a few seconds for the data to appear.  It depends on how busy the GIS server is and the speed of your internet connection.  

The map is displayed by GISsurfer which is a general purpose web map I developed as a public service and part of my way to ""pay it forward"".  There is a **""Map tips""** link in the upper left corner with some general ‘Help' information.

Open Ohio legislative district map:

I've almost been run over, even came so close to a car i had to grab it to keep from being run over, while riding my bicycle. Usually when this happens this is the situation: im crossing a street (going straight not turning) and a car thats coming from behind me speeds up to try and turn (left or right) on that street before i get across, I'm assuming because theyre impatient. Is this illegal? Do i really need to stop my bike and check behind me at every street (a.k.a every 1 minute?) Today i crossed a busier street, on the crosswalk. I waited for about 5 minutes (theres no signal) and no one was letting me go. The next car was going to turn, allowing me to go through. It was my only chance because after that car was yet another mile long group of cars. I had plenty of time, i started walking as soon as the car signaled their turn. The car behind them for some reason sped up and started honking their horn for me to go. The first car hadnt even turned yet and I only needed to take one more step and id be back on the sidewalk, but they hit the gas and i could feel their car going past, i could feel the wind on my back. Every day i cross this same street something happens. Sometimes I'll purposefully go out of my way to cross where theres stop signs, but even then I'll sit and wait for up to 10 minutes because no one will let me go. Am i doing something wrong here?

Senator Portman,

I am a constituent and am an independent voter. I am writing to express my dire concern that the Republican party is attempting to cover up actions by the Trump administration during the impeachment process. The fact that Majority leader McConnell has stated that he will not allow evidence or witnesses to be brought forth in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump is shameful. The administration blocked the release of materials and stopped multiple people who were subpoenaed from testifying in the House. Now, the Senate has the power to correct this shameful, blatant abuse of power. Senator Portman, as your constituent, I ask that you demand a fair trial with evidence and witnesses and I demand that you fulfill your oath of office and sit as an impartial juror during this impeachment trial. 
If you continue to blindly support this President then I will have no choice but to work to unseat you from your position as Senator.

I am glad that you have stated you intended to listen to the evidence presented at the impeachment trial and make your judgment based on the facts. 

However, I was shocked to read in the Dispatch that you said “I don’t think everything was appropriate, particularly asking for a foreign government to look into a political opponent, but I don’t believe it rises to the level of saying, ‘We’re going to reverse the results of an election,’ which is what impeachment is.”

Let me remind you of the constitutional grounds for impeachment: ""The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" The constitution does not define bribery, but English law from which the constitution is ""descended"" defines bribery as abusing the power of a public office to obtain a private benefit.

You accept that the president has abused his power in this way, and it is not your place to overturn the constitution's examples of impeachable conduct. The founding fathers gave only two specific examples of impeachable conduct, and the President's alleged behavior undoubtedly matches one of those examples.

Your job is not to decide whether or not bribery is an offense worthy of removal from office. The founding fathers have already done so. Your job is merely to determine whether or not the accusations against the President are true. And you have already indicated you believe they are. I expect you to uphold your oath of office and abide by the constitution by voting based on the truth, and not based on your party.

Thank you,
Your constituent

It can be in around Columbus, Akron or anywhere in between.

My mom lives in the sticks in Stark county, where your mailbox has to be mounted on the road. I have had to replace her mailbox/post almost every year because it gets hit by someone. I have even tried using a metal post sunk deep into concrete, and all that did was royally mess up someone's car when it was hit. The mailbox/post was still demolished. 

She is currently mailboxless due to a recent run in with a plow and I am making a trip out this week to do something about it. I'm trying to make it last this time. Unfortunately, all the sites that I can find that sell these swing posts have like a 2 week delivery window. So I am hoping one of you know somewhere that would carry something like this. I have looked at Lowes, Ace, and Home Depot without any luck.

Hi there!

[This is Ohio 2020](https://thisisohio2020.com) is a documentary film + podcast project in which I criss-cross the Buckeye State in the year leading up to the 2020 general election, meeting and interviewing my fellow Buckeye voters, learning about their lives, and what they’re thinking about and what worries them as another Presidential election cycle looms.

We are particularly interested in talking with undecided Ohio voters...but it's not necessary to be on the show.

The show is nonpartisan and aims to create a portrait of the Buckeye state electorate at this moment in time. You can check it out at [ThisIsOhio2020.com](https://ThisIsOhio2020.com)

If selected for the show, we will do a sit-down interview where I learn your past history, your stories, the how-you-came-to-be the person who you are. Then we talk about how that influences how you are thinking politically as another Presidential election cycle looms. If selected, our crew will come to you for your interview. Expect to spend about 1.5 hours with us.

Founded in the 1820's by Lorenzo Solon Bull, Jason Robbins and their families along with other pioneers of the Western Reserve, Solon has grown into a bustling town of 24,000 and counting today. The residents are a mix of longtime locals and new immigrants from far and wide, all mixing together to create a diverse and proud Solon community.

However, we have an issue with our local government. For the past 20 years or so, they've been proving their incompetence time and time again. Aside from the rumors of corruption and under the table deals which I have no proof of, the city has made countless bad decisions in terms of spending tax money and developing properties, often to the chagrin of residents. These decades of wasted tax dollars have resulted in countless historical properties being torn down and lost forever, most of which were replaced with drive thru fast food places, tacky shopping centers, or even just vacant lots. Talk about leading us into the future...

In comes the Lynch House, named after its most recent owner. Built in 1905 right on Solon's public square, this house has served as a historic relic that defines Solon's downtown. The house was home to many important early Solonites, and served as a place of wholesome memories that the people of Solon hope to preserve for the future. The house was purchased by the city in 2005 for virtually nothing, and was used to house the fire department while their new building was under construction. After 15 years of neglect by the city, the house has some extensive damage that needs to be repaired. Luckily, the Solon Historical Society has more than 3X the amount needed to cover repairs in the bank, so money is not an issue here. The issue comes with the city government, who for some reason wants to see this historic house torn down. They have rejected offers to sell the house to someone else, proving that their interest is solely with the piece of property itself. Despite years of protest from the public, the city council voted to move into an emergency vote regarding the house last week, and **to the sudden surprise of Solon residents they voted short 3-2 to save the house, leaving out 2 council members who were prevented from voting due to their affiliation with the historical society** (complete bs)**, and because they couldn't get the mandatory 4 votes to save the house, it is now slated for demolition.**

**The 2 councilmen who voted against saving the house should not be the ones to call shots on this matter**. There's an entire community of people who have expressed for years that they are willing to put the time and money into fixing this house. The historical society's plans are to turn this house into a second museum, being right next to the historical society museum housed in the old town church. Every year, the 3rd graders from the Solon elementary schools are taken on field trips to the historical society where they learn about the local history and get a hands on experience that they otherwise would possibly never receive. It's a shame that this is what was voted against by our incompetent government.

This Monday, 2/3, there will be a council meeting where local Solonites plan on protesting and expressing their concerns to the city. A petition has been created, and is currently at about 1000 signatures. However, we need more and are desperate as time is running out. Please show your support by signing the petition, thus helping to save one of the last pieces of our town's history still standing! Thanks so much!

**Why I’m Voting to Acquit President Trump**

Impeachment will end in the Senate. It’s time to take up consensus issues.

By Rob Portman
Mr. Portman is a Republican senator from Ohio.
Feb. 5, 2020, 5:00 a.m. ET

On Wednesday I will join a majority of my Senate colleagues in opposing the impeachment of President Trump brought by the House of Representatives.

For four months, since the release of the memorandum of the call between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, I have consistently said that Mr. Trump’s request for an investigation of Joe Biden and any effort to tie the release of military aid to investigations were improper and shouldn’t have happened. However, I do not believe these actions rise to the level where it would be necessary to remove a president from office.

The founders intended for impeachment to be extremely rare, and they required those seeking to remove the president to meet the burden of proving “high crimes and misdemeanors,” like treason or bribery. In this case, unlike in other impeachments, no crime was alleged. Although there may be circumstances where a crime isn’t necessary for a president to be impeached, to be impeached under such a circumstance would require meeting an even higher bar, and it wasn’t met here.

In addition, the House engaged in a rushed process that lacked fundamental fairness. The constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley calls it “the shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president.” It was also the only purely partisan impeachment in history.


Rushing an impeachment case through the House without due process and giving the Senate a half-baked case to finish set a dangerous precedent. If the Senate were to convict, it would risk making this kind of quick, partisan impeachment in the House a regular occurrence. That would serve only to further deepen the divides that seem to permeate every part of our society today.

People certainly see this divide in Congress. Many believe their elected representatives on both sides of the aisle have lost sight of what’s important and are focusing on politics and partisanship rather than results for the American people.

While the Senate is where this impeachment process will end, it is also the Senate that is best suited to help turn the page and begin a new chapter. We can do that by demonstrating that we can work together and address the issues our constituents care most about. I believe it is possible for both parties to come together for consensus solutions on these three issues:

Lowering Prescription Drug Costs. Researchers are producing life-changing medicines, but all that progress does us no good if they’re unaffordable. It’s gotten so bad that some Americans have to choose between paying their mortgage or rent and being able to afford expensive prescription drugs. In the Senate, three committees have approved legislation intended to help lower out-of-pocket costs for senior citizens, crack down on the high prices set by drug manufacturers and end surprise billing practices that have devastated families with shocking medical bills. The House has its own plan. The president wants to get this done and there is no reason we should not be able to find common ground here.

Improving Skills Training. Everywhere I go in Ohio, employers tell me they need workers who have the skills to fill available jobs — well-paying work as welders, coders and health care technicians, all of which require skills training. I’m working with Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, to pass legislation called the JOBS Act to ensure that Pell grants can be used to cover short-term training programs for these careers. That would help fill well-paid, in-demand jobs and get more people off the sidelines and into our economy. This legislation is bipartisan, and ready to go.


Combating the Addiction Crisis. One area where Congress has worked well together is in combating the opioid epidemic. Significant new federal investment since 2016 is making a difference. Overdose deaths fell nationwide last year, the first time that’s happened in nearly three decades. Despite this progress, synthetic opioids like fentanyl remain a huge problem, and we’ve seen a resurgence of psychostimulants like crystal meth and cocaine. We’re working on bipartisan legislation to address these deadly threats.

And there’s more we can do, from infrastructure to retirement security to protecting our national parks. If Congress acts we can begin to re-instill faith in our institutions and bridge the growing partisan divide. In these highly partisan times, it’s easy for both sides of the aisle to retreat even further into their ideological camps. But for the sake of the country, let’s look for what unites us instead.",Ohio,Portman’s Puff Op-Ed in the NYT

What I see is a world of social media and disconnect. 

I'm a U.S. citizen. I served in the military. Never in my wildest dreams did I think, I would find myself a middle aged man living in this reality.

Why is it so hard for the whole of humanity to realize we are on the brink of destruction. Not from war, but from stupidity.

I live in one of the wealthiest, influential and dumbest countries in the world. I have more in common with poor white, black, brown and whatever racist color you can think of. For some reason, us poor, and middle class Americans believe these wealthy spoon fed politicians have our best interests on thier minds.

460,460,1488top,1581113843,f0hyd0,Nan,"First off Please Understand, Im not Trying to use this post as a advertisement in any way! 

Quick introduction so we are all on same page here.
Im a jack of all trades. Im also the type of person that cant deal with doing the same thing day after day. I blame/thank my ADHD for that. But at first I didnt understand, or even know that about me so I  became a certified electrician. From working at a company in Hudson, that had a 4 year apprenticeship program. But after 4 years of learning/working (for very little money part of the deal with the program since they payed for the apprenticeship) The owner and myself have a falling out so I quit. But instead of making $20+ a hour, by working for any other company in the same field. I decided I'm sick of doing that, and start Tending for a Mennonite masonry company out of Hartville. It was family owened, and they taught me a lot, but after two years. Of learning every thing they had to teach me. I figured I should make more money then what they were offering me. So we split ways.  Then I deside to take a class on Framing and Cabinet Making, during this time I get talked into going full time in college. I added Mobile App Development &amp; Computer Science. To make ends meet I start a Handyman Company. I mainly got my work from craigslest gigs, or facebook, also a website called next door. 

Now here is my question! Is there any other buy and sell sites that have a classifies. That people post what kind of jobs they need done other then ang.list,facebook,cragislist.&amp; next door? Cause during the summer.  I'm swamped, but every winter I'm living job to job if not worse. I always do a good job and treat every job. As if its my own house Im working on so please dont think its me, that is causing my work to slow!

So any help or ideas on where to look or ways to get more work will be greatly appreciated 
Thanks

Something like this had happened to me in TX  where I completed  a defensive driving course on May 27, 2017 and got it  off my record.

Now after thinking  about it for a whole day, I want to do whatever possible to get it off  my record. So how can I achieve this goal especially because I  already paid for the ticket? Is  defensive driving still an option? And how do I  get the permission from the court to take it?

549,549,Pixelcitizen98,1581475135,f2k0bh,Nan,"	Today, I received the card reminding us Ohioans of the March 17th primary in the mail. Being one who has been looking forward to the primary for a while, I thought this is a rather appropriate thing to post:

	Everyone who is either 18 already or is just about to, try and register as soon as possible! The 18th of this month is right around the corner, and unless you plan on *not* voting (which I personally discourage), it’s better to start now than later. You can register online or at your local library.  

	If you have registered, as soon as possible, start studying the politicians and laws before going to the polls! I cannot stress how important research is in regards to who and what’s on the ballots! The state of Ohio [has a wonderful webpage dedicated to links to each county and cities’ sample ballots!]( https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/voters/toolkit/sample-ballot/#linkList) You can also look around and find anyone who may not be on the ballot, but is still available for national voting (such as Andrew Yang). I myself am creating a whole MS Word doc listing almost everyone on the ballots, alongside their stances and overall political history. That way, I could look over and narrow my own choices based around my personal views and stances. I highly encourage this for research regarding laws and additional politicians who are on the ballots. Of course, you do you in terms of researching this stuff. 

	And while I highly discourage this (unless it happens to be an emergency or you’re entirely unable to vote, no matter what), if you don’t vote, do everyone a favor: Don’t sit on your ass and throw a tantrum on social media because you didn’t like the results we got… I mean, don’t do it either way, but I especially get annoyed when, every damn election or primary, someone bitches and moans on Reddit because their dream choices weren’t chosen like they wished. Then, you find that the same exact big baby on the keyboard didn’t even bother to vote and instead spent the whole day sitting on their ass at home watching the live results with a dirty look on their face. Plus, at the end of the day, it’s better to fire up our right to vote as American citizens rather than ignore it and take it for granted. There’s many countries in the world that don’t even have a voting system and, instead, are heavily lead by the next lunatic that happened to come from the same old bloodline (*ahem* North Korea *ahem*). The fact that a good portion of abled individuals don’t even bother to use this God-given right is pretty sad. 

	Finally: Please don’t be a shitbrain if you find that your friend, family member, co-worker, favorite celebrity, etc,. happens to choose someone or something you’re not voting for. Talk it out like grown ass adults and learn why other people would believe in the ways they do. Hiding in your little shell of ideological yes men is unhealthy not just for you, but for our Democracy itself, as well.

History is split between two periods, the dark ages leading up to her discovery and the enlightenment when man first settled upon her fertile soil and declared her to be the mighty Ohio, 17th state of the American Union.

Ohio cannot be partitioned under the pedantic labeling of American regions, as Ohio lives in each and every one of her chosen sons and daughters across the globe. Just as a son of Cleveland carries her heart with him wherever he may choose to settle within this union of states, abroad in the ancient lands of the rising sun the people celebrate her majesty when the radiant light of dawn first peaks over the horizon, uttering the hollowed word ""Ohayo"" to celebrate the coming of a new day through the benevolent grace of the great and beautiful Ohio.",Ohio,"Got carried away answering a question about Ohio, as I ended up writing a short essay on what Ohio is..."

I'm researching the area right now but would love any recommendations on stuff to do, the best places to stay, etc from people who are familiar with the area or have vacationed there in the past. 

My parents are in their late 60s, definitely wouldn't be interested in Cedar Pointe and don't want to go during any big festival weeks or anything. They like going to breweries, hiking, bike riding, exploring towns, and relaxing near the lake and reading. I'm thinking it makes the most sense to stay on the mainland, maybe catawba or lakeside marblehead, but to be honest I really know nothing about these areas.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!",Ohio,Lake Erie Islands - vacation ideas?

This is the (inadequate) response I got. I will point out that each of his reasons for voting against impeachment are easily discounted and debated. The president did commit criminal actions, that was determined by the GOA. The House process was not flawed nor was it rushed. The House did everything short of holding violators of subpoenas in contempt of congress and arresting them which surely would have been weaponized against them if they did that. Multiple constitutional scholars explained that Trump did commit high crimes and misdemeanors. Also, the senate obviously has no desire to pass any legislation seeing as there are hundreds of House bills sitting in the graveyard of Majority leader McConnell. 

I'm not buying your bullshit, Rob. 



Dear John,
Thank you for writing in to express your views regarding the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump. It is good to hear from you.
On February 5, I voted against both articles of impeachment brought before the Senate by the House of Representatives. In doing so, I joined a majority of my Senate colleagues in opposing removal of President Trump from office and taking him off the ballot this year.
The founders intended for impeachment to be extremely rare, and they required those seeking to remove the president to meet the burden of proving “high crimes and misdemeanors,” such as treason or bribery. In this case, unlike in other impeachments, no crime was alleged. Although there may be circumstances where a crime is not necessary for a president to be impeached, to be impeached under such a circumstance would require meeting an even higher bar, and I believe it was not met in this case.
In addition, the House engaged in a rushed process that lacked fundamental fairness. Instead of using the tools available to compel the administration to produce documents and witnesses, the House followed a self-imposed and entirely political deadline for voting on the articles of impeachment before Christmas. Rushing an impeachment case through the House without due process and giving the Senate an incomplete case to finish set a dangerous precedent. If the Senate had voted in favor of the articles, it would have risked making this kind of flawed, partisan impeachment in the House a regular occurrence, which would serve only to further deepen the divides that seem to permeate every part of our society today.
It is time to turn the page and begin a new chapter. We can do that by demonstrating that we can work together and address the issues our constituents care most about.
My focus will remain on working with my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and with the Trump Administration, to lower prescription drug costs, improve skills training for the jobs available today, expand retirement security, tackle the addiction crisis, and the many other priorities for Ohio families. I truly believe we can do more together as a united Senate, Congress, and country.
Thank you again for taking the time to contact my office. It is an honor to represent you and your family in the United States Senate. For more information you can visit my website at www.portman.senate.gov. Please keep in touch.
 
Sincerely,
Rob Portman

 Ohio State University Buckeyes basketball fans could see a raise in ticket prices for the Big Ten competition, premier games, and season tickets in 2021 at St. John Arena.

According to the OSU student newspaper, [***The Lantern***](https://www.thelantern.com/2020/02/ohio-state-mens-basketball-ticket-prices-for-public-faculty-to-take-slight-increase-next-season/), The Board of Trustees Audit, Compliance and Finance Committee met this Thursday to discuss a proposal which won’t change student ticket prices, but could raise prices for the public and Ohio State faculty. Under the recommended plan, premier tickets will increase by $2 while conference game tickets will increase by $1 per game for Zone 1-6 tickets. Student prices, however, will remain $9 per game. Premier public season tickets in Zone 1 will increase from $659 to $670 and faculty will raise from $599 to $612.

While fans will see slight increases, full season ticket package discounts will stay[(read more....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/02/ohio-state-to-raise-basketball-season-ticket-prices/)",Ohio,Ohio State To Raise Basketball Season Ticket Prices

He has worked, started a business, and contributed more to this nation's economy, and more in taxes, than most citizens will in their lifetimes. He has been married to a citizen for 20 years, and has been registered with ICE since they were founded.

A few days ago, two ICE agents came to his business in an unmarked black van, entered with their guns drawn and told him and his American employees to get on the ground, shackled him, and took him to a detention center. As his kids are not biologically his, ICE will not allow them to see him. His wife is allowed time to see him subject to the whims of the CO on staff.

He had been applying for a voluntary deportation, so he would only need to wait 1 year in his birth country before returning here to apply for citizenship. Instead, an immigration judge took his case and ~200 others, and decided to put them into an expedited decision. In the next few weeks, we will know if he only needs to wait 1 year before coming home, or if he will be barred from this country for 10 years. 

Their youngest is adopted. She's only known him as her father, and he's provided for her when her biological parents wouldn't. This 6 year old girl may grow up unable to see her father because of this. Her mom has told her that ""daddy had to go on vacation"" because she doesn't know how to tell her that the country he's loved and lived in for the majority of his life is now throwing him out.

This girls life is worse off because of ICE. My hometown is worse because of ICE.

Guys I don't want to fear monger, but seriously the Corona Virus is a lot worse than they are letting on.

Look at Italy right now. The entire country is shut down, and Lombardy is so overwhelmed with this virus, certain hospitals there (BIG HOSPITALS) are turning away people who are in critical conditions that are 60 or over. 60 IS NOT THAT OLD. Regardless of if this virus is a big deal, it does cause pneumonia and MANY people need respirators and cannot get them.

The U.S will be much worse if we don't take drastic action. We only have less than 3 beds per 1000 people. 

Since the CDC will wait until it's too late. We have to start putting pressure on our politicians to shut down certain events, schools, and businesses should be encouraged to close. 

ONLY TEMPORARILY. just for like 2 weeks. 

would it be the end of the world if everyone just stayed home and ate rice and beans for 2 weeks to help save lives, and help our hospitals from completely imploding on themselves? 

I know no one gives a crap about these stupid petitions, but there is important info in here, and if we try getting the attention of at least Mike DeWine, real changes can happen for Ohio, and hopefully, the rest of the country can follow suit.

Please consider all the information in this post and petition as it could save a loved ones life.

Thank you SOO much for your time.

1059,1059,BimblesMcPippens,1583807580,fg6sek,Nan,"I moved to NE Ohio just shy of 2 years ago to assist a good friend of mine through the death of several of his family members. I was unemployed and had recently lost my vehicle and was in desperate need of both a car and job - so moving here worked out well at the time, as my buddy had a car for me and a job. Now, the car has since died, my friend committed suicide 2 weeks ago, and the job I have been working at has become an utter shit-show and that's putting it lightly. :( 

Today I found out that In July I will be right back where I was before moving out here. I have literally been collecting change off the ground, today I found a whole quarter! lmfao! Every spare dollar I make and living on what little food I can (I've lost 40lbs in the last 6mo.) as well as foregoing necessary medical (heart and lung condition in combo with spinal cord issues) and dental attention so I can attempt to save what little I do make to buy a car. I am not, have never been and will never be an opioid addict and refuse to take opioids or pot based meds just so I wont be labeled an addict or drug abuser.

Thank God, one of my roommates has been kind enough to let me use his car to get to and from work, which is an hour north of where I currently live, but that will end at the end of June. For a little extra icing on my cake, I am also, and have been a victim of identity theft, (apparently my SSN has been in use prior to my birth - which the Social Security Admin claims is impossible), not the kind problem you can simply resolve by submitting a copy of a credit report with the individuals name on it to the proper authorities though. I've spent years attempting to resolve this issue and have had people at the DC branch of the SS Admin Office essentially tell me I'm pretty much screwed. Suffice to say the last 3 years of my life have been an UTTER NIGHTMARE! I have sold literally everything I own, I sleep on an air mattress, my computer died about a year ago so I have been borrowing one to get me by in the meanwhile and literally live out of a duffel bag. Due to limited funds I have also had to let my portfolio/website go as I can no longer afford to pay for the domain and hosting. I have tried all free hosting and domain registrars - unfortunately they don't offer the bandwidth or server power required to run a graphic oriented website without exceeding their service caps and being suspended or shut down.  
I have done extensive research on the few design firms in the area and a few outside Ohio and over the river in WV. Every single one of them have absolutely horrid working environments and are micro managed out the wazoo! Former employee reviews mark these firms as stress factories in which they are verbally abused and treated like utter garbage, hours are cut and salaried employees are expected to work well into the night to meet unrealistic deadlines.

I have been in the design industry for over 25 years and have been fortunate to work with some very big and very reputable companies in both design and management positions - only to be laid-off with my entire department so they can meet diversity mandates or the company simply decided to relocate their design staff to over-seas firms to cut costs. Others I left due to hostile work environments, verbal abuse, unethical business practices that bordered on illegal activities involving client credit card info and HIPPA information theft or violations.

I absolutely love doing design work but finding a firm, studio, mom-and-pop shop that doesn't make you want to slit your own wrists has been far and few between these days. I have attempted to venture out on my own on more than one occasion but with the numerous free platforms available these days - people have been reluctant to pay for a custom project. Prior to all of this mess, over the course of a few years, I had 20 long-time clients, all eventually leave to do they're own thing on Square-Space or Wix, despite letting them know about the obvious drawbacks that those types of services offer.

I am truly at my wits end and am reaching out to you guys to see what or if anyone else has had similar experiences and what if anything you did to get yourself out of that mess. I don't have any relatives or friends to lean on, my roommates are going their own separate ways and with exception to one sibling who is in a similar situation in another state, I'm really just at a loss and don't know what else I can try to better my situation. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.

I apologize if this comes across as a rant or negative, it truly isn't meant to be either, I am just trying to reach out for some advice or help.

1127,1127,UnicornHostels,1584015285,fhfe4x,Nan,"What follows is my story.   I am coming out to let others know what happens here in Ohio when you have Covid symptoms.  I also want to say I have been self isolating since this started, not because I was told to, but because I want to be safe.  The only place I have gone is medical facilities to try and get help.

In January, my husband traveled to California from Columbus to Los Angeles to visit his family for a week.  He returned home and went back to work.  He works for a multinational company with a factory in Wuhan, amongst many other places in the world.  Co-workers are sent to and from China from Columbus airport.  In fact, last week the CDC called one co-worker through contact tracing with a confirmed case and told the co-worker to self isolate for 14 days, yet they called him on the 12th day, so he had been in the office for 2 weeks. 

Shortly after my husband came back from LAX, his eyes started to burn and he has a cough.   He felt as though he also had heart burn, constantly clearing his throat and couldn’t sleep.  He was sent to Michigan on a work trip shortly after coming back from California.  At that time, no one was thinking of covid, he felt a little off but went on the trip.  

In February, his co-workers continued to travel to Japan, Italy, Hong Kong, Michigan, Indiana and California.  Around the beginning of February I became weak, had burning in my eyes that was so strong, I couldn’t open my eyes without searing pain and had to get into a shower to rinse my eyes.  I had muscle aches, a headache that lasted for 4 days and was very tired.  I have gotten mono and sometimes have low iron, so I thought it was just this.  

A little before valentines Day, I woke up with pain in my chest, shortness of breath and a fever, which was 101.4.  I went to the urgent care after three days of this because those around me that care for me insisted I go.   When I got to urgent care, I had a chest X-ray and was checked out by a PA.  He said the doctor looked at my X-ray and it showed no pneumonia, but an infection in my lungs.  The urgent care gave me a steroid inhaler, albuterol, an antibiotic and told me to take mucinex. 

I went home and started my regimine.  Eleven days later I still didn’t feel well and I started a horrible cough, but my shortness of breath was better.  I had finished my antibiotic, so I thought I may need another antibiotic.  I made an appointment with my gp. When I got there they put a mask on me because I had a horrible dry unproductive cough.  My gp said I most likely had viral bronchitis and sent me home without medication and told me to rest for another 2 weeks.  

About a week after this, my eyes started watering, my eyes have never watered, it was like goo was coming from my eyes and I had to use a tissue to wipe up the liquid coming from my eyes.  My fever was still there but low.  My cough was so bad I couldn’t sleep.  It was difficult to lie down without starting a coughing fit.  

At this point, I started to become concerned that I had Covid19 and not just bronchitis or a lung infection.  I called a few hospitals in my area and asked if they would test for Coronavirus.  They said no they do not, but I should come in if I was having a hard time breathing.  

Once at the ER, I asked for a CT scan and flu test and was denied for both.  I was given another chest X-ray instead.  I was told I did not have pneumonia but reactive airway disease most likely from inhaling something into my lungs(what?).  They gave me a cough syrup with codeine which helped a great deal with the cough and I was able to sleep.   I felt so much better after being able to sleep.  In fact, I thought I was healed I felt so much better.  

That was a week ago, a few days ago, my shortness of breath came back.  I cannot walk from one part of the house to the next and talk at the same time.  When I exhale, I smell blood coming from my bronchial lining or throat, it’s upsetting.  What is worse is that no one can help me and I don’t know what to do.  

I am athletic, 40 years old, non-smoker, not a drug user, social drinker only, had the flu shot this season and have never had allergies or asthma.  I have had walking pneumonia when in college when I was worn down from finals while having a bad cold or flu.  That was nothing like this, for example I never had a cold or flu first.  I never had nasal drainage or a stuffy nose.  This went right to my lungs, not affecting any other part of my body.  

I’m not saying I have Covid19, I suspect I will never know, what I am trying to put out there, is that even presenting with these symptoms will not get you tested.  This is something that needs to be said.  It is not something that should be kept a secret.  They should not say anyone can get tested.  If you don’t believe me, call your local hospital and ask if they will test you for Covid19.",Ohio,My journey in Ohio while sick and trying to get tested for Covid19

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, Australia, Canada, and the LA area. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted in China through [Herculean efforts](https://twitter.com/NAChristakis/status/1237020518781460480).

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently over [135,000](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO recently [classified it](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1237777021742338049) as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&amp;feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic.** Read a little more on the subject [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT IS GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing as well. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: ""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now."" [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer. Also please note that this study has not been peer-reviewed, but due to the implications is included here out of an abundance of caution.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/fgj062/joe_rogan_experience_1439_michael_osterholm/fk4t45b/) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air up to 3 hours, and on surfaces up to several days. This has been noted here out of an abundance of caution. ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf))

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/).

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)--especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

* This is a ""novel"" virus, which means the immune system has never been exposed to it and therefore everyone is susceptible. There is no vaccine, nor do authorities expect one for some time.

* People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest). (Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html))

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an ""adjustment reaction."" [Here is a very short guide](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm) on how to cope.

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum. **Update:** [A warning for leadership](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca).

* If you're experiencing distress regarding this epidemic, please consider visiting COVID-19 [mental health support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/).

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* Practice [social distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/).

* Do not touch your face (practice this one at home, as [it's harder than you think](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/08/coronavirus-prevention-how-stop-touching-your-face/4965517002/)).

* After *every* outing, wash your hands and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO.

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is at least 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. 

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing social distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

* Be proactive. How can *you* help?

#**INCUBATION PERIOD:**

* People generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5.1 days after intial infection.

* 97.5% develop symptoms within 11.5 days. 

* ""Current 14 day quarantine recommendation is 'reasonable' as only 1% will develop symptoms after release from 14 day quarantine.""

* [Source](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) / [Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fg4a74/covid19_median_incubation_period_is_51_days/) with regards to this section.

#**TYPICAL SYMPTOMS:**

(All direct from [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China.)

#**COMORBIDITIES:**

Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include those who meet *any* of the following conditions:

* People 60 years of age and older

* Diabetes

* Hypertension

* Cardiovascular disease

* Chronic respiratory disease

* Heart, lung or kidney disease 

* Cancer

* Those with weakened immune systems

* Obesity ([source](https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw?t=283) / [credentials](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/fgj062/joe_rogan_experience_1439_michael_osterholm/fk4t45b/) of source)

* People with weakened respiratory system due to smoking/vaping ([source 1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-vaping/smoking-or-vaping-increases-vulnerability-to-coronavirus-says-nyc-mayor-idUSKBN20V0Z0)), ([source 2](https://journals.lww.com/cmj/Abstract/publishahead/Analysis_of_factors_associated_with_disease.99363.aspx))

**If you fall into any of the above categories, the CDC says ""it is especially important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of exposure.""** Additional: ""CDC: Americans over 60 should 'stock up' on supplies, avoid crowds"" ([source.](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486645-cdc-americans-over-60-should-stock-up-on-supplies-avoid-crowds))

Sources for comorbidities: [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) / [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html). A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response time, etc.)

Age | [% of population](https://www.populationpyramid.net/china/2019/) | [% of infected](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) | [Fatality](http://rs.yiigle.com/yufabiao/1181998.htm) 
:- | - | - | -:
0-9 | 12.0% | 0.9% | 0
10-19| 11.6% | 1.2% | 0.1%
20-29 | 13.5% | 8.1% | 0.2%
30-39 | 15.6% | 17.0% |  0.2%
40-49 | 15.6% | 19.2% | 0.4%
50-59 | 15.0% | 22.4% | 1.3%
60-69 | 10.4% | 19.2% | **3.6%**
70-79 | 4.7% | 8.8% | **8.0%**
80+ | 1.8% | 3.2% | **14.8%**

**UPDATE:** Mortality numbers are starting to come in from Italy. [Here's a data set of 11,538 cases.](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/covid-19-infografica_eng.pdf)

Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years. A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%), via [WHO report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* **Due to the high mortality rate for people over 60, the authorities in Seattle are encouraging anyone in that demographic to stay home as much as possible. ([Source](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/486020-seattle-urges-people-over-60-to-stay-home-as-much-as-possible-due-to)).**

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to others with comorbidities, but because experts do not know what the longterm side effects of a novel coronavirus can be.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. I don't have an agenda or anything of that sort, and to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a very particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal--that and I've been following Covid-19 closely since mid-January. I hummed and hawed whether to even to start this document, yet after seeing how much it benefited people even in its crude early form, I decided to give it all of my focus.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform, without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety, and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in [Sydney](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), Australia, or the one over in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), both of which will be kept up to date (as will any of my PSA's that I posted myself, as long as they're still on the main page of that sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Amid the increasing fear and confusion of the coronavirus pandemic, a voice of knowledge reassures Ohioans every day.

Speaking candidly but calmly, the director of the Ohio Department of Health translates complex medical theory to plain English, then immediately lets her humanity shine through.


In a crisis, Acton, 54, is serving as equal parts scientist and psychiatrist, pulling off the ability to be both wonky and relatable. And people are taking notice, calling Acton a “public health rock star” and more.

I found this odd because social distancing and good hygiene habits are exactly the opposite of what you see in a room of 12-20 children aged zero to 5ish. As a policy wonky person, I wonder if there are legal or regulatory constraints that us layfolk may be unaware of that is compelling his decision to NOT close daycares and preschools? 

For example, I know there are layers and layers weird rules around waivers and different subsidies that the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services and the Ohio Department of Medicaid and other agencies must go through to spend, hold (and even return unspent) money they get from the federal government. Is it something along these lines? 

If not, maybe is it just worry or concern about affecting even more of the population of working parents having to find alternative care? Or maybe it’s the science behind very young kids not really being a high risk population (but of course can carry the coronavirus).

Two general models of dealing with COVID-19n have emerged. South Korea responded by testing everyone, tens of thousands of tests a day, and quarantining everyone who tested positive, but not shutting down the country - schools, restaurants, etc are all still open. Italy responded by quarantining the entire country, closing business, outlawing public gatherings, and testing a few people.

[The difference becomes stark over time.](https://i.imgur.com/WRahZYt.png) Italy's infection rate is trending up; South Korea's is trending down. South Korea has many more tests than Italy; Italy has many more deaths.

[The United States has been following Italy.](https://i.imgur.com/2Ull73X.jpg)

As soon as the CDC declared a public health emergency, FDA rules which prohibit foreign medical supplies kicked in. This made it practically illegal to test anyone, because the CDC had very few on hand - and their first batch were flawed. Because of this, CDC guidelines don't allow for testing of people who aren't showing symptoms - and by then, they've been communicating the disease for weeks.

The President's administration will not lift these restrictions. Instead, there are people in the White House pushing for *more* restrictions - to require that all medical equipment be made in the US.

Congress is too busy passing laws that make spying on citizens legal and encryption illegal to do anything.

The courts are slow, and will defer to the Administration under Chevron anyway.

And Governor DeWine's response is to prohibit gatherings and close restaurants, because that's working *so well* in Italy.

When the federal government passes bad laws which threaten the safety and, literally, the lives of the citizens, the states are the only protection. [Augustine](https://i.imgur.com/ArfYp3X.jpg), [Jefferson](https://i.imgur.com/M4RsRzU.png), [Ghandi](https://i.imgur.com/pveffDh.jpg), [King](https://i.imgur.com/V2wi2zf.png) - they all tell us to ignore unjust laws.

Governor DeWine's actions are going to hurt our economy, and they will not benefit public health. Many of the restaurants which are closing will not reopen, especially the ones that aren't chains or franchises.

What he should do is to go directly to overseas providers of COVID-19 tests, and get as many as he can get, in direct contravention of Federal law, to test Ohioans and quarantine those who test positive - like South Korea is doing.

Nullify this bad law, the same way we nullified the Fugitive Slave Act a hundred and fifty years ago.",Ohio,"Ohio's COVID-19 response should be following South Korea's model, not Italy's."

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to the following shows will be getting a refund. 

CT - Manchester

MA - Boston

MI - Westland

NH - Manchester

NJ - Atlantic City, Point Pleasant

NY - Albany, NYC, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Syracuse, White Plains

OH - Cleveland, Perrysburg

ON - Kingston, London

PA - Philly

QC - Montreal

RI - East Greenwich

VT - Burlington

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Poughkeepsie, Manchester NH, and Cleveland have already been rescheduled for October). Meanwhile, I will be hosting free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.). Some are Q&amp;As with famous people, others are stand-up shows with my comedy buddies from our houses. If you wanna watch, they're free at [YouTube.com/thehofstetter](https://YouTube.com/thehofstetter) every day at 2PM and 8PM ET. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see. 

I'm not sure what to do with all this time at home. Maybe I'll go on a vacation. I hear Italy is nice this time of year.

My kids are bored and driving me crazy. Assuming I'm not alone in this, I thought it would be a good idea to make a list of some outdoor places we can explore. Something to get us outside and away from video games and dire news stories. So what are some of your lesser known hiking spots, outdoor places, hidden gems that would be great to explore while maintaining social distancing? 

One of my favorites is the Moonville Tunnel in Vinton County. There was a great graveyard here, too, but unfortunately it suffered some recent vandalism.

Rule 2.Be patient. People are people. They are still going to do things they annoy and confound you. Kids at home being imperfect, co-workers doing things you don't like ,this is all part of life 

Rule 3.Be kind. People will have fears for themselves and their families.

Rule 4.Be positive. We have overcome much worse problems before.Use positive words and actions. Imagine that people are looking to you for guidance.

Rule 5.Get a goal. Try learning to bake, rewatch all 9 seasons of the Office, exercise, learn magic, learn to bartend. Something besides worrying and watching the news. The goal will help you from going stir crazy.

Rule 6.Always remember that this sucks for everybody. We are the adults here. If you only think about how it's affected you then that's not helpful.

Rule 7.Listen what's asked to be done and do it. The government is trying their best to figure things out. We have a partisanship problem propped up by social media in this country and its self defeating to try to paint either side as the enemy of this issue. Don't spew hate online about a political affiliations, those comments aren't changing anyone's opinion on the matter or helping right now. 

Rule 8.Don't spread misinformation. Vet your sources. Your Facebook friend probably doesn't have a trusted nurse who shared a letter with her about how hot liquids stop viruses.

Rule 9.Help out. If you can afford it then donate to a food bank, play the piano and send the video to your friends, call someone you haven't seen for a while, make sure your neighbors are ok, start an online Scrabble tournament.

Rule10.Support a business if you can. Order a milkshake and have it delivered, buy something online if you need it from a box store. Every little bit helps.

How do you kick a stalled/stopped economy back into gear once people are no longer at extreme risk?   At some point we will have to go back to work, even though the virus will still be active on some level and it becomes a risk vs. reward thing.

I imagine that the restaurant/service sector will be slow to get back into gear due to lingering fears about the virus on some level.  Manufacturing, if they have raw materials, should be able to get their production lines going again but will they have anyone to sell to?

The plans being discussed (so far as I know) are quick access to unemployment and possibly some cash (last figure I heard was $1000).  The last time I had to draw unemployment (its been a while) I received a percentage of what I normally made and it was barely enough, to be honest.  

My current burn rate is $850-900 a month.  That covers everything, so long as nothing breaks and I don't have to go to the doctor.  I can't cut that number down any more.  There are no frills (no cable tv, xbox, nice car, etc).  If I am home, I can hunt and farm more and might be able to get that figure down a bit more but a one time infusion of $1000 buys me a month at best.

1559,1559,LifesPotential,1584643641,flfb8k,Nan,"I know the basic, just lock yourself home. Is there more to it?




I deliver pizza, and workers at my location are getting sick (not sure if its COVID-19 or not, no reported cases in my city). My store wont close until the governor makes us, but tbh im a little worried about my safety now. Not just the virus, but how people are going to start acting. I've got a pretty big target on my back for a little bit of food/money. 




My work has stated if we decide to quarantine we arent allowed back until the epidemic is over. 



- When it comes to quarantine, do you have to be sick? Or can you quarantine prior to being sick?


- If you selected option 2 in the above question, do you still apply for financial aid? Or do you have to be forced into quarantine? 



I'm thinking about telling my work that ill be placing myself in quarantine. My life isn't worth what they're paying.",Ohio,How exactly does quarantine work?
1560,1560,Temperal_Joe,1584643754,flfcii,Nan,"So basically I want to be clear I'm just literally your average Joe. But I think I have the most basic way to explain why everyone is in such a panic. The question was raised to me by a co-worker. Well besides the complications, it's the contagiousness. So let's round it's R0 from 2.28 to 3, for semantics and to aide understanding.

1 person can infect 3 people. Those 3 can infect 3 people each and so on. Basic math.
1*3=3
3*3=9
9*3=27
3*27=81

Our current number of confirmed is over 100. So 100*3=300
300*3=900
900*3=2700
2700*3=8100
8100*3=24300
24300*3=72900

The efforts and freak out is to stop this excelleration in growth. At first it looks like nothing. But before long it's massive and out of control. 

Consider the capacity of our hospitals and what percentage of those numbers would take up a hospital bed. Quite literally it would overwhelm our healthcare system. Then we're like Lombardy, Italy.

Again I am making an attempt to explain this simply to help those that think this isn't a big deal, why it's a big deal. You may be asymptomatic, but you don't know who won't be. I hope this helps.

DeWine knows this, and these last few days of asking for businesses to ""do the right thing"" is just an overture. A farce. He knows they won't. For the average business that requires it's employees to physically present, there's very little that can be realistically done to prevent spread of this disease. The PPE required daily is too expensive for most businesses to willingly provide even if they could.


So why has DeWine and his administration put on this show of being *disappointed* in this entirely predicable lack compliance? Because DeWine is still a politician. He wants to be re-elected in the future, and he'd like to salvage what little campaign funding he might still get after this is all over. So he provides us all the illusion that there may have been a path to preventing a complete quarantine, in hopes it'll absorb the tiniest bit of entrepreneurial anger from the economy being shut down cold.

Most of America's population will get COVID-19 no matter what we do. Spreading that future out over a long timeline is the only way to save lives.

I am a library employee at KC Public in Kansas City, Missouri and am being given PTO during our closure. My girlfriend, whom I live with, works at a facility where she works with former cons, those formally interned in mental health facilities, and is still going to be going into work. I am 25 and she just turned 26, and she has mild asthma. Ever since that video surfaced of that Italian celebrity with his dead sister in her bed, I have been terrified of losing her.

She is in her mid fifties and he is in his early sixties, both have long histories of health problems. He, in particular, has diabetes, and had heart surgery in January.
I need to know there is a way they will be okay. My father is convinced he has already had it, and since he was tested in WV he was never given correct results. He’s horrified at the prospect of spreading it throughout his office or to his mother in her 80s whom he takes care of.

Resources now are low, and your help is more critical than ever. Especially with the delays with governmental aid, hospitals now are really counting on donations from the community. This is all partnered with a local 501(c)(3) non-profit, so all donations will be directed to hospitals and solely for charity purposes.

If you find any issues, or want to donate to another hospital that is not listed, please contact us and we will resolve it. Otherwise, please donate and share the website with friends and family to funnel more money and resources to hospitals. Currently we've only set up Paypal, but will have credit/debit card payment up soon.

1882,1882,Thumbupass,1585068826,fo8grf,Nan," 

To be clear, this is not meant to try to shine a rosy light on this..  I just don't think the numbers being quoted add up in a lot of ways..

They estimated that 100k people had it on March 13 (in ohio). Working backwards that would mean that 25k people had it about 7 days before that. And that today, conservatively, 500,000 people have it or have had it already. For reference, there are 288 people per square mile in Ohio - double that in italy. Average age in Italy is 45, in Ohio 39.

today's hospitalization and fatality numbers would then be correlated to 25k person spread. (accounting for incubation time)

(very conservative estimate) 105 hospitalizations divided by 25k means that .0042% of people that get the virus will be hospitalized.

6 deaths per 25,000 cases is a fatality rate of .00024%

Your chance of dying while walking down the street is something like 1:500 (.002%).

Edited to add:

the population density in NYC is 67k people per square mile. NYC is open 24/7. NYC is a world-hub with three airports and a packed subway system. NYC's average age is 5 years younger than Ohio's.

Even if Ohio estimated 1/4 or the 100k people from Mar 13, this would mean that NYC has millions already with it or having already had it. The hospitalization and death rates, as a result, would be ridiculously small.",Ohio,Covid-19 Numbers

Keep in mind there needs to be a Senate-House conference to agree to a few changes. 

Here are the highlights with immediate relevance to the pandemic:

*The bill expressly authorizes the Tax Commissioner to extend state tax filing and payment deadlines for the duration of the Governor’s COVID-19 emergency declaration and to waive associated interest and penalties for taxpayers affected by the emergency. This provision
applies to all state taxes, school district income taxes, municipal income taxes administered by the state, and certain fees administered by the Department of Taxation.  

*The bill makes several changes regarding unemployment compensation benefits during the emergency declared by the Governor’s Executive Order. All changes will remain in effect
until the state of emergency concludes or December 1, 2020, whichever comes sooner.

The bill suspends the requirement that an individual serve a waiting week before receiving unemployment compensation benefits during this emergency. 

The bill also allows the Director of Job and Family Services to waive the work search requirement as a condition of receiving benefits during the period previously specified. 

The bill provides, during the period specified, an individual is not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits if unemployed or is unable to return to work because of an order to be isolated or quarantined by the individual’s employer, the Governor, the Department of Health, or a board of health. 

*The bill modifies election law by expanding the absent voter period for the March 17, 2020 primary until April 28, 2020. (Note the bill doesn't actually set the date for a primary, it just extends the absentee period to April 28. Whether they will extend it again is another matter.)

*The bill requires county boards of elections to include return postage on absent voter ballots. 

*The bill authorizes the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (during a state of emergency declared by the Governor’s Executive Order) to issue an order that does any of the following:

Requires a public water system to restore service to any customer whose service was disconnected as a result of nonpayment of fees and charges;

Requires a public water system to waive all fees for connection or reconnection; and

Prohibits a public water system from disconnecting customers because of nonpayment of fees and charges.

*The bill defers actions, including licensure renewal, by state agencies, political subdivisions, and individuals that are otherwise required by law to take place during the state
of emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak until 90 days after the date the emergency ends or December 1, 2020, whichever comes sooner.  (Note: This affects your driver's license.)

*On March 14, 2020, the Director of Health issued an order closing all Ohio site-based schools serving any grades K-12 from March 17 through April 3, 2020, due to the implications of COVID-19. In response to the school closure, the bill waives state testing and state report card requirements for the 2019-2020 school year and various other requirements and deadlines and allows schools to make up through distance learning any number of days or hours necessary to
meet minimum instructional hour requirements.

*The bill waives requirements in current law that school districts and other public schools administer elementary and secondary state tests. 

*The bill prohibits ODE from publishing state report card ratings and assigning overall or component letter grades on the state report cards for the 2019-2020 school year and prohibits any report card ratings for this school year from being considered in determining whether a district or school is subject to sanctions or penalties. 

*The bill grants permissive authority to defined state and local public bodies to hold public meetings via teleconference or video conference until December 1, 2020, or during the period of the COVID-19 emergency, whichever occurs first. 

*The bill requires the Board of Nursing to issue temporary registered nurse and licensed practical nurse licenses to applicants that have completed all other requirements except for their licensure exam during the COVID-19 emergency.",Ohio,OMG!

1986,1986,Zapdosmedallion,1585238440,fpe02k,Nan,"I emailed the Senator to urge him to oppose what is clearly NOT a child protection bill, and this is the email he sent back this morning:
Dear Mr. (my name):

 

Thank you for contacting me about the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) Act.

 

We have a collective responsibility to protect our children from harm. This includes ensuring that they are not sexually exploited on the internet and other social media platforms. Though we have strong laws on the books for those who commit sex crimes against children, more can be done to ensure that our children are protected. Collectively, we should do everything that we can to ensure that individuals that sexually exploit the most vulnerable in our society are held accountable for their actions. That includes technology companies, which have a responsibility to protect children by screening for and removing abusive content from their websites and reporting individuals who violate the law on their platforms to law enforcement.

 

The EARN IT Act would create incentives for companies to earn liability protection for violations of laws related to online child sexual abuse material and ensure tech companies are using best practices to prevent child exploitation. As a parent and grandparent, I take seriously the responsibility of safeguarding all children. Nothing is more tragic than the victimization of a child, and protecting our children from sexual crimes will always be a top priority for me.

 

Should any legislation dealing with child pornography on the internet or child abuse come before the Senate, I will keep your thoughts in mind.

 

Thank you again for getting in touch with me.

 

                                                            Sincerely,

 

                                                            Sherrod Brown

                                                            United States Senator

Be aware, this bill strips protections from companies and programs that do not give the government backdoor access to our texts and emails.

___________________________________________
2:06 PM: The Governor begins speaking

On evictions, obviously people have to have a home to remain in. Courts are currently open. The bill that I plan to sign tomorrow provides that all civil, criminal, and administrative time limits are held, allowing courts to be more flexible in how they handle cases. Courts will not have to take cases relating to evictions. In some cases, evictions will continue, such as in cases of domestic violence or drug dealing. The Chief Justice plans to instruct the courts to avoid evictions whenever necessary. 

On weddings and funerals, they are not prohibited. We do not want large gatherings, so it is recommended to postpone the big ceremonies until this vital period ends.

102 years ago, Philadelphia had a parade despite the Spanish Flu, this led to a large increase in infections. Throughout the state, parades and other large gatherings are being canceled. Social distancing is buying us time. 

We want to ensure that there is a process for where the sick will be sent as diseases progress. We do not know how large our capacity will have to be by the end of this but we must do it. Maryland will be doubling their capacity and we expect it will be about the same for us. 

Many have offered to help in any way they can. Donations can be mentioned on together@governor.ohio.gov.

We asked them if they realized how irresponsible it was to send people out to come in contact with strangers when Covid-19 is spreading throughout the state and the country. He said it was ""our opinion to think this is irresponsible"" then hung up the phone when we tried to ask him more questions.

Thanks the Governor and team. 

You cannot separate the people from the economy.

We are working  in Congress to give the resources to the people and the health care workers as necessary. A moratorium on evictions will be fought for. I do not feel that the Federal Government has gone far enough. 

Thanks to all Ohioans who are working in essential jobs and helping everyone get through this.

Our setup is somewhat lower tech than before. One of the workers who set up our briefings have become sick with what was diagnosed as pneumonia. Luckily, they tested negative for COVID-19. However, we are running with a skeleton crew and this will have an affect on the quality of these briefings. 

We will be capable of sanitizing 160,000 masks a day due to the innovations of a company based in Ohio. The FDA must approve the use of the machines they have produced before they can be used and I implore that they do so as soon as possible. 

To testing centers, please get us your results as soon as possible.

I issued and order last night that any state contractor that has a contract they are fulfilling must be investigated to follow the proper guidelines.

Feel free to go outside but make sure you continue to practice social distancing.

Our estimates show that we have around two weeks before cases start ramping up and the peak may not come until May. We may have to increase our capacity by as much 2-3 times our current levels. Ohio has been split into 8 regions and drafts for a plan to combat the virus in each region have been submitted. These are being reviewed and will be sent back with suggestions as soon as possible.

Each region must be united, working closely together as each plan moves forward. 

We will ensure you understand what is going to happen in each region before the plans move forward. 

I would like to thank churches that have been innovating to ensure that their members do not contract the virus and follow social distancing. I would ask that people not congregate.

We need surgical gowns of all sizes, face/surgical masks (adult and pediatric), gloves (nitrile, vinyl, or butyl), N-95 particulate respirators, isolation gowns, and many more. We are seeking donations and to expand production from as many companies as possible.

We have 1406 confirmed cases, 344 hospitalizations, 123/344 in the ICU, 25/1406 deaths.

We absolutely need tests that have been completed to be reported to the Ohio Department of Health as soon as possible. This includes a total of all tests given out and a report on negative test as well.

This crisis is like when you see a report of a hurricane in the Caribbean and the east coast begins preparing as soon as possible to protect themselves. We must do this.

Every action you're taking at home is affecting how and when this storm of a virus will hit. We are spreading out the power of this storm and lowering its strength as much as possible. There is no health care system in the world that would have been prepared for how this would have affected us. We must do everything we can to continue to slow this down. 

I'd like the elderly to stay home as much as possible with help from their community.

2:02 PM: The Governor starts talking

Apologizes for having to call everyone to meet today. Mentions that Amy Acton will be continuing to work as usual rather than speaking today. 

We do not have enough N-95 masks. They keep our medical personnel safe and healthy, preventing the spread of the virus. We are already having to conserve them and they are wearing them longer than usual. This is a problem that is not unique to Ohio. Battelle is an Ohio company that innovated and created a machine that can sanitize as many as 80,000 masks a day. They must be brought online as quickly as possible. They are already ready but we were waiting for FDA approval. Their response, just this morning, was to approve the use of these machines. We were obviously excited. 

I spoke to the man in charge of Battelle who told me that mass sanitation of the masks would not be possible due to the FDA limiting the number of masks they are allowed to sanitize to 10,000. 

I spoke to President Donald Trump, our senators, and several of our other representatives. All of them immediately understood our concerns and said they would work to fight for this limit to be removed. 

Several minutes ago, I also spoke to the leader of the FDA and he said that he would be clearing this up by the end of the day. We have no yet heard anything but I am hopeful and grateful for the understanding. 

2:12 PM: The Governor stops speaking
_____________________________________________________________
2:13 PM: The Lieutenant Governor starts speaking

I was thrilled when I got the call about the approval of this innovative process but when I heard about that limit all my enthusiasm was evaporated. These guidelines must be changed in order to protect our most vulnerable workers. We need to run at full speed rather than being limited. I have never seen the Governor more frustrated than he was today.

2:15 PM: The Governor gives an update on the latest cases

_______________________________________________________________________
2:17 PM: The President and CEO of Battelle begins speaking

We developed a technology that would allow for decontamination of masks that is capable of sanitizing them of diseases that are actually worse than COVID-19. These masks can be decontaminated as many as 20 times per mask. We currently have machines ready to operate in Long Island and New York. We also have machines in route to Seattle and Washington D.C. We can produce as many as two additional machines a week depending on the supply chain we can develop. 

The President and CEO of Battelle stops speaking
_______________________________
2:20 PM: Question period begins

When do you expect to see this technology used in Ohio?

Governor: We expected something better than this days ago. I was assured by the FDA that we will be able to go full-speed into this today.

The President and CEO of Battelle: We can begin working tomorrow. We already have a machine capable of full operation tomorrow. 
______________________________________________________________
2:23 PM: Are both systems deployed in Columbus? Are you planning on focusing on Central Ohio or the whole state? How long does this take?

The President and CEO of Battelle: Yes. We plan on focusing on the entire state. We currently believe we can get the 80,000 masks sanitized in a single day barring logistics issues.
__________________________________________________________________________
2:24 PM: Did the FDA explain their reasoning? Governor, do you feel you can criticize the President? 

The President and CEO of Battelle: I hope being able to share our data and the exact process we use will improve the situation. 

Governor: I called the President this morning. I explained what was happening. He understood what was going on and he said he would get this done.

I was laid off on 3/20, but I was sent home from work on 3/19 (without pay) due to a fever. I was told to file immediately on 3/20, per my boss, so I did. It told me my next filing date was on 3/22, so I logged on on 3/22, but it said I had nothing to file for. I was very confused by this, so I reopened my application. I think I screwed it up, because when I put my mass layoff number in, it didn't have my own employer, so I manually searched for my employer in their system, and it took away the mass layoff number. I realized this was probably wrong after I submitted it again, so I reopened it one more time, and just selected the mass layoff number and left it alone this time.

Fast forward to today. I filled it out for the week ending 3/28. It says my next filing date is 3/29, which is today. I'm very confused. Is that correct? Do I need to reopen my application again?

On the payment page, it only lists two dates - 3/21 and 3/28 and both are listed as pending. Is this correct?

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

But my understanding is that if you ever earn more in a week than your weekly benefit amount, you have to restart your claim. And that sounds like a terrible hassle. Would I even qualify again if I had to do that?

Because I filed on the 19th, it's showing my first week to file as the week ending the 21st. But with my partial work week, my gross pay that week was $259, and my weekly benefit amount is only $226.

So I've been afraid to file that, assuming it would be denied and afraid that then everything would be denied and I'd get nothing. I thought I could skip that week, but it's not letting me file for the week of the 28th without having done the first one.

Am I really going to have to try restarting my claim?

I have a faint hope that the stimulus package will increase my weekly benefit amount such that I can file that first week normally, but it might not even be applied in that way, and who knows how long it will take to be implemented.

Financially I can afford to wait a few weeks to receive my benefits, but I'm afraid of screwing something up and not being eligible for them.

2:03 PM: The Governor begins speaking

Reminder that businesses and customers are obligated to observe social distancing guidelines. Businesses must also ensure that the environment their employees work in is clean and healthy. 

Jobs Ohio is a great organization that helps with job creation in our state. We are planning for the upcoming bad economy in order to ensure that Ohioans will not be as badly affected by unemployment. Jobs Ohio is working in those hardest hit by bad economy in order to allow companies to remain open or begin operation. They are focusing on small businesses. 

Dr. Acton will be issuing an order today in order to track where ventilators are and how many we have. This will streamline the process to ensure we know how bad our shortage may or may not be. We are working to secure more ventilators along with that process. Devices that may also be used to treat sleep apnea should also be reported, including Cpap and Bpap machines. Ventilators owned for personal use need not be reported. 

Since March 12th, employees working for the state have been working from home whenever possible. I have ordered state agencies to continue that process until at least May 1st. I have also ordered them to look into moving even more into working from home.

The state has required that water utilities must continue serving customers, even without payment, for as long as this crisis is considered ongoing.

Battelle and Ohio State University have developed a new, rapid test system that will be capable of processing 200 tests every day. This number might increase to 1,000 as infrastructure improves.

New technology is being innovated and is coming online. This is only possible because we are slowing the spread of the virus. 

Mental health is very important during this time period. We will be having a brief explanation of things you can do to keep yourself healthy mentally during this time.

2:19 PM: The Governor stops speaking
_________________________________________________
2:20 PM: Lori Criss begins speaking 

We are working with the homeless in order to give them a place to call home during this period. 

We highly recommend that you keep to a new routine and keep everything rather scheduled.

Keep in contact with your friends, family, and neighbors, especially those who live alone will keep everyone healthier.

If you are facing trouble with keeping yourself stocked on food and other important items, we are working on fixing that issues and many places may be able to help you now.

Keep in contact with your primary care doctor and if you are experiencing addiction, feel free to look into resources for help.

If you are religious or spiritual, keep in contact with your leaders.

Taking time to listen to nature or being out in nature is important for mental health as well.

Make sure you keep a balance between work and and social time. 

The state has created volunteer opportunities for those who have time to help during this period. 

Set boundaries for yourself so that you can take care of your needs whenever you need to.

It is important to remember that school is a community for children. Make sure to create opportunities for your children to socialize with their peers while practicing social distancing. 

Monitor the media that your children are browsing and answer their questions and concerns honestly.

If you were recovering from or dealing with alcoholism or other addiction, make sure to keep in contact with your recovery support groups.

Reach out and support those living with mental illness.

Seek serenity to accept the things we cannot change. Courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference. 

2:32 PM: Lori Criss stops speaking

2:32 PM: Lieutenant Governor starts speaking

Right before I walked into this room, I spoke to the the entire technology sector relating to unemployment and I made sure they understood that there is a lot of frustration with the current system. I wanted to give them a sense of urgency. They told me they had already increased the system by 20X and I informed them that it was not enough. I am doing everything I can and they are doing everything they can as well. This is not something that can be fixed in moments. We are listening to those of you who are voicing your frustrations. Please do not focus those frustrations on those who are working in the unemployment system. They are doing as much as they can. They have processed more people in the past two weeks than they have over the past two years.

On insurance, employers who cannot pay their premiums have been given a grace period. COVID-19 is covered under insurance and all hospitals in Ohio should be covered equally by all health care insurance providers.

We are always on the phone with the leaders throughout the economic and health sphere, trying to get everything fixed where necessary.

2:41 PM: The Lieutenant Governor stops speaking

2:41 PM: Amy Acton starts speaking

2,199 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 585 hospitalizations, 55 deaths, 29,191 total tested. 

429 health care workers have been confirmed to be infected with coronavirus. This is 20% of the total.

A recent study focusing on mitigation measures taken in Italy found that there is a major difference between the hardest hit region of Italy and the lesser affected regions. 

No one person or president is at fault. A quote from the article is, ""This virus is faster than any bureaucracy."" Despite this, I feel that Ohio has done the most we can to fight this virus. 

We are building a response to both the surge we are expecting and a community-based response to keep everyone involved in the process. 

I feel confident that we have made the right choices based on our models. Even models that disagree with ours agree that social distancing is essential to slowing down the spread of the virus. We have to be prepared for the storm. We are looking into the worst case and the best case but the most important part of this is keeping increasing supplies in our hospital in order to keep capacity as low as possible. This is the calm before the storm, we're minimizing our use of hospital beds and other supplies, while maximizing their production.

Every time you go out, be vigilant, and be safe. Follow social distancing rules and listen to guidelines given to you by businesses regarding social distancing.

2:53 PM: Amy Acton stops speaking 
______________________________________________________
2:53 PM: Question period begins

Have you received any response from the education community about extending the school closures? What about to families of those students?

Governor: When we began these orders we understood that people would become unemployed or be on the edge of financial trouble or worse. This is the type of response that was necessary and I understand that people are making sacrifices. I have not had any direct conversation from superintendents but we are continuing dialogue. 

I'd like to have everything go back to normal but I cannot do that yet without putting everyone at risk. This is a once in 100 years event.
___________________________________________________________________
2:56 PM: Have you changed your mind on your views in terms of the prison system?

Governor: Our prison system has the best interests of both the prisoners and their workers. We have been reviewing if there are prisoners who did not commit violent crimes and are nearing the end of their sentence. There are things that we will never do but we are looking into making decisions on a case by case basis. We have an obligation to both the prisoners and staff in prisons but we also have an obligation to those out of prison.
___________________________________________________________
3:00 PM: How many tests can the state lab handle each day? What is limiting our testing ability?

Amy Acton: Testing is still limited in supply. Our lab can do 280 tests every day and this takes around eight hours. Cleveland Clinic, Ohio State University, and hospitals throughout the state are also working on this. We do not have enough test kits still. There is a new type of testing being worked on called point of care testing. We have a team working on getting that testing as quickly as possible. We are doing everything we can. 

We're working on expanding our investigation force that's looking into the infection spread through contact tracing. We're also looking into technological answers to that issue.

Governor: Hospitals, do not send your tests to places that may take five or more days to get through them. Send them to our Department of Health lab or a hospital with a quick turnaround time.
____________________________________________________________________
3:06 PM: What do you think of the use of homemade masks that seems to be spreading? Do you think Ohioans should begin doing that?

Amy Acton: The CDC is measuring the benefit of wearing masks. In Ohio, we are already recommending you expect that you are infected and so I wonder if it will be necessary for us. I won't rule out that it won't be useful. We have seen the mask-wearing in Asia that possibly helps prevent the spread of disease and we will continuing looking into that.
____________________________________________________________________________
3:09 PM: What has your experience acquiring ventilators been like?

Governor: The other states have about the same experience as us but we are looking into having our own businesses produce ventilators for us. We're taking every opportunity to increase our supply. 

Lieutenant Governor:  I wanted to mention that Battelle has sanitized 3,500 masks and is working on ramping up on that.

For a few years now I’ve been growing cut flowers to make fresh bouquets. This year I had planned to begin selling at a farmers marker which means I’d already planned my garden out to have at least a hundred bouquets each week starting in roughly 6 weeks until the fall. Instead of doing the market (they might not even exist this year anyways) I would love to donate bouquets to people making a difference or perhaps just those who need cheered up. I’ve already got so many different flowers started or planned, and hundreds of Dahlia tubers. I know these beautiful blooms can help make someone smile during these scary times. 

What kind of places would be feasible for this? I’d like to first reach out to those making a difference during this pandemic, such as healthcare workers, foodbank volunteers, overlooked essential employees, etc. I know flowers aren’t anything life changing, and I do not want to trivialize the contributions of these people in any way so please let me know if you feel this could have a negative effect. I just really think some people out there could benefit from a little beauty, this summer especially. I’m in the greater Dayton, OH area. 

Now that germs are a huge consideration for everyone I want to mindful of that as well. I don’t want to make things worse by someone thinking they’re going to get contaminated from the bouquets or the act of receiving said bouquet. I already have tons of plastic bouquet sleeves as well, so the bouquets will be placed in those individually (like they are at the supermarket). I just am unsure of how to best distribute them since I don’t want to inconvenience those receiving the bouquets in any way.

What happens is, people come in pick out the paint color they want and grab however many gallons of paint they think they need and slap it on the desk... Now there’s different types of mixing bases to make different colors of paint and 9 out of 10 people grab the wrong base so the employees have to switch the bases out creating an “indirect” handshake for the most part.....

_________________________________________
2:05 PM: The Governor begins speaking

I'd like to start off by thanking our teachers, administrators, and parents who are helping our students learn. We've never had to do something like this at such a large scale.

The Ohio Department of Education has released a remote learning resource guide with all of the best practices we have come up with during this time. 

We still do not have enough tests to perform the number we wish. We need more testing and we need quicker results. The order Amy Acton gave several days ago is now showing results. Tests are getting done faster than ever before. Our major hospitals have plenty of capacity to continue analyzing tests from throughout the state. Our capacity to test has gotten bigger but we are still lacking some important supplies. Ohio State University and the Health Department are working together on getting some of those supplies for the state from manufacturers within the state. Help is on the way. We expect a better supply chain within a few days. Other teams are working on procuring the rest of the necessary supplies.'

2:13 PM: The Governor stops speaking
________________________________________________
2:14 PM: General Harris of the Ohio National Guard starts speaking

We're doing what we need to do to build-out our capacity to ensure that our health care workers will be capable of helping all citizens of Ohio. We have seen what other states and countries have dealt with and are taking actions that will ensure we learn from what happened to them. Our regional approach will ensure that our patients will end up in hospitals rather than new structures. The new structures we are working on will be for those who are not as sick. The National Guard will be working on building partitions for buildings and transporting beds. This is an approach that involves leaders, found in political, economic, and scientific theaters. We are also working on procuring more staff to ensure that we suffer no shortages of workers. The National Guard is also working on producing food for the homeless, running PPE warehouses, and much more. Ensure you are being safe online as well.",Ohio,The Governor's 4/03 Coronavirus briefing will begin soon as of 2:00 PM

Governor: I'll begin by talking about the ties that I've been wearing. I've been wearing ties from different colleges and universities throughout the state. We're very proud of them.

I will be showing a video of the 100th birthday of Louise Williams in our state. They're all practicing proper social distancing so I'd like to thank everyone involved.

We've been continuing our process of hospital build-out today, along with our process of procurement of the vital supplies our health care workers need. Thanks to everyone that is working on that every day. Thanks to our businesses that are working to produce the material we need.

There are three ways we are increasing our capacity. One is cutting out elective surgeries. This frees up rooms and materials for the upcoming peak. Second is the build-out process which General Harris spoke about yesterday. That is still a work in progress. The third involves hospitals building out capacity within their own buildings. 

We thank a lot of people who do a lot of things, I'd like to give a shout out to those who work in our prisons. We appreciate what you do. Especially with this challenge we are all facing. I'd also like to thank our health and human services workers who serve as a safety net for those with mental illness, addiction, and other ailments. 

Around 15 minutes ago, I signed an order expanding telehealth. We are broadening the ability of those with mental health issues and other problems to access the resources they need to protect themselves without leaving their homes.

We've received new advice from the CDC regarding the wearing of masks. Whenever I'm in public I plan on wearing the masks my wife, Fran made for me. Please don't stigmatize those wearing masks when out and about throughout the day. They're trying to reduce the spread of the virus any way they can and that is commendable. Dr. Acton will be explaining some limitations to these masks but please be respectful to those wearing them. To employers, please let your employees wear masks

Battelle is now sterilizing masks at full swing and they are doing this for free for some time. This is a major breakthrough and we will continue to buy as many of these as we can. Hospitals should get in contact with Battelle as soon as possible. 
____________________________________________
Lieutenant Governor: My family is also planning on wearing masks while out in public. We need to respect each other and, in a way, these masks are doing just that. 

We understand that in some areas of the state there are those that don't have good access to the internet. Our website regarding the coronavirus provides a map of all the hotspots throughout the state. I understand the irony of recommending the use of a website for those who do not have internet access but it is still a useful tool and I hope many of you are able to get access to it. To our churches, this might be a useful tool for your congregation to use in order to take part in service while maintaining social distancing. 

April 28th is election day. We will have no in-person voting; it will only be by mail. You can request a ballot at voteohio.gov or by calling your local board of elections. 

2020census.gov will allow you to fill out your census forms. 

Many businesses are still hiring and need your help. We have 23,000 jobs waiting.

I want to give a shoutout to a few people at my alma mater. 

I would like to thank Chris Spielman for working to raise $40,000 to help with the coronavirus.  He is doing this by auctioning the awards he received during his time as a football player. 
_______________________________________________
Ursel Mcelroy, Director of the Department of Aging: Our older citizens have been bringing strength, wisdom, in calm in these trying times. But they have also been telling us that they have never seen anything like this before. We must all work together, to do all that we can to keep each other healthy, especially our older adults. They are in the high-risk group, even more so if they have chronic medical conditions. We are pleased to see that businesses, hospitals, and our state agencies are working hard to protect them. The aging network is continuing to help our aging Ohioans. We have been working on maintaining our essential services, including helping with hygiene, providing food, and providing medication. Keep an eye out on the older adults around you and protect them. If you can do anything to help, either by volunteering or donating supplies, please work to do so.

We have nearly 1,000 nursing homes, which hold around 90,000 beds, 755 assisted living facilities, and 70,000 older Ohioans live in affordable housing communities. These are all congregant sites. We have had to make some changes in some cases in order to protect those living there. We've had to limit visits in some cases but we encourage our workers to allow those living in those communities to stay in contact with their family through technology. Thank you to our workers in these communities. 

We provide care for nearly 55,000 aging adults with high needs and limited income. Personal care remains one of the most critical and requested services. We've put steps in place in order to make it easy to access our services. 

Caring for a loved one can be very hard work. You must care for yourself as well as whomever you are caring for. The CARE Act provides support to family caregivers. We are working on putting resources for caregivers online. 

Thank you to our in-home care workers, our transportation workers, and our family caregivers. Thank you for all you do. We value and appreciate you. 

Keep in contact with your friends and family. We don't want anyone feeling isolated. Be willing to help those around you whenever you can. 

We are very energized and dedicated to helping our aging Ohioans.

Amy Acton: I have a lot to share with you today. 

3,739 confirmed cases, 1,006 hospitalizations, 326/1,006 in the ICU, 102/3,739 deaths. 748 of those infected by the virus were health care workers. 41,871 tests have been administered so far.

Deaths lag behind all of our other data. The elderly are still the most vulnerable with the average age of death being 78. While that is true, young people are still dying from the virus. As more data comes in we'll be sharing more data. 

I want you to know that we are flattening the curve but we must keep that up. Masks will be an addition to our current methods, it cannot be used as a substitute. 

We have seen a decrease in the use of retail, in transit stations, in grocery and pharmacy use, and in workplace travel. 

Masks will not make you invincible. Still, we will show you some of the best ways to create homemade masks. Thicker fabrics will keep everyone safer. It won't be 100% but it will be more like 80%. Every mitigation measure can help slow the spread. This is  the norm in a lot of Asian countries but I hope we can lead the way in this new protection. Don your cape and your mask and be heroes for all Ohioans. 
________________________________________________
Question period begins
___________________________________________
**Are you expecting your restrictions on camping, day camps, pools, and other warm weather activities to last into the summer?**

Governor: We don't know yet. We don't think there's a chance that the order will end before May 1st but it will depend on what the models tell us and other things we are seeing.
______________________________________
**Do the number of negatives indicate a good sign in terms of the virus spread?**

Amy Acton: We still don't have enough testing to be able to say that for sure. Even those testing negative could simply be in the early days of the virus, when it is not detectable. Our hospitals are working on measuring positives. CDC teams are working in rural areas and we plan to test a small sample of the general population, which would improve our understanding of the virus' spread.
__________________________________
**Has this crisis made you change your mind regarding licensing hospitals?**

Governor: That's not something I'm working on at this point. I'm focusing on the virus.

Amy Acton: Licensing is an ongoing conversation we have been having with our hospitals. Our hospitals are working so hard for us and we're making sure that we listen to them. We're hoping that our healthcare system and our public health system can work better in tandem, with or without licensing, which might jumpstart that process.
_____________________________________
**What can people in Ohio do if they see scams related to the coronavirus or are scammed? I ask because we have seen fake testing booths springing up in neighboring states.**

Amy Acton: All three of us here have some very strong opinions after hearing about this and if you see anything like that report it immediately to us. This is an absolute travesty. Most people are rising to the occasion. It's too bad that there are people in so many different spheres taking advantage of this situation. You cannot get tested without first consulting with your doctor. You must be referred for testing to take place. You will be given very specific instructions on this by your doctor if you need a test, otherwise you are likely being scammed. There are so many scams going on and we all have to be hyper-vigilant. In state government, we have seen scams relating to the coronavirus and the fact that states are being pitted against each other only makes that issue worse. We'll try to give you information on these scams whenever we can.

Governor: My experience has been that most Ohioans will rise to the occasion. The small minority of people are scam artists and they will always be scam artists. Please report this and let us broadcast that information.

Lieutenant Governor: There have been attempted scams against us. People who violate our trust both as citizens and government must be punished and I'm sure our Attorney General will get onto those people as soon as they're reported.
__________________________________________________
**What do we say to Ohioans that feel lied to regarding unemployment and who aren't getting their benefits? Are we going to hit a surge that will make everything untenable? What can people do while they wait?**

Lieutenant Governor: The unemployment surge is still in process. We've increased server capacity by 20X and we hope to increase the workforce by 1,000 people. Our analytics are showing improvement on wait times but it's still not where we want it to be. I hope that it will be much better by the next time we speak. All of the states are facing this issue.

Those receiving benefits from the CARE Act, I want to let you know that the federal government has not given us any direction as to how to set that up and we must wait until that direction is given before we can help you. It is still weeks away. It still needs to be built from scratch. We're building it but we can't do anything just yet.

I want to reiterate that benefits are retroactive to the moment of their eligibility. They will receive their benefits if they are eligible, it's only a matter of time and I feel so much for what they're dealing with. We've done as much as we can to ensure that they will be protected as this process is completed. In some cases we are even working ahead as in the case of the CARE Act build-up.
_________________________________________________
**Are you working on securing PPE from international sources or are we only focusing on Ohio manufacturers? Are you concerned it might be seized by the federal government?**

Governor: We're going after PPE anywhere we can find it. We expect to have a plane coming in Tuesday with our first shipment. We're still working on acquiring more shipments. We'll notify everyone when these come in. We want this PPE to be there for those who need it.  

We've heard stories of PPE getting seized and it is a concern but we're not just taking one path or source, we're following multiple paths and sources. Everyone I work with understands just how important PPE is to our health care workers. 
______________________________________________
**What is the status of our supply of hospital beds and ventilators? Have you set a deadline for a report on that?**

Governor: We've been open about the fact that we need to double the amount of hospital beds we currently have. We are already working on that by suspending elective surgeries. Just today we showed a chart showing the increases in capacity we have already seen. Right now, we're building up hospital facilities for people who do not have COVID-19. We're taking existing structures and placing beds in those facilities. We've started down our path and we will continue as time goes on. We're still in the process of taking a full inventory throughout the state of all the supplies we need. It's getting closer and closer every day.

I've told all of our workers that we need this done as soon as possible. I want it yesterday if I can get it.
____________________________________________
**Any update on if food banks will be receiving help from the state? What should Ohioans do to keep a good supply of food in grocery stores that can be donated to food banks**

Governor: We're still working on that but that was only 24 hours ago and we've got a lot on our plate right now. I don't have an update just yet. Our grocery stores are not losing supply. Take what you need for a reasonable period of time and no more. There is no need to hoard as we have seen with toilet paper. 

This is a top priority to keep our state healthy. 
____________________________________________
**When do you expect the CDC workers will be done with their report on the rural population's COVID-19 infection rate? Will the state work be separated from the federal work?**

Amy Acton: We have been in communication with the CDC. We're hearing they might be extending their stay in Ohio. Personally, outside of the rural area, we have been working on training amateur epidemiologists to work on contact tracing. 

I just want to mention that we are not hiding our numbers regarding our ventilator supply. We do not have the accurate numbers we want to use. We're building new software to track all of our supplies and we hope that it can be sent out publicly. 

We'll be talking to you about how long our average hospital stays will be. We'll be talking to you about inventory in each of our regions. We've changed the way we are registering deaths for COVID-19. This and so much more will be prepared and you will be informed in the next week regarding them. We've known for awhile that we have a major shortage but we need to build and buy. 

It's hard to separate the two. 75% of my funding comes from the federal government. We're doing lots with the CDC but we will certainly be doing our own work.

2464,2464,-MrWrightt-,1586092495,fvdm1d,Nan,"The unanimous Declaration of the United Territories of Buckeye Nation:

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for Ohio State to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with Michigan losers, common decency requires that we should declare the causes which impel us to separate from those jerkoffs.

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all Buckeyes are created equal, that they are endowed by Saint Urban with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are twelve-win seasons, excellent recruiting, and the year-in, year-out demolishing of that team up north; that College Football Risk was instituted among all college football fans to ensure a reason to give Michigan what-for, that whenever the Wolverines start acting up, it is the right of Buckeye Nation to slap them down and to seize their territory, freeing their serfs from the tyranny of incredibly mundane football to improve their lives and happiness.

We do not overthrow the Wolverines lightly, but when a long train of abuses and treachery, issuing directly from Michigan's jerkwad-dom comes to light, it is our right, our duty, to throw off such Wal-verines and to provide superior role models for future football fans. Such has been the patient sufferance of Risk Territories; and such is now the necessity which requires us to handle these wankers. The history of the present Michigan leadership is a history of douche chills, all having in direct intent the establishment of Michigan mediocrity over college football. To prove this, let these facts be submitted to a candid world.

 • They have refused to disown the state of Michigan, the most wholesome and necessary act for the public good.

 • They have permitted their rogues to attack powers unrelated to their current missions, unless they are trying to curry favor with the target of their harassment;

 • They have resumed their covert attacks when discussion with their target has been suspended, resuming their cowardly injury;

 • They have refused to accommodate the needs of fellow allies, preferring to pilfer scraps of territory in their grubby, clammy hands.

 • They have refused to respond to administrative queries for the sole purpose of fatiguing erstwhile allies into compliance with their nonsense.

 • They have hired a man in James Harbaugh who in deeds and character is compares unfavorably to Bo Pelini, yet persist in considering him to be among the nation's coaching elite;

 • They have deigned to compare themselves to Ohio State when a more fitting comparison would be the Volunteers of Tennessee, which have also not won a major bowl game in the last twenty years;

 • For insulting allies for opposing with manly firmness their invasions on the rights of Aggies;

 • For endeavoring to backstab their military allies, preferring in stealth to halt the agreed upon assault on the corn-producers.

 • For inserting spies into this noble space for the sole purpose of relaying our exhortations and direction;

 • For generally being back on their bullshit, had they ever abandoned their bullshit to begin with;

 • And for being complete dicks.

In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned the chodes in Michigan leadership in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated jive-ass behavior. A team's leadership whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a bunch of knobs, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have we been wanting in attentions to the Michigan ass-clowns. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their “rogues” to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of their emigration and settlement to the Southwest. We have appealed to their Cro-Magnon intellect with the interpolation of crayon drawings into our letters. Our previous words have fallen on deaf ears, though, and the Michigan simpletons consumed all available crayons, thinking them to be rainbow candy. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity of our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of the error that borders four Great Lakes, Enemies in War.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united Buckeye Nation, in this channel, assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world, Ryan Day, for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by Authority of the good People of these Territories, solemnly publish and declare that these United Territories are, and of right ought to be in the possession of Ohio State; that they are absolved from all allegiance to Michigan Bastardry, and that all political connection between them and the State of Michigan, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent Territories, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, get to Five Stars, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may rightfully do in order to tell Michigan to get bent.

For the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

The worst offender to me is Randy Ludlow of the Columbus Dispatch, who never asks a question that isn't built as a ""Gotcha"" moment. His most recent question was related to the governor's legal authority to close businesses. I have to wonder if he's looked at the rest of the country and seen the exact same measures being taken. The Governor has even been comparatively lenient from what I've seen.

Maybe I'm overreacting but I feel like several of these reporters are acting unprofessional and rude.

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

So make no doubts about it, this is on us. And a lot of you are celebrating it. You need to stop. This isn't a ""snow day"" for a whole lot of people. This is a GD nightmare. 

Most restaurants that have closed will not re-open. Those people have lost their dreams of being independent and now will have to go find work where they can just to keep their families in their homes. And you are sitting there mad that someone went out for groceries more than once in the week.

What about the millions of other small businesses that are shut down, or effectively shut down due to lack of business because of the rest of the shut down? Same result. Very concerned people, might not re-open.

Children's toy store... barely paying rent before... but just enough to get by and pay their employees. Now 2 going on 3 months behind on rent that they will have to make up. Business doesn't come back all that fast even after ""shelter"" order goes away.... out of business.

Commercial real estate rental rates drop through the floor because so many tenants just bail. Empty offices everywhere. Commercial landlords can't pay their mortgages so the banks take the properties in foreclosure, receivership, or bankruptcy.

Don't celebrate a landlord failing -- that was just a person trying to make a living -- now, you've just got a superior landlord taking over who doesn't know you or care at all about your issues.

All these people that went on their own last year, 10 years ago, 20 years ago... suddenly back in the job market. Wow, say goodbye to raises and hiring bonuses... there is no longer a labor shortage in America.

Lifetime restaurant worker? Spent your 20s waiting tables, maybe behind the bar? Guess what, there's going to be about 1/2 the jobs available. If your establishment didn't make it, you're unlikely to find a place to land unless you are well established in your local area.


But we have to do it right? Every medical expert has said so, and I'm not a medical expert so F me, I can't have an opinion.

Well how about the other experts? How about the economist? the sociologist? the historian? how about the anthropologist for F's sake?

What if we directly save 30,000 lives but kill 1,000,000 in the process?

Don't give me the ""if it saves 1 life, it was worth it"" line... we KNOW the seasonal flu is going to kill 60,000 in America every year, we don't shut down the world economy for those 60,000 people.

How many people are we shutting the economy down for, and how many people are we killing by shutting down the economy?

How many people are we killing directly and indirectly by this response in order to save how many?

Literally, are we killing more people with our response?

This is insanity.

Anyone that wants to demonstrate in a GROUP in front of the state house private message me. I'd like to organize something.

This response is killing Ohio, killing America, and killing Americans. It's time to shut down the shut down.",Ohio,"All of you celebrating your ""adult snow day"" because you get to take a month off and go back to a secure job or because you are working from home with no family issues.... you are not quality people."

You want to do your civic duty and stay home, but at the same time you bills to pay. I feel you. I dealt with this for weeks as well, so I really hope the below information helps.

**(I would recommend at least skimming through the whole post but you can skip to the bottom for the TL;DR)**

I applied for unemployment on 3/18/20 and was just approved today (4/6/2020) around midnight after FINALLY getting through to someone on Saturday.

I obviously can't say for sure if the below strategy is going to work for everyone (or if it was just a coincidence that I got approved the following business day after I was able to speak with someone), but implementing what I'm recommending definitely won't hurt your chances:

**First recommendation**: As opposed to calling the primary unemployment number (877-644-6562) that literally EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHER is calling, **I would recommend calling the customer service center that is specifically designated to your social security number (based on the last four digits).**

Here is the link to find that number: [http://jfs.ohio.gov/ouio/claims-processing-center-locations.stm](http://jfs.ohio.gov/ouio/claims-processing-center-locations.stm)

I found it easier to get through. Not *easy* to get through, just easier. To give an idea of what I mean, after 100+ tries over the course of the week, I was only able to get through to this call center once, and that was this past Saturday around 2pm. But that beats the ZERO times I was able to get through to the other number after 200+ tries.

**Second recommendation**: When you call, press option 1 for English, then (when prompted) press option 9, then press option 3. This will take you one of two ways:

Either 1) to the fucking abyss of a recording that has pissed literally every single one of us off a thousand times over that lets you know that you've listened to TEN MINUTES of prompts for absolutely fucking nothing because of their exceptionally high volume of calls, OR 2) to speak with someone about clearing up an **eligibility issue**, which most, if not all, of us have had an email about.

When you get someone on the phone, just let them know how long you've been waiting and that you wanted to ensure there were no more eligibility issues you need to clear up. When I spoke with my rep about this, she asked a couple questions and informed me that she was able to clear it up and all I needed to do was wait.

Guys, I don't know about you, but just hearing that there was nothing I could do besides wait from someone was honestly a huge relief in and of itself because I knew at that point I had done everything I could do. I know that isn't everything, but it isn't nothing.

**Third recommendation**: Reference the chat status on the unemployment website to gauge volume. EVEN IF YOU DON'T NEED TO RESET YOUR PIN, the status of the chat box can help you gauge how busy the customer service centers are. The the chat has 3 options:

1. Chat Offline (when the office is closed)
2. Chat to reset PIN (someone is available)
3. Chat busy (can't get through)

I don't know if this is 100% correct or not, but all I know is that I was able to get through when I noticed that after refreshing the page a few times the chat status wasn't ""busy.""

**Fourth recommendation**: Try at least twice every hour. Don't do it on the hour or on the half hour, that's probably what everyone is doing. Pick a random number and set alarms to remind yourself to call. Don't give up. You'll get through eventually. If nothing else, your best chances will be on Saturday or (probably) Sunday.

**Fifth recommendation**: Be nice and thank your rep at the end of the call. These guys are busting their asses. They're still at work and they're doing their best. Don't. Be. An asshole.

Hope this info helps. Tried to be as clear as possible. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to help.

**TL;DR:**

1. Call the unemployment customer service center that is specifically designated to your social security number. Find it here: [http://jfs.ohio.gov/ouio/claims-processing-center-locations.stm](http://jfs.ohio.gov/ouio/claims-processing-center-locations.stm)
2. Press option 1. Then option 9. Then option 3.
3. When you get someone on the phone, just let them know how long you've been waiting and that you wanted to ensure there were no more eligibility issues you need to clear up.
4. Try twice every hour at times that are not right on the hour/half hour.

I call unemployment this morning and try to reset the pin to get in - the woman tells me that someone else’s name is under my social security number... and that I’ll need to call back to discuss this with someone.

Of course I’m unable to get through, so I call the social security administration to see if, by chance, I share a SSN with someone or if something else is popping up under my SSN. The woman let me know it’s just my name and to contact the FTC and Fraud office with what’s going on.

I'm caring for coronavirus patients and can't use the pink disc filters that are fabric.  My facility will not permit use of other filters at this time. 

I've called a lot of hardware stores who have none, they're sold out everywhere online, and eBay is either scams or massive price gouging that I can't afford. My facility can't provide anymore filters, and the ones that I got with my respirator are expired. 

If you have any you would sell or know of any places I could call to ask I'd really appreciate it. They're used by painters, construction, industrial use, auto shops, woodworkers if you have any friends in these areas... I haven't had any luck getting the plastic encased filters that I need.

_________________________________________
2:06 PM: The Governor begins speaking

I'm continuing to wear ties that represent the colleges and universities in our state.

The requirements for the new stay-at-home order will be going into effect tonight. I've already seen a number of retailers working to limit the amount of people in their stores as required by the new order. Some stores are even starting to make their stores into a one-way aisle.

If someone's wearing a mask, that's a good thing. It sends a signal that we all need to keep being careful. Although it's not a substitute for social distancing, it is still helpful.

By staying home and being careful you are buying us time for our hospital buildout. We're still working on doubling our hospital capacity and supplies. 

Major hospitals are already working on expanding their capacity in their own facilities and/or collaborating with other facilities. We are also working on expanding health care work into buildings that were unused. These buildings must be safe for both patients and workers. They will be used for those without COVID-19 that still need medical care. Some areas of Ohio are already prepared and will not need to buildout. Please keep working to buy us time. This is all very important.

We are working with both the public and private sector in order to ensure we have the necessary supplies. Regarding PPE, if we can find it, we're buying it. If we can't buy it, we're going to build it. We're much too reliant on foreign countries. We will have to change that after this crisis is over. Once we have our supplies we will use technology and innovation to ensure our supplies last longer. Battelle will be leading that charge with their mask sterilization program.

Jobs Ohio has pivoted to focusing on building the supply chain we need. I'd like to thank former Governor John Kasich and the state legislature for having the foresight to create Jobs Ohio.

I'd like to quote former Governor Bob Taft (didn't catch it all)

I'd like to mention what has happened in the only federal prison in Ohio. Several inmates have tested positive with coronavirus and three have died. This was very worrying. An investigation has shown to me that they need help. Their medical staff is at 50% of what it should be. This was a facility run by the federal government. Still, this prison was in Ohio and run by staff from Ohio. Today, the Ohio National Guard will help in that prison for 7 to 10 days until the federal government can shore up their own response in the prison. This is a medical mission, they will not be armed or providing security.",Ohio,The Governor's 4/06 Coronavirus briefing will begin soon as of 2:00 PM

I applied just under a week ago (03/31) and when I click “View Claim Summary/Payment History”  under my Claim Summary section all the benefit amounts/balances are $0.00. 

My husband applied after I did, on 04/02, and when he views this page, he has figures which we assume would be his benefit payment amounts if approved, instead of $0.00 like mine shows. 

Does this mean I will be denied since mine says $0.00? Or is it just a step in this process? Did I do something wrong or is this normal?

I’ve been following all the rules to perfection. To the point in late February/early March I started stock piling food and supplies to last me weeks/months. At this point I haven’t left the house since March 15th as I’m immunosuppressed. 

Looking at this latest model, it seems dare I say it, this was kinda overblown? According to this model this would be a non story. I get 29 deaths at the peak is sad, but in the grand scheme of things, that’s nothing. 


I know the governor and Amy addressed this model yesterday and said the truth is somewhere in the middle, but even if this model was way wrong and it will be 5x as bad as their projecting, it’s still really a non issue. 150 deaths a day is bad for a peak, but not catastrophic. Also we still wouldn’t be close to using all our resources. 


What am I missing here, because I have to be missing something if we are going to these great lengths. Does the state really have models showing this model is underestimating 10x, 20x,?

197,197,TheDukeof419,1586370796,fxbynt,Nan,"I read this article this morning. I've thought Amy Acton has been awesome so far but this definitely gives it a different perspective. Interested what you guys think. 

...........................................

""There have been 119 coronavirus-related deaths in Ohio.  There have been 9,678 deaths nationwide with 67% of these coming from the very largest cities in only five states.  Ohio's death rate is 1.2% of the national total. 

On March 12, Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, and Governor Mike DeWine told Ohioans that there were already 100,000 of us infected with the virus.  The next day, Amy clarified that this number was her ""guesstimate.""  She was relying on a projection from a Harvard professor of epidemiology who himself guesstimated that between 20% and 60% of Americans will have the virus.  Using the most pessimistic number of 60%, Dr. Acton worked the math backward into Ohio's population base to arrive at her 100,000 infected number.

As of April 6, the confirmed cases in Ohio are not 100,000, but 4,043.  Two statistics should guide lockdown decisions.  The first is the number of confirmed cases reported per one million population.  The second, and more important, is the number of confirmed hospitalizations per million people in Ohio.  Simply put, how many people are getting sick, and how many use up hospital beds?

Based on an Ohio population of approximately 11,688,000, if Amy Acton's guesstimate of 100,000 infected were correct, that would equate to 8,555 cases per million.  Yet the actual number is 346 per million, only 4% of her guesstimate.  That difference amounts to much more than a rounding error.  The coronavirus infection rate is concerning, but it's not the end of civilization.  To give perspective, let's compare today's 346 per million rate to the total of general infectious diseases reported in Ohio in 2018.  That number was 11,186, or a rate of 1,045 per million.  Compared to all of last year, the Ohio coronavirus as of today is indeed a high number per million of infectious diseases.  It's about 33% of last year's total, and this is only April. 

Yes, people in Ohio are getting infected.  Does infection mean automatic admission to the hospital?  Hardly, and numbers don't have to be guesstimated.  Of the 4,043 confirmed Ohio cases, only 27% (1,104) have required hospitalization.  So what percentage of Ohio's population have gotten the virus and required hospital admission?  Less than 1/100 of 1%.  Yes, but what if we haven't peaked?  Even if the hospitalization rate triples in two weeks, the percentage would be less than 3/100 of 1%.  For this, the lockdown has pushed 468,414 Ohioans on to welfare, slammed shut our small businesses and closed our churches for Holy Week this year""",Ohio,Interesting Number Crunching on COVID in OHIO

I applied for unemployment due to COVID-19 on March 24, application was approved, no problems at all. I got my first direct deposit the following week on April 2, still no problems. This week I filed my weekly claim Sunday. Got a notice Monday that said “benefit payment information” and another one that said “direct deposit notice”. I have gotten nothing as of noon on Thursday. There is a difference between the “paystubs” though. The one that was actually paid out to me and direct deposited says “deposit transaction number” where the one I haven’t gotten paid out (although it says paid) says “debit transaction number”.  

Like everyone else, I have tried for days to call them and I am getting no where and no one will pick up the phone...I spent 30 minutes this morning trying to get ahold of them to just get a recording that says “we’re experiencing a high call volume now, please try again later” I’d rather be able to stay on hold for hours tbh.

2:06 PM: The Governor begins speaking

I'd first like to say happy birthday to my daughter in law, Michelle. This was also meant to be opening day for minor league baseball. I have several hats for several teams with me right not and my socks are colored for several teams as well.

We're going to show a video to celebrate the five teams we're celebrating today. Baseball will come back and things will get better. 

We're still working on getting PPE for our health care workers in every field. The procurement and production process is still moving. It's our obligation to protect our protectors. 19 manufacturers are working with several of our hospital groups to produce face shields that were built to requested specifications. they were able to do move to production from prototypes in only two weeks. We believe they will be able to produce 750,000 over five weeks. We will be getting those face shields out to our hospitals as quickly as possible. 

There's a lot of discussion right now throughout the country about models and estimates. When changes happen we let you know. That means that we give out information as we get it. That can lead to changes in estimates that may appear to come out of nowhere. The models and estimates changed because of what you were willing to do in order to protect each other. Our modelers did not expect that Ohioans would comply with our orders as well as they did. Their model was built on a compliance level that was lower than the actual value. Even if our estimates change, people are still dying and we need to understand just how terrible that is for everyone who knew them. That is why we have to keep protecting each other.

 Our team is working very hard to figure out how to get back to normal. It's not going to be like flipping a switch. It's also still a work in progress. We'll tell you what we have in the coming week. We're working just as hard to come back as we were coming in.",Ohio,The Governor's 4/09 Coronavirus briefing will begin soon as of 2:00 PM

If we are to believe the numbers .05% have been infected in Ohio. Logic would seem to say as soon as the stay at home order is lifted we would have the huge spike in infections that we thought would happen in March. All we did is push out the date, but not far enough for better treatment. 


So the way I see it you have two route. One is to admit the 5.5k infected is extremely underreported and COVID-19 is not nearly as dangerous/contagious as originally thought and we just let everyone live their lives and what happens happens. Or you have to have some aspects of social distancing all the way until their is vaccine which I would assume would mean no schools or sporting events for a year. Maybe people are still strongly encouraged to work from home and restaurants are still take out.

3. Numbers coming in orders-of-magnitude off.

In Wisconsin and Ohio, farmers are dumping thousands of gallons of fresh milk into lagoons and manure pits. An Idaho farmer has dug huge ditches to bury 1 million pounds of onions. And in South Florida, a region that supplies much of the Eastern half of the United States with produce, tractors are crisscrossing bean and cabbage fields, plowing perfectly ripe vegetables back into the soil.

After weeks of concern about shortages in grocery stores and mad scrambles to find the last box of pasta or toilet paper roll, many of the nation’s largest farms are struggling with another ghastly effect of the pandemic. They are being forced to destroy tens of millions of pounds of fresh food that they can no longer sell.

The closing of restaurants, hotels and schools has left some farmers with no buyers for more than half their crops. And even as retailers see spikes in food sales to Americans who are now eating nearly every meal at home, the increases are not enough to absorb all of the perishable food that was planted weeks ago and intended for schools and businesses.

The amount of waste is staggering. The nation’s largest dairy cooperative, Dairy Farmers of America, estimates that farmers are dumping as many as 3.7 million gallons of milk each day. A single chicken processor is smashing 750,000 unhatched eggs every week.

Many farmers say they have donated part of the surplus to food banks and Meals on Wheels programs, which have been overwhelmed with demand. But there is only so much perishable food that charities with limited numbers of refrigerators and volunteers can absorb.",Ohio,US farms are destroying millions of pounds of food

Reason being is that since there's no widespread testing, there's really no way to know how many more people have the virus that aren't being reported. Could be 10 more, could be 10,000.

But a much more reliable number to look at would be hospitalizations, as we should know just about everyone who is being admitted due to covid. So if you want to know how we are doing in Ohio and as a country in general, take the number of additional hospitalizations. Once that number remains close to no change per day, that would mean enough people are either getting released, or dying, which would suggest an apex as cases should begin going down at that point.

But based on how cases popped up all around the state at the same time once testing began, doesn't that mean community transmission had been happening for a longer period of time?  Even Dr. Acton stated early on that there were many more cases already in Ohio than what was being reported (I believe she said up to 100,000 at that time?).  So my question is why it seems like neither the unmitigated nor the mitigated model seem to take this into account?

I was directed to talk to someone in our units legal department which I did but because of all this coronavirus stuff haven’t received back an email and I doubt I ever will.

424,424,xkisses,1586799107,g0niwq,Nan,"This is my S.O.'s workplace - they're a small sales &amp; manufacturing business, and considered non-essential. He's been there for 17 years. There's about 10 employees total, and everyone was laid off when the stay-at-home order was issued.

My S.O. has since successfully filed for unemployment and is receiving benefits, along with the rest of his coworkers.

Recently, the owner (lives out-of-state) has asked the office employees (that includes my S.O.) to log in from home and clear online orders, return voicemails, etc., mark their hours worked on a time sheet, and the owner will then pay them in PTO once this is over and everyone is re-hired. He has also asked the warehouse workers to come in to the warehouse and process (manufacture/ship) orders, with the same promise of being paid in PTO in the future.

Unsurprisingly, no one stepped up but for 1-2 people.

This has prompted several increasingly nasty emails from the owner to his employees. The most recent one says: 1.) not to worry about the virus (chance of transmission is small, rather get the bug now anyway, chances of hospital admission is small), 2.) not to worry about ODJFS finding out about people working while collecting unemployment (he will take care of it and cover any UE benefits lost if they find out), and 3.) threatens to take away their quarterly bonuses if they don't ""step up"".

Further, he says that employees that aren't returning his calls are not only putting their bonuses at risk, but also their job. (they're *laid off*, right? As in, don't have a job? As in, not expected to return phone calls from their former boss?)

I'm asking here because I'm not too familiar with employment laws, but IIRC they're pretty lax/nonexistent with worker protection in Ohio. However, it seems pretty awful that a business owner is doing this to compel his employees to work under the radar during a stay-at-home order.  

Does anyone have any advice for this situation?

Edit - he's already saving every email, voicemail, and text; started doing that right away. Just not sure what to do with it, if anything. I'll head over to /r/legaladvice, too.

Edit 2: /r/legaladvice has it on their FAQ - FYI to anyone else who may find themselves in a similar situation:  ""If you're receiving an ultimatum from your employer, *whether it's working at all, or not working from home, or working without proper gear, or working at risk of exposure*, you will have to make a decision whether to follow it or not. If you don't comply with what the employer wants, yes, they can fire you. We cannot tell you right now if it's possible you'll have a lawsuit or other remedy later on. We don't know. Nobody knows. We are in an unprecedented situation, and it will not only depend on how the law develops but also very fact-specific inquires.""",Ohio,"Boss threatening future bonuses if employees don't come into work ""under the table"" during pandemic...advice?"

2:05 PM: The Governor begins speaking

I'm wearing a tie representing the University of Rio Grande today.

I want to thank all of our churches that did their services via the internet or other methods. My family used Zoom to interact with all of our family members.

I want to thank the General Assembly. They approved funding of 8.8 million dollars for the build-out of our hospitals. 

We've heard that many private companies have been purchasing rapid tests for their employees and customers. I want to caution them on buying them. You should ensure that your tests are FDA-approved to ensure their reliability.

Several members of the Ohio National Guard are still in the only federal facility in Ohio. The Ohio National Guard will also be providing additional medical help to one of our state prisons. They will largely be focusing on non-COVID illnesses. Unfortunately, another inmate has died with a positive test of COVID-19.

We took action to protect our nursing homes early on in this crisis. We know that the elderly, especially those in nursing homes, are extremely at risk of death from COVID-19. Amy Acton will be signing an order that requires nursing homes to inform the families of patients if anyone in their facility has tested positive, including staff. We will also be publishing our own report on nursing homes that have confirmed cases of COVID-19.

We're asking all Ohioans to reach out to five people that they haven't spoken to because of this crisis. 

We are issuing the following order, we are restricting the sale of liquor to those who are citizens of the state of Ohio in order to prevent citizens from Pennsylvania from coming into the state and buying liquor. Anyone who wishes to purchase liquor must prevent an Ohio license or additional information that proves they reside in Ohio. Pennsylvania closed down their liquor stores and we are now taking action to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through that vector.

2:19 PM: The Lieutenant Governor starts speaking

We are working hard to get further funding to our Ohio food banks. We have found enough to fund them for quite some time already. This problem is not solved in the long-run, please continue donating to them as this crisis continues. 

I challenged my team to get better at communicating regarding updates about the unemployment system. We hope that this will improve customer service for all claimants. 

There are still over 40,000 jobs from 642 employers who need workers as soon as possible.

Two weeks from today is the final date to send in your ballots. You can still request your ballots over the internet or calling your local board of elections. You will be able to track the ballot to ensure it will be counted. 

Thank you to all of our businesses who are giving us feedback as to how our orders are affecting you. We appreciate those businesses that have been incredibly collaborative with us in ensuring a safe workplace for their employees. We're building protocols and strategies based on your recommendations

2:27 PM: Amy Acton starts speaking

6,881 confirmed cases (with 94 extra probable cases), 268/6,881 confirmed deaths (with 6 extra probable deaths), 2,033 hospitalizations, 613/2,033 in the ICU, 1,449 of the infected were health care workers. 65,112 tested in total.

Our trend for the past five days has been fairly steady.

We are doing an order today to keep families educated on the danger in nursing homes. 

We have great leadership working on improving our reaction to the virus in our prisons and elsewhere. We've been working together with groups within Ohio and outside of Ohio in order to keep everyone safe. Whenever there's an outbreak our state task forces have been working with local health departments to take action as quickly as possible. They are working tirelessly on behalf of the people we love. I want you to know that even if a nursing home has had a patient test positive, keep in mind that anyone can be spreading the virus without symptoms. It is not the nursing home's fault in most cases. There is a lot of stigma and fear that we expect will increase as we report this but we hope that you will help us move away from that.  

We have been working in both the public and private sector to decide exactly what our next step is. This is not going to be like flipping a switch. We're still on-call constantly with our partners in order to move on but keep us safe. Don your masks and don your capes. These masks are starting to be seen in many of our studies to be another weapon that will help us return to normal. Even our top businesses understand that masks and other new options will be essential for a safe workplace.

We are working to help our vulnerable populations be safe and represented in this process.

2:37 PM: Question period begins

Where is the CARE Act money that should be going to 1099 workers? Why are there still roadblocks in the unemployment process?

Lieutenant Governor: I cannot give out information on the CARE Act money until I have been fully informed on the situation. I hope to have that information as soon as possible. We are constantly making improvements to the unemployment process but we have seen that a lot of the issues that have been seen throughout this crisis has been due to problems with mismatched information.
________________________________________________________________________________________
2:39 PM: Who will be making the decision to open the state back up? 

Governor: Whatever rules I put in place, people will still have to feel safe enough to actually go out. I have tried to get the best information from the best experts. I have gotten advice from my medical advisory group along with our business advisory group. They both give me the information I need to make decisions that are good for everyone in the state. We are speaking to the federal government and other state governments to make sure the process is coordinated correctly. It is a work in progress but I think you and everyone throughout the country will find our plan to be rational and well-informed.

Lieutenant Governor: I think it's very clear that our actions have been good for the state.
________________________________________________________________________________________
2:43 PM: Why have you reversed your decision to not inform the public which nursing homes have confirmed cases?

Governor: I made that decision myself because I felt it was important to keep the public informed.
___________________________________________________________
2:43 PM: Where was the prisoner that died located when he died? In prison? Or in a medical facility? What is the current situation in prisons?

Governor: I don't currently have that information. 

Our Prison Director has a lot of experience in keeping the prison population healthy. There was no way to keep COVID-19 outside of the prison system. We kept it out as long as we could but it is true that there have been confirmed cases now. I ask the director daily what more we can do to keep them safe. I also speak to our other directors to see what more we can do in other situations.
_________________________________________________________________________________
2:46 PM: Do you have any knowledge on inmates being placed in solitary confinement rather than receiving treatment after showing symptoms of the coronavirus? Do you plan to release more prisoners?

Governor: I am still looking into releasing more inmates as is possible. I want to ensure that the communities around the prisons are kept safe. 

I will have to speak to the director about the solitary confinement issue. They definitely need to be separated from the rest of the prison population. The Director is making those decisions to keep everyone safe
_________________________________________________________________________________
Lieutenant Governor: We have someone on the line speaking about the CARE Act

We plan to have the CARE Act money out in the next few weeks. 
_________________________________________________________________________________
2:50 PM: More and more Ohio lawmakers are calling for easing of restrictions and opening up of the economy. Have they gotten in contact with you? There has been a recommendation that the less hard hit areas be opened. Are you planning on doing that? How close are you to being able to do widespread testing?

Governor: I welcome their comments and thoughts. My line is always open either online or over the phone. The Lieutenant Governor has also been fielding calls from businesses throughout the state. We take that into consideration. We have to do all of this safely and without allowing for hot spots to develop. 

As I said, we are looking into these recommendations but with our current testing ability, I cannot see it happening soon. When we get improved testing, more actions can be taken. We know we have community spread throughout the state and none of the state is safe from that. 

We're getting closer to widespread testing every day. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________
2:54 PM: As we look to reopening many of the states, do you believe that it will be federally led or at a state by state basis? 

Governor: Our relationship with the federal government has been very good. Our calls can last hours and they constantly listen and exchange information with us. We're currently looking into moving our Battelle machines throughout the country. We're all in this together and this is something we have not seen before. As medical knowledge about this virus continues to evolve, plans can be better developed with collaboration with the federal government. Each state will have to have its own plan, tailored to its situation.
______________________________________________________________________________________
2:58 PM: What are the current numbers for hospitalizations? Will the build-out be required?

Amy Acton: I will look into getting you that data. Due to our early actions, Ohio has had a lot of time to make decisions and take actions that has allowed to get everything we need ready. This situation is still unpredictable and if we see a spike we have many teams on standby, ready for a spike. Our capacity build-out is specifically for non-COVID patients. We're looking at giving the homeless and mildly ill places to stay during this time period. 

Governor: We rely on our hospitals and professionals within their own area. Our response is tailored per-area.

Amy Acton: I just got the numbers. There are 898 COVID-19 cases in hospitals as far as we know.
__________________________________________________________________________
3:03 PM: Can the president reopen the state without your consent?

Governor: I'll leave that to the lawyers. I don't think this is a confrontation. I think that whatever plan we put out that the White House will have no problem with it. This is a collaborative process.
________________________________________________________________________________
3:03 PM: There's talk about tapping into our rainy day fund. Is it time to do that? What sort of a hole are we in right now economically?

Governor: It's definitely raining in Ohio. We need to keep the budget balanced. We'll be talking with the general assembly about this. I want to thank our previous governor and previous general assemblies for creating the rainy day fund. We won't have good numbers on our economic situation until the end of this week or so.
_______________________________________________________________________________
3:05 PM: What sort of testing do we need before we can open up?

Amy Acton: No country was prepared for this. We need to be able to identify cases before we develop hot spots that we have to respond to after it's too late. We created a response plan of unprecedented proportions. We want to make our responses surgical rather than blunt, getting into the area that has developed infection and working to resolve it. We will be doing this by working on investigations throughout the state with testing, both direct and indirect. We're also using new software created by Google to improve our contact tracing. We'll have more on that to come. We've had enormous support from volunteers, to the point we are actually overwhelmed by the amount. 
________________________________________________________________________________
3:09 PM: The president tweeted recently that the president has the final say on reopening the country. How does that make you feel?

Governor: We've had very open and candid discussions about getting back open with the federal and state governments. Each state needs to make its own plan. Ohio will be making ours based on the latest science and expert advice. We won't be able to get fully back to normal until we get a vaccine. our goal is to make everything as normal as possible, keeping in mind that there's monster that is killing people around every corner. We all want to get back to normal but we must make our decisions based on mitigating the risk to our citizens. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________
3:13 PM: Have you given much thought as to what will happen to our prison sentences based on this, including extremely reduced sentences?

Governor: The most important question we have to ask and discuss is ""Who needs to stay in prison?"" We will constantly reexamine that issue, so in some ways you're correct to ask that question.
________________________________________________________________________________________
3:14 PM: How is it not a public record on the number sick in nursing homes? What about the numbers in specific hospitals?

Governor: I will leave that to lawyers. I made a decision on my own because the public has a right to know. This was a policy decision. 

I will have to look at that hospital issue.

AG Yost Warns Debt Collectors:
Stimulus Checks Protected by Ohio Law

(COLUMBUS, Ohio) – Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost today [alerted](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Briefing-Room/News-Releases/STATE_LAW_EXEMPTION_FOR_WEB.aspx) creditors and financial institutions that COVID-19 stimulus checks are protected under existing Ohio law from bill collectors and exempt from state and federal attachment, garnishment or execution.

“The stimulus checks were intended to be used during an emergency – to put food on the table, keep the lights on, and a roof over our heads,” Yost said. “It wasn’t meant to pay off an old bill.”

Yost said he is sending notices to relevant entities as well as posting the notice on his website. He pointed out that Ohio Revised Code 2329.66(A)(12)(d) applies to payments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act:

&gt;A payment in compensation for loss of future earnings of the person or an individual of whom the person is or was a dependent, to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any of the debtor's dependents.

While the CARES Act does not allow for stimulus checks to be garnished for debts owed to federal or state governments, there is no current federal provision banning private debt collectors from doing the same – which is why Yost said he issued the notice about state law.

2:05 PM: The Governor begins speaking

Today, I'm wearing a Wright State University tie.

We are submitting a medicaid waiver application to the federal government in order to bolster telehealth, waiving signature requirements, easing obstacles to getting care in a nursing home, and access to alternative locations.

I want to help all of our mayors and local leaders as they report what's going on at a local level. I believe they are helping me and the rest of the state with all they're doing. 

I'm going to have Andy Ginther, the Mayor of Columbus to talk about what's been going on, including our build-out plans for hospitals. 

2:14 PM: The Governor stops speaking
______________________________________________________________________
2:14 PM: Andrew Ginther, the Mayor of Columbus begins speaking

I had the opportunity to tour one of our build-out sites and it was simply amazing how quickly this has been done and how collaborative our hospital system has been. We're getting calls throughout the state and the country on how to do this sort of thing. I'd like to thank the National Guard as well for their tremendous support. Our greatest hope is that we never have to open these build-out sites and it's possible we won't if you keep following the stay at home orders and other guidelines. 

We're constantly focusing on collaboration and working for the common good. Battelle is one example of a company that is doing what they can to keep Ohioans safe but there are many companies throughout the state that are doing the same. 

While I'd like to open up the state as soon as possible, we absolutely must follow the advice of the medical community. We have to do this the right way to avoid a second surge. With this recovery, we have to keep in mind that not everyone is on the same level right now in terms of healthcare and that we must ensure that they are properly taken care of as well. 

2:20 PM: Andrew Ginther, the Mayor of Columbus stops speaking
_______________________________________________________________________________
2:21 PM: The Lieutenant Governor begins speaking

I'm going to give a report of some of the tools we have implemented in the past few weeks.

The Dispute Resolution Commission has had 194 issues they were requested to take care of  142 of those did not meet the criteria, 27 are under review, in 15 there was a conflict but it was taken care of at the local level. Less than 10 have been ruled on in total so far

The Office of Small Business Relief has been sending out forgivable loans to small businesses throughout the state. It has helped 1,300 businesses so far.

I want to mention that along with the medical community, we are speaking to the businesses community in order to figure out what works and will work best to protect our economy. I always get asked when we're opening back up and I'd just like to say that I think we'd all love to know that answer. This isn't going to be a switch on from off. We have evidence of how the best practices are protecting workers and lowering the human and economic costs of continued operation. Businesses need to ensure that they follow those best practices when the state reopens so that those practices can work with you as well.

There are more than 41,000 jobs in several industries that are critical to the continued operation of our supply chain.

2:30 PM: The Lieutenant Governor stops speaking
____________________________________________________________________________
2:30 PM: Amy Acton starts speaking

We hope that we've reached our plateau and hopefully that's the worst we'll have to face.

7,153 confirmed cases (127 with extra probable cases), 309/7,153 confirmed deaths (with 15 extra probable deaths), 2,156 hospitalizations, 654/2,033 in the ICU, 1,534 of those infected were health care workers, 67,874 total tests

High risk categories that can cause increased risk of death include chronic lung diseases, moderate to severe asthma , obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, heart conditions, and those that are immuno-compromised.

We will be issuing a new order in order to protect first responders. We are sharing information on the locations of positive cases with first responders, while still keeping that information as confidential as possible to protect privacy. 

We're still working on a plan for the recovery phase, but we have also created a collaborative environment throughout the Ohio healthcare system, that we believe will be ready to go out to hot spots as they appear throughout the state. We've won the first battle but this is a war. We cannot stop just yet. This is a long road and there are more battles we have to fight. This hospital buildout is in preparation of those future battles that will appear as spikes in cases and possible deaths. 

Staying at home is just as important as ever but I want you to remember that while we have to keep distance from each other that staying social with those you know is still important for everyone's mental health. I think we all feel angry about what is going on. I feel angry every moment I know that we don't have the exact details of this virus just yet. Staying social will help you with that as I think it's helped me.

2:40 PM: Amy Acton stops speaking
_________________________________________________________________________
2:40 PM: Question period begins

50 people from a small business have applied for unemployment and only four of the 50 have received the benefits they need. What do you have to say about that?

Governor: This is very concerning and I apologize to those 46 individuals. I can go into the reasons why this is happening but I think what you want is for us to fix this and we're doing everything we can.

Lieutenant Governor: Every time I hear a story like this I get even more frustrated because this isn't acceptable in any way. This is a difficult time and I feel the responsibility to help our citizens. I am not satisfied. I want to present more answers as to what is going on with our system but I'm going to take another day to figure this out. Until then I will be doing everything I can to fix this.
____________________________________________________________________
2:44 PM: What would you say to the kids who are stuck at home and don't really understand any of this?

Amy Acton: I've thought about that a lot. We have to create new normals and routines without causing fear. Unfortunately, kids are perceptive and can see our own fear and that makes everything even more difficult. I want to learn from the past and that tells me that this won't be a quick path. This is unsettling at the least, the job losses and the loss of stability are hurting our children. I hope that I will be able to find better answers and I will share everything I know as I know it. This isn't something I can look up and get an answer, it takes much more than one person to understand at this time. All I can say is that everything we've done in Ohio has saved lives and we need to keep moving. We're still short on PPE and testing, two things that are essential to getting us to a place that will allow us greater freedoms. The best minds are working together on this. We're sticking with you as this goes on.
________________________________________________________________________
2:49 PM: What are you looking for to reopen? Is there a magic number?

Amy Acton: What I know and what is agreed upon is a sustained decrease. Ideally, we would like to contact trace everyone. I know we won't get to absolute zero. What I'm building is the ability to get the best numbers possible. We still don't have enough testing to figure out the total infected cases throughout the state or the country. Each day we're gathering the best data we can and following trends, while we have eyes on the dashboards that are focusing on higher-risk areas so that we are ready to respond as necessary. We will need to build our infrastructure to fight against this illness. We are at the cutting edge of these discussions.
____________________________________________________________________
2:53 PM: What do you think about reopening college campuses? How will they practice social distancing?

Governor: It's far too early to make any decisions about fall term. I don't know where our numbers will be, especially our number of tests. No matter what, when our education system reopens, the students' experience will be different. This may be difficult to accept but until we get a vaccine it will be a different environment. Everyone needs to think about how to keep everyone safe when all of these industries and systems reopen. You need to start thinking about this right now. When is an important question but HOW is the question you need to focus on right now. Everything looks good but our citizens are still dying and it's still very dangerous. I apologize for the long answer but this is what we need to focus on.
________________________________________________________________
2:58 PM: What budget cuts are you going to be a focusing on?

Governor: We're not prepared to make an announcement on our budget cuts just yet. The highest priority is to keep the essential areas that are focusing on the coronavirus as funded as possible.
___________________________________________________________________________
2:59 PM: What kind of efforts are being made to keep grocery stores supplied with health supplies?

Governor: We're all doing what we can. Some stores are doing it themselves. We're also providing help as possible.

Lieutenant Governor:  Our businesses are creating protocols, buying stock, organizing teams, and just doing everything they can to reopen. We cannot open until these businesses have completed that process. We have some amazing companies that are working globally to keep themselves open and prepared to be reopened. 
________________________________________________________________________
3:05 PM: We're hearing reports of families of individuals in nursing homes that have been waiting for days for test results. What do you have to say about that? Should families be informing you about this?

Amy Acton: We have done a lot to keep things like that from happening. I'd like to hear more details.

Governor: We have the capacity to get these tests back quickly. There is a problem there and I want to know what's going on. 

Absolutely let us know if there are testing delays.
_______________________________________________________________________
3:07 PM: How will we avoid the coronavirus coming back into Ohio after we reopen?

Governor: We're used to a quick win but this monster will be with us until we get the vaccine. People are going to have to be careful. Those in high-risk populations should probably avoid putting themselves in dangerous situations. This isn't just going to go away for quite some time. 
__________________________________________________________________________
3:10 PM: You have built up goodwill among Ohioans but do you believe you will see a growing backlash as this goes on?

Governor: I understand and see how this is frustrating. I want to get everything back open but I think that even if I opened everything up, people wouldn't go out at the same rates as before. I want to make sure everyone is feeling as safe as possible. This will definitely be not be like it was before.
__________________________________________________________________________
3:14 PM: Is there anything you can share about the increase in deaths? Is this a trend that will continue?

Governor: I sure hope not. This is a lagging indicator of what's actually happening throughout the state. Hospitalizations are a much better indicator. 
____________________________________________________________________________
3:16 PM: Clarification on the death rate that was mentioned. Do you believe that we'll continue to be below the models?

Amy Acton: I think that this is a reporting issue that I'll look into

Governor: We'll look into this.

Models can only do so much. The original models were based on no mitigations and the newer ones focused on certain amounts of social distancing. 

Amy Acton: Numbers are being updated at 2 PM and I think that's the issue. Our reality is that we're going to stay at this rate of infection and hospitalization. Deaths are going to lag behind everything else.
__________________________________________________________________________
3:21 PM: Do you believe our sports will reopen in the summer or the fall?

Governor: I don't know.
_______________________________________________________________________________
3:23 PM: When will you be signing the order regarding nursing homes? Is there a regional reopening plan?

Amy Acton: I believe we're still preparing it and I'll sign it as soon as possible.

Governor: Unfortunately, we have to have the lawyers involved regarding that order.

I've spoken to the governors of surrounding states. We have no formal plan but we're definitely communicating, including in a call I had this morning.

Amy Acton: I've been communicating with departments of health throughout the country. We're working together to get this done.

2:04 PM: The Governor starts speaking

I'd like to say happy birthday to one of our sign language interpreters.

I'm wearing a Shawnee State University Tie today.

I'm proud of the problem-solving innovation that Ohio companies such as Battelle have been moving into. We're going to show a video by two married researchers who had a hand in Battelle's PPE sanitation innovation. We're expanding our partnership with Battelle, they will be sanitizing N-95 masks for several state agencies for free.

We're facing a shortage of many important parts of tests kits. Seeing that issue, several Ohio State researchers created a new liquid transportation medium, created a 3D printed swab kit, and partnered with a 3D printing company in order to produce them. This will hopefully produce 200,000 tests for the Department of Health by the end of April.

I'd like to mention the importance of the census. We've got a good response rate of 52.2%, although it is lagging behind Michigan. Please fill out your forms and beat Michigan. 

I'd like to focus for a second about our prison situation. Congregant living situations are incredibly worrying to us. On Monday, I mentioned one inmate had died. Two more inmates have died since then with a probable COVID-19 designation. We're still getting final results. Last week, we began the process of releasing some inmates. These are non-violent offenders. 105 inmates have been released based on the situation. Each of them will be tested for COVID-19 before release. I instructed the director to continue using our criteria and allow for the release of prisoners as they reach a 90 day period before their release.

I'd like to talk about elective surgeries for a moment. Amy Acton canceled those surgeries in order to free up capacity in both hospital beds and PPE. We're still running into challenges regarding PPE, as every state is. 

I think it's obvious we have flattened the curve, which gives us some hope regarding hospital capacity but PPE is still a major issue.

There is a concern about people avoiding the health care system as we move forward. The health care community is creating a plan to show that hospitals are safe and ready for patients. 

I've also asked all businesses in the state to remember that even when they reopen, that they will have to follow our best sanitary practices. They have to be prepared to protect the health of their employees and customers.

2:28 PM: The Governor stops speaking
_______________________________________________________________
2:28 PM: The Lieutenant Governor starts speaking

I've been getting lots of questions and acknowledgements regarding the unemployment situation. I want to share with you the latest information that I just received. The entire team knows that the current rate is unacceptable. The system was built in 2004. It worked well when the unemployment rate was lower but with the increased amount of claims, this is not the case. Before this time period there were 42 people in the call center. There are now 1,192 workers in the call center. More claims have been filed in the last month than in the full last two years. They are adding more phones daily and have already increased server capacity as much as possible. 

Over this week I was promised that the process will have text to speech capabilities, add more than 300 staff, and voice recognition and bot technology. By the end of next week I was promised there will be a virtual call center, they will begin processing the money added on by the Federal CARE Act. They will have an application process for self-employed workers to get in early. This is what the team has promised me will occur in the coming weeks. This process will not stop until this is over. You will be given your benefits retroactively to when you were eligible, not when you were accepted.

I was really frustrated by a question that was asked yesterday. In the process of asking it, it was mentioned that only 3/40 unemployed workers at one business had received benefits. I would like to clarify that that situation is no longer near as bad as was assumed. 28/40 of those workers have received their claims and more are in the system, either pending or requiring more action by the individual claimant. 

We have more than 41,000 jobs available for Ohioans in essential industries.

2:39 PM: The Lieutenant Governor stops speaking  
__________________________________________________________________________________
2:39 PM: Amy Acton starts speaking

7,628 confirmed cases (with 163 extra probable cases), 346/7,628 confirmed deaths (with 15 extra probable deaths), 2,237 hospitalizations, 677/2,237 in the ICU, 1,606 of the infected were health care workers, 71,552 total tests have been done so far.

We've been looking a the trends and releasing our information as quickly as possible. We want to develop trust and understanding about these complicated issues. The numbers we see here are changing faster and are bigger than many other diseases. Symptom onset and death data are difficult things to report on. Symptom onset is the moment that symptoms first appeared, which may be different than the day they are noticed. With death data, the reporting isn't able to keep up with new information. There are deaths that occurred today that we won't know about for quite some time. The important thing is the trend data and properly comparing everything to what is actually comparable. Our decisions are made based on this data and as it improves we can improve our response. 

Talking to children about this disease is very difficult and it's something I've been thinking about. There are tons of tips on our website for how to talk to children about this time period. We are working on an idea to add on to that, with a children's press conference, that will help them understand this situation. I hope you understand that you don't have to be a perfect parent. Do what you can, when you can but understand that children's media consumption can increase their anxiety during this time, so keep that in mind and pay attention.

The collaboration between our health providers throughout the state, the government, and innovative businesses is continuing to improve. We're all in this together but it's a troubling time where we don't have all the answers. We'll tell you what we know when we know it and continue to help as we can.

2:51 PM: Amy Acton stops speaking
_______________________________________________________________________
2:51 PM: Question Period Begins

Have you thought about waiving liquor license renewal fees? Has child support been affected?

Governor: We have thought about that and we're looking into it. We'll have an announcement regarding that at some point soon.

Lieutenant Governor: We're having Kim Hall on the line to explain the child support situation

Kim Hall: Our child support office is telling us that our child support payments are continuing.
__________________________________________________________________________________
2:53 PM: Can you talk about the additional monetary requirements that will be placed on businesses as this situation continues due to the unemployment system being underfunded?

Lieutenant Governor: The system will be insolvent as soon as June. This will not end your benefits and the general assembly will decide what to do to solve that. I'd prefer not to have businesses have to pay additional charges to solve the unemployment problem but it's up to the general assembly in the end.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
2:56 PM: What difficulties are you facing regarding the partisan attitudes and calls for reopening we've been seeing?

Governor: We're going to continue to talk to the citizens of Ohio with the same inclination as always. We try our best to give the information out as we get it. It appears we've won the battle but the war isn't over. The monster is still out there and it simply isn't safe. We'll have to live with this and it won't be the same normal we've been used to. Our job is to make things better for Ohio and keep everyone educated on the latest data and what actions we are taking. This thing is not just going to end. We have to get out of this as safely as we can.
____________________________________________________________________________________
3:00 PM: Do you believe the current model on your website is correct?

Amy Acton: Remember that our models are for the amount of people out there that actually have the virus. We are not testing enough to get all of those cases confirmed. We all know that we'd like to learn the actual prevalence of the disease and we're taking steps to get a representative sample of Ohioans to get that. With the extreme social distancing you are all observing, the curve may continue to get lower. 

I want to add that the Governors of New York and Maryland have ordered compulsory mask use, I'd like to mention that we plan to institute one as well. These masks are part of the future. Our businesses are especially vulnerable for disease spread and masks may protect those around you.
___________________________________________________________________________________
3:04 PM: If someone quits there job due to fear of catching or spreading the coronavirus, will they be eligible for unemployment?

Lieutenant Governor: We want our workers and the customers they serve to feel safe. All of our businesses should be following our healthcare guidelines and as long as they follow those guidelines, the workers should be safe. If you see any violations, report them immediately. Our protocols are based on methods of businesses in Italy and China that did not have workplace spread. You can keep everyone safe by maintaining distance and giving ourselves a higher level of safety in other ways. 

Governor: The ability to provide a safe workplace is of the utmost importance. Businesses need to ensure that their employees are safe and so far they seem willing to do that. This is based on the facts

Kim Hall: We have a ""good cause"" reasoning to receive benefits but if you quit your job and still have an offer, you are not eligible.
___________________________________________________________________________________
3:10 PM: How many inmates do you think would need to be released to keep prisoners safe?

Governor: We ask ourselves that question everyday but this has to be based on facts. What did they do to get in prison? What is their health situation? You can look into the numbers and tell me to release a certain amount, but you have to understand that I'm not going to release violent offenders, I'm not going to release sex offenders. As long as these people can meet our criteria, they are going to be released. It's a question of balancing their health with the reason they are in prison. I thank our prison workers for keeping everyone safe.
_______________________________________________________________________
3:13 PM: Realistically, how do 1099 workers have to wait? Do you think you will need to increase your call center workers?

Kim Hall: We know that the amount of call center workers will not be sufficient. We will be adding more to both the normal system and the system that will be used for 1099 workers. We hope to have our 1099 applications ready for payments to be made in Mid-May. 
________________________________________________________________________________
3:16 PM: How is the situation at the federal prison that was facing an outbreak?

Governor: I'm going to look into that.
___________________________________________________________________________
3:17 PM: When are you planning on doing random sample testing? What will you use that data for?

Governor: We hope to have that representative testing as soon as possible.

Amy Acton: This is an attempt to figure out how much of the infection can be found in Ohio. This study is based on a model that has been vetted by scientists worldwide. The more information we have, the better our decisions will become. This has been planned for some time and it's only one part of our looks into the data. We'll also be looking into previous death rates in order to get better data. We'll have more information from the leaders of the studies soon.
_____________________________________________________________________________
3:21 PM: How are you working to keep the test usage equal, both demographically and regionally?

Amy Acton: That's a very important thing to focus on. Our current tests are largely accurate, PCR tests but will not tell us when you had it. Newer tests will tell us if you've had it, based on antibodies. We're largely looking into the second type. We are doing these tests based on scientific studies. We're using the smallest possible group size in order to keep our test conservation.
___________________________________________________________________________________
3:25 PM: Was the unemployment system's antiquity considered as part of the decision to shut down businesses?

Governor: It was not part of the decision, in fact we'd already seen slow downs in the economy prior to closing down. We made the decision based on the health needs.

My wife and i moved here from another state around 2 years ago. She's a former teacher, but stayed home with the kids and then worked as a sub before we moved. She started subbing in Ohio this year, but obviously, that's no longer a viable source of income. As the kids are getting older anyway, she wants to get back into a full-time teaching role whenever things return a little bit back to normal and wants to use her down time to work towards that goal. 

She contacted the licensing office to ask what she needed to do and they just sent her here: 

 [http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Teaching/Licensure/Out-of-State-Licensure](http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Teaching/Licensure/Out-of-State-Licensure) 

We looked at it together and tried to figure out the best path. Here are her circumstances. B.S. Spanish Ed., More than 5 years teaching in another state, but teaching license currently expired. Current Ohio sub license. Good relationship with admins in the schools where she subbed this year. 

It looks like the easiest thing might be to first renew her certificate in the state we moved from, which would require 6 credit hours in school (like a couple undergrad courses) and then once she's renewed it, go back to Ohio with  an active license from another state and it would be easier to proceed. it seems like if she did that, she could get a ""one year out-of-state"" license and then once employed work on the real thing. 

But, because she taught Spanish, I wondered if the ""Alternative Resident Educator"" program might be an opportunity for her. That program was frankly pretty tough to understand just from the webpage.

I am currently receiving unemployment due to COVID layoff and have applied/filed/paid benefits.

Since the CARES act passed I've been reading it over and apparently the 10% penalty for withdrawing 401K early is being waived.
I understand I have to pay taxes on this, federal and state level, I understand that federal taxes can be split across 3 years.  
I also understand that retirement is important and I am just pulling as much cash to the sidelines based on my own financial analysis.  I wanted to do this before the layoff, and the market crash : / , but the rules prevented that while I was employed...well...now I'm not and the market has rebounded a bit.   

I have the withdrawal form printed , signed, and ready to sent to my plan holder.

Is anyone else having problems contacting Ohio unemployment currently due to COVID-19? So long story short COVID is stopping me from being able to work since I’m not considered an essential. I’ve applied for Ohio unemployment for 3 weeks at this point and my claims haven’t been accepted nor denied. As of 2 weeks ago I wanted to call and see how it was going and was met with a voicemail about how there’s soo many calls there’s no one to take my call. I’ve called minimum 3 times a day for 2 weeks and get set with the exact same voice message I always receive. So I’m close to going on a month and my claims are just up in the air and I don’t know what to do. Have any of you been struggling contacting Ohio unemployment like I have? If you’ve gotten through and talked to someone how did you manage to get through? Sorry for the read but I just want to be able to talk to a human being and not a machine for once in 2 weeks. Thanks!

EDIT: Calling since 8AM and I finally got through! My claim has finally been sent for someone to review! Thank you all for the advice. Much appreciated.",Ohio,Ohio Unemployment Problems

2:02 PM: The Governor begins speaking

Jon Husted will not be with us today. I asked him to work with the business community today to get them ready for opening up. 

This will be a shorter time period as the President will be holding a conference call with all the Governors. 

I want to give you an update of where we are today on April 16, 2020. I would like to quote Winston Churchill to start that off. It is from 1942, when the British were battling for their lives. ""Now, this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is perhaps the end of the beginning."" That's where I think we are today. We're about to enter a new phase.

You have all done a great job. I am grateful to all of you for doing this. Based on the latest data it appears that you have flattened the curve. The hospital admissions appear to be rising at a relatively flat rate. At the same time, you have to understand that until a vaccine is created, you will have to live with COVID-19 in your daily lives. This will not last forever and we will get through this. We must get Ohio's economy moving again and we must get back to work. A faulty economy leads to increases in alcoholism, addiction, depression, homelessness, and many more ailments to our society and as individuals. Still, we have to get this right or the consequences will be disastrous. We have to keep everyone safe. Businesses must keep their employees and customers safe. We're fighting a two -front war, one on the medical side and one on the economic side. I am getting advice from both the medical and business communities to fight this war on both fronts.

This morning, my business advisers sent me a report. This is still a work in progress. Before we get a vaccine, no plan will prevent people from becoming infected with COVID-19. Our essential businesses have been learning from this trial period with people largely staying at home. I have asked the Lieutenant Governor to work with businesses to get the best practices from our essential businesses. We are looking to begin reopening on May 1st. There are companies that have demonstrated to us that they can do this. We'll start with those companies. You have to understand that you'll see people in masks and many more changes. This is a new reality and a new normal. Until we have a vaccine this is what you're going to live with. 

When we reopen, people are going to have to make their own decisions. That means that each person will have to decide if the risk is too great to go to events they might have attended otherwise. High-risk individuals will have to be more careful than others. It's unfortunate but they must stay safe and protected. 

To young people, I want you to understand that you are just as much a carrier of this disease as anyone else and that the young still have a chance of dying from COVID-19. Please be responsible for yourself and work to protect others. 

As we move forward, we will be driven by facts. The facts will tell us how much we reopen and the steps we take. The data on cases and hospitalizations, along with our supply of masks and tests, will be the main points that will control our response. We have to protect our fellow citizens on both fronts and I will fight just as hard to save lives as I will fight to save your livelihoods. 

We will take the best advice we can for both fronts. The economy and the health of our citizens are linked intrinsically. I want everyone to feel safe to go out to shop and do what they need to. This is a new thing and it's tough but I think we can do this.

2:24 PM: The Governor stops speaking
_____________________________________________________________________________
2:25 PM: Amy Acton starts speaking

It has been an absolute honor to serve alongside the Governor. We still have an obligation to your health and well-being. This can be physical, mental, and economic sickness. I understand that this is wearing all of us down, I am very optimistic because I've seen just how well we've done so far. 

8,239 confirmed cases (with 175 extra probable cases), 373/8,239 confirmed deaths (with 16 extra probable deaths), 2,331 hospitalizations, 707/2,331 in the ICU, 1,729 of the infected were health-care workers, 826 of the infected were living in long-term care facilities, 74,840 tested in total.

You're hearing a lot about the path ahead. Our team has been putting together a series of phases to facilitate our reopening. There's a lot of things you can do to help us do well again. Keep up your hygiene and wear masks if you can. If you're feeling angry or afraid about all this, I want you to know that you shouldn't blame yourself. This is a hard time and I feel the same way.

2:33 PM: Amy Acton stops speaking
________________________________________________________________________
2:33 PM: Question Period Begins

Would you consider issuing an order requiring that everyone wear masks? At least in stores?

Governor: I want to highly recommend the wearing at masks while out in public. Our team have all been wearing masks and I strongly suggest you do the same. Some might not have masks but there are many options that can help protect others. 
______________________________________________________________________________
2:35 PM: What do you expect to do on May 1st? Will businesses have to apply to reopen? Will Schools reopen? Will the stay-at-home order end?

Governor: I will be dealing with schools next week but the rest are still in the final planning phases. I'll be sharing everything with you when I can. 
____________________________________________________________________________________
2:36 PM: What are the prison numbers? Will inmates released from prison be given housing?

Governor: I don't have numbers right now but I have to say that the Director has done a great job in keeping them safe while she could. General Harris of the Ohio National Guard has been working on building more space to keep everyone safe and secure. The inmates we released would have been released in 90 days anyways. They aren't being released without help or testing. They are being tested for COVID-19 before release.
______________________________________________________________________________________
2:39 PM: Do you have any information on neighboring states reopening?

Governor: I talk to other Governors a lot. We are working with Indiana and Kentucky especially but we are working with the entire Great Lakes region. We're all in contact and share our ideas.
____________________________________________________________________________________
2:40 PM: Nursing home deaths and illnesses in specific hospitals are not being released. Can you really say that's transparent? 

Governor: I'll look into that.
_______________________________________________________________________________
2:42 PM: Do you believe large events will be open in the summer?

Governor: I love county fairs and other events like that more than anyone but I don't have an answer on that. Large events are pretty problematic for keeping the monster of COVID-19 from spreading. When everyone is in such small facilities in large groups, it's hard to keep everyone safe and that's something that will weigh heavily on our decisions.

Amy Acton: There's science behind all of our decisions. This is a novel virus and the world is learning together. There are still unknowns but what we do know is that this virus' incubation period is long. That necessitates small moves that allow us to pay attention to how much of an impact they have. These moves will likely occur over 2 or 3 weeks. 

Governor: From our perspective, new information and discoveries can occur at any time, and change our minds. Nothing is cast in stone at this point because we simply don't know. We have to make the best choices and the best decisions based on our limited information. We hope that means further opening and doing things we want to do.
_________________________________________________________________________________ 
2:48 PM: Should people start to view our higher case totals as a reflection of testing rather than a danger?

Amy Acton: This is exactly the case. As more tests go out, we are able to find more asymptomatic cases. It's very humbling to say that I cannot give definite answers at all times. Everything can change in a moment but I hope we can give context to all of our decisions and data reporting.
________________________________________________________________________________
2:50 PM: Michigan has issued an order to have people with multiple homes stay in one home at one time. Do you plan on doing that?

Governor: I'd recommend not doing it but beyond that I haven't really felt the need to do it. The clearest answer I can give is ""We'll see.""
_____________________________________________________________________________________
2:51 PM:  What can you say about the state's commitment to continuing representative testing that will help us understand the prevalence of COVID-19 in Ohio?

Amy Acton: We're working on that in every way we can. We're getting help from the federal government as well. We're expanding our testing and are already working on getting representative samples of the population as soon as possible. We will learn a lot more as time goes on, as we can look back and better understand the history of the infection's spread. 
_______________________________________________________________________________________
2:54 PM: What are some things that we might be able to see early?

Governor: Opening up the hospitals more is something we've been working on. Businesses that have shown their ability to follow the proper guidelines may be able to open very soon. We'll see where we are before making those decision.
___________________________________________________________________________________
2:56 PM: Are you planning on using contact tracing apps? What of the privacy concerns?

Governor: Yes and we are looking into the privacy concerns.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
2:56 PM: Is there any message for those being kept on hold while attempting to get unemployment?

Governor: We're looking at that issue and speaking directly to the team responsible every single day. 
______________________________________________________________________________________
2:57 PM: How have you reassured politicians in the state that it isn't time to reopen just yet?

Governor: I'd like to say that we have a plan to get Ohio back to our new normal as soon as possible. That process will begin on May 1st. We will not open completely on May 1st. We're only getting started. We have to ensure that everyone is as safe as possible. It does no good to open up without a society that feels confident to go out.

564,564,gabora94,1587063612,g2l71q,Nan,"So the past 4 days 7am till 7pm I have been non stop calling. I've had multiple issues. I wasn't employed starting march 13th. Filed for unemployment march 27th. Put in two separate claims (both on sunday) for the 4th of April and for the 12th of april.I still had nothing. Claim view shows pending with $0 and as you know its a hassle to get a hold of someone. I did get lucky 2 times. One time on april 15th, when attempting to call, I pressed 1 for english, Pressed 4 for further questions, and then pressed 8 for further questions. Took me way too many phone calls to count. The first time I got through I explained to the person that my correspondence inbox had a red envelope that had me fill out information about my college. Also, I had those 2 pending claims with $0. She said that I filled everything out correctly and claimed to have fixed the situation and that tomorrow (april 16th) I should see my money back payed for both claims and it will take 1-2 days to go into my direct deposit.......well, that was not the case. I wake up april 16th (today) to see yet ANOTHER correspondence letter has been applied. This one says ""UI initial allowed"" and when I ooked at my pending $0 claims, they have now stated that both are ""break in claim"" with $0. So today I called at 7am. Called about 30 or more times with the method I had. Got through luckily, and was told that ""this is odd"" and eventually that person had me giving them all my information again. I also had to re-do my whole application with her asking me questions. Now, at the end of all this it had been about 30 minutes or a little more of talking, exchanging, and giving personal information. She then tells me once again (like the last phone call) that tomorrow I will get my back pay and it will take 1-2 business days to go into my account. Nothing was explained about how my claim will look because she said I won't see anything until the next day (over night) from when we just talked. So far my claims still say ""break claim"" and still at $0. My correspondence inbox still resume to be stating that there is a ""UI initial allowed"" that I can't open. So I will just wait until tomorrow again. Like I said, I have been at this for 4 days non-stop and its literally mentally draining and I need income like everyone else. My problem is like, dude I've gotten through 2 times. I've been told its fixed 2 times. If it doesn't work this time..... do I keep trying? I don't know if anyone else had a problem like this. As of now I'm crossing my fingers and I'm mentally defeated and disturbed from that man's dam voice telling me they are experiencing high call volumes. Any advice? or is there someone with the same experience that can let me know of this has happening to them? feel free to reach out. Thanks.",Ohio,[OHIO] unemployment issues.

2:02 PM: The Governor starts speaking

I'm wearing a pin from the Toledo Mud Hens and a tie from the Akron Rubber Ducks.

I'd like to mention that on this day in 1964, Julie Mock,. the first woman to pilot an aircraft around the world, completed her record-breaking flight. 

Dr. Amy Acton has won the Spirit of Columbus award that was created based on that historic flight.

I've heard people say that the state is opening up completely on May 1st and I've heard people say that nothing will change on May 1st. Neither of those ideas are true. I'm going into what we hope our plan will be able to do. We've flattened the curve and now we can start reopening. As we talk about starting this process, we know we must protect employees and customers. Every decisions flows from that thought. Businesses are going to have to create a safe workplace in order to create a supply of workers and a demand for their products or services. Opening up won't do any good if businesses cannot successfully do that. 

In the businesses we plan to reopen you will likely see distancing, with the norm being six feet. Employees will likely be wearing masks and gloves. Barriers will be set up where appropriate to prevent access to areas where distancing cannot occur. Mass sanitation of surfaces will occur. Staggered arrival and lunch times for employees will begin to be observed. Employees will be working from home when possible. Employees will be checked for signs of disease before entering the workplace. These are the best practices we have learned from Italy and China. 

It is important to remember that due to our limited testing, it is important to consider people around us to be positive for COVID-19. In our prisons, 152 inmates in one dorm tested positive but 60 of them had no symptoms. That's a worrying number. We can't say that it's a typical amount of asymptomatic cases but if it is something we see outside the prisons it would be dangerous.

I am allowing 7 commutations for prisoners but denying more than 80. Those we are allowing out will have their names released to the media in order to ensure transparency.

The president mentioned that every state will have to do this differently and that's absolutely correct. We're working closely with Kentucky and Indiana to compare our notes so to speak. We're also working closely with several of the Great Lakes States as well to do the same. Our plan will be by Ohioans for Ohioans. 

2:21 PM: The Governor stops speaking
_______________________________________________________________________________________
2:21 PM: The Lieutenant Governor starts speaking

We've been talking to as many people as possible to talk about how we plan to reopen. As we gather information, it's hard to integrate it all together but we're working to figure out what the best options will be for each unique business situation. Our plans will be released before May 1st.

This restart will be a balancing act between keeping the economy and our businesses operating, while protecting the most vulnerable, and ensuring that our health guidelines are followed. We need to live safely until a vaccine is prepared. We believe we have the information we need to make this work.

2:27 PM: The Lieutenant Governor stops speaking
_____________________________________________________________________________________
2:27 PM: Amy Acton starts speaking

8,858 confirmed cases (with 249 extra probable cases), 401/8,858 confirmed deaths (with 17 extra probable deaths), 2,424 hospitalizations, 740/2,424 in the ICU, 1,853 of the infected were health care workers, 77,677 tested in total

I want to say thank you to everyone for the honor of The Spirit of Columbus award. I'm not really sure if I deserve it but I suppose that's pretty typical. The people who gave me this award are those who I look to for the best possible advice and I truly respect them. Ohio as a state seems to have a highly collaborative private and public sector, that has been capable of constant innovation and integration whenever necessary. I may have received the Spirit of Columbus Award but I believe that this collaboration is Ohio's Spirit. Each one of us can do something for others that was thought impossible. Each of you has a spark, even if others can't see it. You can do this. 

2:34 PM: Amy Acton stops speaking
__________________________________________________________________________________________
2:34 PM: Question period begins

More than 77,000 tests have occurred and you mentioned these were for the sickest. Aren't the positive numbers rather low?

Amy Acton: We are ramping up our testing beyond the sickest and there are a lot of factors that affect the number of positive tests. We've been working in prisons and nursing homes the most, due to the danger of congregant settings. You have to remember that the tests do not always give a positive diagnosis if the patient is still in the early phase of the virus. We have to remember that we might all be carrying this. As we slowly head back into normalcy, please remember to keep a distance between each other and wear your masks.
______________________________________________________________________________
2:38 PM: The Dayton International Airport will be one of many important public entities that will be laying off employees. Can you do anything to help?

Governor: I've expressed my concern to our senators and a major concern is local governments. If they cannot provide basic essential services, their citizens are less safe and secure, but the businesses in that region will also be heavily affected. Our local governments really need money that they can spend on those basic essential services. I will not be focusing on airports right now because people simply do not have the confidence to fly and that's what we're moving our resources to improving. 
____________________________________________________________________________________
2:42 PM: What have you concluded on the nursing home death issue?

Governor: I owe you can answer but we're still working on getting that information out to the public. This isn't the answer you want I expect but we're still working on it. I've tried to increase these types of reports even before this crisis. We have to ensure that everyone's privacy is protected. Even then, some organizations are the ones who control the data, and they do not have to share it with the public. 
____________________________________________________________________________________
2:45 PM: Is it really a good idea to open businesses when we are still very low on tests? What is the risk of a second spike?

Amy Acton: Our curve is flattened and we're seeing steady numbers. We've won the first battle but reopening is just another. I'm in constant conversation with people who make the best recommendation regarding these policies. We're opening up in phases. We are not opening up completely on May 1st. We're going to keep monitoring everything, from the data, to new advancements in science and innovation. Our health and economy are linked. That means we cannot open up wildly without a plan. We have to inch our way forward to keep everyone safe.
__________________________________________________________________________________________
2:50 PM: Could you give us a reason for releasing Tom Noe? Why would you release an inmate that was involved in one of the most extensive corruption cases in Ohio's history? How will you get our state restitution for his crime? Do you believe he was worthy of release regardless of the disease?

Governor: He has served 13 1/2 years and will be observed by parole authorities. He will begin paying us back what he owes us for his corruption. The buck stops with me. This was my decision. 

I think it's hard to be introspective enough to figure out if these considerations I have made were a result of the disease or not.
___________________________________________________________________________________
2:54 PM: How will we ramp up testing capacity? Can you explain why DRC positive COVID-19 test results are at 75% while the rest of the state are at 11%

Governor: The DRC is reporting positives far quicker than negatives and we expect the numbers will change as reporting continues. This is also a congregant setting, were more people are capable of spreading the disease in a small space.

6 of our hospitals have capacity for testing. Each of the hospitals only have access to so much reagent for the tests each week. Until that supply increases, they are held back. They also don't have the swabs, the tubes, or the liquid to carry the test. They are already starting to produce their own or buy them when they can. We're focusing on the reagent issue and are currently waiting for FDA approval for some of those processes. 

Amy Acton: Congregant settings are very dangerous. We can really just assume that these settings are heavily infected. Those types of groupings will result in high levels of positives no matter where they occur. This virus is the perfect storm for quick and silent spreading.

Testing is a nationwide issue and is a very frustrating thing. Tests are being sent out throughout the country on a fair basis as far as we know. We've done everything we can do ourselves but we do not have the ability to scale it up currently and we're working on that as a country.
____________________________________________________________________________________
3:02 PM: Do you agree with the President's criteria that would allow for opening up? Ohio seems not to meet that criteria regarding testing and contact tracing

Amy Acton: That's a very important issue. We're working on subtle mitigations that will improve our response. We aren't going to rush and we're being super thoughtful to allow for maximizing of our supplies. We can't go straight to normal with what we have.

Lieutenant Governor: We've learned a lot from these experiences. Our businesses are following our protocols and have created safe workplaces. Everything we learn gives us more confidence to reach a safer and quicker reopening. We'll have more information in the coming days and weeks.

Governor: Some of these businesses that aren't open now are working on being capable of protecting their employees already. We think this slow reopening will allow us to do everything safely.
______________________________________________________________________________
3:07 PM: Will the state be approving which businesses can open? Will precautions be enforced? 

Governor: Customers should stay away from businesses that aren't clean. Employees should report any violations to their health departments. 
____________________________________________________________________________________
3:09 PM: Many teachers are confused about schools reopening. Can you give some insight into that?

Governor: We'll have information on that next week. I'm still in contact with our education leaders right now trying to figure out where to go with that.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
3:10 PM: What do you think is good about the President's guidelines and what do you think isn't so good? Are we following his plan? He's been tweeting at specific states to tell them to do better, especially with testing. Isn't that undermining his own plans?

Governor: I think especially that his idea that every state is different. I'm making all of my decisions with my team. Our economy is hurt, as the entire country's economy is hurt. Our plan will be in the spirit of the President's plan. We're not just going to open the door and go back to where we were. That won't happen until we have a vaccine. We're starting this process on May 1st. We're going to keep everything slow in order to monitor everything. Our understanding of the data and other information is always improving. We don't want to have to pull back again once we start, that's why everything is moving so slow. Each state really is different and we're going to chart our own course just as he wants us to.

We're doing everything we can regarding testing. We're waiting on the federal government to allow us to do our production improvements. I'm going to get that done as soon as possible.
_________________________________________________________________________________
3:15 PM: Are you going to include any protections to employees who are concerned about the reopening? Will you give them an outlet to file complaints?

Governor: Even with our protections, employees will have to make the decision to go back to work. If they have health issues, the risk might be too high. We encourage businesses to give these employees the ability to work in less-trafficked areas, in order to protect them. Working from home would be the best answer for them but that isn't always possible. We're always allowing complaints to the local health departments but I believe that many of these companies are doing and will do what they can to keep everyone safe. 
___________________________________________________________________________________
3:19 PM: Parents are concerned about sending their kids back to school. What message do you have to them?

Governor: My message is that I understand your concern and I have more information coming.
____________________________________________________________________________________
3:19 PM: Some are saying you've folded to the pressure to reopen. What do you think of that?

Governor: Watch what I'm doing. I'm doing what I can to protect the state. That's my number one concern. That is the essential function I was elected to perform. Let us and the news media know if you are upset with what we do but I am doing what I believe will protect the state in the best way. We've been taking measures from the beginning to do just that.
____________________________________________________________________________________
3:21 PM: How is the state going to take care of violations within restaurants? Will it be an enforcement or an education issue?

Governor: The health departments will continue to enforce our protocols as they had before this crisis. Our guidelines have become more stringent but the local health department will have the final say.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
3:24 PM: Can you explain how there can be such a disconnect between the data and the idea that we are safe to reopen? What numbers will you look at?

Governor: We're not just opening up. This process will take a long time. I assume that I'll soon get complaints because I'm not moving fast enough. We will stop the expansion as quickly as necessary if it's needed.

We're focusing on hospitalizations especially.

Amy Acton: We're doing our study to find the prevalence of the virus. We're also looking into other numbers to figure all of this out. We're finding new indicators that will help us the most. We're doing everything we can within realistic parameters.
