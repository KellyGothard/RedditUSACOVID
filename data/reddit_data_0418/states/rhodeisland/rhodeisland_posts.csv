HELP NEEDED.

Eliot has started chemotherapy for lymphoma. This does not lead to a cure, only a 6-12 month remission at best. The only real chance of a cure is undergoing a bone marrow transplant from a 100% matching donor. Eliot’s breeder still has her mother, and the vets have said that our best shot at finding a match is having as many of her full siblings tested as possible, as each has a 25% chance of being a full match. Without a match the chances of this procedure working are around 18%. With a match they shoot up to 50-60%. The donor procedure is extremely low impact, non-invasive, and we would cover all costs. The initial ask is just a blood test to check for a match.

THE ASK: 
We want to locate as many of Eliot’s littermates as possible and have them tested to see if they are a match. Eliot comes from Chris Sousa’s Sousa’s Goldens in Tiverton RI. Her litter was born May 19, 2015. Her mother was a light colored golden named Rosie and her father was Tangloft Party Like a Rockstar. Dogs from this litter were likely picked up in late June or July 2015. 
Please share this as widely as possible (especially if you live in Rhode Island) and have any sibling parents contact us at charliehastwomoms@gmail.com or DM on here.

I've lived in Rhode Island for the majority of the last five years, and recently moved to Providence within the last year. In the next couple weeks, my girlfriend will be moving to Providence with me from out of state. I want to have a fun housewarming party to welcome my friends to our new place, but I also want to help my girlfriend explore the city and start to meet people. My thought is to have a housewarming party pregame at our new apartment, and then separate my friends into teams for a night out scavenger hunt. I'm thinking of including actions at some of the big spots throughout Providence, and would love help thinking of things to include. While the point of it is to be a night out, I'm open to any landmark type of ideas anyone has as well. I'd also like to consider cover costs/prices to make sure the night is inclusive to people who don't have a ton of money to spend, and also include activities that don't involve drinking to make sure people who don't want to drink/are DDing are still having fun. Ideally, as many signature Providence experiences we can cram into one night, the better.

Some thoughts about what to include so far:

\-If any member of your team brought a party pizza to the pregame, your team earns one point

\-If any member of your team lands a ball in the 50 hole at skee ball, your team earns one point

\-If any member of your team lands a ball in the 100 hole at skee ball, your team earns two points

\-Go to Boombox and get at least two of your team members to sing karaoke to earn five points

\-If your team is at Whiskey Republic when Mr. Brightside is played, your team earns one point

\-Take a photo in front of a mural to earn one point",RhodeIsland,Scavenger Hunt Ideas

I hope this was an okay place to post this. If there is a better spot, please let me know. I didn't find another sub-reddit for this. 

The areas we are looking at are Woonsocket RI OR Hopkinton, MA and surrounding towns within 20-25 mile radius, ideally.

My boyfriend moved out there last month to stay with a friend in Woonsocket RI to start a great new job, and I am planning to move myself and our stuff out there come March/April. We are both saving up for the expenses associated in the meantime. I'm in the midwest right now.

My credit sucks, talking about a 530 score. Identity theft being the main reason. That said, there isn't much on my actual report that's negative anymore, but the score reflects the damage that had been done and it's improving, but slowly. His score, however, is between 650-700, I'd say. I'm finding most places want to pull a credit check, obviously.

We do have two good rental references, and verifiable income that's x3 most rental prices I'm aiming for, which is $1,100-$1,400 deepening on location, space, utilities, ect. I think we can afford up to $1,600, but we would really rather not pay out that much. It'll already be very different than the $700 rent we are used to paying in our old housing market, lol.

Any advice? Anyone know of properties that are a little more lenient on credit core if we have the rest of the requirements met? Our take home / net income is about $4,980 between the two of us. We do also have 2 cats. We'd love to rent a house, duplex or townhome. Apartments would be okay as well, though.

Starting to feel a little overwhelmed as I browse for places. I know it's a bit early to be looking, but if we can swing it, boyfriend may secure a place before I come out there and then I would move in. Any advice or resources recommended would be fantastic. Thank you!",RhodeIsland,Moving to RI - Advice on rentals? Unique Situation here.

However, after working with an agency in Johnston that assists with these types of matters, I was able to get Medicaid back in November around the time I needed to. Fast forward to a week and a half ago and I get a letter in the mail saying my health insurance has been cut as I make too much money. Make too much money? How is that possible when I don't even have an income at the moment? Some of you might be thinking it has to be my savings account. Well, it can't possibly be that either as I have under $1,500 left in it, mostly after shelling out the money for 6 classes out of pocket.

Oh, to top it off? The letter suggested I have less than 2 weeks to get this sorted out through their mess of a system. Gee, thanks for the last minute notice. Given that health insurance is REQUIRED in this state, I suppose if I can't get them to address this, I will end up eating that $695 minimum tax penalty when I go to do my taxes within the next week.

Anywho, we are now we are back to square one with trying to get in touch with the super helpful folks at HealthSourceRI again. Thus far, I have been on hold each time for 2+ hours. I remain hopeful that I will eventually get in touch with them but I just felt I had to get this nonsense off my chest.",RhodeIsland,My experience with the utterly broken HealthSourceRI system

I have family living in Pawtucket who, after a recent string of earthquakes here, have offered to board me for a few months while I get my feet under me.

&gt;These are potentially dangerous nominations that have not been vetted in the least. These three positions, more than any other, will determine the energy future of Rhode Island. The positions these people have been nominated may well be the difference between doing something about climate change or simply slouching along, business as usual, towards doom.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is unknown where these nominees stand on some of the most important questions facing Rhode Island today. And some have very disturbing histories when it comes to actually grappling with climate change and our energy future.  
&gt;  
&gt;For instance:  
&gt;  
&gt;It was obvious from relatively early in the Energy Facility Siting Board (EFSB)  hearings on Invenergy that the powerplant proposed for Burrillville was not needed, as was ultimately decided after a four-year long ordeal. But **Nicholas Ucci**, working for the Office of Energy Resources (OER), never gave up on advocating for this fracked gas and fossil fuel burning power plant. OER fought to build the power plant right up to the end. Is Ucci truly the best person to shepherd a plan to make Rhode Island fossil fuel free in ten years?  
&gt;  
&gt;When asked if a plan to make Rhode Island 100% renewable energy in ten years means an end to fossil fuel infrastructure in the State, Raimondo said, ""That's up to him,"" referring to Ucci. Ucci said nothing. Ucci needs to answer that question — and more — before his confirmation. No one is asking for a complete plan, but we might expect to hear some of the ideas and philosophies undergirding his process. We need to know if Ucci believes that more fossil fuel infrastructure will be needed, and what a plan to get to 100% renewable looks like as a big picture.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, the Rhode Island Progressive Democrats (RIPDA) are already developing such a plan, on a comprehensive level, with corporate interests ready to get going. Is Ucci aware of this plan? Has he been in contact with RIPDA? There are hosts of questions that Ucci must answer before he is confirmed. Who is going to ask these questions?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ron Gerwatowski** co-authored the DPUC report that determined the cause of the Aquidneck Island gas outages, and made several suggestions for preventing such outages in the future. One of the suggestions was to ""add a twelve-inch pipe in parallel with the existing six-inch"" fracked gas pipeline that connects the Port of Providence to Portsmouth. *Nowhere in the report is it indicated that pipeline capacity was an issue*, but when I asked DPUC about this, I got no response.  
&gt;  
&gt;Being the head of the PUC also makes Gerwatowski in charge of the EFSB. As such, he will be deciding on National Grid's application to be released from having to go to the EFSB to build so-called ""temporary"" LNG facilities throughout the state of Rhode Island. The EFSB already granted the company  a two-year exception to deal with the crisis on Aquidneck Island, but now National Grid wants to take that exception statewide and make it forever.  
&gt;  
&gt;If confirmed, Gerwatowski will also be in charge of approving the new, unsubstantiated gas pipeline recommended in the report he co-authored, which can only serve as a giveaway to corporate interests interested in building and maintaining new, very profitable fossil fuel infrastructure in our state — and increase Rhode Island's dependence on fossil fuels. Who's going to ask Gerwatowski about this before his confirmation?  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, as the new head of the DPUC, **Linda George** is supposed to be looking out for all ratepayers, including the poorest and most marginalized. The George Wiley Center has been working for years to get National Grid to reinstate a program called PIPP (Percentage Income Payment Plan), an income-sensitive tiered subsidy program to ensure that home energy utility costs are affordable for eligible low-income households.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Wiley Center wrote to Governor Raimondo and all three nominees and received only one, non-committal response from nominee George. Why can't she commit to helping people keep their power on? Why must so many people in our communities face shut-offs every year?  
&gt;  
&gt;A few years ago Gov. Raimondo made several key replacements to the Coastal Resources Management Council, paving the way for National grid to build a new liquefaction facility in the Port of Providence. Back then, few people understood what her nominations meant or the disastrous effects they would have on the Washington Park community, a mostly low-income, mostly people of color neighborhood dealing with environmental racism and the highest asthma rates in all of New England. *This time, we can see it coming, and the implications are* ***statewide***.  
&gt;  
&gt;The RI Senate committees that will be tasked with approving these nominations are rubber-stamps. The Senate repeatedly fails its constitutional duty of ""advice and consent"" when it comes to approving gubernatorial nominations. OER nominations typically fall to the Commerce Committee, but I've heard rumors that it may be the Environment Committee that takes it up.  
&gt;  
&gt;The most important thing we can do is to contact the senators on both committees, and let them know we expect them to do their jobs. Contact the Senate leadership with your concerns. Contact your own Senator. *By the time these nominations come up for a vote, it will be too late*. They truly need to hear from you:

276,276,lifemisled,1580920288,ezc4fc,Nan,"There are a couple other threads I found that were archived and found the advice/information to be a bit mixed. Where I just want through the entire process, I wanted to share my experience with others who are curious about the process of licensing and what to expect. 

First and foremost, you need a physician to sign your application. Your application can be found on the RI Department of Health website. I don't currently have a primary physician, nor was I particularly willing to find one/broach the subject of medical marijuana. So, at the suggestion of other threads, I looked a bit into Cannacare. 

Now, I, personally, applied with PTSD because it was the only ""emotional"" symptom that was supported by the RI DoH. I happen to have some supporting evidence, including a letter from my former therapist advocating the idea. Letter in hand, I went to the new Cannacare location in Smithfield. It was a little hard to find initially, it's in a strip mall downstairs. It's easier to use the side door to access and the signage wasn't entirely clear from the outside but is posted inside. The office is small but the people are very friendly and knowledgeable. I went in on a Saturday morning and was the only person there when they opened. I didn't see anyone else by the time I left. It took maybe an hour from the time they opened to leave with an endorsed application.

As far as the Cannacare process, you can fill out the application from the website and save a little time filling things out when you're there. I filled it out before I arrived and just had to sign a few papers, took me maybe five minutes. Because the location is new, they were running a first time customer promo of $150 for the month of January. Call, they may still honor this. Before anyone complains about the cost, let me explain the process a little more. Once the paperwork is completed, you meet with someone who goes over marijuana with you generally. They will describe different varieties, moods, strains, answer questions, and provide you physical documentation to take home with you that explains a lot of the basics. For someone like me, who came in very ""green"" (pun intended), I found this to be helpful. Once this initial info was presented, I was taken to see a general practitioner. There, my vitals were taken. Blood pressure/heart rate. General information asked about my health. I presented my letter but it was clear they didn't intend to ask about it and considered it a confidential issue (that is discussing traumatic events with a general practitioner you just met). Though, I expected some questions in order to be endorsed. She was kind, quick, and it was very easy. She signed the application and explained that in six months I would have to return for a basic check up because the state of RI requires this to continue licensing. I asked if there was an additional fee for this check up and I was told it is all included in the initial fee. So, taking it all into consideration, you're meeting with a doctor twice and getting a medical referral for your application for the $150-$200 fee. Understand that because this isn't going through health insurance like a co-pay is, there is a real expense to run office with overhead and these fees pay those bills. For what you get out of it, I think it's a reasonable fee. 

From there, I went to the post office to mail a $50 money order (application fee) with my application (you can do check also). It took 10-12 days for my to receive a letter from the RI DoH stating I needed to go into the office in Providence Monday-Friday 1PM-4PM (I think those were the times, they were after lunch). Maybe I was oblivious but all parking was fee parking. I went at exactly the time they started accepting people. For reference, you walk in the door and immediately have a desk with security at the front. The office for DoH for licensing is on the left at the end of that same hall. I heard many people ask but the door is labeled and it's literally right near the desk. When I went, there were at least six other people ahead of me. They accepted about two people at a time, clearing us out in maybe 20 minutes. They have you show them the paper you received in the mail, a copy of your RI license or valid picture ID, and they take your photo. On the spot, they provide you a laminated license you can take to any of the three compassion centers in RI.

I went the next day to Slater Center in RI, it seemed to have the better of the reviews and is close to my work. Parking is a little crappy, just a LOT of traffic at all times but there is an attendant and he does his best to guide you to available space. Just caution leaving. At least there IS parking. I walked in, explained I was a new patient and they gave me a few pages to complete at a desk in the reception area. I filled it out in five minutes and was immediately eligible to purchase product. I'm a bit antisocial, so it was nice that Slater Center had five or six little kiosks in the reception area where you could place an order on a tablet and wait for your name to be called at the area over to the right in check out where they pick your order, call you over, and pay. My experience was fast and easy. Interestingly, I paid only a 7% RI sales tax and no other fees my first time. Slater has frequent daily sales. The rates are very reasonable and I find recreational cannabis products to be considerably more expensive, particularly after all the taxes/fees.

The medical selection is pretty remarkable in my opinion. You get access to flowers, tinctures, oil cartridges, shatter, products are provided and that you have a better understanding of what you're getting as compared to say street dealers. The 2.5 ounce limit every two weeks also seems very agreeable. I imagine more people would bump into a financial limitation than they would a product limitation. 

My only real complaint about the whole thing is that a six month check up and annual renewals are a bit cumbersome. Why not make them last three years? Why not do away with the annual check up? Just the annoyance of dealing with these things may be enough for casual users to just go to MA for recreational product where the process is literally show your license, buy your products, and leave. The other annoyance to me is that Slater was one of three compassion centers in RI that offered credit card processing until last week. Now, none of them offer credit card processing. Some of us would prefer to use cards for points, to track expenses, or just to get buy us a month if we're short on cash. Where we are ""medical"" patients, it seems odd to make medicine a cash-only business. I understand for recreational use why this is the case. But it surprises me that compassion centers aren't required or aren't able to provide credit card processing for medical patients. 

I hope this helps some of you in the future. 

PS- In somewhat related news, I can confidently recommend The Mighty Vaporizer by Stors and Bickel for flower products. It's very expensive but the battery life is ridiculous, I like the pass-through charging capability (use while charging), and the digital read out. It also handles oils with the right pads, making it more versatile than some. I also bought a CCell Palm for cartridges and was happy with it. HOWEVER, if you're used to vaporizers and bowls, beware of cartridges. I inhaled like I would on my Mighty with the Ccell palm and before i realized it, my lungs were on FIRE and I was coughing so hard I thought I would puke. I'm sure it's a combination of far less resistance on the device itself and also the much higher THC content. Long story short, it was over 30 minutes before my body was calmed down from the violent coughing. Chalk it up to newbie shit but want to give the warning about the carts. Take  a short, quick drag until you find out the resistance on the device.

On Friday Jan 24th I submitted an online registration for DCYF Home Care Orientation, directly through the website.  Automated email response saying they'll be in contact shortly.  Waited a week, nothing.  Called twice, no answer, no message availability.  Sent another general ""contact us"" email asking for a timeline.  Nothing.  It's been another full week.


I can't move on with my DCYF licensing without this orientation.  I'd love to open in September, but the process can take 6 months AFTER the orientation.  


How long do I wait? What is ""normal"" for this type of thing? (Does anyone have another number I could call...?) (Is there a better sub to post in?)

373,373,Desperation43,1581638484,f3jg4j,Nan,"So, I'm in a pretty bad situation. I recently lost my job because my company went under and due to some really bad luck with rainy days I'm really low on my savings. I'm a young adult so I wasn't getting paid very much in the first place so it's not like I ever had a ton to begin with but...it's bad now. Am in the process of filling for unemployment but apparently it takes quite a while to hear back from what I've heard.

​

I owe rent to my landlord for my room I rent out in a couple days. It's $600 and I pawned my PC recently for $200 but don't really have any other assets I can pawn out I also don't really have anyone I can turn to. I'm a bit of an introvert and I haven't spoken with my family in a while because they're pretty...toxic. Very racist, very negative, the kind of people who will step on people to get their way. Mom is basically a big Karen. And it's not even so much about I can't stand them it's just the bridge has been totally burnt.

​

So, I'm going to be homeless soon. I haven't lived in this place very long so I don't have a leg to stand on with making him give me an eviction notice...not that I would want to, I don't like taking advantage of people. He's not willing to work with me because he has 4 rooms he rents out in his house, and he uses them to pay his mortgage so he can't afford to lose a months of payment, which I totally understand. It's just not possible for me to come up with it. Between my Paypal, Venmo, Bank account and Real world wallet I have $22.53 combined.

​

So...basically, I'm going to be homeless. I've never been homeless since I was a child and I didn't think it would ever happen to me as an adult but...here we are. I'd be lying to you if I didn't say I was having panic attacks and feel like I'm going to pass out at any moment.

​

I got new employment lined up, but it's going to be 2 weeks before I can take the position. (I'm a junior tradesman who specilizes in Waterjet) but suffice to say I am going to be homeless. It would take a miracle to save me from it. I need advice on here I can go, what I can do, from other people put in this situation.

I did physical therapy for 6 months then had to get surgery to completely straighten it.

Hello, 

Coronavirus is here in Rhode Island. This is really valuable advice. Let’s be humbly prepared with habits we should live by to prevent the spread of any virus. If there is a pandemic in our future this may help:

THIS IS A REPOST VIA A FRIEND'S COLLEAGUE:

Date: February 26, 2020 at 2:35:50 PM EST
Subject: What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.

Dear Colleagues, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.
The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.
Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:
1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.
2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.
3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.
4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.
5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.
6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.
7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!
What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:
1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.
Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.
2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.
3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.
4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY ""cold-like"" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.
I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.
I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share this email. Good luck to all of us!

I overdrafted cause a payment never showed on my end even though they never took the money out, and I had the money for my other transactions I ran (also got overdrafting fees for those two transactions). After going into the Smithfield Branch I dealt with two ladies, one was Noticeably new. I was told that it was my fault and I need to just keep track of all my transactions so that doesn't happen. Then a new lady entered the arena and came in and told me I had already had 3 overdraws reversed this year (the max per year they can reverse). Upon some questioning from me we found out that those were the ones I was here for today and she didn't do her research (she came in telling me she did her research before coming to talk). The end of the conversation ended with her telling me that the supervisors for Navigant Credit Union don't care about their members they only care about their employees. I'm taking my business to a different bank that doesn't put the blame on me nor imply that I'm not being completely upfront with them. If a charge isn't showing on an account how can it be overcharging the account for every other transaction.

I just spent 3 frustrating hours at the Cranston DMV and I'm flabbergasted how the system even works here. 

I just purchased a 1993 Yamaha in December from a RI resident. I thought I had everything clear and ready for registration, but when I got there they said I need ""Proof of Ownership"" from the LAST owner. 

My bill of sale, insurance, and TR-1 form all checked out. Apparently I just need an old registration slip from the lady I bought it from. I told the folks at the DMV the bike hasnt been registered since 1994 and has been stored in a barn ever since.  But they had no answers for me. I was told to find a registration from 1994... Who the fuck keeps old registrations for 25 years? 

They were unable to find the bike via VIN lookup, but I know for a fact it was registered in RI in '94. 

The motorcycle only has 1000 miles on it. 

Am I screwed? I feel like moving just to avoid ever wasting my time in Cranston again. 

I'm ranting, I know. I've lived in 5 different states and Germany and Italy. Never once have I had an issue or been so frustrated.  I'm pissed off that I might be out a couple grand on the bike if I can't resolve this and I can't believe RI would deem such a decent vehicle worthless over paperwork 25 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

From **President Trump’s** [restrictions on European travel](https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;id=37f3923b0f&amp;e=d44cc37bad) to the NBA [canceling its regular season](https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;id=3de83404c6&amp;e=d44cc37bad), a lot has happened in the past 24 hours as the coronavirus continues to disrupt life as we know it across the world.

While we encourage you to [continue to follow us](https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;id=865a680292&amp;e=d44cc37bad) for all of the latest news on the disease, it’s important to keep in mind that there are other things happening as well. Case in point: the census.

The US Census Bureau will begin [mailing notices](https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;id=60953981c0&amp;e=d44cc37bad) to Rhode Island households today to remind everyone to participate in the once-a-decade headcount of the state’s population. It’s mandatory to fill out, but the state’s large immigrant population has some officials fearing that not everyone will be counted.

The implications are real.

Rhode Island is dangerously close losing one of its two US House seats in 2022 because its population continues to hover right around 1 million residents while several states in the South and West have grown rapidly.

But even if you don’t care about **US Representatives James Langevin** and **David Cicilline** potentially having to square off in a Democratic primary for one statewide congressional seat in two years, the Rhode Island Foundation has warned that the state’s $3.8 billion in federal funding could be slashed as a result of an undercount in the census.

State leaders have been racing to ramp up the effort to remind people to fill out the census, and the Rhode Island Foundation has awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to help nonprofits reach hard-to-count populations in the state.

The good news is that it’s easier than ever to fill out your census. Once you get the notice in the mail, you can fill out the paper version, [or do everything online here](https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;id=14437159b5&amp;e=d44cc37bad).",RhodeIsland,Don’t let the coronavirus stop you from filling out the census (RI could lose a seat in the house and Federal funding)

On Monday, March 16, The Policy Lab, a research lab at Brown University, will produce a special episode of our 30,000 Leagues podcast. David Yokum, our director and host, will interview Dr. Philip Chan, an infectious disease specialist and member of the state-wide coronavirus response, about the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We are looking to gear the show towards a Rhode Island audience, rather than add to the pile of national COVID-19 coverage. In that spirit, one section of the podcast will be devoted to public questions!

If you would like to submit a question, please respond to this thread. We're curious to see what people think the important questions are! However, if you don't feel comfortable posting your question in a public forum, you can submit it using [this anonymous survey](https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3Jg2I1xq50mPFdj).

-Set up facilities for the homeless for testing/treatment/quarantine

* Governor Gina Raimondo

* Mr. Marc R. Pappas - Director of the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency 

* Dr. James McDonald - medical director of the Rhode Island Department of Health


# Gov. Raimondo:

* **No (0) new cases of COVID-19**
    * maintained at 20 active
    * over 2000 people in self quarantine 
    * testing more than 100 people a day just at the DOH. this is higher per-capita rate than most other states. 
    * hoping to get private labs online this week. we aren't there yet. 
* Right now is the most critical time to avoid a spike in cases. Stay. Home. 
* Still working through the details on how to make meals available for seniors and students. 
    * Daily call with town managers and mayors. Every town is handling a bit differently, but every town is putting plans in place
* **Childcare Centers:**
    * **Calling on all childcare centers** (daycare, YMCA, Boy&amp;Girls Club, etc.) **to close for the week.**
    * Working to try and make provision for first responders, healthcare workers, etc. No announcement today but will be coming in the coming days. 
* Dangers for receiving communion, etc. is extreme. Calling on all services to be canceled. 
* DON'T HOARD. Food will continue to come in. There is no reason to hoard right now. 
* To anyone over 60 and anyone with an underlying condition:
    * You are at special risk and the consequences are severe. Take extra precaution. 
    * If you know someone in this position, check in on them. Make sure they are okay and they have what they need. 
* **Encouraging those affected to immediately apply for temporary disability insurance**. (Department of Labor and Training Hotline for COVID-19)
    * 14 day benefit - Waved waiting period. It's quick and it's available. 
    * This applies for those in quarantine, but not sick.
    * This is not available for people that need to stay home for children. 
* Working on contacting malls regarding large crowds. There may be announcement coming soon. 
   * ""Today, as of right now, the malls are not closed."" ... few moments later: ""I am asking everyone to avoid the mall.""
* Tripled capacity for the DOH hotline. Should be easier to get through.
* Direction is still the same: If you feel sick, pick up the phone and call your PCP. If you don't have a PCP call the DOH hotline. 
* This is going to be a long crisis. We are going to be doing this 2-3 weeks from now. 
* *Question: ""What about private and religious schools?""* Answer: ""Close. All schools should be closed.""
* *Question: ""What about restaurants and bars?""* Answer: ""Right now... We are asking folks to stay home. People should be avoiding that particularly those 60 and older."" 
    * *Follow-up Q: ""Should restaurants and bars close?""* Answer: ""We are going to continue to talk about that... What I am suggesting now is that people stay home.""
* Encouraging every mayor and town-mayors to declare state of emergency because it gives them flexibility. 
* Calling on president and congress for a stimulus bill for small business and everyday people. 
* In the process of doing a surge capacity planning for the entire state in the event of a surge on medical resources. 

# Mr. Marc R. Pappas

* Fully activated emergency operations center at the DOC in Cranston. They support what is happening on RIDOH. Including: 
    * Assisted in establishing joint information center
    * Assist in establishment in testing sites across the state
    * Assist in coordinated response for all health services 
    * Poised to assist with all other events (such as the mill fire) 

# Dr. James McDonald

* Hospitals have enough ventilators right now. 
    * 200 in reserve. Some are deployed... Not because we need them, so hospitals can become familiar with operating them.

 I always seem to see staff their just walking around not doing much. Why aren't they cleaning? Why isn't someone wiping down the kiosk tablets after use? Why are they even still being used? 

When I was in earlier last week I saw staff wiping down and spraying counters after almost every customer left. 

This weekend I watched as staff stood closely together laughing, joking, touching each other. Some had gloves, some didn't. Once staff member leaned over the counter rubbing his hands everywhere while calling out numbers. He had about 3 customers each time he did the same, wasn't wearing gloves, didn't once see him sanitize his hands.

# ** **Notes from Monday, March 16 - 10:00am** **

* Governor Gina Raimondo
* R.I. Health Department Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott
* Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza

# Gov. Raimondo:

* **All dine in food and beverage services are closed**
    * **Effective Tues March 17th - Mon March 30th**
    * Includes restaurants, bars, cafes, coffee-shops, etc.
    * Drive thru, delivery and take-out services can remain open.

    * If you work in a restaurant and if you are sick you cannot go to work. Period. Asking restaurant owners and managers to enforce this. 
    * To owners: ""We will figure out a way to make it up to you."" 

* **Restricting gathers to no more than 25 people.** 

* Unemployment insurance claims and TDI claims are ""starting to sky-rocket"" 
    * Fill out an application online first before calling for unemployment insurance or TDI. Check that this is a COVID related claim and the claims will be expedited. 

* **Submitting to the federal small business administration: ""Economic Injury Disaster Declaration""** 
    * This opens eligibility to receive low interest federal disaster loans 
    * designed to allow RI small businesses to apply for working capital loans to pay fixed operating costs until we can return to normalcy. 

* Hang on a day or two for information regarding schools next week. Continuing to work on distance learning plans. 

* DMV, Statehouse, and other lobbies will be addressed this afternoon press conference. 

# Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott:

* Critical right now that people are not apart of gatherings or crowds over 25 people 
* Stay local
* Do not engage in non-essential activities where there are crowds.
* Teenagers and students: Stay home. Don't get together.
* Food orders should be paid online or by credit card when possible. 
* RIDOH will be issuing guidance today for food delivery and food take-out protocols. 

* **One (1) additional case of COVID-19**
    * Woman is hospitalized and in stable condition. 
    * Total cases from 20 to 21
    * Currently investigating the source of the illness. 

* **Declaration that Rhode Island has community spread.**
    * Community spread occurs when you cannot immediately identify the source of illness. 
    * We have started to see cases that fit this definition. 

* Testing is important for people who have severe illness and need to go to the hospital. 
    * If you can recover at home, please do that. 
    * *Dr. appears to be suggesting that if you are showing symptoms, but do not need to go to the hospital that testing is not necessary.* -this is my personal interpretation of what was said.  

* It's not too late to get your flu shot.

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to the following shows will be getting a refund. 

CT - Manchester

MA - Boston

MI - Westland

NH - Manchester

NJ - Atlantic City, Point Pleasant

NY - Albany, NYC, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Syracuse, White Plains

OH - Cleveland, Perrysburg

ON - Kingston, London

PA - Philly

QC - Montreal

RI - East Greenwich

VT - Burlington

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Poughkeepsie, Manchester NH, and Cleveland have already been rescheduled for October). Meanwhile, I will be hosting a free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.). Some are Q&amp;As with famous people, others are stand-up shows with my comedy buddies from our houses. If you wanna watch, they're free at [YouTube.com/thehofstetter](https://YouTube.com/thehofstetter) every day at 2PM and 8PM ET. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see. 

I'm not sure what to do with all this time at home. Maybe I'll go on a vacation. I hear Italy is nice this time of year.

828,828,DS617,1584750426,fm60fs,Nan,"Hello all,

I have seen a few posts with questions and myself found the process quite a pain. I figured I'd do a brief guide, and help out with any questions if possible. DISCLAIMER I DO NOT WORK FOR THE STATE, just someone also laid off this week :(

First start here: https://dltweb.dlt.ri.gov/UI-INET-STAT/IntroPage.aspx 

Sign up on this site and make sure to choose layoff or loss of job due to covid 19 - the application consist of your personal information typically used for taxes. Info on your employer, salary, and contact information. Upon completion you will receive an e-mail typically in a few hours saying that your application has been received and being processed. This says within 48 hours but claims have been taking longer due to large numbers, I applied on Monday afternoon and didn't get anything back until yesterday.

So you will see another email that says if it is processed, once it is processed they send you a very vague page with some numbers you need to write down, and the link for payments ( If you do not get this then you may have to call). 

On the email that comes with confirmation there will be a link that takes you to a page with your claim info, it will tell you when you need to login to collect first payment, you have to go to the teleserve website and create a pin, but don't try to claim yet as it will just tell you to call in as you do not have a payment to collect until they say it starts.

I was quite confused by the whole process and was not in the best place while trying to figure it all out. So hopefully this helps, my own thoughts on why this may be taking longer are essentially they are reaching out to your former employer, asking what your weekly rate was, and if you got severance in order to setup your payments. 

So if you are seeing a long turn around they may be having trouble reaching your employer, or may be waiting for the severance info to calculate payments, as companies lay off larger amounts of people this obviously makes this whole process take longer. The website did crash multiple times this week, and is getting slammed so I think patience will be key thru this process.

Worst case you can call them, they are very friendly and understand this is a really shitty time for the people making claims so just be polite and let them know you have been waiting for +48 hours and just want to make sure there isn't something else they need from you.

Also in the meantime go to EmployRI.org and make a resume and account so you can stay in the guidelines, typically you are supposed to apply for 3 jobs a week. I do believe for Co-vid 19 claims this has been waived but never hurts to have a post out there to snag something especially since most companies doing layoffs may cease to exist, or will at least not be able to rehire until things settle down, and if for some reason they do not waive this you can have a backup plan ( on the flip side I applied for 3 jobs this week and was instantly turned down by the auto HR programs so again I don't think they will expect much in this regard)",RhodeIsland,Step by step guide for applying to Unemployment due to Coronavirus in RI

838,838,Antonio9photo,1584811185,fmig0a,Nan,"Just a discussion post. I am writing this post to express my perception of this whole corona virus situation.

If you think it's bad right now, it's going to get a whole lot worse. I keep up with the latest news from CNN, Fox, France 24, BBC, AP, NY Times, Defense News, NHK, Council on Foreign Relations, and a good 30 min scour of news articles on reddit each day. Due to this daily routine, it does not take much to say that the US, and that Rhode Island, are going to have it much *much* worse than it is right now. Many experts state the US is handling this situation very poorly. Soon, it's not going to be about how many cases there are in RI or in the US, but of how many people you know that have it. Simply gonna be a reality of it. I have a 80+ year old grandfather, and I have mentally thought, and to a degree, prepared myself for his passing. He has COPD and if this virus gets to him, he is gonna be a goner *statistically*. I obviously don't want that to happen, but this is the reality. Just reading health ministers, professors, researchers, on the field doctors's testimonials, it is more than evident this is gonna get worse. Now, this being said, this is not to panic anyone, people who can't or don't want to keep up the news shouldn't, it is stressful. Once again, don't panic, if you do the right things and prepare you'll be alright and we'll get through this together. 

If any of ya'll wanna pm me to talk to me individually I would be more than happy to do so :)

844,844,mkmck,1584817729,fmka43,Nan,"I'm sure I'm not the first to run into this bullshit, but this is what's happened to me in the last 24 hours:

Went to bed Thursday night feeling fine. I woke up yesterday morning feeling like someone was sitting on my chest. I had a very sporadic cough...not hacking my lungs out at all, but there was a cough, and my chest hurt. I took my temp and had no fever, so I went to work. I am a local truck driver, and had a run to central CT. On my way home, I started feeling a little light-headed, so I pulled into a rest stop, and threw my legs across the seat to try to catch a quick nap. Problem was, as soon as I hit that position, I could barely breathe. So I just sat there for a few, then drove the last 40 minutes home. I called work before I got there and told my boss what was going on. He met me at the truck with a bottle of disinfectant and some rags, and asked me to wipe everything down before I went home. I did, and then headed home.

When I got there, I took my temp again, with the same result - no fever. So, as instructed by every DOH advisory I've seen, I called my doctor, and he advised me to go to the hospital right away, as he was concerned about either a blood clot or pneumonia...or possibly Covid19. ( I should note that I have conditions that make me vulnerable. I've had pneumonia twice and bronchitis a few times, and am a non-insulin diabetic). I called my local hospital to let them know what was going on, as instructed by DOH (""don't just show up""), and they told me to come on down.

I was there for about 4 hours. They did a chest x-ray, blood work, and a flu swab. Everything came back fine...lungs clear, no flu, blood work normal. They diagnosed a viral upper respiratory infection, and advised me to call the DOH and set up testing for Covid19. I got back in touch with my PCP, and he told me the same thing...call DOH.

So this morning I called the DOH, and they told me to call my PCP. I explained to him everything that had happened yesterday, and his response was to ""call your doctor and do not go to the hospital"". Trying my best not to lose it and ask this stupid fuck if he listened to *anything* I just told him, I repeated that I HAD called my doctor, that HE recommended that I go to the hospital, and that the hospital told me to come in when I called them. His response to that? ""Call your doctor again"".

I feel like the pivot man in a circle jerk. What in the actual fuck is going on with this shit? If this is what we can expect from our DOH, why even bother listening to anything they have to say? Sorry if this is coming off as a rant, which I guess it sure is...but I'm fucking pissed. I've done everything they recommend - to the letter- and I'm still getting nowhere. Granted, I'm not going to be hospitalized (not yet anyway) so if I test positive, I would probably just do what I'm going to do anyway...stay home, and take the appropriate meds...but it would be nice to know for sure what I've got. Hasn't the jerkoff in the White House been telling us over and over ""if you need or want a test, you can get it""? Awesome! Every fucking athlete or movie star in the country seems to be able to get this test, symptomatic or not, but I can't? Can anyone tell me where to go to get that test, because the RI DOH sure can't.

...awfully glad I stocked up on beer, because I think I'm on the verge of killing a case right now.",RhodeIsland,Covid19 testing circle jerk

* Governor Gina Raimondo
* R.I. Health Department Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott
* Superintendent, Rhode Island State Police Director, Colonel James M. Manni

# Governor Raimondo
* A lot of misinformation and rumors going around on social media. Listen to the information coming from the Governor. It is the most accurate and fact-based information. 
    * a.k.a read these posts I am providing :D
* Activating the National Guard is not a cause for alarm. This should provide you comfort.
    * Helping with testing, logistics, food, etc.
* No plans for state lock-down, or shelter-in-place order. May be instituting additional restrictions in the coming days. 
    * This will only work if this everyone follows the orders from the state
* Executive order to allow take-out wine and beer from restaurants. This excludes home delivery. 
* Executive order to move gun permit wait time from 7 to 30 days. This is due to an increase in background checks at request of the police.
* Reminder that HSRI opened a special open enrollment period until April 15th. 
     * Reminder that if you are laid-off you can enroll from 60 from the point you are laid-off. 
* Reminder that this is not a time to go to places of worship. Encouraged to stay home from these activities. 
* Critical to avoid crowds and only go out for essential needs.
* Call 211 if you need assistance. Call the DHS. Some of the goverment programs are avaiable. 
* Evictions right now are not an emergency. The courts are closed therefore eviction notices cannot be adjudicated.
* Cruise ship is arriving in Newport. There will be restrictions for these people. 
* Hinted at other travel restrictions that will be coming. No timetable or details. 
* Going to wait to make a full decision on the primary vote.

    * Total case count from 54 to 66
    * 8 males, 4 females
    * Age Range 20s-70s
    * Travel from this new group is all domestic
    * 3 of the 12 are hospitalized
* Less than 5 are currently in the hospital.
* We currently have capacity to care for cases. We want to maintain this capacity. 
* If you are able to donate PPE or medical supplies, please use the online form. (I can't provide the link here due to automoderator taking my post down)
* Smokers or people who vape are at a much higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19. Encouraging people to quit now. 
* Plan on relaying specific information in the coming days on modeling for Rhode Island


# Colonel Manni
* Request made to the Governor to extend background check time due to uptick in ammount of firearms purchased. 
* Police departments are facing operational challenges.

CRANSTON, R.I. – The R.I. Division of Motor Vehicles on Monday, March 23, moves to a reservation-only system to continue its necessary customer services during the unprecedented public health crisis brought on by the spread of COVID-19.

This limited customer service will continue exclusively at the Division headquarters located at 600 New London Ave., Cranston. Customers are reminded that DMV offices in Wakefield, Warren, Westerly and Woonsocket remain closed.  

Reservations will be available at the Cranston office – in limited numbers -- for all types of transactions.

Walk-in service will not be available.

We ask that customers arrive alone or, if necessary, with only a guardian, health/mobility aide, or translator.

Customers should check the DMV website before their scheduled appointment as reservations may be canceled due to staffing limitations.

Visitors to the DMV Customer Reservations Portal will be transferred to a third-party website -- hosted by Stonewall Solutions -- where they will find available service dates and times. Reservations will state the following terms:

• Once your reservation is confirmed upon arrival at the DMV Cranston office, you will be served as promptly as possible.  
• No check-ins will be allowed more than 15 minutes prior to your reservation time.  
• Please have a copy of your reservation confirmation or your reservation number available at check-in. You will be required to have proof of identification.  
• If you are unable to keep this reservation, please be courteous and cancel it as soon as possible.  
• Customers seeking a reservation should check the portal regularly as additional reservations may become available.

The reservation portal for weekday service at our Cranston office is currently available through our REAL ID page found here: [http://www.dmv.ri.gov/realid/](http://www.dmv.ri.gov/realid/?fbclid=IwAR3fhMG5RAXiysux4DGLkG8dZnLqjiK4pE35CtdP4JvnbaydLxKPAAdZsgY)  
When you navigate to that page:  
1. Click on the blue reservation button.  
2. Click ""Create a reservation"".  
3. Type in your information  
4. Choose ""Cranston"" as the location  
5. Choose ""yes"" or ""no"" when asked whether you want a REAL ID  
6. If ""Yes"", choose ""CDL"" or ""excludes CDL"" for ""Visit"" type.  
7. If ""No"" (the purpose for your visit is for something other than a REAL ID) you must then choose a secondary ""Transaction"" type.  
8. Choose another ""Visit"" type.",RhodeIsland,Service reservations available at DMV office in Cranston

- Cards (gin rummy, rummy)

- Organize closets/cupboards in your house
- Get an early start on your yard work / projects around the house
- Some golf courses are still open
- Throw around a football at a local park (Roger Williams is a personal favorite)
- Play TV network chopped solo or with your spouse/roommates. One person cooks a meal per day with random shit around the house

They also have a promotion for memberships using code 'GOAT'. Membership will apply to 14 months after they reopen the zoo. I'd like to think events there later this year will still occur, but even if they don't and you've got a soft spot for animals like me, helping them care for all their residents is enough of a return for me.

URGENT MESSAGE from your Zoo Family


We know that right now is an uncertain time for all our Zoo family which includes you. We hope that you are staying safe and healthy.


With the Zoo being closed as we enter our peak attendance season – a time that is vital to our operational budget – we know we will have additional challenges ahead. 


If you and your family are able to make a gift to our emergency fund at this time, the extra support will make such an important difference at this critical time.

Donate Now

Our keepers are the best and they are always working. In an emergency like this, our animal care staff are always there to make sure that our animals are safe, healthy, and happy. The more than 160 species who call the Zoo home will continue to receive the same superior care, veterinary care and enriching opportunities they always receive daily.


Our operations team is also still hard at work. They are deep cleaning the Zoo, making sure the animal care team has every support they need, and setting up for when we open again. We all know you'll be ready to get back to the Zoo as soon as you can for your animal fix. We'll be ready for you!


Education and public relations staff are working to bring to you Zoo School on Facebook and YouTube every Tuesday and Thursday. This is an important resource for school children stuck at home or for anyone who needs a reminder to take a break and smile.


Whether a one-time gift or a monthly donation, our zoo family really needs you now. It will give our animals everything they could ever need, will keep our staff employed, and will make sure the Zoo is ready for you when we can open again.

If you're able, please help. A gift of any size will make a difference.


Be safe and stay healthy,

1049,1049,Subrick,1585683065,fsjii5,Nan,"I live on Providence Street in West Warwick, and after 14 days of quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19, I finally got to leave the house yesterday. I had to go pick something up at the Walmart near CCRI, and I observed a complete lack of social distancing on the part of the customers and workers there.

I went there at 2:00 PM yesterday, so it wasn’t overflowing, but it was about the same amount of people that are in that particular Walmart at that time on a weekday. They had the sidewalks by the doors taped off into a line to get in the building, with markers spray painted on the ground denoting a 6 feet apart distance. You were only able to go in through one door, and the other two doors were blocked off by store workers. In the line, I had someone standing six inches behind me, and the one time I moved slightly forward to get further from him, he actually came closer to me. Before I could tell him to back off, the doors opened and they let a stream of people in.

There was no real methodology behind how the customers in the building were being accounted for when letting new people in. The lady at the door just kind of let people in, stopped us for 10 seconds, then let more people in. None of the workers outside were communicating (or able to communicate, really, as they had no walkie talkies and were spread far apart) with each other as to how many people were in the building and when to let people in so as to not go over the 20% safe occupancy limit. Throughout the parking lot, people were clustering all over the place.

Inside, there were lines taped on the floor every six feet in front of every register, but no one was monitoring the lines to make sure people were standing six feet apart, nor were they keeping people from clustering together or standing far apart when walking through the store. Even at the registers themselves you could stand as close to the pin pad as you want, and the clerk just didn't seem to care. Employees were clustering together and standing in close quarters all throughout the area of the store I was in.

Basically, no one is paying attention to these distancing guidelines, and workers in stores don’t care enough to enforce it. A friend of ours was at the Trader Joe’s we go to yesterday on Bald Hill Road, and they told me that the workers there are actually actively policing people into following the guidelines, with lines on the floor, endless wipes to pat down anything you touch, and a max occupancy of 35 people, including workers. I have to go there and Stop and Shop tonight, so hopefully they're still doing that.",RhodeIsland,Social distancing (or lack thereof) report from the Warwick Walmart

I am paid off the books, which means of course i have no legal recourse or support, and i’m worried that if i call out of work or try to report the business for inspection i may permanently lose my job.

The corona virus pandemic has depleted many essential supplies needed by our brave essential workers -- many of these items can be crowdsourced and created.

Things such as face shields, door openers, and simple masks can be easily printed and produced. Some of them have been CDC approved, and many of the plans are available online.

Many people are looking to help in whatever ways they can. Although initially our governor kindly passed on people's help, there may come a time when people are in need of items such as these to help.


I have created this group as a place for those Rhode Islanders with 3D printers to meet and share ideas, plans, and builds, with the hope that maybe some of us can help create some things that will actually help people during this crisis.

There are many plans available for both extruding and resin printers.

Let's pool our resources together to help people!

Newport Festivals Foundation, the nonprofit organization behind the Newport Folk and Jazz Festivals, has launched a musicians relief fund to help those affected by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Each year, the Newport Folk and Jazz Festivals select a charity of their choice, where NFF donates on their behalf. Previously, they’ve donated to fund workshops for veterans and provide instruments for public schools, as well as various other music education programs.

However, now, some of the annual funds have been reallocated to the Musicians Relief Fund. Amid the coronavirus crisis, the NFF will provide “rapid micro and full grants” and offer financial support to those that have reached financial problems during this time. These micro grants, which are $300 or less, will be given on a “more rapid basis to cover[(read more.....)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/03/newport-festivals-music-fund/)",RhodeIsland,Newport Festivals Creates Music Fund For Affected Artists

I know that kitten season is starting, but I'm having a terrible time finding a kitty to adopt. Craigslist posts have hundreds of applicants within a few minutes and all of the shelters I've called have suspended adoptions. 

We've been wanting to adopt about two years now and finally are in a place that we can afford one and this pandemic is happening! I had a miscarriage a couple of months ago, and though we're not ready to try again right now, we ARE ready to welcome a baby kitty into our home!

I have vet references and have had cats in the past. I've never surrendered an animal and promise that any fur baby that goes home with us is in for a whole lot of love.

Is anyone adopting out kittens or have any leads? We'd prefer a long/medium hair kitty and would like a female, but for the right little guy, we might adopt a boy. Please feel free to reach out.

**Virus Classification and Characterization:**

* Coronavirus is actually a family of viruses, the name Corona being latin for Crown, referring to the crown-shaped helical capsule that surrounds the virus.  The virus itself is a single-strand of RNA.
* Coronaviruses in general are actually rather common, most people have been infected with a coronavirus before. They one member of a group of viruses that can cause of the common cold. **Therefore, while it is easy to fall into the thinking ""oh, then COVID-19 must be like the common cold!"" this would be a mistake.** Coronaviruses gained fame for their ability to mutate into more lethal strains, such as the more well known SARS-COV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and  MERS-COV (middle eastern respiratory syndrome). 
* COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2 is named for the virus class and it's symptoms. So SARS-COV-2 is a fancy way of saying ""The symptomology is that of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the cause is Coronavirus, and this is a different strain (#2) than the original SARS virus"".  
* The 19 in COVID-19  just means 2019, which the year the virus was characterized.
* The Coronaviruses are very common in BATS and genetic analysis of the COVID-19 shows that there is[\&gt;95% similarity between COVID-19 and the Bat strain of coronavirus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090728/) and &gt;75% similarity to the original SARS virus. This suggests the COVID-19 is a species-hopping mutation of the bat version of coronavirus.

  
**So how does COVID-19 compare to SARS, MERS and the Seasonal Flu?**

* As a CLASS of viruses, coronaviruses tend to attack the respiratory system, more specifically, the  tracheal (throat) and Bronchial (lower airway leading into lungs) *epithelium.* All of this is simply a fancy way of saying ""the cells that line the airways"". This holds true for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
* SARS and MERS classically cause bilateral pneumonia (pneumonia in both right and left lungs).   
I'll go into more detail on this in the symptoms section. COVID-19 is similar to SARS/MERS in that it also causes bilateral pneumonia.
* SARS and MERS cause respiratory distress/failure (unable to get enough oxygen by breathing) which usually leads to the need for intubation and a ventilator. This is also true for COVID-19.
* SARS has a mortality rate of [about 10%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15018127) , whereas MERS has a mortality rate of [nearly 35%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30244-9/fulltext) the novel COVID-19 has a mortality rate of [somewhere near 1-2%](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30244-9/fulltext) while in the USA the yearly flu has a mortality rate of [about 0.1%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html). This means coronavirus is at least 10x more lethal than the seasonal flu. This is very concerning because last year alone 38,000 Americans died from influenza.

&amp;#x200B;

**How is COVID-19 Spread?**

* The COVID-19 Virus originated in the Wuhan province of China at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. This is where the first cases were discovered. Due to the unsanitary conditions and close contact with exotic and feral animals (bats etc.) the virus was originally thought  to spread animal to human. However the subsequent spread of the virus was inconsistent with this theory.
* COVID-19, like the other coronaviruses, is most commonly spread via respiratory droplets. The latest data shows ""*As with other respiratory pathogens, including flu and rhinovirus, the transmission is believed to occur through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. Aerosol transmission is also possible in case of protracted exposure to elevated aerosol concentrations in closed spaces. Analysis of data related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China seems to indicate that close contact between individuals is necessary. The spread, in fact, is primarily limited to family members, healthcare professionals, and other close contacts.*"" [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/) basically, that last paragraph means it's spread by sneezing, coughing  and the droplets can hang around in the air in tight spaces.
* COVID-19 has an [R0 (r-nought) of 1.5-3.5](https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/how-scientists-quantify-intensity-of-an-outbreak-like-covid-19). You may be asking,""u/allopathological, wtf is an R-Nought"" well don't worry i'm gonna tell you right now. R-Nought is a term used in epidemiology (the study of disease spread) to put a number on how infectious a disease is. It is calculated from characteristics of the virus. I won't bore you with the specifics. If you want to learn more about R0 [watch this](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/current-issues-in-health-and-medicine/ebola-outbreak/v/understanding-r-nought).  The virus with the highest known R0 is MEASLES with an [R0 of 12-18](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30307-9/fulltext), while the seasonal flu has an [R0 of 1-2](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-7-30). So what does this mean in english? Basically COVID-19 is as infectious, or slightly more infectious than the seasonal flu.

**What steps can I take to prevent COVID-19 Transmission? What is actually backed by science?**

* **The greatest threat of infection is and will always be to healthcare workers. I am assuming this will be read by the general public so I will not include the recommendations for healthcare workers.**
* The following information is taken from [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090728/) review article
   * ""The virus can remain viable on surfaces for days in favorable atmospheric conditions but are destroyed in less than a minute by common disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, [etc..](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090728/#CR13) **Infection is acquired either by inhalation of these droplets or touching surfaces contaminated by them and then touching the nose, mouth and eyes**. The virus is also present in the stool and contamination of the water supply and subsequent transmission via aerosolization/feco oral route is also [hypothesized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090728/#CR6).""
   * ""At the community level, people should be asked to avoid crowded areas and postpone non-essential travel to places with ongoing transmission. They should be asked to practice cough hygiene by coughing in sleeve/ tissue rather than hands and practice hand hygiene frequently every 15–20 min. Patients with respiratory symptoms should be asked to use surgical masks. ***The use of masks by healthy people in public places has not shown to protect against respiratory viral infections*** and is currently not recommended by WHO. However, in China, the public has been asked to wear masks in public and especially in crowded places and ***large scale gatherings are prohibited*** (entertainment parks etc)."" 

**What's all this about #FlattenTheCurve?**

* The major issue we face right now is that coronavirus is spreading quickly and while most people will not be hospitalized, the amount that are being hospitalized threatens to overwhelm our healthcare system! If this happens, it means that mortality rates will skyrocket as the sickest among us cannot get the treatment they need such as ventilators and ICU beds. It will mean the lack of supply forces doctors to  have to choose [who gets a ventilator and who dies](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689). This is known as triage and is every Doctor's worst nightmare.
* We hope to avoid a scenario where Doctors are forced to triage patients. We do this by  [flattening the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html). That is, slowing the rate of new cases cropping up so our hospital system and healthcare workers have a fighting chance to give everybody who comes in the best possible treatment. We want to give our patients the best possible shot at survival! We can only do that as long as we have enough ventilators for everyone!
   * For example, if we have 10 ventilators at Imaginary Hospital X and 20 people who need them TODAY we have 10 patients who will die today. If we spread those 20 patients out over a week, we can get the first 10 in and out  before the second 10 show up! So now everyone gets a ventilator and a fighting chance! This is the entire goal of #Flattenthecurve! This is why we need everybody to follow hand hygiene, and social distancing rules! It will help all of us in the long run!

**Who is most at risk?**

* **Healthcare Workers**
* Just like the other SARS/MERS coronaviruses, and other respiratory infections, **the old and sick are at greatest risk!**
   * The single greatest individual risk factor for severe disease, ICU Admission, and mortality is **age**. &gt;80% of all fatalities observed in China thus far are in [adults &gt;60 years of age.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214079) The risk continues to increase with age, with the hardest hit group being those over 85 years of age. For whom case mortality rate [can approach 15-20%](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm).
   * The other most significant risk factors are underlying respiratory diseases (COPD, Asthma, Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema, etc..).

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID-19 Disease Course**

* It is estimated that about 80% of cases are [mild or asymptomatic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214079), especially in the young. This means just because you feel good doesn't mean you can't spread the disease. If you are young, you can KILL your parents/grandparents by spreading a disease you didn't know you had to them. If you are young **you need to take this seriously**, if not for yourself **then for the people you love.**
* For those who do experience symptoms, the initial defining symptoms are sudden fever, cough, malaise (feeling bad), muscle aches, and other symptoms you might mistake for the flu. It is almost impossible to distinguish the early phases of COVID-19 from the seasonal flu. 
* The symptoms of greatest concern for coronavirus are: Spiking a fever, feeling short of breath, and a dry cough.
* For a a small subset of patients, usually those with risk factors (age, underlying disease) the disease will progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure, +/- death. The shortness of breath will slowly get worse and worse until you cannot breathe without supplemental oxygen, but then even that will not  be enough. As the pneumonia progresses you will need to be intubated. More information on pneumonia and intubation below.
   * **Pneumonia** is when your lung is infected with a virus or bacteria and the lung fills with fluid &amp; pus from inflammation and infection. As you can imagine, having a lung full of liquid gunk really sucks, and makes it harder to breathe but you usually still have one good lung and can use that lung to breathe and meet your needs for oxygen as long as you aren't running a marathon or something. What makes SARS, MERS and COVID-19 so bad is that a bilateral pneumonia  means you have almost ***no working lung tissue***. Most of your lungs on both sides are full of gunk and now you can't get enough oxygen into your blood even just sitting still. You have to work harder and breathe faster to pull more air into your lungs and hope you can make up for the massive loss of lung tissue by increasing the amount of air you breathe in and out per minute. This works for a while, but soon you get tired and you can't keep breathing fast and deep. You go into what's called Respiratory Failure. This means you physically can no longer meet your own needs for oxygen. This is when you get ***intubated***. You are put on a machine called a ventilator that breathes for you and forces pure oxygen into your lungs. You are sedated for this as it is very unpleasant to have a tube forced down your throat. Many of those who are intubated will never wake up from their sedation, they will die on the ventilator from multi-organ failure due to lack of oxygen. 
* There have been reports of organ-specific damage from the virus as well. This virus has shown it can [attack the heart directly](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2763843), causing arrhythmias (incorrect beating of the heart) and destruction of the heart tissue itself (cardiomyopathy), and irritation of the muscle and lining of the heart (pericarditis/myocarditis). Perhaps more concerning, the heart damage can persist even after the respiratory symptoms resolve, or occur in absence of respiratory symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

**COVID-19 The State of Science Behind Drug Therapy:**

* As of today, there are ***no FDA approved treatments for COVID-19.*** 
   * BEWARE SCAMMERS. THE FDA has been alerted to and acted upon several scammers who are selling [fake cures online](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/corona-curecom-605875-03262020).  Do not buy anything from someone who claims to have a cure!
* Hospital treatment is currently SUPPORTIVE meaning patients will get oxygen via a mask or small nose tube, you will get food and IV fluids and rest, as well as medications to help you breathe easier and feel less short of breath. If your blood oxygen level continues to worsen you will be put on a ventilator that will breathe 100% oxygen into your lungs for you.
* By now most of you will have heard of Hydroxychloroquine AKA Plaquenil. This is an Anti-Malarial drug used to treat Malaria and certain autoimmune conditions like Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. It was used in some small hospitals in China during the initial outbreak. This is because hydroxychloroquine was used nearly 2 decades ago with some success to fight COVID-19's meaner brother SARS [back in the early 2000s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232869/). The initial data coming out of China in small studies was [positive](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v2) but most of it *has not yet been peer reviewed*. Despite initial promise, 2 subsequent studies in France have shown [no benefit](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20300858?via%3Dihub) versus [placebo](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20300858?via%3Dihub). There are several investigations going on across the world, and while we should have hope, Hydroxychlorquine will likely [not be the miracle cure we hope](https://www.sciencealert.com/small-trial-found-antimalarial-is-not-effective-for-treating-coronavirus). Despite what the President for Fox News may tell you.
   * **Under no circumstances should you be taking Hydroxychloroquine or ANY medication without your doctor's explicit instruction. These drugs are DANGEROUS. Hydroxychloroquine is notorious for causing irreversible damage to the retina of the eye, and for increasing your risk for life threatening arrhythmias (cardiac arrest).** 
   * It should go without saying, but for the love of god DO NOT buy Hyroxychloroquine fish tank compound (used to kill fish parasites) and ingest it. [It will kill you.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/health/arizona-coronavirus-chloroquine-death/index.html) In fact, don't buy any form of this drug online. Don't ask for it. If you need it your doctor will give it to you. **Don't take anything except what your doctor tells you to!**
* Some early data shows that certain NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen can actually [worsen the disease](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1086.full). The data is preliminary so take it with a grain of salt. The article I linked recommends Tylenol (acetominophen) for fevers and muscle aches associated with the virus. If you are sick and considering taking OTC medicines **CALL AND ASK YOUR DOCTOR FIRST**.

61,61,-_-oo-_-,1586283182,fwphbm,Nan,"I'm wondering why the restaurants and the supplies in Providence, many of which are being hit hard with sending their staff home and a lack of customers, aren't considering different offerings to customers?

For example, I hear restaurant supplies have a lot of unsold inventory and farmers are dumping perfectly good food. How about offering packs of 20lb of prime steaks to customers for 10% more than they sell to restaurants? Or what about making CSA-like weekly bins of produce and allowing for pickup?

I walk by restaurants and see them selling their usual fare with alcohol takeout, but I can't afford $40 on fancy entrees plus $12 for a glass of wine plus tax and tip, and then be hungry again the next meal. I could just pick up the same bottle of wine next door for $10 without tax. Why not sell like a week of meals of food in one go for $100? Like a tray of meat, tray of veggies, tray of starch, make it the size that fits in a fridge.

This way, restaurants and supplies can sell way more in one go (safer and requires less overhead), consumers can save money by buying in bulk, and we can more quickly churn through that extra supplies. Actually FEED people in a big way.

We're broke. And people don't want to pay the same price of a fancy sit-down occasion at home without the service and ambiance. Meet us in the middle.",RhodeIsland,Why aren't restaurants and their suppliers offering larger-sized deals direct to consumers?

Let's get into it. First, let me just say that I love all of you. You're all my neighbors and you're all my family. Because I care for you, I'm going to be direct and tell you what's up. 

Gina told us she'd fucking goon-hand us or spank us with a wooden spoon if we don't get our act together and take the social distancing guidelines seriously. 

We can go outside for exercise, but we gotta stay the fuck away from each other. I realize that it's sustained contact within 6ft that can transmit the virus, but still, we're supposed to stay away from each other, bitch, so why in the fuck are you walking up on my shit on the sidewalk when you know Gina can see us and pull up in her SUV and fucking slap the shit out of us?

I'm serious, she will beat the fuck out of us, but also, come the fuck on, we both know we gotta not be all up in each other's shit right now. 

So here's what we need to do:

- if you're jogging/running or whatever, you need to make sure you're getting out of the way of walkers
- if you're biking, I don't even know why your fucking ass is on the sidewalk, but whatever, if it makes you feel safe, I get it. You are more mobile than walkers, so you, too, need to keep clear of the fucking walkers
- Walkers, stay the fuck away from each other. Don't pass each other on the side walk. Cross the street to avoid passing other walkers for fuck's sake

I didn't make it this far in the quarantine to get my ass grounded by Gina for trying to get some exercise outdoors, so I'm going to need you to work with me on this and I will work with you. 

I love you and I hope you all stay healthy.",RhodeIsland,"Social Distancing does not mean ""walk up on me on the sidewalk"""

At that time we informed him about our delivery service. His explanation is that if everyone in your house is sick then someone has to leave to get stuff. That is absolutely not true.

COVID-19 Testing and Data Updates
Because of the wind and heavy rain forecast for Monday, April 13th, all outdoor coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing sites in Rhode Island will be closed tomorrow. This includes testing sites at:

•	URI in South Kingstown; •	CCRI in Warwick; •	Rhode Island College in Providence; •	Rhode Island Hospital in Providence; •	Kent Hospital in Warwick; •	Newport Hospital in Newport; •	Westerly Hospital in Westerly •	CVS Rapid Testing Site in Lincoln; and •	Respiratory Clinics with outdoor tents.

Healthcare providers should not make any additional appointments for Monday, April 13th. Any patient with an existing appointment for Monday, April 13th, will be automatically rescheduled to Tuesday, April 14th, at the same time.

COVID-19 Data Update:

The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is announcing 316 new cases of COVID-19. This brings Rhode Island's count to 2,665. RIDOH is also announcing seven additional COVID-19 associated fatalities. These people were in their 60s (two people), 70s (two people), 80s (two people), and 90s (one person). Rhode Island's number of COVID-19 associated fatalities is now 63. Currently, 201 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized in Rhode Island. A full data summary for Rhode Island is posted online at https://health.ri.gov/data/covid-19

Key messages for the public:

•	Anyone who is sick should stay home and self-isolate (unless going out for testing or healthcare).

•	The people who live with that person and who have been in direct close contact with that person should self-quarantine for 14 days. Direct close contact means being within approximately 6 feet of a person for a prolonged period.

•	Help is available for people living in quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. Visit www.RIDelivers.com for connections to groceries, home supplies, restaurants, and mutual aid groups. People can also call 2-1-1.

•	When people are in public, they should wear a cloth face covering. A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It could be sewn by hand or improvised from household items such as scarves, T-shirts, or bandanas.

•	Groups of more than five people should not be gathering. Always avoid close personal contact with other people in public.

•	Healthcare workers should not be going to work if they are sick (even with mild symptoms).

Governor Raimondo Announces $10 Million Small Business Loan Fund with Goldman Sachs, Community Reinvestment Fund
Governor Gina M. Raimondo announced today that Goldman Sachs has committed $10 million for loans for small businesses in Rhode Island through a partnership with Rhode Island Commerce Corporation and with Community Reinvestment Fund (""CRF""), the largest non-profit, non-bank SBA 7(a) lender in the country. Applications are currently being accepted and can be found by visiting www.commerceri.com.

96% of all businesses in Rhode Island are small businesses, and Rhode Island will continue to deliver resources to its entrepreneurs.

""I want to thank Goldman Sachs for making this incredible commitment to Rhode Island,"" said Governor Gina M. Raimondo. ""The decisions we've had to make to keep Rhode Islanders safe through this crisis have had an overwhelming impact on our economy, particularly our small businesses. It's urgent that we offer swift solutions that bring needed resources to our small businesses. I hope this announcement provides additional relief to our dedicated small business owners.""

""We have long held Rhode Island as one of the best examples of a small business success story, with an incredibly motivated set of entrepreneurs and very strong support from elected leaders,"" said Goldman Sachs' Executive Vice President John Rogers. ""Through this partnership with Gov. Raimondo and mission-driven lenders like CRF, we are moving as fast as we can to help secure the futures for small businesses across the Ocean State."" ""CRF is proud to partner with the State of Rhode Island, which is prioritizing the needs of its small businesses and nonprofits at a critical time,"" said Frank Altman, co-founder and CEO of CRF. ""With Rhode Island's dedication and our SBA lending expertise, we will be able to help many small businesses, sole proprietors and nonprofits access the SBA Paycheck Protection Program and keep their employees during such an unprecedented economic crisis. We're grateful for the Governor's leadership and honored to partner with Rhode Island Commerce Corporation and Goldman Sachs in delivering this much-needed capital.""

""Within Rhode Island's economy, the Coronavirus crisis has hit small businesses the hardest,"" said Rhode Island Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor. ""This partnership will enable us to provide additional resources to our state's small businesses at a crucial time. We are very grateful to Governor Raimondo and Goldman Sachs for bringing this program to Rhode Island, and we thank CRF for collaborating with us to implement the initiative.""

This option is for small businesses and non-profits who have been unable to submit a PPP application through another lending institution. Loans will be made through Community Reinvestment Fund (""CRF""), the largest non-profit, non-bank SBA 7(a) lender in the country, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") under the CARES Act. This program provides urgent cash flow assistances to small businesses that have been negatively impacted by COVID-19. These loans can be partially or wholly forgiven for businesses that maintain or rehire their workforce and can be used for:

• Payroll costs; • Interest on mortgages; • Rent; and, • Utilities.

""Anything that helps small businesses right now is good news. So I join everyone in thanking Governor Raimondo and Goldman Sachs for helping with these loans,"" said U.S. Senator Jack Reed, a senior member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee."" ""These important funds will help mitigate the worst effects of this pandemic on Rhode Island's small businesses,"" said Congressman David Cicilline. ""It's critical that all of us in government continue fighting in the weeks and months ahead to ensure that workers get the resources they need to make it through this crisis."" Loans will be capped at $250,000. No collateral or personal guarantees are required. Neither the State nor lenders will charge small businesses any fees in relation to these loans.

This capital commitment builds on existing investments by Goldman Sachs that support small businesses across the State of Rhode Island through the 10,000 Small Businesses program, which helps small businesses grow and create jobs by providing them with greater access to education, financial capital and business-support services. To date, over 250 Rhode Islanders have graduated from the program. Nationally, two-thirds of graduates of the program report revenue growth within six months and nearly half report job growth.

Free Trees Available, Just In Time For Spring Planting
Registration opens today for popular Energy-Saving Trees Program, which helps Rhode Islanders save energy and money

PROVIDENCE - The Department of Environmental Management (DEM), in partnership with the RI Tree Council, RI Nursery and Landscape Association, and the Arbor Day Foundation, is providing 1,200 free trees to Rhode Island homeowners this spring. Now in its tenth season, the program helps Rhode Islanders save energy and lower their utility bills by strategically planting trees on their property. The trees will be mailed directly to homeowners, so in-person pickup is not required.

""We're especially pleased to offer free trees to Rhode Islanders now, when many of us are spending more time in our backyards because of the public health emergency,"" said DEM Director Janet Coit. ""Planting a tree in the right place can improve air quality, sequester carbon, and help manage stormwater runoff. It's a terrific way for residents to reduce their energy costs today and in the years to come, and a tangible way to stand up to climate change.""

Planting the right tree in the right place is the key to maximizing the energy-saving benefits that trees provide. When planted properly, a single tree can save a homeowner money on energy costs by shading their home in the summer and blocking cold winds in the winter. Additional benefits of planting a tree include improving air quality, reducing storm-water runoff, and beautifying your surroundings.

Registration opens April 13th - In three easy steps you can reserve your tree! The process takes less than 10 minutes.

1.	Simply sign up at [www.arborday.org/RIDEM](www.arborday.org/RIDEM), and map out your house by using the interactive mapping tool 2.	Select the right tree by choosing from a list of approved trees 3. The 1-gallon tree will then be mailed directly to your home

All homeowners must meet program requirements and pre-register online to reserve their free tree. Tree shipments will begin in mid-May.

Funding for the program is provided by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

For registration assistance, contact the Arbor Day Foundation at 1-855-234-3801.

For questions about the Energy-Saving Trees Program, contact Lou Allard, Urban and Community Forestry Program Coordinator in DEM's Division of Forest Environment at 401-222-2445 ext. 2056 or by email at Robert.e.allard@dem.ri.gov.

Governor Raimondo Provides Updates on Cloth Masks, Health Insurance Enrollment
Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH, the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), made several announcements today about the state's response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

- Face coverings: The Governor signed an executive order clarifying the state's directives around cloth face coverings. Beginning Saturday:

All employees of customer-facing businesses, office-based businesses, manufacturers and nonprofits, must wear cloth face coverings when they are at work.

Business must provide face coverings for their employees. Face coverings can include scarves, bandanas, and other homemade and non-factory-made masks.

Additionally, all customer-facing businesses must take steps to remind customers to wear face coverings. That means they should be putting up signs at the door reminding customers to wear a face covering inside.

The only exceptions from these rules are for anyone whose health would be in jeopardy because of wearing a face covering or any children under 2 years old.

- Health insurance: The Governor announced that HealthSourceRI is extending their special open enrollment period through April 30. Rhode Islanders looking to purchase coverage should visit www.healthsourceri.com.

COVID-19 Data Update Dr. Alexander-Scott announced today that Rhode Island has 275 new cases of COVID-19. This brings Rhode Island's count to 3,251. RIDOH also announced seven additional COVID-19 associated fatalities. Of these people, two were in their 60s, two were in their 70s, and three were in their 80s. Of these seven people, three people were residents at nursing homes and one person was a resident at a group home. Rhode Island's number of COVID-19 associated fatalities is now 80.

Governor Raimondo Unveils New Data Dashboard, RI Havens Resource
Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH, the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), made several announcements today about the state's response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

•	Data dashboard: The Governor unveiled a new data dashboard on RIDOH's website (health.ri.gov/data/covid-19). The dashboard will be updated daily at noon. 

•	RI Havens: RIHavens.com is a new website that connects those in need of a safe space to quarantine with hotel rooms across the state offered at significantly discounted rates – some as low as $25 a night. The website is part of a wider effort to meet the basic needs of all Rhode Islanders in quarantine and isolation during this pandemic.


**COVID-19 Data Update**


Dr. Alexander-Scott announced today that Rhode Island has 278 new cases of COVID-19. This brings Rhode Island's count to 3,529. RIDOH also announced seven additional COVID-19 associated fatalities. Four of these people were in their 80s; two of these people were in their 90s; and one of these people was older than 100. Of these seven people, six were nursing home residents. Rhode Island's number of COVID-19 associated fatalities is now 87. A full data summary for Rhode Island is posted online (health.ri.gov/data/covid-19).

**Key messages for the public **

•	Anyone who is sick should stay home and self-isolate (unless going out for testing or healthcare). 

•	The people who live with that person and who have been in direct close contact with that person should self-quarantine for 14 days after the last day that that person was in isolation. Direct close contact means being within approximately 6 feet of a person for a prolonged period. 

• Help is available for people living in quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. Visit www.RIDelivers.com for connections to groceries, home supplies, restaurants, and mutual aid groups. People can also call 2-1-1. 

•	When people are in public, they should wear a cloth face covering. A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It could be sewn by hand or improvised from household items such as scarves, T-shirts, or bandanas. 

•	Groups of more than five people should not be gathering. Always avoid close personal contact with other people in public. •	Healthcare workers should not be going to work if they are sick (even with mild symptoms). 

•	People who think they have COVID-19 should call their healthcare provider. Do not go directly to a healthcare facility without first calling a healthcare provider (unless you are experiencing a medical emergency). 

• People with general, non-medical questions about COVID-19 can visit www.health.ri.gov/covid, write to RIDOH.COVID19Questions@health.ri.gov, or call 401-222-8022. This is the COVID-19 Hotline that RIDOH has available to the public. 

•	Everyone can help stop the spread of viruses in Rhode Island. 

o	Get your flu shot, and make sure the people around you do the same. 

o	Wash your hands often throughout the day. Use warm water and soap. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. 

o	Cough or sneeze into your elbow. o Stay home and do not leave your house if you are sick, unless it is for emergency medical care. 

o	Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. Germs spread this way.

I saw a few posts here over the last few days regarding the stoppage of the daily press conference briefings so I want to make a post explaining.

Firstly, thank you for those concerned about me. I'm absolutely fine (other than cabin fever). 

So there is a couple reasons why I stop doing them daily.

1) Time. It took about an hour and a half each day to do the notes from the briefings. Simply too much time to invest while I am also working full time from home.

2) Day to day changes in the situation simply slowed. Information that was being given each day was simply not as impactful as at the beginning when the situation was initially unfolding. Most of the briefings today are reiterations of what we already know or smaller updates that impact a small subset of people.

Once we get to the point of recovery and the situational changes begin again (re-opening economy, stores, relaxing restrictions, etc.) I will more than likely start doing the notes again.

In the mean time, if you are interesting in keeping your finger on the pulse of the situation there are a few options: 

* You can sign up for email updates from the DOH at www.health.ri.gov

* Providence Journal as be doing a pretty good job of offering updates on their site for free: [providencejournal.com](https://www.providencejournal.com/)

* You can watch the live stream on [Gina's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/GinaMRaimondo/) or a number of local news stations stream daily as well such as [WPRI](https://www.wpri.com/) and [WJAR](https://turnto10.com/)

**Governor Raimondo, Dr. Alexander-Scott Provide Updates on State Response to COVID-19**

*Date: April 17, 2020*

Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH, the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), made several announcements today about the state's response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 

•	Workers Compensation: Beacon Mutual Insurance Company, which insures 12,000 Rhode Island businesses, will be allowing frontline healthcare workers to file for workers compensation under the presumption that they contracted the virus in the course of doing their jobs – and will expedite those claims. This includes doctors, nurses, EMTs, home health aides and others. 

•	Testing for vulnerable populations: The state is implementing a cyclical testing program for all nursing homes to be tested every 7-10 days. This involves delivering swabs to nursing homes and picking up samples the next day. Mobile testing for outbreaks will be deployed to hot spots. COVID-19 Data Update Dr. Alexander-Scott announced today that Rhode Island has 372 new cases of COVID-19. This brings Rhode Island's count to 4,177. There were 13 additional fatalities. One person was in their 50s, 2 people were in their 60s, 7 people were in their 70s, one person was in their 80s, one person was in their 90s and one was more than 100 years old. Rhode Island's total number of COVID-19 associated fatalities is now 118. A full data summary for Rhode Island is posted online.

***Key messages for the public***

•	Anyone who is sick should stay home and self-isolate (unless going out for testing or healthcare). 

•	The people who live with that person and who have been in direct close contact with that person should self-quarantine for 14 days after the last day that that person was in isolation. Direct close contact means being within approximately 6 feet of a person for a prolonged period. 

• Help is available for people living in quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. Visit www.RIDelivers.com for connections to groceries, home supplies, restaurants, and mutual aid groups. People can also call 2-1-1. 

•	When people are in public, they should wear a cloth face covering. A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It could be sewn by hand or improvised from household items such as scarves, T-shirts, or bandanas. 

•	Groups of more than five people should not be gathering. Always avoid close personal contact with other people in public. •	Healthcare workers should not be going to work if they are sick (even with mild symptoms).

•	Everyone can help stop the spread of viruses in Rhode Island. 

o	Get your flu shot, and make sure the people around you do the same. 

o	Wash your hands often throughout the day. Use warm water and soap. If soap and water are not

**Governor Raimondo Unveils Rhode Island Modeling Projection, EmployRI Job Site**

*Date: April 16, 2020*

Governor Gina M. Raimondo and Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH, the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), made several announcements today about the state's response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

•	Modeling: The Governor unveiled the state's modeling projection for coronavirus hospitalizations through mid-May. The model can be found on RIDOH's website. 

•	EmployRI: The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, Skills for Rhode Island's Future and Commerce have re-launched a state job-seeking platform to help connect Rhode Islanders with nearly 2,000 open jobs. Many of the jobs posted are frontline positions in the fight against COVID-19. Jobseekers can visit www.EmployRI.org to find jobs as well as other important resources including information on unemployment insurance, resume tips and other COVID-19 updates. Employers looking to hire quickly can post jobs on EmployRI for free and dedicated specialists at SkillsRI will facilitate matches with qualified candidates. 

•	COVID-19 Specialty Nursing Home: To support Rhode Island's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Oak Hill Center in Pawtucket is being established as a COVID-19 Specialty Nursing Home. Oak Hill Center will be a central facility to accept patients who are being discharged from the hospital and who are COVID-19 positive but no longer require acute-level care. This strategy allows COVID-19 positive patients leaving the hospital to receive specialized rehabilitation and step-down, post-acute care while reserving hospital beds for patients who need acute-level care. Current Oak Hill Center residents who do not have COVID-19 symptoms will be located in a separate unit of the facility. Residents at other nursing homes who have COVID-19 will remain at their current nursing homes.

COVID-19 Data Update Dr. Alexander-Scott announced today that Rhode Island has 309 new cases of COVID-19. This brings Rhode Island's count to 3,838. RIDOH also announced 18 additional COVID-19 associated fatalities. Seven people were in their 70s, seven people were in their 80s, and four people were in their 90s. Rhode Island's number of COVID-19 associated fatalities is now 105. A full data summary for Rhode Island is posted online.
