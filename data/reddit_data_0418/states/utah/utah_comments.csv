I love the ever changing mountain view here along the Wasatch Front, and I recently had the pleasure of going to Zion National Park and was amazed at how beautiful all the various shades of brown, gray, and red could be.  I plan to visit the rest of the Parks before I move, and I'm sure they'll all have their own special beauty.

But - Utah doesn't have the majesty of the redwoods in California, the primordial depths of the bayous in Louisiana, the vast unspoiled breathtaking wilderness of Alaska, the heart-stopping views of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, or the endlessly fascinating and hypnotically beautiful ocean views from the beaches of every coastal state (my personal favorite is the beach at Seaside, Oregon right now).

I'm happy for you that you personally find Utah a pretty, great place to take beautiful photographs, and I hope you continue to enjoy it.

EDIT:  If you get the chance, go to Maui.  We went up to the top of the dormant volcano Haleakala and there is a side hike where you can look down into the cauldera and watch the clouds stream in through the break in the rim and it was awesome, but what still sticks in my mind is the view from the top - on a clear day you can see **almost a hundred miles** over to the two volcanos on the big Island of Hawaii.",1577906355,fcrtd95

200,200,Saltandvinegar2019,"Depends on what you want to do, what your interests are and where you’d like to work/what your profession is.

Salt Lake City is expensive, but it’s the city. You’re close to all the action and ski resorts are all pretty close. Public transit is decent with Trax and you have access to the Front Runner train.

Ogden is a bit further north. It used to be the armpit of Utah (but now it’s West Valley) but it’s actually cleaned up quite a bit. It’s a mid size city and you have access to Front Runner if you don’t like to drive. My favorite resort is nearby (Snowbasin).

Provo is crowded and there is the Happy Valley stigma. You’re also near BYU. There are pros to it, but someone else will have to give them. You have access to Front Runner from here. 

The point of the mountain area (halfway between Provo and SLC) is getting crowded with suburban houses, but there are a lot of tech jobs there and access to a Frontrunner.

Logan is an hour and half north of SLC. It’s beautiful and there are a couple of nearby ski resorts as well as bear lake 45 minutes away. It’s a smaller community but there is a niche alternative crowd as well because of Utah State. No access to the rest of Utah’s public transit, but it has free public transit in the valley. There are a lot of high tech research jobs and ag jobs. Awesome outdoors here as well.

St. George (not as familiar) is warm about year round and you’re a couple of hours from Vegas. It’s growing fast. There is a lot of red rock outdoors to do and nearby Zions NP and other parks. It’s at the very corner several hours from SLC.

Moab is a small community, but it’s an outdoors community. Not sure about jobs here.

Mormons' attitudes in Utah communities can be ethnocentric and a little possessive. In my experience, this isn't that different from small-town attitudes all the world over. IMHO, the Mormon reputation for being, ""nice,"" is well deserved. They value civility, order, and community; if you don't make a fuss, neither will they. I *have* found it's hard to be as close to my Mormon friends because they spend so much time doing church stuff. They really believe what they believe and, to my secular ears, what they believe is at least as batshit as run-off-the-mill evangelical Christianity.

Though my non-Mormon friends who grew up here tell some pretty crazy stories of prejudice, I've never had any bad experiences in the tenish years I've lived here, so I wouldn't let the scary stories scare you too much.",1578018665,fcw73y1

&gt; 30. LOGAN, April 27 — A 16-year-old girl claimed **Michael Fife**, 62, sexually assaulted her while the two were on a Cache Valley Transit District bus on April 23. The girl immediately called her 17-year-old brother and told him about the alleged assault. But police said video evidence shows that there was no sexual assault. Police said the brother located Fife getting off the bus near 300 South and 100 West, ran toward him and attacked him. Fife fell to the sidewalk, suffered head injuries and was left unconscious while the brother ran away. Fife died four days later in a hospital. The brother was charged with homicide by assault and was later ordered to serve 30 days in juvenile detention.

These numbers are handed over by the LDS church, and they include any member that hasn't officially resigned or anyone that died while not being active/tracked by the church up until some silly age well over 100.   
  
In reality, world wide they have activity rates sub 30% of recorded members.   
Anytime I discuss it, someone asks for links, so here's a few. one from BYU discussing 'social life' trends among members (clearly aimed at identifying where inactivity occurs so that it can be addresssed)

Out of thousands of survey responses and enrollment/attendance numbers came up with less than 30% active rate for mormons world wide. It is however biased as a large chunk of these numbers are about retention rates after 1 or 2 years of conversion. per the BYU research above, activity percentages are very likely to continue dropping after 2 years.

I'm not sure what negative effect it has had. Much of the violence and hate related to gender identity has come from those hurting non-binary people. I'm curious what you are arguing.

&gt;their very way of life is solidifying truly harmful gender stereotypes and norms dealing with masculinity and femininity.

I think you misunderstand the goals of things like feminism and related civil rights issues. The goal is equality. It's making the ""norm"" whatever you want, in opposition to stereotypes. Part of the goal of this movement is making it safe for a CIS male to wear pink if he wants, or sparkly shoes. Or for a CIS female to do whatever the fuck she wants. It's not _just_ about protecting those who were assigned a gender they don't identify with. Simply not talking about this kind of thing means no norms will shift and no space will be made for anything but ""man"" and ""woman"" with absolutely no nuance. I'd argue that's bad for everyone.

Rights and acknowledgement of trans people is sought because they are actually being hurt. Saying ""no they're not, they should be quiet"" is a sadly typical response.

&gt; Be yourself, but don't you dare tell me what's feminine or masculine

I'm not sure what you're getting at here. No one is telling you what is feminine or masculine. People just want to be able to act how you (or anyone else) defines feminine or masculine at their leisure and not be told ""don't do that"" because it doesn't match the sex they were born with. As uncomfortable as it may make you, that includes having sex with whoever they want.

&gt;That movement you bring up, that got women's their rights to vote, also shied away from sterotyping gender roles, yet the gender identity crowd can't survive without traditional gender roles existing for them to identify with. Hardly progressive.

378,378,mewurby,"If a person is ""assigned"" male at birth but ""feels like"" a female, what the hell does that even mean? It's absolutely arbitrary. Biological sex says that existing as a male means however you feel is how a male feels. If being a male but feeling like a woman means you wear makeup and pink dresses, than all you are doing is further substantiating the gender sterotype that a woman wears makeup and pink dresses. If you claim that they aren't cementing sterotypes because they're trans, and therefore they aren't the same as a woman you're a transphobe.

The fact is, if you're a male, and feel uncomfortable in your own body, and feel you should be a female, and transition by growing hair out, getting breast implants, and wearing make-up, you're not doing anything except saying that women have to have long hair, wear makeup, and can't have a flat chest or else they're men (like your ""assigned"" sex) 

You can't have your cake and eat it too. Either gender sterotypes are wrong, or trans people don't exist. 

You're assigned a sex at birth. What does it mean to ""feel"" like you're that sex? I'm a male. I have absolutely no idea what the hell it means to feel like a male because all I have known is me, and my biology means I have a penis. Having a penis means I am male. There is no existence except what I know. I am therefore incapable of knowing what anything else feels like. If I felt like a woman trapped in a man's body, than obviously the issue isn't that I am trans, it is that I have psychological issues with my body since logic dictates that I cannot know what it means to feel like any other gender than the one I experience daily. 

I don't care to discuss this further. You may reply, and I will read it, but trans as a progressive ideology is inherently flawed and does nothing but water the issues that plague modern gender stereotypes, which have a substantial impact on men and women in society.",1578286621,fdcwtat

468,468,TBTop,"This post will serve as my personal test of whether this subreddit can have a fact-based discussion. I'm not optimistic given that Reddit is as partisan and fact-free as the rest of social media, but I'll give it a shot mainly because I like talking about this stuff and know quite a bit.

I comment as someone who shares ownership of three vehicles: a one-ton diesel pickup, a compact gas-powered SUV, and an EV that I bought 7 years ago when Think North America went bankrupt and cleared out the inventory at deep discounts. I have used my EV ownership as the focal point for my detailed study of EVs and of how electricity is generated and distributed.

We live in a rural county in WA State that borders the Columbia River. My spouse has a condo in the Portland area, and we've been able to register our vehicles in Oregon on account of the lower vehicle registration fees there. WA State levies a $150 annual ""gas tax replacement"" fee on EVs, the status of which is in limbo on account of a successful voter initiative that repealed that fee and replaced it with a $30 annual fee that applies to all vehicles. (It's complicated, and I don't want to clutter this post with those details.) In addition to the $150, the legislature approved a $75 annual fee on EVs and all hybrids to finance expansion of EV chargers.

My EV's battery is small (24 kWh). Over a calendar year, it gets 129 mpg-equivalent, and the charging rate amounts to 0.6 miles of range per minute on a 240v/14A electric dryer circuit. (Actually, the circuit is 20A, but the car's on-board charger maxes out at 14A.) Its range varies from about 55 miles per charge to 77 miles per charge depending on the season, for a yearly average of 69 miles. The chargers to be installed will add about 3 miles of range per minute to the newer-generation EVs capable of hooking up to the ""DC"" chargers. Tesla's so-called ""superchargers"" add a maximum of 6 miles per minute, but often less on account of multiple cars sharing the charging stations.

By contrast, my truck adds range at 90 miles per minute at the fuel pump; the average small gas car ""charges"" at a rate of 150 to 175 miles per minute. The charger network will be unusable for me; if I did use them, the typical markup on the electricity is 50%.

I use the EV for short hops to do errands, and drive it about 3,300 miles a year. The gas tax on the equivalent gas car (Scion iQ, almost exactly the same size and weight as my Think, but 37 mpg) for 3,300 miles of driving would be $60. But that overstates it in two ways. For starters, neither WA State nor Oregon will allocate any of the ""gas tax replacement"" money to the federal highway trust fund, which accounts for $16 of the Scion's fuel tax. Past that, the gas tax has a built-in fuel economy incentive: the better the fuel economy, the less tax you pay. If the ""gas tax replacement"" fee were levied on the same basis, my road use tax would be $12 a year.

I don't think that *any* road vehicle should be tax exempt, and that includes bicycles, which I think should pay the same fee as a moped, with a break for kids. I have no problem paying an equitable tax, but what WA State and Oregon are doing is financially abusive and hypocritical. Here we have two state governments dominated by ""progressives"" who talk the eco talk, and then turn right around and stick it to EVs. In the end, ""progressives"" aren't about ecology, they are about taxes however they can get them.

One answer would be a per-mile fee, which Oregon is considering. There are some problems with that. One is that Oregon's required device would include GPS tracking of wherever you drive, something I don't like one bit. Secondly, Oregon won't kick back any of the money to the feds. Thirdly, their mileage fee would be the same for every vehicle -- no fuel economy incentive at all. Finally, if that goes through, the next thing that'll happen is graduated fees for those who the ""progressives"" deem are driving ""too much."" They haven't yet said they'll do that, but they want to establish the mechanism to allow it.

The alternative would be to have EV drivers simply report their odometer reading when they re-register the car. If the owner games the system, the full fee could easily be recovered (plus a penalty) at time of sale. But that's not what they want to do. They want to track your movements, and I think eventually have a graduated mileage fee. So, even though I support a *genuine* ""gas tax replacement"" fee for EVs, these schemes are not one single bit genuine IMO, and therefore I don't support them.",1578350800,fdf0wbh

What this is doing is since electric vehicles don't use gas but still need the roads maintained and repaired, they still need to pay their fair share to maintain &amp; repair the roads that they use.

Right.  The entire transportation budget is short.  Funding one part of roads means another part of roads has even less money.

&gt;they're pulling money from the general fund for that, which then hurts education

Yes on the first, no on the second.  The state is pulling money from the general fund to cover road shortfalls.  But they can't pull it from education, because the state constitution does not let money raised for education be spent elsewhere. 

&gt;Or maybe the yearly registration fee's should include a vehicle weight tax

Yes the Texas DOT link on ESAL is a correct formula to use (in the future reference AASHTO, FHWA, or state DOT's (like you did), they are the credible sources).There are so many factors in play to make a blanket statement that passenger vehicles cause virtually no pavement damage is false. Obviously  heavy trucks are a bigger factor. But if you have too thin of a pavement section passenger vehicles are definitely a factor. Usually the pavement section is designed for the traffic it sees. If a road doesn't see any traffic it cracks, usually caused by the sun. Think of some of your local streets that don't see any traffic, most likely they have alligator cracking. Salting roads during the winter time effects the integrity of the road.

Tying this back to the OP, the electric vehicles need to pay for the maintenance of roads and the ""gas tax"" is a good way for that, imo.",1578363727,fdfkcxs
498,498,TBTop,"If UT doesn't have enough money for road maintenance, it should increase the state gas tax. In doing so, it should make sure that every penny of the gas tax goes for roads. Not buses, light rail, or bike lanes. Trust me, folks, the ""progressives"" who run my state (WA) are masters at violating the state constitution in various ways and effectively commandeering gas tax money for other purposes. There is no weasel cleverer or more dishonest than a WA State Democrat in search of more tax revenue. Olympia, the state capital, is filled with performance artists. LOL

UT's gas tax is only 30 cents a gallon, compared to WA's at 49.4 cents. There's room to raise it, IMO. As for EVs, I'd suggest that those owners report their mileage at license plate renewal time and pay a genuine use fee that recognizes the far higher fuel economy of EVs. Utah isn't run by tax thieves from everything I've seen, so this ought to be possible there.

An equitable EV tax would start with the EPA fuel economy number for that model. If it's unavailable (as with my 2011 Think) then use the closest comparable, which in my case would be the Nissan LEAF. If, for instance, your state gas tax went to 35 cents, and an EV owner drove 6,500 miles in a year, the correct use fee for an EV rated at, say, 120 equivalent MPG would be \[(6,500/120) .35\] or $19 a year. This would put that EV on an equal footing with other vehicles, and those others would pay more.

For instance, if someone owns a heavy-duty diesel pickup that gets 16 mpg and drove it 6,500 miles, they'd pay $142 a year in UT gas tax if it were 35 cents a gallon. The only difference in collections would be that the pickup driver would pay it at the pump, while the EV driver would pay it by stating his odometer reading every year. If someone were to understate their mileage, that could be handled at the time of sale through a penalty. If trust in the numbers is an issue, then you could require people to take it to the DMV to have the odometer reading verified, or to submit a photograph of the odometer reading.

This would be the cheapest way to do it, and the least invasive, privacy-wise. The alternative -- GPS tracking for imposition of a mileage fee -- would not only be expensive because of the device, but it would require EV drivers to have their movements tracked by the state. Not only that, but at some future date if those devices were attached, even UT has its tax-thirsty ""progressives,"" and as sure as night follows day they'll want to attach GPS devices to every vehicle and then charge extra mileage charges to people who your eco-weenies deem to be driving ""too much.""

EDIT: If you did it this way, it's a win-win-win. It'd not only be cheap to administer and the rate would be fair, but it would please the eco-weenies who want to see more EVs out there. Now, to those who'd worry about the long term effect, I say relax. I can talk at length about this, but the short version is that lithium-ion chemistry has enough limitations that EVs are going to remain a small niche for a long time, especially in far-flung states like yours. The long version is, well, a lot longer. LOL",1578363755,fdfkeg9

Let's do some math. [Utah produces 1,595 lbs of CO2 per mwh of electricity](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/utah/). A car generates 20 lbs of CO2 per gallon of gas burned. How much CO2 would each car burn over 100 miles? Assuming the ICE vehicle can get about 33 mpg, it will burn 3 gallons over 100 miles, generating 60 lbs of CO2. The 2019 Nissan Leaf has a range of 150+ miles and a battery that is 40kwh, meaning to go 100 miles, it will need about 27kwh. Each kwh produces (1595/1000) 1.595 lbs of CO2, so those 27 kwhs generate 43 lbs of CO2. So an ICE car would have to get about 50 mpg to produce the same amount of CO2 emissions as an EV powered by Utah's coal plants (which are the 8th worst in the country in terms of how much CO2 they produce).",1578365008,fdfmbgt

This is part of the problem. This may be true, but isn't necessarily. Someone in a fuel efficient compact car could drive twice as much as someone in a less efficient vehicle and pay roughly the same in taxes. 

I'm not saying EVs shouldn't pay their fair share, I'm saying that the gas tax isn't an effective way to measure ""fair share"". 

Not only that, but it is in opposition to the goal of lowering pollution. The more efficient a vehicle gets the less tax revenue gets collected for the same amount of miles driven. The state makes the most money when people drive low efficiency vehicles and have to burn more gas. 

I'm just saying we should find a solution that works fairly for everyone (EVs included) if road use is the only concern. I mean, i'd like to see a tax on gas to help us find a solution to pollution as well, and that could be based on a per gallon surcharge, as that makes more sense. They could easily make a road use tax based on miles driven when you register your car every year, for example (if they started collecting odometer readings).",1578365580,fdfn6xp

u/Jaya_8 had a great comment in another post about this 5 months ago, and I think it helps illustrate some of the complications that can come from a law that isn’t well thought out: TL:DR you don’t get one, read it. Issues like this take more than a knee jerk reaction.

""I am not automatically for or against mandated reporting for clergy, it all depends on how the laws are written.

I haven’t seen the text of the bill in question (would love a link, I am not a Utah resident). I do have an MA in clinical psychology and am familiar with some of the challenges in implementing MR laws.

Here are four of the things people may want to consider when evaluating specific bills:

1. ⁠Detecting abuse is difficult even for people who are trained to detect it; bills need to define the scope carefully, particularly when involving non-professionals.

Mandated reporting usually goes beyond the scenario where a child abuser explicitly confesses to abuse and the therapist/clergy/doctor reports. It usually mandates that the MR make a report whenever there is a “reasonable suspicion” of abuse or neglect.

But as any MR will tell you, deciding what is reasonable suspicion is extremely difficult in practice.

For non-medical professionals, discerning whether injuries stem from abuse or normal childhood activity is extremely difficult if not impossible, and asking people to make life-altering calls they are not trained to make does not always have positive results.

For example, the American Psychological Association published this counterpoint to turning researchers who work with kids into mandated reporters: “Mandated reporters would be criminally responsible for failure to report a suspicion of child abuse. But, given that they will lack valid and reliable means for detecting that abuse, many of the reports will almost certainly be false alarms. Although the legal system may eventually exonerate the falsely accused parent, the allegation of child abuse is obviously traumatic and disruptive to parents and children alike. This risk would be worth taking if our research could reliably indicate child abuse, but given that it rarely can, we would be putting many children and parents at risk of false alarm while not increasing our ability to detect abuse when it does occur.” ([https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun03/counterpoint](https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun03/counterpoint))

So if a bishop sees a bruised or hungry or scared kid, and he has little training or ability to discern the cause of the injury or emotions, but if it is found later to be abuse, he could be held accountable for not reporting. Situations like this often lead to a high rate of false alarm reporting which can harm families.

This isn’t an argument not to make clergy mandated reporters, but it is a clear indication that laws should narrowly define the situations the scope of mandated reporting to be within the person’s actual expertise and access. Lay clergy are volunteers with widely varying backgrounds. Therapists and doctors are professionals. Volunteers can only play so much training catch-up while juggling dozens of other new role responsibilities.

2. Mandated reporting can have unintended chilling effects that have to be weighed in writing laws:

Example: LDS clergy are involved in dispensing charity such as food from the bishops storehouse. This involves discussions of family resources, income, and food. People in poverty may be reluctant to divulge the extent of their situation for fear it may look to a mandated reporter they are neglecting their children by not being able to provide food and shelter, when they are simply struggling. This can actually harm children who continue to go hungry if parents choose not to go to a bishop for help. It can also contribute to the criminalization of poverty.

Here is a situation that springs up in psychology research, from the APA again: “Every consent form will now have to inform parents that the researcher is legally required to report suspicions of child abuse. Given that our research usually has nothing to do with abuse, parents may (legitimately) wonder what we might be looking for that requires us to put such an alarming warning in our consent forms. Parents therefore may elect not to participate in the research, and that is a real risk to children.”

Along these lines, a similar chilling effect could be created amongst churchgoers if laws are unclear or badly communicated. People may be reluctant to work with their bishop on issues of addiction, substance use, gambling, anger, or even infidelity if they are concerned they could be reported for suspicions of child neglect or abuse, even if they don’t abuse or neglect anyone. A law that does not fully consider this could inadvertently create more harm than it prevents by stopping help-seeking for destructive behaviors.

3. Abusers and victims alike do not always use clear, unambiguous language when talking with mandated reporters. They often use veiled/coded language that can take time and trust to unpack. Cross-cultural communication can complicate this.

Abusers don’t usually come out and say to bishops “I have been abusing my family” They often use coded or denying language like “My problem is, my kid doesn’t listen to me.” Sorting through that to figure out what is abuse is often beyond the training most clergy or even many therapists receive.

Victims of abuse also often do not directly call their experience abuse and may even have trouble seeing it as such. They may use phrases like “he gets in these moods,” or upon probing deny that it is abuse until they have worked through many inner barriers and come to terms with life-changing next steps.

One great concern about mandated reporting laws is that clergy and therapists are often alerted to abuse by victims who use veiled language to slowly start talking about it, and only over the course of many meetings reveal what is really going on. If they suspect a clergy member or therapist will leap to report the the first inkling, they may never go in at all, and the abuse is thus actually hidden by vigorous mandated reporting laws.

4. Mandated reporting takes away some consent from those impacted, and this can cause unintended complications.

For examples of why reporting without consent of the victim can cause issues for adults, see the #WhyIStayed stories.

Example: If an abuser is targeting spouse and children, the spouse may need to time the reporting with other actions so that they can extricate themselves fully and safely. If a report is made before enough documentation can be obtained, financial separation measures taken, etc, it can cause harm. Even though we want kids to be immediately safe, individual situations vary and a parent may need time to gather evidence that would allow them to gain full custody. A poorly timed report could result in a child going back to their abuser, who now becomes more careful and secretive.

So in short, I would like more legal protections for victims. I would love more checkpoints put in place to help them. At the same time, mandated reporting laws can cause known areas of unintended harm. Mitigating these areas of harm should be central to all discussion of how these laws are implemented.

It is not as simple as “well of course everyone should report abuse!” Likewise, someone who is against a particular version of a mandated reporting law may not be trying to cover for abusers; there are legitimate harms they may be trying to avoid. It merits discussion.""

570,570,helix400,"Catholics.  That's the big one.  It's rooted in this 800 year old doctrine:

Catechism #1467 - ""A confessor who directly violates the seal of confession incurs an automatic excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See""

The result is that this is recognized by [all 50 states](https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1646&amp;context=lawreview) as priest-penitent privilege.  It's very similar to attorney-client privilege, where an attorney cannot be compelled to report crimes discovered through confidential client communication.

Just as attorney-client is a thing, priest-penitent privilege is recognized too.  California made a push to undo it recently, but that fell apart.

What about ministers who hear something third person? 

I don’t currently live and practice in Utah, so this could be wrong, but I believe it is dictated by law that anyone who witnesses abuse, must report it. Everyone has a duty to report. The difference is that not everyone is in trusted positions of power and trust , but I don’t know how you separate that, who is “powerful” or trusted enough to be mandated by law. 

As a therapist I believe that in some (many) cases, the healing path is parallel and mutually exclusive to the reporting path. I certainly have worked with clients were their reporting was a big part of the healing, but it didn’t start out that way. As a therapist, the mandate to report is a huge obstacle for a person coming looking for healing.

683,683,varthalon,"General points:  

- The Governors Economic Development and the Utah World Trade Center funded a study by the University of Utah to see if an inland port would be a good idea economically. The study said it would be. Bringing more higher paying jobs into Utah, builidng up the infrastructure in an economiclly depressed area, and making it more favorable for businesses to locate themeselves in Utah and thus bringing even more job opportunities to Utah.
- Utah state legislature acted on the study and passed several bills to build a large inland port (a place where cargo could be exchanged between air, rail, and road transportation) on the undeveloped land west of the airport.  
- Salt Lake City government is up in arms about it because its taking control of the land (and taxes) away from them.  
- Environmentalists are up in arms about it because its being build on wetlands, is largely industrial, and they believe it will increase the amount of air pollution in the valley.  
- Many other people are upset that the legislative bills that created the port were introduced and passed *suspiciously* fast with little time for public review or input. There have been several alligations of conflicts of interest, underhandedness, and corruption surrounding the process.
- Some people protesting the port have been doing so rather uncivilly - including criminal tresspassing and violence. 

The TL;dr is that the port will bring in a lot of jobs but is doing it in a way that is pissing off a lot of people.",1578592999,fdnuc9e
684,684,sullen_maximus,"I'll try to present this as un-bias as possible. 

The state of Utah (read governor/ politicians) want to build an [in-land port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Inland_Port) near the airport. They argument is that it would be a huge boost to state income because anything coming in and going out of the port is taxable at some level by the state. It would also provide a ton of jobs. 

Salt Lake City is staunchly against it though because it takes a sizeable chunk of land (16,000 acres) away from Salt Lake County (not the city) and converts to state owned land which is lost property taxes. In addition, many are concerned that the benefits of port, won't outweigh the negative impacts since Utah has a history of charging extremely low impact fees, and usage taxes compared to other states.

There is also the civilian argument against it, because it would totally destroy the ecosystem where they want to build it which is mostly uninhabited currently. 

Personal observations, the environmental impact sounds good, but lets be honest money talks. SLC is pissed because this would be a metric shit ton of lost future property taxes for the county. [Here is the area](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c5cbc0329f2cc33899d0f4b/1549665264005-TS3H1TJ1W0273EYM25HJ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKF77zHgOZR0utR6DkX45aAUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8PaoYXhp6HxIwZIk7-Mi3Tsic-L2IOPH3Dwrhl-Ne3Z2WV1dndH8G68klfnt7nyKA-DceZZKt-Nspq7gxVfJOMgKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/map.png). These lost taxes would have to be picked up by everyone else (read SLC). This also would translate to increased utility infrastructure for the county since an in-land port of this size would have huge impacts on virtually everything from water, to power, to even road maintenance around it.",1578593688,fdnvid2

The Utah Inland Port is a proposed dry port in the northwest quadrant of Salt Lake City, Utah and other undeveloped land in Salt Lake County. It is currently in the planning and preconstruction stages. It would cover over 16,000 acres.The Utah Inland Port Authority is a government-run corporation with the responsibility and legal powers to develop and run the Utah Inland Port.

They looked at the deaths in 2004 and the deaths in 2018 and said ""Look almost a 30% improvement"" without bothering to look at all the years in between.

I don't have the data for 2004-2006 ready to hand but for 2007-2017:

Column 1: Year  
Column 2: Number of deaths that year where at least one driver had a BAC over 0.08  
Column 3: What percentage those deaths were of all traffic fatalities for the year   
 
2007 | 42 | 14.0%  
2008 | 34 | 12.3%  
2009 | 31 | 12.7%

2014 | 45 | 17.6%  
2015 | 37 | 13.3%  
2016 | 36 | 12.8%   
2017 | 36 | 13.2%  

I don't see any statistically signifigant change over the course of these years from these numbers. 

I haven't seen the full 2018 numbers yet, although the numbers from the first quarter of 2018 showed a marked reduction of deaths compared to the first quarter of 2017.  Its not enough data to say if the reduction is due to the new .05 BAC law or if it is just a normal variance.",1578685027,fdriguh

Their methodology is comparing the number of DUI-related deaths to the number of registered drivers. Your Column 3 is comparing DUI-related deaths to total traffic fatalities. I wouldn't use that as a gauge of successfully reducing DUI-related fatalities. It's too susceptible to changes in total traffic fatalities. 

Scenario 1: DUI deaths remain constant. Other traffic fatalities are reduced. It appears that the DUI deaths are getting worse.

Scenario 2: DUI deaths remain constant. Other traffic fatalities skyrocket. It appears that DUI deaths have been reduced.

When dealing with statistics, it's important to be mindful of what is being compared. You rightly pointed out the  mistake of comparing two end points without discussion of the middle. When comparing two variables, the sensitivity of the comparison needs to be understood.",1578697721,fds9wlr

Add a half to a full day's drive to get to the parks and you've eaten up half your time just in driving.

With that being said, should that not be a deterrent, both of your suggestions would totally be worth seeing (although it might be best to only choose one to actually take the time to see it in its entirety).  

Should you not want to burn so much of your time driving, there are a lot of awesome places in the Park City area to go snow shoeing.

874,874,varthalon,"The Utah Constitution requires all income taxes (both corporate and individual) to go 100% to fund education. The legislature doesn't have the authority to use it anywhere else.

However, you will be seeing a proposal on the next general election ballot to remove that requirement from the Constitution so the legislature can spend income taxes however they want to rather than being forced to spend it on schools.

&amp;nbsp;

Currently [this](https://tax.utah.gov/commission-office/reports) is how Utah spends its taxes:  

**The Education Fund**  4.5 billion dollars  
The education fund is the budget for the public K-12 schools and state colleges/university system. The Utah Constitution requires 100% of all income taxes (business and personal) to go into this fund and those taxes compose over 98% of the fund with the other minor portions coming from alcohol taxes (reserved for the school lunch program), and Driver's Education Fees (reserved for driver's education classes). K-12 education is also suplimented by property taxes at the local level. College education is also funded through tuition and charitable contributions.

**The General Fund**  2.3 billion dollars  
The general fund is the budget for general state operations. Its funded primarily (86%) with the state portion of sales taxes (about 2/3 of sales tax is state while the rest is county/city). The rest is made up from tobacco, beer, insurance, and mining taxes - although most of those have ear marks which restrict what the state can spend the money on. Another very large earmark on state sales taxes transfers about a quarter billion dollars of it each year into the Transportation Fund. 

**The Transportation Fund**  1.3 billion dollars  
The transportation fund is the operating budge for UDOT.  It is composed primarily of fuel taxes and a large earmark from state sales taxes. It also receives funds from motor vehicle registrations, and several other special fees. Additionally, for national highways and interstates projects it often receives matching funds from the federal goverment. Futhermore Counties and Cities are allowed to impose local sales taxes and most of those are earmarked for transportation projects such as UTA, Frontrunner, and rural highway projects (see Fiduciary Fund).

**The Fiduciary Fund**  1.7 billion dollars  
Approximately 1/3 of the sales tax rate is locally imposed sales taxes. These taxes can only be imposed by a county or city for a specific purpose. The money is collected along with the state's sales tax and held by the State in The fiduciary fund until the local goverment spends the money for the approved uses.  Examples include funding for Frontrunner and UTA, for zoos and parks, for rural hospitals, for museums and for promoting and supporting tourism in Utah.

**Property Taxes**  3.2 billion dollars
Property taxes come primarily from taxes on real property, business personal property, and part of motor vehicle registration fees. Property taxes generally stay at the local goverment level supporting local goverment operations for the area where the property is located.  Property taxes are split four ways.  

1. Schools  
The majority (55%) of property taxes are used, in addition to the Education Fund to pay for K-12 education. Unlike the education fund - which is shared statewide per pupil - this portion of property taxes goes to the school district that supports the the property generating the tax.  
2. Counties  
About 18% of property taxes goes to the county goverment as their primary source of revenue for their general operating budget.  
3. Municipalities (cities and towns)  
About 14% of property taxes goes to the city or town were the property is located and is used as their general operating budget.  
4. Special Service Districts  
About 13% of property taxes goes into special service districts... these are special local goverment agencies that provide essential services that cross city bounderies - trash collection, water, sewers, vermin control, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

The concern that the legislature has is that over time, with inflation and population growth, all of these funds need to keep pace with growth and they aren't.  Especially the General Fund and the Transportation Fund are falling behind the cost of the services they provide.  

For example: 
&gt;The until a few years ago Utah hadn't raised the fuel taxes for over a decade. At the same time the population was growing, the cost of building and maintaining the roads was increasing, and cars were becoming more fuel efficent (especially with the introduction of hybrids).  The state was faced with either increasing taxes (a good way for a politician to not get reelected) or cutting corners in maintaining roads.  They opted to cut corners.  Some less used roads were converted to gravel roads (cost less to maintain), bridges weren't maintained, road's were 'patched' when they really needed to be rebuilt or resurfaced, etc.  Now we are in a situation where things have been badly neglected for so long it will cost more to repair them than if they had been properly maintained all along. 

One of the big problems the legislature has with the current way we are doing things is that the progressive taxes (income and property) pay primarily into education and local goverments while the regressive taxes (sales and fuels) pay primarily into infrastructure and state goverment operations. They don't like that since, in order to get that funding up to where they should be, they are stuck with using regressive taxes - like increasing the tax on grocery food items.

&amp;nbsp; 

In the next general election you'll be seeing a proposal to remove the Utah Constitutions requirement that 100% of income taxes go into the Education Fund.  Teachers, PTAs, and other education special interests will scream bloody murder over this because currently 100% of those taxes go to them and they are already underfunded even with that requirement.  But the Legislature will want it to pass because they can do things like *removing* the sales tax on groceries and pay for it with an increase in income tax which is a better way to pay for things because income tax is a progressive tax and sales tax is a regressive tax - something they can't legally do the way things are now.

--

My Personal Opinions:

**Sales tax on Food**  
Personally I don't have much of a preference here. The VERY poor already don't pay sales tax on food (food stamps are exempt from sales tax). I think exempting it creates a tax break for the middle class (OK), and rich (crap) and pulls the money that the middle class and rich would have spent on groceries from goverment programs like - providing tax free food stamps for the very poor. Still the way they are going about it in this bill is asine. One of the things that we saw when they first dropped the sales tax rate on groceries half-way was it increased the cost for groceries - because it created a really difficult to understand and administer defition of what was grocery and the grocery store is liable for paying the tax themselves if the screw up - which gets passed on to the customers - including the very poor. 

The tax rate should be the full normal tax rate or it should be nothing, not this weird middle ground.  Even in this bill they didn't raise it to the full rate, they raised it to 6.1%, so sellers STILL have to figure out what is which. 

I think my personal preference would be to exempt sales tax on food - in general - but then increase the sales tax of restaurants to compensate. So if you buy food from walmart, its cheaper, if you buy it from Sizzler, its not. 

**The tax bill in general**  
Gods this bill is a nightmare. They tried to do something in the prior legislative session and it failed. They tried to drum up support with public meetings and it failed. Then they passed this 238 page monster of last minute compromises and ill thought out revisions in the middle of the holidays despite knowing it didn't have public support. The whole premise of the bill was to fix a possible FUTURE problem with taxes. Then why did it have to be done in such an emergency rush. Why does it impose sales taxes on a very arbitrary seeming group of services (taxis and rideshares, streaming videos, etc). Why if its trying to broaden the tax base does it introduce new exemptions from taxes. Why does it lower income taxes. Why does it give out a bunch of income tax 'rebates'. 

All of this should have been done in a general legislative session. It should have been done in a series of separate bills rather than one massive one so each point could be separately considered and approved or rejected on its own merits. It shouldn't have been done at all until after seeing if the citizens of Utah will even allow a change to the constitutional requirement for income taxes to be spent only on education. 

**Constitutional requirement for education spending**  
Personally I'm a bit conflicted over the idea of removing the constitutional requirement for income taxes to only be spent on education. I like that it would allow the legislature to shift away from regressive taxes like sales and fuel for general governement operations. However I also forsee it creating an ongoing tug-of-war of funding education vs everything else when all the money for both is in the same pot. Given how publically popular education is I see it pulling MORE than its share of money out of the pot and other vital goverment operations suffering because the public doesn't see them as vital until its to late (like a decaying bridge) and then when its finally apparent that something is an emergency somewhere else too much gets pulled from education to rebuild what was neglected elsewhere for years - creating an ongoing rollercoaster of government programs getting feast or famine based on legislative whim.",1578939155,fe9ljzg

884,884,helix400,"1) Utah's tax income was out of balance and threatening to get ugly in the years to come.  Utah is unique nationwide in that it effectively must have two budgets (per the state constitution).  Income taxes go to education.  Everything else goes to the rest of the budget.  Because Utah's GDP is top or near top in the nation, Utah's income tax increase has shot up dramatically, and so has education spending (good!).  But sales tax is dwinding down as people are switching to services, and *sales taxes to the state are no longer keeping pace with inflation* (bad).  That means the rest of Utah's budget would be a form of a cut, as the ratio of government services to people would dwindle each year.  The tax reform helps fix this and gets Utah tax receipts back to reasonable balances. 

2) The tax reform is progressive in nature.  The poor and middle class are being targeted with additional credits that more than make up for the tax increase on food.  For example, a family of 4 making $45K total income would pay roughly $124 more in taxes on food (bad), but get $131 back from a lower income tax rate (good), $500 back from a grocery tax credit (good), and $180 back from a bigger dependent exemption (good).  The bottom line is that if you want the poor to have more money in their pocket, this tax reform gets there.  The tax cut is also progressive in terms of effective taxes, or % ultimately taxed, with the poor and lower middle class getting the biggest effective tax rate drop.

3) Sales taxes are one of the few taxes that has broad support among economists for being fair.  It's an end-of-point tax that tends to scale with spending habits and doesn't fluctuate wildly with economics ups and downs.",1578947646,feaeed9
885,885,varthalon,"I don't think he's saying he supported a tax increase. He said he supported tax reform.

A lot of people who understand how Utah taxes work do support tax reform. Currently almost all of our progressive taxes (100% of income taxes and 55% of property taxes) goes to education. That leaves the most regressive taxes (sales and fuel) to pay for infrastructure and general goverment operations. 

Its a requirement of the Utah Constitution that 100% of income taxes goes into education. But this means we doesn't have a strong  progressive tax to use for the rest of our budget.

The real deal will be in the next general election when they will ask for the citizens to remove the 'education only' requirement for income taxes so they can increase the income tax rate instead of the grocery tax rate to keep up with inflation and population growth.",1578948065,feafha5

889,889,varthalon,"**Grocery food sales** 
Sales tax on grocery food is increasing from 3% to 6.1% statewide  

Currently the sales tax on grocery foods is 3% (1.75 state and 1.25 local).   
The new rate will be 6.1%% (4.85 state and 1.25 local).

It looks like Harmons was only looking at the increase in the state portion without factoring in the local portion that still applies but didn't change.

**Non-grocery sales**
The sales tax rate on non-grocery sales varies depending on the city where the sell occurs but runs from 6.1% to 9.05%

This bill does not change the sales tax rate (with one exception) but does impose that sales tax on more types of sales (including taxi/rideshare and streaming videos). 

The non-grocery tax rate is  

- 4.85% for the state;  
- 1.25% for local goverments; and 
- between 0% and 2.92% for optional local goverment taxes  

So essentially the grocery food tax is the full tax rate less the optional local taxes for things like UTA, parks, rural hospitals, roadsigns, etc. 

The one exception for the change in tax rate on non-grocery sales is a large (4% if I remember correctly) tax increase in short term rentals of motor vehicles.",1578949309,feaiptq

895,895,helix400,"&gt; But even people who want tax reform recognize this bill is a nightmare of last second compromises and bad decisions. 

I agree there.  Tax reform is *hard*, because you will *almost never* get a majority of the general population that supports a practical answer.  So you instead have to find some majority of representatives that supports something close to a reform end goal, or you get nothing at all. 

I much preferred last year's tax version where far more services were taxed in exchange for a lower sales tax rate.  But I also like the credits in this year's version. Makes me mad when special interest groups say ""We need taxes, just don't tax *my* business, make others pay for it.""  And a few groups got their exemptions.

I also get that people find food taxes fundamentally abhorrent.   I know many that find income tax abhorrent.  Same with property taxes.  I'd happy go with a solution where other service sales taxes are added to make up for the loss of food sales taxes.   I'd rather see the sales taxes applied to things like real estate sales.

1322,1322,varthalon,"- Utah is right in the middle for its tax burden  (27th of of the 50 states).
- About **8.26% in total** of your income will end up going towards Utah taxes. 

**Income Taxes**  
Utah is 14th nationwide for income taxes.  It has a 4.95% single rate tax that decreases if your household income is lower than a certain threshold.  The average tax rate paid is 2.63%  The Utah Constitution requires 100% of income taxes to be used for education. 

**Sales Taxes**  
Utah is about average nationwide for its sales tax burden. Sales tax rates vary depending on the city but most people pay about 7.8%.  Groceries have a lower tax rate of 3.0% but recent legislation is trying to raise that to 6.1%.  Sales taxes get split *roughly* into three places.  One third going to the local government where the sale took place (with about half of it being given to the local government for general use and the rest being earmarked for specific uses, such as to fund parks, an airport, or city bus system, etc). One third going to highway maintenance.  The last third going to the state government's general operating budget to fund most government programs other than education and roads. 

**Fuel taxes**  
Currently Utah charges 31 cents per gallon in fuel taxes. Recent legislation is trying to raise that about 6-10cents per gallon depending on the type of fuel. Fuel taxes go to road maintenance. 

**Property taxes**  
Utah has fairly low property taxes, 36th out of 50 states.  Property taxes are also split roughly three ways.  One third goes to the local school district.  Another third goes to the local government's operating budget.  The final third goes to special service districts, which are special local government agencies that provide services across city boundaries - like sewer, garbage, and water. 

**Current Controversy**  
You've been seeing a lot of posts about taxes here because of a current controversy.  As I mentioned above, the Utah Constitution requires ALL income taxes to go to education. That is causing a problem. Income tax is Utah's only really progressive tax system (a system that taxes people based on their income/ability to pay). That means all the other government services are stuck being paid with regressive taxes (that tax people even if they are poor). Over time Utah's non-education budget has really lagged behind the demand on it and that lag is going to continue to increase. 

There is going to be a ballot initiative in the next election to try to remove that constitutional requirement so income taxes, a progressive tax system, can be used for a wider range of government services. But its almost certain to fail because the lobby for the schools is tremendously powerful and having your income taxes pay for schools is a lot less unpalatable than paying for everything else.  

As a stop-gap measure the Utah legislature recently passed Senate Bill 2001 which was a VERY controversial bill.  It is trying to temporarily rebalance that the Education Fund (schools) is outpacing the General Fund (general government operations) and Transportation Fund (road maintenance). It is:

- increasing the tax on grocery food by 103%, 
- increasing the tax gasoline 19%, 
- increasing the tax on diesel by 32%, 
- decreasing the income tax by 5.85%, 
- is issuing a series 'rebate' refunds to refund to the middle and lower income tax families extra income taxes collected from last year because of the changes to federal tax laws, and 
- is issuing a series of 'prebate' refunds to very low income families adversely impacted by the increase in the grocery food tax. 

There is currently a signature campaign to put the bill on hold and turn it into a ballot imitative. Today was the last date to sign that referendum, although it will still take several weeks for the counties and the Lt. Governor's office to count and certify the signatures.",1579559963,ff4bv1w
1323,1323,Sublimetribble,"It depends on where you buy them.  The state tax is 4.85%. Then each county and city has a tax as well.

6.85%, 7.25%, 7.45%, 7.6% are all the other possible sales tax rates of Salt Lake City area.  
7.75% is the highest possible tax rate ([84101](http://www.salestaxstates.com/sales-tax-calculator-utah-salt_lake_city-84101), [Salt Lake City](http://www.salestaxstates.com/sales-tax-calculator-utah-salt_lake_city), [Utah](http://www.salestaxstates.com/sales-tax-calculator-utah))

- Newer cheap sedans are **LUDICROUSLY** expensive compared to other states. Small general 4 doors that are 10 years or newer are over $150 a year to register, where as they would be well under $100 in other states. 
- SUV's, trucks (particularly older ones) are fairly cheap compared to other states which add on fee/taxes due to lower emmission standards on these vehicles

1391,1391,helix400,"&gt;when they say it will be good for low-income Utahns?

Elementary school math says that.

Suppose you have a family of 4 and your family has $45K of taxable income.  That family also spends $4,000 a year on grocery food.

The food tax increases from 1.75% to 4.85% (doesn't apply to WIC, SNAP, charity food pantries, prepared food at restaurants, etc.).  So their food tax increases from $70 to $194.  A $124 increase.  

The sales tax gets applied to gasoline.  Typically a family spends $2000 on gas a year, and with ~7% sales tax, that's $140 more.

However. the income tax rate dropped from 4.95 to 4.66%.  So that poor family's income tax drops from $2228 to $2097, giving them back $131.

Also, that family of 4 gets $500 in grocery credit.  It's $125 per person, and starts phasing down after $45K.  

The 2 child exemptions go from $565 per person to $2500.  In other words, the taxable income drops from $45K to $41,130.  Now they are paying $1917 in taxes (another $180 back in your pocket).  

In summary:

Change| Increase in Taxes
---|---
Food Tax Rate | +$124 
Gas Taxes | +$140
Income Tax Rate | -$131 
Grocery Tax Credit | -$500
Bigger dependent exemption | -$180

It means trust women and take their word seriously.  Just like any other crime, follow up, asl questions, investigate to verify.  

Most of the problem comes from disbelieving women who come forward from the beginning.  Victims are assumed to be lying or out for revenge, or regret consensus sex and are looking for an out of responsibility.  To believe women (and men!), means documenting their report and trusting their word, like we would for any other crime.  When someone is burglarized, they don’t get pushback from police and those around them, questioning if they’re lying or blaming them for the crime committed against them.  Their word is taken at face value, a report is taken and them investigated.  Even if there’s little police can actually do to find the perpetrator, the victim is still treated like a victim and believed.  

We don’t have to assume that those accused are guilty.  But it does seem that many will refuse to to condemn anyone accused until proven guilty, while also refusing to believe a victim until the causes is convicted and in jail.

These rules are effectively the same wording in the widely agreed upon HB 399 here: https://le.utah.gov/%7E2019/bills/hbillint/HB0399.pdf.  (That HB 399 got gutted by more conservative groups, killing the bill.  Then Herbert directed an administrator to do an run around the Legislature by implemeting a rule change.  The administrator proposed a one-liner rule that cased lots of fuss on ambiguity.  The rulemakers talked with numerous stakeholders again and they agreed back to the original agreed upon wording.)  

In short, the exemptions are: ""a clergy member or religious counselor who is acting substantially in a pastoral or religious capacity and not in the capacity of a health care professional; or (b)  a parent or grandparent who is a health care professional and who is acting substantially in the capacity of a parent or grandparent and not in the capacity of a health care professional""

The main point for these exemptions was in cases where a clergy and/or family member had dual roles, such as being both a licensed therapist AND a parent.

This is just the population the earth can support, that’s not even taking into account how much our current production can support and logistically supplying a population remotely of that size. This is already something we struggle with. There are still large amounts of people who don’t have access to clean water or food nutrients.



Pollution sicknesses are also a sign of overpopulation as well as spiking in sickness outbreaks much like what we see in China all the time because overpopulation drives population density increase which decreases overall population health.

1532,1532,varthalon,"There is a single underlying problem. 

Regressive taxes (sales and fuel taxes) are fairly bad taxes. They tax everyone the same - we want to tax the rich more than the poor - but regressive taxes can't do that. They can't tell if someone is rich or poor.  When you go to a register at a store to buy something (sales tax) the cashier can't tell if you're rich.  When you pump $13 bucks of fuel (fuel tax) into your car because that is all you can afford this week the pump doesn't know that. 

Utah only has one progressive tax system - INCOME TAX.  Progressive tax systems can tell if you are rich or poor and adjust how much it taxes you based on how rich or poor you are. This makes it a better tax system than others.

The problem is the Utah Constitution requires that income taxes can ONLY be spent on education. Nothing else.  That means everything else in the state is stuck being funded with tax systems that aren't as fair as income taxes are. 

Education is great! It should be funded.  But we also need roads, clean water, welfare, emergency services, and all the other things government provides.  Currently Utah is slightly over budget for what we planned to spend oneducation and is increasingly under budget for everything else. 

This bill tried to rebalance that - temporarily. 

What really needs to happen is that the Utah Constitution needs to be amended to allow the State to use income taxes, which can tax people differently depending on if they are rich or poor, on more goverment services than just education.  

However, to change the Constitution would require voters to approve the change in an election.  When that proposed change goes onto the ballot the Utah's teacher's union will scream bloody murder.  They will show up in the news with busloads of crying children begging us to not take away what little money they have. You see. Currently they are guaranteed that money. If the Constitution is changed they have to rely on the legislature to budget them the same (or more money).  I think the legislature would, education is too important not to, but would is not must and when crying little children hit the news the proposition to change the Constitution will fail.

Then next year we will have to look at raising the taxes on groceries and gas again. 

TL;dr

The ideal tax reform would be
- Change the Utah Constitution so income taxes could be used for more goverment services. 
- Maintain or increase current spending on schools
- Increase the Utah income tax on the rich and upper middle class to pay for other government services  
- Entirely remove the sales tax on food except food sold by a restaurant
- Remove all the exemption from sales tax for special interests groups (local government, churches, manufacturing, ski resorts, drill bit manufacturers, farmers, there are about 89 of these)  
- Cut the sales tax rate in half (perfectly doable if all the special interest exemptions are removed and some income tax can be used for general goverment services. 
- reduce the fuel tax rate back slightly to match the surrounding states (this cuts down on fuel smuggling which - yes, is a real thing) and use more of the sales taxes on roads.",1579810859,ffd087f

Every child that you view as an expense will be a future adult that contributes economically. Social Security (government sanctioned pyramid) takes paycheck deductions from workers and pays retirees. You'll feel the hurt if the population pyramid inverts. Even private pensions and retirement accounts will hurt with an inverted pyramid. We're trending towards a population rectangle right now.

That bill would be blocked but they could introduce another bill or bills to mimic the original bill. The political backlash for doing so would be pretty bad though. 

One of the worries about the announcement that they are pulling the bill is that this is what they may be setting up to do but I doubt it. This bill isn't really what they wanted to happen anyway - it was just a stop gap measure until the Constitutional change goes onto the ballot this November to do a more permanent fix of the problem (I've posted more about that elswhere on this thread).

1543,1543,wstu,"There are people who won't have children regardless of cost or government regulation. Utah has a fertility rate less than the 2.1 replacement rate. That is with families having 4 or 5 children. If everyone was capped at 2 children, the fertility rate might drop below 1. That sounds fine and dandy until you recognize what an extremely inverted population pyramid is like. Every adult was once a child.

Right now, our income taxes pay for the education of somebody else's children. That means socialized costs and privatized benefits. It makes having children appear selfish. Here's the thing, though. Children don't stay children. They become tax payers who pay for your Social Security. They are the productivity that makes the companies in your private retirement account profitable. 

The cost of raising a child is not limited to their K-12 education. Parents pay a lot of private costs raising children. The majority of the cost is privatized, but we all eventually benefit from those children becoming tax payers. If anything, it's selfish to want to live to a ripe old age. Retirement is a privatized benefit, but a socialized cost. It has only become worse as the average time between retirement and death increases.",1579815539,ffd8lbc

Also All of this regarding high private cost of having kids was addressed when I said people expect that the tax credit for having kids will somehow ease the financial blow and it never does. Also the social security bomb is already in the pipe and gonna explode in 10 years, popping out babies now isn’t going to prevent this. The replacement rate of approx 2 babies per couple is why I suggested a 3 cap. There is far less economic mobility than previous generations had so nobody benefits from families that can’t afford the 10 kids in having 10 kids. Also it’s selfish because there are millions of children without parents but once again my dna is best dna so screw them.",1579816382,ffda1jg

In a more serious reply though, there are a lot of economic studies showing that in the current economic environment, financial mobility has been stymied in comparison to previous generations. Generational poor is becoming a very real thing. You’re expected to land in a relatively similar income bracket as your parents now (actually the trend is you are going to be worse off than your parents). Basically the evidence shows that if you are having kids you can’t afford and need to rely on government assistance then your kids will suffer the same fate rather than become economic driving forces.


People are chomping at the bit to defend having 5+ kids. Once again I’m suggesting you pay a tax on each kid over 3, I’m not suggesting mandatory abortions for kid number 4.

That said, the legislature lacks credibility. This is the same legislature that has taken shots at the medicaid proposition, the medical marijuana proposition, and probably will attack the gerrymandering proposition in the future. To add to this, Republicans around the country have been cutting education funding. Why should anyone believe they won't hit education spending as well, which is already very low per-pupil in this state?

Even you paint the education system antagonistically in your assessment, like they're some greedy special interest. I guess all the businesses lobbying the government for tax cuts to assist their bottom line aren't then? How unreasonable that schools in this state, which exist to provide a public good, fight tooth and nail to protect themselves from being cut when we already have very low per-pupil spending in this state.

Don't kid yourself, the legislature would love to hit education funding, and amending the constitution gives them the power to do just that.

Any money that exceeds that surplus would go into the general fund. I'm all for increased education spending, but the proposed and repealed legislation would cut income taxes benefiting the affluent first and foremost and reduce the education revenue.

&gt; Regressive taxes (sales and fuel taxes) are fairly bad taxes. They tax everyone the same - we want to tax the rich more than the poor - but regressive taxes can't do that. 

It's true everyone is taxed at the same percentage, but wealthy people buy more things and buy more expensive things, in this way they are paying more.  The amount wealthy spend on something like groceries has a natural cap, so putting a sales tax only on groceries would be unfair, and you could argue taxing everything else while not taxing food sales would benefit the poor while shifting the tax burden to non-essentials which wealthy buy more of.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The goverment wouldn't not spend spend the money on schools: education is too important not to, but from the the education special interest perspective: why change having the money MUST spend on them to only having it WILL be spent on them. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can we be sure of this when Utah currently has ~~one of~~ the lowest investments in education in the country and hasn't raised the income tax to try and make it better. Based on your apparent distaste for education special interests I'm guessing you have a lot to say on this subject.

1583,1583,outdoorlos,"Quick recap on this issue:


The BLM is in the planning stages of a statewide oil and gas lease sale in June. According to the sale’s BLM e-planning website, there are seven parcels located in the Green River and Canyon Country Districts being considered for lease. 


Two of those parcels are within the Sand Flats Recreation Area, a beloved recreation area just outside of Moab city limits.


Land within the Sand Flats Recreation Area is under a “No Surface Occupancy” regulation. Parcels may be leased for oil and gas development, but no development on the surface of those plots can take place. An alternative for developers might be directional drilling, in which a surface operation on a nearby parcel facilitates horizontal drilling to extract underground resources from beneath the “No-Surface Occupancy” parcels. The practicality of directional drilling to access these particular parcels is unclear.

&gt; It’s useful to wonder what we would do if five years from now the American culture was suddenly subdued by another culture that believed theirs was the superior way of living, their god was the one true god, their language the only worthwhile speech, their history the only history that mattered. It’s a helpful exercise to ask ourselves what would happen if this young American society suddenly was rocked by cultural trauma. It’s almost unthinkable, but suspending our disbelief for a moment to consider what would happen to our grandchildren’s children if in the span of the next fifty or sixty years a killing blow was delivered to the way of life we now know is an edifying challenge.



&gt;We would no longer be allowed to speak English. In schools, offices, stores—everywhere—all communication would be conducted in some new language we didn’t understand.



&gt;Our laws would be swept away. No more regulations, acts of Congress, municipal codes, laws as we know them. Everything would be done according to some new legal system that we didn’t understand and that was created and enforced in someone else’s favor.





&gt;Our religions would be abolished. Bible studies and Communion and concepts like Manifest Destiny would be seen as prehistoric and evil. There would be no more “In God we trust” on our money. In fact, there would be no more money. The new currency would be in the hands of others. Our wealth—our bank accounts, our property, our belongings—would suddenly be of no value to us, and most of our remaining fortunes would be taken from us.



&gt;Our standards of beauty would be ridiculed. Our art would be trivialized. All of our place names would be changed. Our own names would be changed. We would be forced to celebrate peculiar holidays that glorify acts committed against us. Our children would be taken from us and sent far away, where they would be forced to forget English, forced to dress in someone else’s fashions, and forced to learn trades that prepared them for servitude. Taken from our influence, they would be given unpronounceable new names in a foreign language, they would not learn the history of their country, they would not know who they were related to, and they would receive the strong message that whatever they did, they would never be as good as those who were members of the dominant culture. Taken from us at early ages, they would not learn how to parent. Their children would receive the same negative cultural messages. Before long, our legal and educational and spiritual and social systems and beliefs would disappear. Before long, only a few old ones would remember how it used to be. 


&gt;In time—just a few years beyond that—a resurgence of interest in traditional American culture would occur. After all the land had been taken and all the art destroyed and all the worldviews that it took 250 years for this country to develop had been finally done away with, it would become fashionable for people to confess they were part American. The few people remaining who spoke English as a first language would be studied. The old photographs that had been hidden away would be brought out for interpretation. Most of the cultural artifacts, including most of those photos, would already be in museums, where they would be visited by curious tourists trying to remain open-minded about such quaint ways of life. Christian artifacts would be considered beautiful but primitive. People belonging to the then-dominant culture would become recognized authorities on the American. Some scholars and would-be authorities would even claim American identity. Those who were truly part American would possess the least authority in all things, including all things American. Those who were truly part American would be incarcerated, would drop out of school, would lose their children to new laws, would abuse themselves with whatever addictive drugs were then available, would suffer poverty, depression, anger, shame, suicide, domestic violence, and all the other inevitable effects of cultural trauma. There would be no lack of reports and meetings and task forces studying the problems of their failed assimilation. Once in a while a part American whose grandfather spoke English but whose mother did not, who had managed to obtain a colonizer’s education later in life, who worried over her children and grandchildren but didn’t know what to do besides go on, would manage against all odds to capture a position at a colonial institution and at the end of her life would wonder if she had done any good, or if there was even any good that could have been done.

Putting in the context as if it happened to me, I understand I would likely feel a lot of anger and resentment. Probably more than I truly appreciate.

I reread through some of my previous comments to see if I could determine what made me appear to be an asshole, and I can see why some of the things I said appeared to be ""combative"", and I apologize.

My aunt married a Native American, and they lived on a reservation when I was growing up. I would visit occasionally, but the world was extremely foreign and strange. My cousins from that marriage are extremely active in the Native American Social Movement, attending the protests for the Keystone Pipeline and so on.

I consider myself sympathetic to their cause. The Keystone one was super fucked up. But I also have never felt truly involved with the conversation...I am a true outsider.

With various different movements there can be varying degrees of ""acceptance"" from ""outsiders"". LGBTQ+, Transgender, etc. I find myself interacting with these groups through friends I have that identify with them, and while I don't ""belong"", I also don't find myself alienated.

At this point, I still believe my initial ""kernal"" of an idea concerning Native American cultural appropriation, but I feel I'm doing a poor job expressing the idea. I admit, I likely have a lot to learn with the subject.

I have in the past tried to understand Native Americans by comparing them to cultural groups from the past. However, I think some of these comparisons aren't fair, and aren't accurate. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever really understand what it means to be Native American...period.

Thanks again for taking the time to respond, and I apologize again if I was an asshole.",1580021967,ffkflyh

Its a auction, these Super Pacs and corporate lobbyists have been profiting from tax cuts, buying our politicians, and on the backs of the working class that pays more in taxes, have stagnant wages, and then the corporations that make more money a day then people would in multiple lifetime, pay nothing.

With normal trails I don’t really care about keeping the location secret. If people flood the trail and trample some vegetation or litter that’s not a big deal. We can fix that. And the trail will eventually become less popular. No biggie. 

But if a bunch of people flood a petroglyph site, it’ll probably get damaged. Because people who aren’t seriously invested in hiking and exploring usually don’t have as much respect for these sites. And you can’t undo that damage. And it’s not always inconsiderate people that damage these sites. Sometimes people color in the petroglyphs, thinking that it’ll help preserve them or make them prettier. But that damages the original work of art and can render some methods of studying petroglyphs ineffective. 

I’m not a fan of the insiders club thing that some hikers do. I think it’s selfish to not share all the beauty of the world with others. Maybe a beautiful trail will be the experience that kickstarts somebody’s interest in hiking or conservation.

No you don’t *seem* arrogant, this *is* arrogance. So because our culture was never given due diligence in understanding and acceptance, that’s somehow our fault? Not only that, the burden to rectify the situation is on us? The victims?

It also used to be super super super super polluting.  

 From [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Rennert)

&gt;In 2001, the Justice Department and EPA took action against Renco, filing suit against the company. The agencies demanded nearly $1 billion in fines, alleging MagCorp (a Renco Metals Inc. subsidiary) dumped toxic waste in ditches and ponds on the Great Salt Lake, Utah. The suit claimed PCB-laced sludge and dust choked the plant's plumbing, wastewater ponds, landfill and ditches, where contaminants were 12 times the allowed limit for accidental release. MagCorp maintained it was exempt from the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which requires companies to monitor certain kinds of hazardous waste. Magcorp declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy shortly after the lawsuit began and a federal judge allowed Rennert to restructure MagCorp — now U.S. Magnesium — which exempted it from previous legal liability. The EPA suit, however, remained outstanding until October 2007 when a federal judge ruled against the EPA and the Justice Department and in favor of Renco and MagCorp / US Magnesium.

&gt;Today, U.S. Magnesium is the third largest magnesium producer in the world. US Magnesium’s environmental improvements and recent track record have been substantial and include a reduction of emissions by 90% since 2000 (97% since 1989). The EPA data recognizes this as the single largest reduction in air emissions in the category of hazardous air pollutants since the TRI began in 1987 at any single facility. Also, the energy improvements in US Magnesium’s manufacturing process caused a net reduction of 100,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide emissions.  US Magnesium was the recipient of a 2004 Climate Protection Award from the EPA.  and won an MEP award in 2006 for Environmental Consciousness.",1580144758,ffqvs0r

But I'm also pointing out, as an engineer and someone who can just research and read basic sources, that it's tricky to not extract *anything* from the lake because 1) primary magnesium producing sites are globally rare, 2) very few of those sites are fully located in and controlled by Western allied states, and 3) magnesium is incredibly important, among other things, as an essential component in making strong aluminum alloys that are required to make almost all modern aircraft. Put all 3 today, and shutting down the facility entirely is a geopolitical non-starter. The real fight should be to force the local, state, and federal governments to hold US Magnesium environmentally responsible for past damages, present cleanup, and future prevention

1789,1789,4blockhead,"In a thought experiment with infinite resources, the tragedy of the commons does not come into play. In a real world, such as ours with population exceeding 7 billion humans, and displacing all other life as a consequence, it definitely is a problem. The Easter Islanders kept building statues, some with hats, right up until the brink of the collapse and that there was nothing to do to fix it.

I think we've seen some bad results with communism with its corruption and ultimate collapses in the Soviet Union and East Germany. I definitely don't want a totalitarian regime to replace our current system. I think that people need incentive to get up in the morning and go to work, and the idea that what an individual does or does not do has no effect is wrong. We need some method of providing that without leading to our destruction. I think that jingoism and nationalism is also not the route to our long term survival. The nuclear threat still looms large, as does the collapse of the natural environment via monospeciation.

&gt; However, I’m quite confident that you would mock and condemn people for being unwilling to do the same.

I don't mock people online or in real life. At least, I don't think that I do. I listened closely to the candidates' pitches in the last election in 2016. In the end, I voted for Hilary. I thought seriously about voting for [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Johnson), but rejected him because of his fatalist environmental stand which amounted to, ""Enjoy it while it lasts."" The last few years with hurricanes and soaring temperatures has driven home the point that our home on the earth is in jeopardy. Just asking people to care for the environment gets lots of lip service, but rarely any action. I first heard about the ""Greenhouse Effect"" in 1972. It was a theory at the time. We've since added lots of measuring capabilities. They all confirm the hypothesis that an increase in C02 increases the heat retention of the earth's atmosphere. I hope for survival of our species, but it's going to be touch-and-go at best. 

It's easy to insult anonymous people on the internet and to assign bad motives to them, but I don't think that you're being especially fair in your assessment. In a world with infinite resources, I would be more inline with the consumerist position and the admonition for everyone to ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps.""

To house 10,000 visitors, Moab (a town that's never really exceeded 7.000 residents) has to maintain the infrastructure for a town more than twice its size. Infrastructure is maintained by taxes, but the tourists don't pay property taxes. It's almost impossible to extract money ONLY from the tourists. So the costs go up for ALL residents, but only a small fraction actually get more money from the tourists.

Moab had to stop new house/hotel construction because its waste treatment plant is undersized and they had to make it bigger, or build a new one. That's not cheap, but it also doesn't really employ all that many new people. More cost, but barely any more employment.

If you want to buy a house in Moab, you have to compete with speculators who are just going to rent the house for much more than a reasonable mortgage payment. House prices get inflated past what locals can afford.

It's tough thing to balance.

Here it is again, with even more context: ""The decision to raise the speed limit to 65 miles per hour is based on UDOT speed studies indicating that drivers are already averaging between 65 and 70 miles per hour on the roadway despite the 55 mile per hour speed limit.""

&gt; I don’t know the specific road you are talking about,

Legacy Parkway, as I said. Follow the link for more info.

&gt; but they don’t just “raise the speed limit because people are speeding”. That would be ridiculous.

Agreed that it's ridiculous, but see above. Both of my quotes *are from UDOT's own announcement,* which you can read in its entirety by following the link I posted. Here is is again for convenience:

Here's the link to the actual law that says you must move over:

Please don't do this, it's far more dangerous, especially if a car tries to move right to let other traffic through while you're cruising up on the right. I know it's annoying, but please try to ""encourage"" people to move right before opting to pass on the right (e.g. flash headlights).

Honestly, I wish police would enforce speed limits a bit less, enforce impeding traffic more, and hand out tickets for reckless driving for passing on the right. 

[Here's the relevant law for passing on the right](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title41/Chapter6a/41-6a-S705.html):

&gt; (1)	The operator of a vehicle may overtake and pass on the right of another vehicle only:
&gt;
&gt; (a)	when the vehicle overtaken is making or preparing to make a left turn; or
&gt;
&gt; (b)	on a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for two or more lines of vehicles moving lawfully in the direction being traveled by the overtaking vehicle.
&gt;
&gt; (2)	The operator of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle on the right only under conditions permitting the movement with safety.
&gt;
&gt; (3)	Except for a person operating a bicycle, the operator of a vehicle may not overtake and pass another vehicle if the movement is made by driving off the roadway.
&gt;
&gt; (4)	A violation of this section is an infraction.

The important parts are 1b and 2, and the emphasis there is on safety. Personally, I think changing lanes right before overtaking someone on the right is often dangerous, especially when the speed difference is fairly high because you're merging right into their blind spot (e.g. they see you approaching, check the right lane, and then move as you enter their blind spot).",1580404771,fg0ca0f

2178,2178,plat_of_zion,"My two cents: Lehi is super boring. And while it has added jobs recently, they have designed the area very poorly so that it's basically all strip malls with generic chain restaurants. They really missed an opportunity there over the last decade, but I digress.

My point is that if it were me, I'd live somewhere more exciting. Salt Lake City and Provo are both connected to Lehi via the Frontrunner train, so if your work is near a station, you could look anything along the rail line. Provo is very Mormon, but has a nice downtown and restaurants that are really fantastic (Black Sheep, Communal, etc). SLC is quiet for a big city, but is obviously the most cosmopolitan place in the state. 

If you're into the outdoors, you could look for something near American Fork Canyon, which is close to Lehi but also a great area for hiking and camping. Home prices are pretty high over there, but you might find a rental that works. 

Lehi doesn't have a lot of crime and if you're a homebody you'll be fine anywhere. 

One other thing to consider is that both rents and home prices have been skyrocketing in Utah generally lately, and in the Lehi specifically thanks to all the new tech jobs. Not sure there's much advice to give on this per say, but just something to be aware of. Some of the other commenters' suggestions to look in Herriman or Saratoga Springs are a response to this. But those areas also really cater to families (they try to have decent schools etc). Since you're single and presumably don't need good schools for kids, you could easily live in a slightly ""rougher"" but more fun part of town like 9th and 9th or everything between downtown SLC and the U of U.

At this point, even if housing prices collapsed as much as they did in the recession (which is very unlikely) they still won't fall back to where they were when these friends first started waiting/hoping for a turn in the market. Meanwhile, their wages have mostly stagnated compared to price appreciation, which means that even if they're saving they're actually getting further and further away from actually buying a house. 

It's pretty brutal out there.

On the plus side, interest rates are super low right now.

1. It's going to be crazy busy. Yes, you'll find a dispersed site somewhere, but it'll be hard to find a desirable spot with easy access to the canyon and the park without it being pretty busy, with constant OHV traffic and the rumble of generators.

2. Even if you head that way and find a good spot, avoid Little Wild Horse on a holiday weekend. It is a constant stream of people and congestion. It's a beautiful canyon, but these days you should only visit on a weekday or in the dead of winter. (The good news is there are plenty of other non-technical slots nearby- consider Crack, Chute, Ding (Dang is a bit trickier) or a little further way, Moonshine Wash.)

3. One word- [gnats](https://watchingtheworldwakeup.blogspot.com/2009/05/road-trip-part-3-all-about-cedar-gnats.html). Memorial Day weekend in the Swell is peak. If you \*must\* go, bring headnets for all. (I'm not kidding.)

Now that I've pooped all over your plans, I'll recommend an alternative- Red Canyon. Several great campgrounds (along highway 12 or down by Tropic reservoir) and tons of great dispersed sites. Higher altitude = no gnats, but it's almost always melted out by Memorial Day. Wonderful hiking through spectacular hoodoos on numerous trails, or in nearby Bryce Canyon NP.

2324,2324,BobbyWasabiMk2,"Well it's just vocal people are annoying. My point was that I've run into more vocal atheists than I have vocal religious people. You'd expect Utah to be pretty vocal about their LDS identity, but in reality everyone here has been super polite about their religion. They ask if I'm interested in coming, I say no, and they wish me a nice day and move on. Eve my friends don't press it, by all means they said if I have any questions they'll be happy to answer them, but they don't force the topic.

On the other hand when I visit my friends back in Seattle, a lot of them just see a church and the first thing out of their mouth is something along the lines of ""religion is a mental disease"".

Sure, vocal religious people exist and are annoying, but they're kind of comical in my opinion. That group of Westboro Baptisits holding a sign that says ""HOMOSEXUALITY IS A SIN"" ""NO FAITH IN JESUS WILL LAND YOU IN HELL"" is kind of funny. I just smile at them and laugh, like ok there buddy.

There is no such thing as recall for members of Congress.  States cannot enact laws that abridge the Constitutionally designated terms of office for House and Senate members.  They can only be removed by expulsion by their own house.  Quinn's bill will likely fail (as all the other Utah legislative bills that have, in the past, tried to [abridge a Senators power](https://www.deseret.com/2006/1/24/19934349/legislators-seek-say-over-u-s-senators#0), or [repeal the 17th amendment](https://www.ksl.com/article/154071/stephenson-proposes-soft-repeal-of-17th-amendment)) , or it will be ruled unconstitutional.

Nixon signed the law that created HMOs back in the 1970’s and “for profit” healthcare began its out-of-control rise back then. The only way to curb these skyrocketing prices is to have government regulation  of the healthcare industry.

When you're school has 3,000 students, it's very easy for children to be invisibly bullied. When there are 200, not so much. When your community has 10,000 people in it, people can have invisible problems, less so with 3,000 people, especially when most everyone goes the same church.

So, rules and regulations which are designed to provide safety in huge cities don't make sense in, say, Roosevelt, Utah. I can see why this sort of thing came about and I really wouldn't have a problem with it.

It took Trump 30 months to equal what took Obama 8 years.

These are best guesses, seeing as the data is being blocked until after the election. (See below) If/when a democratic president did/does the same thing, how would you feel?

www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mnuchin-seeks-delay-of-proposed-disclosure-of-secret-service-spending-on-presidential-travel-until-next-year/2020/01/08/8769ea28-30da-11ea-91fd-82d4e04a3fac_story.html

Lastly, the argument “but Obama” doesn’t apply here. Trump, not Obama, has funneled millions of taxpayer dollars into his own pockets. Every time he goes to his own resort, he charges the American people to rent those rooms for the security entourage that follows him. Not to mention the money that was spent at his hotel in DC for the inauguration. There are numerous instances of Trump enriching himself directly with taxpayer dollars. The only taxpayer money that should be going into his bank account is his $400,000 presidential salary, and that’s it.

Bonus round: If you feel the Benghazi investigations were justified, and that they weren’t a giant waste of time and money for political theater, so be it. 70% of the country sure felt like the impeachment trial wasn’t a waste of time, because 70% of the country, based on polls, wanted witnesses to be called. The impeachment investigation and trial were not a waste of time or money. They were an attempt to have congressional oversight that was ultimately blocked by tribalism.",1580872566,fgkseqx

2644,2644,WikiTextBot,"**Pitman shorthand**

Pitman shorthand is a system of shorthand for the English language developed by Englishman Sir Isaac Pitman (1813–1897), who first presented it in 1837. Like most systems of shorthand, it is a phonetic system; the symbols do not represent letters, but rather sounds, and words are, for the most part, written as they are spoken. As of 1996, Pitman shorthand was the most popular shorthand system used in the United Kingdom and the second most popular in the United States.One characteristic feature of Pitman shorthand is that unvoiced and voiced pairs of sounds (such as /p/ and /b/ or /t/ and /d/) are represented by strokes which differ only in thickness; the thin stroke representing ""light"" sounds such as /p/ and /t/; the thick stroke representing ""heavy"" sounds such as /b/ and /d/. Doing this requires a writing instrument responsive to the user's drawing pressure: specialist fountain pens (with fine, flexible nibs) were originally used, but pencils are now more commonly used.

&gt;The three voting (at least partially) against impeachment: Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who has already said he will switch parties to become a Republican, longtime Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, and Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, who voted in favor of the first article of impeachment (abuse of power) but not the second (obstruction of Congress).

&gt;Van Drew and Golden are both in their first term. Van Drew, who represents a conservative district in southern New Jersey, announced over the weekend that he would switch parties, although his vote was still counted with Democrats’ on Wednesday night.

&gt;Golden represents a district in Maine that was a Democratic stronghold for 20 years but elected Trump by 10 points in 2016. Fewer people voted for Golden than his Republican opponent in 2018, but he won his seat in the midterms under ranked-choice voting because he was the second choice for voters who picked third-party candidates.

&gt;Understand the impeachment process, from its history to what comes next. Explore the full guide here.

&gt;Peterson might not seem like an endangered Democrat: He’s in his 15th term in Congress, representing a western Minnesota district. But Trump dominated in his district in 2016, and Peterson has held onto his seat in part because he’s bucked the Democratic Party in the past. He’s been a longtime impeachment skeptic, voting against the impeachment resolution in October.

You rely on mob mentality to assert strength in your point when the truth of the matter is that your position is weak and nonsensical. That's why you keep referring to my condition instead of keeping to specific and clear accusation.

As for how I proved it, I'll summarize: if you believe that this is an acceptable standard of how any kind of charge or hearing should go, then you basically abandoned the constitution. Schumer was right when saying that this wasnt a trial by any sense of the word. If this was, it would be a mistrial because the defense wasn't allowed to prepare witnesses in the discovery phase. 

If we apply what you deemed an acceptable standard and Romney's reasons behind his guilty decision to criminal and civil proceedings, you violated the most important rule to any kind of definition of liberty and freedom; the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial. Romney demanded that Trump prove his innocence when it was the house's job to prove his guilt which they admitted they couldnt and votrd to impeach anyway. Trump acted in according to his constitutionally granted and protected duties on both counts. Contempt of congress is a made up charge. DC Vs Nixon reinforces a president's claim to executive privilege.  This is why it is anti american to support impeachment. You are finding him guilty without proof that he's guilty.

3256,3256,FoxInAWoolSweater,"Wtf? Ok first of all I don't think you realize what ""anti-human"" means, but for the sake of argument I'll use it as ""going against human nature."" 

How is working towards sustainability ""anti-human""? The human race had a minimal impact for thousands of years up until 100-150 years ago. But you are telling me that it is anti human to want to preserve what we have now? What about everyone who lived before? Were they ""anti-human""? 

If we need mining and energy to make more sustainable resources isn't it still worth *not* spending energy on obtaining and refining resources that are destructive? Regardless, why the hell does it mean it's ok to destroy something of great value to someone? 

I spend nearly every weekend outside and vacation to amazing and beautiful places every year. These place inspire me more than many can know. I don't want to see those places sold to people who don't see the beauty that deserves to be preserved.

Whether you believe in climate change or not you'd have to be extremely ignorant to believe that humanity in the past 100 years hasn't polluted the air we breathe, destroyed rain forests, or dumped *14 BILLION pounds of plastic* into our oceans. So forgive me for being ""anti-human"" as I try like mad to preserve what we have so maybe my grandkids can one day experience the beautiful things that inspired me. 

IMO not feeling inclined to protect and preserve is a sign of ignorance and in so many ways laziness. We live in a place where everyone needs a new phone, a new car, new clothes, video game consoles, junk food, etc. Sure, wanting and buying things for our leisure could be considered human nature, but it's a pretty fucked up way of excusing our behaviors.

(Yellowstone is a big exception - some areas are too commercialized for my taste.) So many states, including our own, have gone down a route of tourism tha doesn't preserve or protect like it should. The federal government doesn't turn a profit from national monuments and parks. But UT wants money, and my fear is in order to make the money they want they will commercialize as much as possible.

3258,3258,randomobserverafar,"&gt;  I don't think you realize what ""anti-human"" means 

Anti-human means going against what is good for humans. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What about everyone who lived before? Were they ""anti-human""? \\

Our ancestors would of done anything to live in our civilization. Human impact on nature has made life immensely better for all of us. The fact a heat wave is a mere inconvenience rather than a life threatening situation is testament to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; still worth *not* spending energy on obtaining and refining resources that are destructive? 

By what measure is that destructive? Is your AC destructive to your health? A dam might disrupt loval ecosystems but they make clean and abundant energy for humans. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Regardless, why the hell does it mean it's ok to destroy something of great value to someone? 

By that logic we should stop all development since I can declare all land is great value to me. I also don't see any mining or oil extraction as ""destructive"" to the land to the extent that it becomes unusable. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; humanity in the past 100 years hasn't polluted 

Where did I saw we didn't? The past 100 years has been the most amazing progress for humanity as life spans have increased, extreme poverty has plummeted, literacy rates have exploded, hunger is at historic lows etc. Life without energy is far worse than life with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  not feeling inclined to protect and preserve is a sign of ignorance 

And wanting to preserve every inch in the name of  ""minimizing human impact"" is a sign of ignorance. When is it okay to have impact on nature? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Sure, wanting and buying things for our leisure could be considered human nature, but it's a pretty fucked up way of excusing our behaviors. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's also a sign of immense progress for humanity. The fact we have the time and resources to do all those things without being a king is a sign we are doing something right. I don't think you truly grasp how good we have it.

I see your point about growing as a human civilization and how life is much better. I completely agree! However I believe it's entirely possible and even imperative we keep developing to where we don't impact our environment as much as we have been. We were smart enough to evolve into what we are now, we are certainly smart enough to continue to evolve. 

I don't know how to quote parts - but where you said ""I also don't see any mining or oil extraction as ""destructive"" to the land to the extent that it becomes unusable."" This happens all over the place actually. There are many places where the minerals and metals mined have poised the soil or waters around it. There a beautiful streams in southwest CO that are toxic and hazardous due to mining. It's not as obvious as one might think, but it's certainly happening. 

As for having impact on nature.. I don't know if you are religious or not but in mostly world religions and especially in christianity there is an expectation to be stewards and watch over the planet. I am not religious, but I do feel there is a amount of respect that should be shown to other living things. In a huge way a small group of organisms impacted negatively can cause pretty big problems down the road. Furthermore, most people value and prefer a clean home/environment to live in.

I don't know what the stats are on Utahans that approve of what he did, but anecdotally I've seen far more ""Good for him!"" than ""He's a traitor!"" — although unfortunately I have seen some of the latter. It seems the author jumped on some of those examples to write a hot take about all of Utah.

But while I disagree with the generalization the author made, the point he makes is still one that can't be ignored. I'm continually surprised that members of any Christian faith can claim to be 100% republican without at least a _little_ shame or disappointment. Are some so blindly loyal to the name ""republican"" that they can't see what the party has become? It's drifted from the morals and values it used to hold dear. The party's top leaders are either morally bankrupt or are unwilling to stand up to the morally bankrupt.

Any college student proposing a study like this would fail his research ethics course. It's not only wrong but seems like a gigantic HIPAA violation. Yes, yes, driving is a privilege, not a right, but it's hard to even get to work or buy groceries in Utah without driving, much less visit the national parks that our state is famous for. Consent extracted under duress doesn't count as consent.

I can't imagine what valid research purpose there is for my SSN. The U. is well-acquainted with generating anonymized data, although I grant that it's hard to truly anonymize things like birthdates and ZIP codes. If we can conduct double-blind studies on medical procedures, we can definitely find a way to conduct research without giving the U the address and social security number of every person in the state.

Utah's unique ability to provide huge datasets for tracking things like genetic diseases is a legacy we should be proud of, but it seems like nobody even thought about ethics on this one.  That needs to change.

see an avalanche bury a parking lot full of cars in a mere 25 seconds. there have been multiple other avalanches adn slides that have shut down the road up the canyon and into alta, leaving as much as 9 feet of debris.

residents of the town of alta were forbidden from leaving their homes due to ""extreme avalanche danger"" according to the utah avalanche center. this is the first multiple-day interlodge in approximately 15 years.

a total of 41.5 inches of snow has fallen in february, and we're only the 9th day in. the snowfall has been obstructive enough to literally snow people in, as windows and doors are blocked by snowpiles taller than 7 feet.

after three days, little cottonwood canyon reopened for travel on sunday, feburary 9th, 2020 and residents were allowed out of their homes, many going to catch up on the great powder skiing they missed while inside.",1581272288,fh3tx3e

When Willard was at Bain Capitol he resuscitated Monsanto's tarnished image since the effects of Agent Orange had come to light. This let Monsanto market poison more effectively to us.

Also while at Bain Capitol Mittens invested heavily in a company named Stericycle. Their job was to dispose of aborted babies as medical waste.

When he was Mass governor he gave us all the fabulous gift of the framework of what would later be called Obamacare.

In 2007 he was introduced to Joseph Cofer Black. He was the head of the counter terrorism branch of the CIA. Mittens made Cofer Black his national security advisor during the 2012 campaign. Cofer Black later went on to be a board member at the oil company Burisma. The very same Ukrainian oil company the Hunter Biden worked at, at the same time as Hunter.

In 2012 he threw the last 2 debates with Obama after he destroyed Obama in the 1st thus throwing the election.

In the 2016 election he gave an hour and a half speech attempting to discredit and impugn Donald Trump.

In 2018 Willard begged Donald Trump for his endorsement as Utahs Senator which was given to him, likely winning him the election.

Mittens is the first senator in the history of the USA to vote to convict a POTUS of his own political party. Before being questioned about his reasoning for his vote he attempted to hide behind his faith to deflect the righteous wrath of his constituents for his backstabbing behavior.

3445,3445,outdoorlos,"The Trump administration approved new management plans Thursday for the reduced Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, land-use road maps that could pave the way for more mining and drilling in southern Utah while providing, critics say, minimal protection to the cultural and natural treasures their designations were meant to safeguard.


The final plans largely reflect the preferred alternatives released last summer.


One noteworthy difference: The Bureau of Land Management reversed its proposal to return livestock grazing along some 40 miles of the Escalante River, a notion that drew fire from the groups that invested heavily in restoring the fragile desert corridor. With backing from Utah officials, the BLM previously had removed cattle from the river running through the Escalante Canyons portion of the Staircase monument and it has since become a popular hiking destination.


“A silver lining on a very dark day,” said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. “That was the right decision, but there are still a lot of problems with grazing in the [Grand Staircase] monument on lands where it had been eliminated and retired.”
SUWA is among the numerous groups suing to invalidate President Donald Trump’s 2017 order reducing the monuments by a combined 2 million acres.

Such as? There were a number of things I liked and disliked about her, so I watched the debate and she failed to impress me on everything I agreed on with her. She seemed more intent on bashing Romney than actually proposing solutions to problems, and I was worried she'd put her party over Utah once elected. I wasn't a big fan of Romney either because he seemed to change completely after winning the nomination in 2012, but I have been happily surprised by him, both in the debate and as a Senator.

&gt; Utah could be a great state if not for its refusal to vote D.

Utah _is_ a great state! I disagree with the Republican majority quite often, but they've done a pretty good job at not screwing our state up too much. I'm worried that if we shift Democrat, we'll end up in a worse situation as politicians play ""catch up"".

GOP has done a terrible job with the state from every single aspect. Switching to Democrat would be immediate and huge boost not for the state but for the country which Utah would then benefit.

So why do your republicans and my crony capitalist Dems still provide subsidies to polluters who continue to destroy our environment and literally kill their children and grand children?

&gt;For those who are joking about “Mormons love polygamy and hate gays” - this bill is actually getting supported because it’s used to keep women trapped in polygamy. The men who (forcefully or coerce) women into polygamy use the illegality as a threat. “You think you can leave? You’ve been in an illegal marriage so nobody can help you. You have no legal options and if you leave you’re going to be alone and die in the streets” kind of stuff.  
&gt;  
&gt;State Senator Derek Kitchen (an openly gay man), sued Governor Herbert in 2014 regarding gay marriage equality, which helped lead to nationwide gay marriage. He was on local radio this morning and voiced his support for this bill to help those trapped in the marriage have a way out.  
&gt;

3739,3739,thediasent,"&gt;like the freedom to control one’s own reproductive rights?

Their argument is better than yours: You cant kill people you dont want. To them, a fetus is a human being. Science agrees.

&gt;Or same sex marriage

That's a religious argument. Marriage is a religious term. It can be won by removing the term marriage from the government and call it a domestic partnership or civil union. That way it doesnt matter if you are gay or a straight guy with another straight guy. 

You have to be careful of modifiers. The Christian part modifies the word Conservative. Meaning they want to conserve christian values whereas a conservative wants to preserve the founding principles of a country. Thats why white nationalist is racist, but a nationalist isnt because race isnt factored into nationalism.

&gt;So why do your republicans and my crony capitalist Dems still provide subsidies to polluters who continue to destroy our environment and literally kill their children and grand children? 

Because the government as a whole wants to take all your rights. Crony capitalism allows the government to control trade. 

No scientific data supports this conclusion. Climate change is real, but the scale is in hundreds of years, not singular we are looking at 20-50 generations to solve it, not 1/2. I'm using the same report that you are using to claim you are going to die in 10 years.

&gt;It’s not. It’s exponentially cheaper and more reliable in the long run. Every study in the world proves this. And honestly who gives a fuck? You wanna talk about capitalism? Let’s be the world leader in “crazy tech”.

No, it isnt. It's more expensive, solar panels dont work on cloudy days and turbines dont spin when it's not windy. Nuclear is the happy medium. I just cited Germany's rolling brown outs and reliance on Russia to substantiate this.

Capitalism relies on demand. The market moves based on the wants and needs of the consumers. When it comes to capitalism, you cant be the world leader in crazy tech unless the people want crazy tech.

&gt;Republicans are anti innovation unless it lines the pockets of rich people. Dems are for science for science sake if it means bettering society.

I can disprove this statement with a specific example: Gender dysphoria. Breaking out the scientific method, there is no way that the gender brain scan study could draw the conclusion that transgendered brains function more like the gender they subscribe to because the test group were post HRT. This is the very block that will bring the whole stance on how we treat gender dysphoria crumbling to the ground.

4058,4058,DeadSeaGulls,"Ogden is much more diverse and has as much culture as any similar sized midwestern town. In utah it's considered a rough city in terms of crime and safety. It's crime rate is 61% higher than national average and it's likely because there is a large income disparity within the city. If you live in a nicer area, you're fine. If you opt for the cheapest rent/mortgage you can find in the rough part of town, you'll probably fall victim to property crime at some point, like a car/home break-in etc...     
You have the same access to outdoor recreation as logan, with much more of a night life.    
Ogden has some neat history surrounding it's roughness.  Ogden was center for gambling, prostitution, and opium dens in the late 1800's.  During prohibition Ogden did fuckall to enforce anything so Ogden became a gateway for bootleggers moving liquor and beer around country and tons of speakeasies popped up.    
Prostitution remained a big problem into the 60's.   The crack down on the lawlessness of the city and decrease of railroad passengers resulted in an economic decline and is why there's a lot of abandoned buildings in part of the city that was formerly booming. 
However, in the last 15-20 years the city has started to boom again.  Run down areas are steadily getting revitalized, there are new venues and a summer concert series that brings in a great variety of really good artists, and property values are on the rise.  
I'd have no problem living in Ogden if the salary was right.   
If you're planning on commuting from Ogden to Logan for work, keep in mind that the mountain pass between brigham city and cache valley (locally called sardine canyon even though the existing round bypasses the actual sardine canyon), can get very sketchy in the winters.  If your job permits working from home on snow days, it shouldn't be an issue.  That's still a longer commute than I'd want to take, but I know plenty of people who do it.",1581954691,fhxhszo

I honestly don't know if there is still a local scene as my concert going days have been over for a few years. We have the more popular metal bands come through as often as other places I would say. I saw slayer and lamb of god here and that show was incredible but that was back in like 08 or 09.

4067,4067,Mouniphilos,"Logan has 4 bars and only one of them is halfway decent. The one state liquor store is well stocked with many kinds of beer including Utah's excellent brands of craft beer (ironic but true). Restaurants stock decent beers as long as you buy food. Utah just raised it's maximum ABV to 5% (outside of the state liquor store) so that has helped with selections at the grocery store (where it's only legal to sell beer below 5%). Don't count on much night life except for Logan's theatre scene. Ogden (45 min) and Salt Lake (1.5 hrs) have much better night life.

Logan itself (and maybe North Logan) are pretty nice places to live that aren't overly crowded with majority conservative mormon populations. This is due to the high concentrations of students and professors from the university. I wouldn't recommend any of the smaller towns in Cache Valley even if the housing prices are attractive. After you declare your disinterest in their religious dogmas, they tend more to just ignore you and/or passive-aggressively judge you and don't let their kids play with your kids.

Overall Cache Valley is a safe place for raising a family, but the hardest part is winter time when there are very few indoor activities to do with kids. However, the outdoor scene is always prime, like sledding, snowshoeing, and skiing (Beaver Mountain Resort is 45 min away).",1581957979,fhxmzys

I've gotten an annual pass for the last 3 years and gotten more than my money's worth. Logan in particular has cache national Forest 5 minutes away from downtown. It's literally that close.

My opinion on the bar scene in Logan is that locals tried for a very long time to get rid of them (Mormons view drinking as a sin, mind you) which you might notice by the signage at the owl (local bar). Lately though things seem to have loosened up. Not sure if you've ever been to the 'old Chicago' chain, but one opened up here a few months ago and it's *very popular*. If that's any indication, I think more of those types of places will be moving in real soon (at least I hope). Regardless, it's easy enough to have some drinks with friends at your home (liquor is sold at the liquor store here, and recently the state has approved higher abv beers in the grocery, while reducing legal limit to 0.05).

I wanted to rattle off a list of experiences, but after trying to be succinct, it was still wayyyyy too much.

4157,4157,varthalon,"Income Tax  
Income tax goes entirely to education.  
It lowered the income tax on everyone.  The poor *normally* don't receive a benefit to an income tax reduction because they already don't pay income tax. However this one added refundable tax credits for the poor. The middle class got a huge increase in the taxpayer tax credit that they usually get. 

Fuel Tax  
Fuel tax goes entirely to transportation infrastructure.  
It raised the fuel tax on everyone.  
Fuel tax is a pretty crappy tax because its regressive (it is charged the same to everyone regardless of if they are rich or poor) Utah unfortunately didn't increase their fuel tax for almost 20 years which put them well behind the curve in road maintenance. 

Sales Tax  
Grocery sales tax goes to general state goverment operations and transportation infrastructure.  
It raised the grocery sales tax on everyone.   
Sales tax is also a pretty crappy tax because its regressive (again, it lacks the ability to tax the rich or the poor differently. Utah *normally* uses sales tax to fund pretty much everything other than schools and roads. However because of the failure to keep fuel taxes in pace with rising costs of road maintenance (due to population growth and inflation) almost a quarter of sales taxes are currently being diverted to road infrastructure which leaves the rest of the state's budget critically underfunded... things like food stamps, enforcing safety regulations, etc. 

Until Utah finally did their first gas tax increase in a decade about three years ago UDOT was actually starting to convert minor roads BACK into gravel roads to save on maintenance costs (insert jokes here about I-15 in Lehi currently being gravel). 

Things like reflective paint cost money. Especially in Utah where the sanding/salting of the roads and snowplows chew it up faster. Money that taxpayers don't want to spend. 

Decreases in income tax have ZERO to do with road maintenance - the Utah Constitution requires 100% of income taxes to go into Education. Because income tax is the only really useful progressive tax system (a system that can differentiate between the rich and the poor) and it can only be used for Education, we are stuck using shitty regressive taxes to pay for everything else.",1582046523,fi0x4lw

You can do absolutely nothing, walk in to a polling place (early now until March 3 itself), and vote.

**Not registered to vote?**

Utah has same-day voter registration; an eligible voter can walk into a polling place, register to vote, get a provisional ballot (for the party of their choice), follow the instructions given, and their vote will count.

**Republicans**

An unaffiliated voter had until February 3 to register as a Republican to receive that ballot in the mail.  That deadline has passed, and because the Republican primary is closed, they must now early vote in person or vote on March 3 person.  They can re-register as Republicans at the polling place.

**Democrats**

An unaffiliated voter had until February to register as a Democrat to receive that ballot in the mail, but because the Democratic primary is open to all voters, a voter has until February 25 to inform their County Clerk that they would like to receive a Democratic presidential primary ballot in the mail.

An unaffiliated voter can also walk into an early or March 3 polling place, request a Democratic primary ballot, and vote.

For those who turn 18 before November 2, 2020, but are still 17, they can fully participate in primary elections.

Mail ballots must be postmarked by March 2 or dropped off to a polling place or approved ballot collection box before 8 PM March 3.

That would require a proposition on the ballot during the election. If that happened then the teacher's union, PTA, and other education special interests would view it as an attack against education funding and lobby extentively against it. Last time it was tried there were TV commercials of little children crying in school buses. It would be very difficult to make the public understand that increasing income tax to replace sales and fuel taxes doesn't mean reducing education spending in the face of those types of commercials.

Tax on eating out  
Currently counties are allowed to impose a tax of upto 1% on restaurants. Those funds have to be used to support tourism (all the counties except Salt Lake can use it for public saftey, museums, etc. SL has to spend a portion of what they get on national advertising for the entire state like the ""Ski Utah"" and ""Mighty 5"" ad campaigns. I actually think it would be a great idea to exempt grocery food from sales tax but impose a state level restaurant tax of the same amount on food sold through restaurants.

All of the national parks require backcountry permits to backpack overnight. Arches and Zion will be busy, but if you get a backcountry permit you'll largely have that area (specified by the permit) to yourselves.

There are countless great places to backpack in Southern Utah outside of national parks, though these require a little more planning. Some of the more popular (and fantastic!) of these areas now require you to reserve a permit in advance (examples include Coyote Gulch and the Grand Gulch canyons.) But others- including most all of the canyons in the Robbers Roost area and plenty of others in the Escalante area- do not. Not sure whether Dark Canyon requires permits now, but that's another primo backpacking destination. Also consider Capitol Reef National Park- less visited, and mid-April is a perfect time to visit Halls Creek Narrows in the Southern end of the park.

4326,4326,landohamlincoln,"Cool story bro. Did you actually read it? 

&gt; Despite its attractiveness as a policy approach to policy-makers, it is unclear whether place branding represents an effective, ‘high-road’ approach to business attraction. Empirical evidence and research are lacking regarding whether place branding is effective in the attraction and retention of business (Bergqvist, 2009). Understanding the effectiveness of place branding is important due to the high costs required to undertake these policy initiatives. Establishing such place brands requires the allocation of scarce public resources. From a perspective of public policy, therefore, it is necessary to understand whether local governments are prudent in their allocation of resources.

&gt;governments have been heavily criticized for misuse of place branding, particularly when focusing on logos and slogans to whitewash local issues in an attempt to create a positive image (Braun et al., 2014; Hall &amp; Hubbard, 1996; Pasquinelli, 2010). Furthermore, place branding has been criticized for being used by local and regional governments as a panacea for a wide array of issues, without clear evidence for effectiveness

&gt;if unnecessary place-branding elements are being developed, the cost will be high and the cost–benefit ratio will again be poor, even if place branding is perceived as an effective strategy.

&gt;place branding should not be undertaken unless there a ‘product’ that exists in the community and is worthy of promotion In the context of business attraction, it means that place branding should only be employed to attract business and industry that fits into the existing local economy, and thus strengthens an existing sector of the local or regional economy, rather than attempting to attract businesses in sectors that do not already have a local or regional foothold.

&gt;Typically these failures are associated with superficial branding attempts. From 2008 to 2012 the town of Innisfil, Ontario, spent C$42,000 on developing a new logo (Kirkby, McMahon, Westwood, Taylor-Vaisey, &amp; Rekai, 2013). The poorly executed place branding resulted in negative national media attention and was held as an example of government wastefulness. Additionally, the municipality of Port Hope, Ontario, spent C$100,000 (or 1% of its 2012 annual budget) in a failed attempt to develop a new logo

&gt;place branding’s effectiveness is limited by failing to promote through the ideal communication channels. Indeed, the channel of communication actually can be viewed as an integral component of the place brand. The site selectors were strongly in favour of detailed, business-relevant information about the community that could be easily accessed through websites. The practitioners, however, demonstrated a fundamental lack of understanding regarding where the site selectors would acquire their information by relying on more traditional information dissemination. Cities and regions are therefore not providing sufficient information or leveraging contemporary channels of communication, limiting their effectiveness in promoting their locational advantages.

&gt;As place branding becomes an increasingly present part of local economic development, local and regional governments must be careful to undertake it in a way that is both effective and an efficient use of public resources. As such, the elements meaningful to a target audience (i.e. a business considering relocation) must be considered, rather than appealing to a subgroup unlikely to invest in the community. Without this alignment, the brand will fail and the potential for attracting investment will be hampered, as it will be difficult to align or enhance assets to present any form of competitive advantage. 

Interesting read but there’s still nothing in this study that justifies the specific point of your post. Overall it suggests that policy makers have no clue about developing economic hot spots because they refuse to listen to the businesses that make up those hot spots. 

Of course there’s an argument to be made for specific, regional, place branding but spending millions of dollars for a new state flag design simply doesn’t hold any water based on the merits of this study alone.",1582150549,fi4xooq

I agree though about spending the use of tax dollars wisely.

You are demanding evidence that it’s not a good use of public funds, but you really haven’t cited anything that supports your position other than your own opinion. So… “I’m still waiting for evidence which you can’t deliver for good reason. It doesn’t exist. Prove why tax payers [shouldn’t] foot the bill. Just provide even one source that justifies it. Just one. I’m not asking you to write a dissertation on the subject. Just provide one source that shows its economically beneficial. Just one.” My guess is that there isn’t a study on this specific topic (e.g. economic impact of state flag redesign) because it is obvious that branding (which fair or not, I am including the state flag as part of), if done effectively and efficiently, is worth it because of the return on investment.

- it's iconic
- it's simple

4397,4397,northrim,"OK, here are your options:

Bryce. This is the easiest. There are large, established Forest Service (not Park Service) campgrounds in Red Canyon (right along Hwy 12, West of the Park) and down by Tropic Reservoir. Sometimes you can reserve sites in advance at Forest Service campgrounds. There's also a smaller, very nice ""Equestrian"" campground (you don't have to have a horse to use it) just South of Hwy 12 en route to Thunder Mountain trailhead. If these don't work, you have plenty of easily-accessed dispersed sites. Best bet: head North of Hwy 12 (just West of Bryce) on FR117, within first couple miles, spur roads leading off to either side lead to a couple dozen dispersed sites. Also FR121 (next road to West) heading North leads to some nice sites, though not as many and quicker to fill up. The road heading South from Hwy 12 past Tropic Reservoir passes many spur roads with sites, though these are a bit less convenient to Hwy 12 &amp; Bryce proper... (Someone else mentioned Kodachrome. Campground fills up fast, not super-0convenient to Bryce, and I'm not aware of good dispersed options right around there. I will say though that the showers at that campground are AMAZING.)

Zion. This is trickier. Couple ideas- first, take the Rockville road up onto Gooseberry Mesa (South of Hwy 9), which has plenty of dispersed campsites. Rough road, but fine for your rig. Early good site would be right at the trailhead for the Wire Mesa mountain bike trail. (use [trailforks.com](https://trailforks.com) to find it.) Another similar idea would be the trailhead for Guacamole mtn bike trail, just North of Hwy 9.

Arches. It's always a zoo camping within 20 miles of Moab these days, but you can almost always find a serviceable (if charmless) spot at Willows or North Klondike trailheads North of Moab off 191 (East side.)

Capitol Reef. I have less good info here. I'd try BLM roads on either side of 24 between Hanksville and Caineville. Alternatively you could try up on Boulder Mountain (East side of Highway 12 South of Torrey), but snow might still be an issue

Grand Staircase. More an area than a distinct park with a controlled entrance. Many dispersed options. Hole in the Rock road as many side roads leading to sites.

I feel like Utah is starting to become pretty socially liberal but economically still aligned to conservative beliefs (trickle-down economics, corporate socialism, etc.).

I've been saying this for years that Utah is a very unique red state. Your conservatives are kind of split and just happen to fall under R because to them there isn't a big enough alternative. We have a very strong libertarian base here for example that tends to vote R in presidential elections (for some reason...I don't get Libertarians being aligned with Republicans but that's another discussion entirely).

In the last decade we've seen the Mormon population fall below 50%, we've seen places like Utah County become massively more diverse and we are just at the tip of the ice berg. Couple that with Utah's love for the outdoors, public lands, etc. and Republican hate of the environment for anything but corporate profits and I think you may have some people that don't always vote down party lines. At least less than before.

If there was a fiscally conservative party that focused on helping people instead of corporations and was environmentally friendly but promoted gun ownership/hunting all while having a sprinkle of 'eff the man' I think Utah would fall very hard into that party.",1582231629,fi81dgd

I happen to have a 2004 Mazda RX8 and placing a front plate would block close to 1/2 of the front grill leading to engine overheating. My list of 30 vehicles which have no space for a front license plate was not as inclusive as I would have liked.

In summary: ""Speaker Wilson said he was hopeful some agreement could still be reached with Prop. 4 backers. But Senate leaders believed things had already broken down, although they were not advocating for an all-out repeal of Prop. 4.""

The disagreements and potential modifications center around the following (quoting from both articles):

* Constitutionality: 
  * Gov. Gary Herbert and GOP leaders have said the initiative law has clear constitutional problems. And some of that may be true -- there are concerns that the initiative law brings the chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court into play, while the Constitution says the Legislature will redistrict -- the courts having no say in the creation of a plan  
  * Rebecca Chavez-Houck, a former state lawmaker who now heads the Better Boundaries campaign, said Prop. 4 is fine as-is. ""Prop. 4 is constitutional. It’s the law. We felt it didn’t need to be fixed. It doesn’t need to be fixed,"" she said.

* Proposed Prop 4 modifications:  
  * Under the initiative, there was a long list of exclusions for possible commissioners aimed at neutrality, and, as the current partisan makeup of the Legislature and governorship provide, there would be four commissioners picked by GOP officeholders, three by Democratic officeholders.  Under the new GOP plan, as I understand it, there would be five commissioners picked by GOP officeholders, two by Democrats -- but at least two commissioners must be political independents, not belonging to any party.
  * Under the initiative law, for a redistricting plan to be adopted by the seven-member commission, there must be five votes for it, meaning one vote must come from a Democratic-appointed commissioner.  There will be no such super-majority vote in the bill, the commissioners themselves -- presumable by majority vote -- will set their own rules in how they pick “at least three” redistricting plans to recommend to the Legislature. If it is a 4-3 vote under the bill, then all-GOP nominated commissioners could pick the plan(s).  
  * Under the initiative law, there are strict guidelines should the Legislature NOT adopt one of the independent commission’s plans. Even letting any individual sue in court to make the Legislature adopt a commission plan.  Those will be gone in the GOP leaders’ bill.  Instead, while the independent commission’s recommendations will be taken seriously by the Legislature, the Legislature will ultimately decide redistricting -- as it has before, and as the Utah Constitution demands
  * From Speaker Wilson: ""Utah legislative staffers should not be assigned to the commission""",1582324232,fibl0bq

However, the author has no financial documentation to prove this, and depends on an edited, incomplete transcript among sore losers as though this is evidence.

What is unclear is if any laws have been broken.  The author doesn't state if there is a conflict of interest provision that Mr. Rigby should be subject to, or if he even has to disclose it.  He doesn't say whether there is evidence he tilted the scales.

Being involved in ""Network Marketing"" isn't ""owning a business"" in the same way as having a controlling stake in a franchise-based company (e.g. own a car wash chain or B2B supply company). The difference is that in the latter, your efforts _actually_ scale, regardless of when you get involved, whereas a ""Network Marketing"" business has a long tail of diminishing returns. Also, you have very little control over whether the brand you're representing will be around in X years, whereas _actually_ owning a business gives you control over that because _you_ own the brand.

There are some reasonable businesses that operate that way, but they're very much in the minority, and I _hate_ it when people delude themselves into thinking it's more than it is.

There’s more than ample amounts of ATV trails for recreational use, I’ve certainly been places where people disregard maintained or pre designated trails and the vegetation has been thoroughly demolished, throwing the natural wildlife habitat for those areas into disarray. As public lands are lands for the entire population to use, unstructured use by the hoards will cause destruction that will not be tenable for sustained ecosystems and over time lange nothing left for future generations. Your ideology of using resources without acknowledge future implications odd what had gotten is into the climate change mess we are in now and is one of extreme selfishness and lack of any significant foresight, if any at all. Much like how John Locke‘s philosophies on human nature only hold true when populations are small enough that land overuse is going to be rare and there is an abundance of property in which all humans, if allowed an equal and fair chance to cultivate and labor over, can cordially co exist when left to their own devices. His mindset and beliefs can also spectacularly fail to highlight man’s greatest weakest which is that of greed. What he failed to realize is that monarchies and established governments did not all of a sudden become so influential out of thin air. Families accrued wealth over time very much in the fashion of unfettered capitalism and the resulting imbalance of power among a select few is something we are arriving at today and we need to be acutely cognizant of. Fortunately we are still at a point where we are a democratically elected republic, but if the power imbalance shifts away from the people and further into the ruling class, public lands will go the wayside and at that point public land utilization will be monopolized by those who have purchasing power. Think of how the Teton valley and up through Yellowstone would look today if John D. Rockefeller hadn’t pulled a bait and switch to purchase the lands and donate them to the government. It would be raped and plundered and be a cesspool of commercialized attractions much like you see at Niagara Falls, pretty much the perfect example of how over time lack of preservation ruins the natural state of things. How else do you think the Catholic Church became the largest non governmental land owner in the world? We are currently facing a constitutional crisis due to the latter aspect creating an overwhelming influence in behaviors for those in power to keep/maintain their autonomy in uncertain times and consequently the general public as well, however with income inequality reaching unprecedented level in the modern era. These levels have spiraled out disproportionally to the point where the major forces that guide us, traditionally consisting of possessions, life, health, and property, to a state of chaos that requires intervention from a thoroughly established and equally powerful government to restore and maintain balance in life. 


We are merely stewards of the earth and this entitled viewpoint to “enjoy” public lands unrestricted eventually will leave nothing for future generations to experience so if anything utilize the vast amounts of trails already readily available and if you want to enjoy fenced off areas, get off your ass and walk and truly experience the lands as Teddy Roosevelt would have or as John Locke would philosophize and write about",1582652225,fiqv41e

Unfortunately there's just enough people out there that don't self regulate. We can't eliminate those people from the gene pool, so instead we have laws so we can have consequences when they make bad decisions.

And to take things farther, people are saying ""You know what, wouldn't it be nice if we could prevent some of these things from happening?"" So they ask not to take away guns, but to just slow down the process of getting a gun so they can make sure guns are going to safe, responsible hands. You know—the people that can regulate themselves.

To me that seems like a pretty reasonable balance. Let good, responsible people have their guns, but make a decent effort to keep them out of the hands of people that can't regulate themselves.

4807,4807,knoxsox,"As a resident in the affected area, I'm pretty frustrated with the county council's decision to preliminarily approve this zoning change. I understand that the county needs to grow, and I understand that farmland isn't going to remain farmland. However, we've got to seriously talk about the impact to water, roads, schools, and similar infrastructure and see when these improvements are going to be made and how they are going to be paid for. 

Concern number one: Schools. The developers are not required to build schools for the new 6000+ residences. The school district, Jordan, cannot (per state law) charge the developer impact fees. The only way school districts can pay for capital expenses is through bonding/property taxes. A new high school alone can cost, [according to the Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/utah/2019/12/1/20971184/utah-high-schools-could-soon-cost-145m-each-in-era-of-intense-construction-inflation) up to $145 million dollars. But lets use Jordan district's own [recent costs](https://jordandistrict.org/resources/updates/) to figure out how this will affect how many new schools are needed and what the cost would be based on the number of new potential new students (based on census data, 40% of JSD residents [are age 1-19](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/97000US4900420-jordan-school-district-ut/)). Break that down by the [average distribution of students](https://jordandistrict.org/resources/statistics/) across schools in JSD, and you are looking at about 8 new schools (5 elementary, 2 middle, and 1 high schools) for a total cost of 245-ish million dollars. Just to build the schools. (Actual math at end of post.) That doesn't even account for the $7k per student it costs the district to educate the students each year, which is about and additional $60M per year. That money has to come from somewhere. 

Concern number two: roads. Today was a normal day. There were no accidents. It took me 40 minutes to get from Herriman to the point of the mountain near the prison for work. East/West access **must** be addressed by county planners. The state government hasn't funded a full build out of Mountain View Corridor. Nor have they funded the conversion of Bangerter Highway intersections to freeway-style interchanges -- but at least those are ""in the plan"" and space has been saved for them. There has been no space reserved for an east/west freeway. It is going to cost a bucket load of money to build, and because the space hasn't been reserved, it's going to be even worse. Access into and out of the area is a significant concern. Several years ago, we had the Herriman fire. Evacuating even a smallish percentage of Herriman residents was very difficult because of the road issues. Now, I admit, this is better now than it was. 134000 South has been widened, and Mountain View Corridor has been built, so a similar evacuation would probably be much easier this time. However, we are worried about adding 6000+ new residences to the area. In case of a natural disaster, it would be difficult to get resources into and people out of the Herriman area. 

Concern number three: Other transportation. There is no master plan to get light rail or busses to further service the area where Olympia Hills would be built. The only option will be for people to have cars. The developers say, ""well it's a master planned community! Everybody will just live here!"" which is bonkers. 

Which leads us right into concern number four: Office Space. A high tech firm, like the one I work for, would not relocate to an office with no freeway access, no light rail access and no bus access. Add that to the fact that it is unreasonable/foolish to think that all these high tech workers are going to move to Olympia Hills because their work moved there. It just won't happen. My office has people from Ogden to Spanish Fork to Tooele to Midway. Our management picks office space based on convenience for the employees and our customers. Olympia Hills does not match that need. 

Number five: water. Where is the water going to come from? We are already spread thin as it is. 

Some commenters on media stories have accused us of wanting to be the ""last ones in"" and then ""shutting the door behind us."" That isn't it at all. We recognize the importance of growth. We just want it to be done **responsibly** with a plan for how we are going to build the necessary infrastructure of roads, school, water, etc. to safely grow this part of the valley without causing gridlock issues to increase. We want the county and state to fund the necessary roads and public transportation options NOW so when communities like Olympia Hills come along, we can be pro-active about addressing these concerns, not reactive. Because dealing with these issues after Olympia Hills is built is way too late. 

As area residents, we do not feel like those concerns were heard or addressed by many of the county council members in the vote last night. We want to see these basic issues addressed either before, or *at least in conjunction*, with the plan to change the zoning in such a dramatic way. 

&amp;#x200B;

=== Explanation of math used to determine cost to build new schools for Olympia Hills development ===

JSD averages 3.6 persons per household. If 6000 new households are added to JSD, that is a population of 21,600 people. The age distribution of residents of JSD puts just under 40% (plus or minus 10%, which is a big margin of error) of residents at age 1-19. So we'll say that's 8640 school-age kids. For easier math, let's round down to 8500 school age kids (remember, plus or minus 800+). (All that data comes from [this site](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/97000US4900420-jordan-school-district-ut/).)

JSD reports that of the [current enrollment](https://jordandistrict.org/resources/statistics/), about 50% of kids are in elementary school, and about 25% are in middle school, and 25% are in high school. (Again, rounding numbers a bit for ease of math.) If there are to be 8500 new school kids, we can then determine how many kids per school type. That would be 4250 elementary-age kids, and 2125 each for middle and high schools. If you divide out the number of kids per school type based on current enrollment, you get about 760 kids per elementary, 1230 kids per middle school, and 1500 kids per high school. If you have 4250 new elementary kids at 760 kids per elementary school, you'll need 5.6 new elementary schools. Let's round down to 5 new elementary schools. Middle school, following the same math: 2125/1229 = 1.7 new middle schools. We have to round that up to 2. For high school 2125/1500 = 1.4 new high schools. We'll round that down to 1. So we need a total of 8 new schools. 

Now we'll use JSD's [financial facts page](https://jordandistrict.org/resources/updates/) to see how much recent schools have cost. The most recent elementary schools have cost about $18M each. Middle schools: about $37M. High school: $81M. New schools times cost = \[ ( 5 \* 18 ) + ( 2 \* 37) + 81 \] =  $245M, which is probably a conservative estimate, as land and construction prices continue to rise.",1582740483,fiufmqu
4808,4808,knoxsox,"I think our concern is that the county council ignored the Herriman city council, the Riverton city council, the Herriman mayor, the Riverton mayor, and the thousands of residents who flooded the council with concerns about this development, and approved it anyway.

4815,4815,norma_clyde,"the outcome:

&gt;While creating an independent commission to address redistricting, the agreement shifts that commission to more of an advisory role.  
&gt;  
&gt;The original language in Prop. 4 said both lawmakers and the commission could not consider where a lawmaker lives when drawing the political lines, sometimes referred to as an “incumbent protection” clause. The proposition also requires both entities to strive for “partisan symmetry,” which lawmakers complain is not an easily defined term.  
&gt;  
&gt;After much negotiation, lawmakers and Better Boundaries representatives agreed to language that sets some standards for the commission to follow when drawing political lines. Those include preserving communities of interest and maintaining the “cores of prior districts.” The requirement to keep as much of the prior districts intact as possible was something Better Boundaries asked to be included in the agreement, according to legislative sources.  
&gt;  
&gt;The legislature will not be required to follow those guidelines when drawing their maps next year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The commission will be tasked with coming up with as many as three maps for any given political boundary, but the legislature will no longer be required to take an up or down vote on those proposals. That also eliminates the possibility that a member of the public could file a lawsuit against the legislature if they fail to adhere to the commission’s guidelines.  
&gt;  
&gt;The bargain also eliminates a provision requiring the legislature to make their staffers available to the commission for their work, which lawmakers say presents an unacceptable conflict of interest. Instead, the legislature will allocate approximately $1 million so the commission can hire its own staff for their work.  
&gt;  
&gt;The commission will still have seven members, but the compromise alters how those members are selected. The governor, House Speaker, Senate President, and the minority leaders in both houses each get to name one member of the commission. That hasn’t changed. But, previously, the final two picks were made by the majority and minority in the House and Senate working together. Now those last two slots will be filled by the House Speaker and Senate President working together. Both of those final selections must be political independents who have not been registered with a political party for at least two years. That could potentially shift the partisan balance of the commission, although that remains to be seen. ",1582747633,fiusunk

 These ones are 1 1/2 to 2 hours south of Moab near Monticello/Blanding and are the best to camp at during the summer — may not be accessible in April: 

-Elk Ridge. Cell service can be spotty here. Come prepared.

On South Elk Ridge my favorite spot is near Kigalia Canyon, but you may need a higher clearance vehicle and 4WD to get there depending on whether the roads have been rutted out or not. I’d bring an extra gas can to be on the safe side, YMMV. 

On North Elk Ridge is Beef Basin, but you’ll need high clearance, 4WD, and extra gas. I would also suggest a comealong just in case, although some of the roads actually in Beef Basin aren’t terrible. Near Gooseberry Guard Station is also a really nice place to camp.

-East side of the Abajos. My favorite spots are up the road from Lloyd’s Lake just west of Monticello. The main access road is nice enough to take a sedan on.

If you’re REALLY looking to get out in the sticks, check out the Henry Mountains (I personally like McMillans Spring campground); a lot of land out there is BLM. If you decide to go here and explore, however, MAKE SURE you have vehicle clearance, at minimum all wheel drive, and extra gas. I would also recommend a spare tire, comealong, and tire patching kit. If you can make it up onto Bull Pass (4WD, clearance, not a place to camp), I highly recommend it: the view is absolutely wild.

I can't say anything bad about Utah, Winters are rough on out of state drivers, summers are dry hot, winter is super dry too. We're a fairly red state so none of the gun laws like in California, don't freak out if you see a guy at Walmart with a gun on his belt. If you don't have a car do the double step at the crosswalks, look once, step once, see if cars are going to stop then if they do go ahead and walk, if they don't then repeat the steps. Ive seen many people almost killed downtown when it's their right of way. Us Utahns have very poor vision when it comes to pedestrians.

The mountains are beautiful but remember there's probably about 10% of the foot traffic on the trails as opposed to in California. If you get lost or stranded it's going to take a lot longer for people to realize you're missing and also to find you. Most times that's a really in depth search and rescue thing.

Don't set yourself up for failure by trying to have a cheery conversation with everyone you meet. I'm from Oregon, having lived in Peru, Hawaii, Texas, Utah, and Washington. Metropolitan SLC is by far the most alienating place I've lived.

Now, don't get me wrong. I love it in Utah (I live near Logan). It's just that you gotta have a strategy for making friends. I thought I was crazy after my second semester, having continually been shot down making basic attempts at socialization. I started visiting other states just to reaffirm my sanity. I ended up with great friends in my classes, dorm, and work. It just took time.

I definitely recommend exploring campus. Because most colleges have their own section, there really isn't a lot of incentive for students to check stuff out.

Food in Utah can be a challenge at times. I recommend either learning to cook (which can totally be done... I wish I knew how to cook when I was on campus) or just keep hunting. There are some real gems, but are largely unknown. The history of Utah set the stage for a lot of people being happy with mediocre, tasteless food.

If you ever feel like you're paying too much for something, post back on reddit. There's bound to be someone who knows how to get it cheap. In Cache Valley, for example, we have lots of manufacturing and agriculture that makes a lot of food and clothing dirt cheap.

As others have mentioned, don't wait until the first snow to get your winter tires on. Especially near campus, it's nearly impossible to even drop off your car to have them done. I made the mistake of waiting a few times, and I had tire shops outright tell me they wouldn't have time for me in the foreseeable future.

Deseret industries is the thrift store of choice in Utah. My best finds are usually in Sandy, Taylorsville, and West Jordan. The downtown one generally sucks.

KSL Classifieds largely displaces Craigslist in Utah and surrounding states.

I second the other posts about driving defensively. I don't live in SLC, anymore, but when I drive in SLC, Provo, and Ogden, I generally avoid freeways and major roads when possible (State, Redwood, etc.)

The church is a nonprofit organization like many others. If there is no profit, how can they be anything other than a nonprofit? The entities owned by the church that make money (for profit) pay taxes. The IRS is not getting shortchanged here. The church has what is essentially an endowment fund.

The church receives donations from members to cover the costs of administration, buildings, communications, printing of church materials, etc. The value of donations is independent of the church's costs. This means that donations either exceed or fall short of the church's costs. To avoid disruption from a short in donations, money is set aside when donations exceed costs. Rather than have the savings lose value against inflation (a waste of people's donated money), the money is invested. This invested money grows and acts as an endowment fund. This is nothing new.

This is similar to how private universities like Harvard have endowment funds. The Harvard fund was estimated at $40 billion last year. Since the fund is meant to support the school in perpetuity, they shouldn't cut into the principal. That would result in a diminishing fund that would provide less support every year. The safe return on investments in the long term is about 7%. Assuming 2% inflation, Harvard can pull 5% every year to support the school. That's currently about $2 billion year. That covers about 35% of Harvard's annual costs, hardly enough for free tuition for everyone.

The church has a purported $100 billion in assets. That's 2.5x more than Harvard's. The difference is that the church has vastly more buildings and people where it spends the money. A 5% return would be about $5 billion dollars. I don't believe that covers annual operating costs for millions of members around the world. That $5 billion a year would be about $300 a year per member. For a congegration of 150 people, that's about $45,000 a year. That's not a crazy amount.",1582948674,fj2nx1d

Whether a company is for-profit or non-profit has little to do with how much money it makes, spends, or invests, but with the nature of the services it provides. The non-profit organizations of the church do not intend to run a profit. For example, FamilySearch isn't out there to make money, it's out there to help people do genealogy, and the difference is clear when you compare it to its for-profit competitor, Ancestry.com.

How about we get an honest democratic process and not your half-baked bullshit?



The Senate committee approved SB200 with very little discussion and effectively no debate. And no members of the public took the opportunity to testify for or against the bill during the 7 a.m. hearing, which Bramble said indicated the consensus nature of the legislation.

“The proof of that is the overwhelming support we see by having no one here speaking in opposition,” Bramble said.

Or perhaps it's because it was 7am and unless you followed this heavily you'd have no way of knowing any of those? People voted with their opinion on the ballot. Respect the vote. Don't like it?

As was mentioned, there was a huge bust over locals digging up/looting Anasazi burial sites, and selling the stuff they found to collectors. Locals feel the land is theirs to do what they want, while others see the behavior and call them out on it. Anyone not in tune with locals is a “rock-licking tree hugger” (quote from former legislator Mike Noel).  The bust resulted in one local committing suicide (which I didn’t understand... if he was innocent it’d come out in court, and the locals wouldn’t care either way). Locals blame the BLM for the suicide. &lt;eye roll&gt;

Generally speaking, the community seems a little less in favor of Trump than other red-dominate communities but if I had to randomly pick someone from church on Sunday I imagine they'd be a supporter on some level. Here's the spectrum I've encountered from conservatives within the church:

* ""I blindly love Trump because I'm blindly Republican because that's what you do. To not be Republican is sacrilege!""
* ""I support Trump because he's not a Democrat. He's not the best, but he's better than the alternative.""
* ""I agree with many of Trump's policies but hate the man. I wish the GOP would do better.""
* ""I'm conservative but can't call myself a Republican anymore. The party is a shell of its former self and the final act was endorsing Trump.""

Thankfully I seem to see more and more people moving away from full-on Trump support. I'm just a little south of SLC though. I imagine trends will vary based on where you are in the state.

Personally, I think it's hypocritical to have such a morally bankrupt individual in office. He seems to go against everything the Church teaches.

The CES honor code still says it requires ""abstaining from any sexual relations outside a marriage between a man and a woman"". This means that legally married same-sex couples who engage in sexual relations are not allowed to attend or can be expelled from the university.

There are on campus jobs that are only available to students, and faculty are generally required to follow the honor code as well.

Their honor code policy is highly illegal, but they are relying on the ""bubble effect"", where they try to keep people out who would likely challenge their policy, and they skate by on thin excuses, like ""we can allow homosexuals as people but still ban actual homosexual relations""

I was disallowed from continuing when I became an atheist. That is also illegal discrimination based on religion.  They are skating by on technicalities and bureaucratic slowness.

I did 11/hr when I first moved to SLC but literally any emergency devastated me and looking back, it's not worth cutting your basic necessities like food. I had a lot of savings to begin with, but I watched it all disappear within a year. Cutting it close doesn't account for all the doctor visits, all the taxes, every flat tire, the time someone hits your car and the insurance makes you wait 9 months before they can pay you back, when your shoes literally fall apart, your heater gets busted and your bill is $100+ and the one electric company in slc (coughs) makes you pay it anyway, etc etc. 

If anything, my best advice is find a super cheap sublease that gets you into the city until you can make friends and find someone you'd genuinely be okay living with. I make $18/20/hr now and am only just able to comfortably live in my own $700/month without getting pummeled by surprise emergency expenses.

* Medicaid expansion.  Passed through Prop 3.  Attempted revision to move these folks onto Obamacare instead of Medicaid and also have a work requirement.  Trump rejected that (to help their Obamacare lawsuit).  Most of Prop 3's original wording adopted instead.  
* Independent redistricting.  Passed through Prop 4.  The state and Better Boundaries negotiated modifications to it which just passed.  
* Tax reform.  1st attempt that failed: Expansion of sales tax onto many services, and cutting overall sales tax rate.  2nd attempt that failed: Combination of tax increases and tax cuts, but food tax increase proved to be too unpopular.  3rd attempt: Heading to the ballot this fall as a constitutional amendment.
* DUIs.  First in the nation to drop to 0.05.  Also putting us more in line with Europe.
* Conversion Therapy Ban.  The first and only ""red"" state with a ban.  A rocky road to get there with two failed revisions.  Ultimately the original approach is what was made law.    
* Allowing signature gathering to get on the primary ballot.  A very rocky road, probably still not done.  Many Utah GOP state party insiders are still fighting this.

But I don't understand ""lower our incarceration rates"". If people are violating the laws, then they must be incarcerated. What laws should we reform? My friend, who is a federal defense attorney, is working with the legislature on parole reform for non-violent prisoners and drug offenders. That's where we need to focus, and again, improving the facilities so that people can reform. Anyone who lives in the Salt Lake County jail will turn into an animal.

I also advocate for a smoother deportation policy for non-violent offenders. Right now, it's a mess. My friend has told me about how foreign prisoners get stuck in limbo. But that's for Congress to fix.

If they would like students to practice chastity they can.  They just need to figure out why they always repress and order around.  They do both.  They are both deserving of being made illegal.  Making people get married, making people uncomfortable in their sexual preference, making people never tell who they are even if they feel raped or violated--rape convictions.

So you really should read some of the comments with a more open mind, if that's possible.  BYU accepts Federal funding in a variety of ways and therefore it is required to follow certain guidelines in order to keep that funding.  So far, the government hasn't wanted to weigh in on this issue - but that doesn't prevent an independent sporting association from doing it.

Frankly, it's just a question of human decency at this point.  If the honor code people at BYU would have kept status quo then this wouldn't have blown up like this.  Sure, the usual crowd would have kept bitching about it, but they've been doing that for years.  But for them to basically set a trap for LGBTQ students by pretending to ""change their minds"" in order to lure them out, and then to change things back is just cruel.

He may be a source of misinformation, but linking the video is am unnecessary step in their message, and makes it politically charged. 

I remember a time when Hillary Clinton made a bad call as the secretary of state and USAID lost a ton of money - like literally a pallet of money vanished. I belonged to a military unit that would have helped identify where that money would most be effectively used, and a lot of people were upset when they were told ""oopsie dasey, your money is gone"". The US Army was blamed for this, for some reason. It happened a few more times and each time the Army was blamed. The Army of course put out messaging about it because that much stolen money is a big deal, but never once did those messages carry implication with them. They were always simple informational messages along the lines of ""millions of dollars have gone missing from this location, report any information to CID"". They certainly could have said ""millions of dollars under DOS responsibility..."" and shifted blame or made it a political statement, but that wouldn't actually help find out who stole the money and would have been inappropriate.

I feel like Trump used a very poor choice of words. To me, I think he was saying that some people might have very mild symptoms and go to work not knowing they are a carrier of COVID-19. 

He was speculating and saying if we include the number of people that have contracted COVID-19 but didn't see a doctor than the percentage of people that died might be smaller than what is actually being reported. 

I think on a topic like this he shouldn't be trying to downplay the severity by essentially making up an unknown number of people who never reported having the virus. He also shouldn't imply that people have gone to work while being sick. But I don't think he said ""people should go to work still even if they are sick.""

Quick edit. It also took me a surprisingly long time to find that video. When I searched for it I kept getting the same clip played over and over again, but nothing that included Hannity's question or most of Trump's response.

There are a bunch of other places you can go to that are relatively close to Zion's. Both Bryce Canyons and Capitol Reef have trails that are doable in the rain. Sand Hollow State Park is also beautiful.

For Bryce Canyon:
- Sunset Point - Canyon Rim Trail connects to the point
- Inspiration Point 
- Queen's Garden Trail (can get pretty muddy with the rain)

If you guys want to stay in Zion's, I'd check out the Emerald Pools. I believe the Canyon Overlook Trail is also doable in the rain.

Azar and Verma have been more interested in maintaining their power within the admin than doing their jobs.

The CDC also introduced additional delays by expanding the scope of the testing from the WHO protocol, plus poor contingency planning by initially relying on a single source for RNA extraction kits (Qiagen).

Sanders' path to victory is reliant on too many assumptions that aren't backed up by historical data, like mobilizing massive waves of young voters, and he's yet to demonstrate the ability or willingness to unify voters that don't exactly align with his ideology.

Regarding our primary: There was a lot of split voting among the more moderate candidates (some of whom dropped after mail-in ballots were cast), and Warren supporters are to date splitting \~evenly between Biden and Sanders as their second choice.  Bloomberg got 15.8%, very little of that is likely to go to Sanders.  If there was a revote between the two, I think the vote would be much closer.",1584326562,fkmdra3

By Jon Huntsman

Utah’s economic resilience has been demonstrated before, but now, we are in uncharted territory and we need uncharted solutions. With diminished supply chains, quarantined customers and forced closures, small businesses, hourly workers and many other Utahns are facing economic crisis along with this viral pandemic.

With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates to effectively zero, the federal government is taking steps to counteract the negative effects of COVID-19 on the national economy. As Utahns do their part to slow the spread of the virus, there are important steps we should take at the state level to protect Utah’s economy, as well.

Over the last few months, I’ve met with business leaders, entrepreneurs and farmers who are prepared to make Utah the Crossroads of the World as innovators, exporters and producers. We will not let this challenge stand in our way.

Here are some of the steps we should consider taking to minimize the impact of an unprecedented disruption to our state economy:

Economic response team • We need the best minds from around Utah, including federal and local government leaders, representatives from businesses of all sizes, and across all sectors. This group should be convened and led by the governor, not delegated.

Federal stimulus • Utah should take full advantage of the federal stimulus packages, applying those funds for paid sick leave, food programs, unemployment benefits and import/export programs.

Rainy Day • For many years, state leaders have methodically built up emergency funds. We should consider utilizing a portion of the Rainy Day Fund to provide relief for small business. Some large businesses have closed until April. They can afford to do that. Smaller businesses cannot. We should have their backs.

Utilities • Some utility companies have already announced they will suspend disconnections until April. We should strongly encourage all local utilities to follow that lead and explore ways to provide relief on any other fees for the time being.

Banks • Financial institutions can do tremendous good by providing working capital lines of credit at zero interest to ensure the survival of small businesses. They can help Utah workers in the hardest-hit economic sectors by extending late payment deadlines and providing better terms for lines of credit.

Property tax • There may be ways to stabilize the housing industry by extending or eliminating property tax payments on the first year of new home purchases and extending the five-year default schedule for other property tax payments. This could make a significant difference for businesses and families.

Sales tax • Our hospitality industry is certain to be one of the most heavily impacted sectors. To provide relief, we should explore the impacts of instituting sales tax relief for the event, restaurant and hotel industries, as well as any businesses that have been mandated to close.

Remote work • Technology has made this more of a reality for many years. In the coming weeks, it will be critical for businesses to adapt to options that allow business to be conducted without employees congregating. We should help businesses learn from one another by highlighting best practices.

Home deliveries • One of the essential services that will help our community succeed during these trying times will be home deliveries of necessary goods to those who are quarantined or high risk. We should consider eliminating sales tax on home deliveries for six months — this will benefit the business as well as the consumer.

Payroll tax incentives • We need to be creative and proactive in supporting businesses that are making monumental efforts to support employees at this time.

This list should serve as a starting point for robust discussions. With the right leadership and engagement from industries eager to lend expertise, there is no doubt the most effective steps can be identified and implemented quickly. We must address the financial impact of this crisis now before Utah businesses, communities and families are irreparably harmed.

Keeping an eye on the economic health of our state in the months ahead will be as important as keeping us safe from the health effects of coronavirus. If we act swiftly and decisively, Utah can minimize the damage done by COVID-19 and restore full health to our economy quicker than expected.

6685,6685,ImmaLabRat,"There’s 2 problems: 1) there was only one manufacturer (Qiagen) who’s RNA extraction kit was approved for clinical testing. They’ve since been unable to keep up with demand because of a bottle neck in the production of one of the kit components. We looked it up the other day at work, but now I can’t find info on it. I have this kit in my lab so I’ll check tomorrow and update with specifics if anyone is interested.
2) they’ve now approved a second extraction kit manufactured by Roche. But it requires different instrumentation. So if your lab was set up to use the Qiagen system, you’re basically fucked. I have some rants about proprietary instrumentation and patented reagent systems, but this is probably not the time or place.

I also saw that IDT was struggling to keep up with manufacturing the primer and probe kits, but that seems to be resolved now.

Either way, the underlying problem is that labs are not being allowed to develop/use their own testing protocols even for screening, which seems counterproductive to me. 
You can use gold standard kits for confirmatory testing, but if you want large scale screening (which seems legitimately needed to control subclinical infections), maybe ease up in the reagent monopoly?

I also hate that now that I’m in academia I’m hopelessly sidelined I keep looking at my thermal cycler sadly, telling it that it’s good enough even though it’s made by BioRad.",1584481568,fks3ktm

I knew about Qiagen, but wasn't sure if there was something new.

7185,7185,halffullpenguin,ok this is going to be a rather long post . first a bit of background information. the planet is split up into tectonic plates. there use to be another plate between the pacific and the north american plate. this plate has since completely subjected beneath the north american plate. this formed the rocky mountains. now days the closest fault to us here is the san andreas fault. which is a transform fault so the plates are sliding past each other. but the pacific plate is ever so slightly pulling away from the north american plate. this movement is ripping the north american plate apart and formed the basin and range province which is everything between the sierra Nevada mounts and the rocky mountains. basically every thing from salt lake to reno. imagine that the ground is a row of books as you pull the bottom out they tip over forming little right angle mountains. each book moves one at a timebut there is a dirt and rock that build up in the little gap between the turned book and the next upright book. as the book continues to slide out that triangle of dirt drops down. the earthquake we had today was the dirt dropping down. there are other auxiliary faults that trigger along side the main fault. which the current main fault is about 13th east if you want to go see it. but the auxiliary fault that runs under the great salt lake is large enough to act on its own. in a few million years the Wasatch fault will have stretched out far  enough that the friction holding it in place will be higher then the  stress needed to start a new fault. when this happens a new block will form around the park city area.,1584547452,fkudonc

7258,7258,manawoka,"The text:

I’m currently working on a master’s degree in hazards geology and have done a bunch of work (both thesis and non-thesis related) on geohazard mitigation in Utah and abroad. I drove around Salt Lake City after the earthquake this morning looking for signs of damage to take pics (for fun) and stopped at this place. There were some other men standing around the parking lot staring at it.

Visibly there's some damage to the lighting, damage to the brick and the decorative trim, etc. The REAL extent of damage won't be clear until the owners do a thorough analysis of the damage both inside the walls and out, but it's not unusual for a still-standing building to be condemned after an earthquake because of invisible structural damage.

After taking a few pictures I was asked not to take photos while on their property. I agreed politely and went to leave, but them saying that piqued my interest - why wouldn’t they want evidence that their building was damaged?

That’s when I looked at the door and saw that this building is being occupied by a STRUCTURAL. ENGINEERING. CONSULTING. FIRM. That’s right, “Dunn Associates, Inc.” decided to put their offices in a brick building that looks close to a century old, built on miles-deep lakebed sediment adjacent to one of the largest faults of its kind on the planet. I was absolutely incredulous at this and started giggling uncontrollably. I went back to my car (parked on public property) and took a couple more pics from there. They seemed ticked that they were caught. Guess what guys? If you don't want to look incompetent then DON'T BE INCOMPETENT.

Don't be like Dunn Associates, Inc. This isn’t the largest earthquake we’ve had here before and it won’t be the largest we’ll have again. It’s reasonable to expect that sooner or later these valleys will witness an earthquake with a magnitude up to Mw7.5 - that’s 80x as strong as what we felt this morning. I’m VERY glad that we’ve finally had an earthquake of this magnitude (enough to cause some damage and freak people out but not enough to kill). Please never forget that you DO live in earthquake county, most buildings on the Wasatch Front are NOT built to withstand an earthquake the size of the one(s) we expect to eventually happen, and you CAN’T prepare for a large earthquake after it’s happened.

Buildings built before the 70s (unless seismically retrofitted) are built to absolutely 0 seismic safety standards. URMs (unreinforced masonry buildings) are particularly dangerous, as they're stiff and quick to break/collapse in an earthquake. Even buildings built in the early-to-mid 90s often aren't built to current seismic standards. For those of you renting in Utah, know that landlords have absolutely 0 legal obligation to tell you this or to retrofit the place you live. Be smart, be vigilant. Secure all nonstructural hazards in your home  like hanging things, heavy things on shelves, bookcases and the like. Then, address if and how your home needs to be structurally retrofitted to meet current standards. Make sure you don't hire these guys to do it, lol.

You can either spend a small amount of money now or spend a HUGE amount of money later. I can't tell you when a big earthquake will happen on the Wasatch Front - could be days or months or decades - but I promise you it will happen.",1584553133,fkuocg7

In short, people are out on vacationing rather than staying home during the Coronavirus pandemic. The hotels in town were at 80% capacity over the weekend and the locals started to get worried about outside visitors bringing the virus into town and creating a mess for the local community. So, the Southeast Utah Health Department ordered all hotels, campgrounds, RV parks, etc to only check-in locals and kick everyone else out over the next 30 days. This includes BLM campsites too. 

Most of the visitors were from Colorado (I’m guessing because all the ski resorts are closed), but there were plates from all over.",1584572807,fkvngka

7643,7643,halffullpenguin,"its predicted to be the worst natural disaster in american history. last estimate I saw was 2000 dead in the initial shake and depending on the time of year close to 50,000 total dead if it happens in the middle of winter. somewhere in the ballpark of 150,000 people with out a home no power for days and no fresh water for weeks. a large portion of the rods in the valley being impassable as well as there being a 10foot wall of dirt along 13th east with most the people on one side and a lot of the medical services on the other. it will most likely trigger landslides that will clog any of the streams coming into the valleys which the clean up of those will take priority over everything because if those water ways are not opened up they will cause massive debris flows into the valley. with how many streams run into the valley there is a high likelihood they would not be able to get to them all in time meaning houses at the entrance to the canyons being buried. as well as many many many more bad things. the u of u teaches a class basically dedicated to this that every geologist has to take.

7719,7719,jedmau5,"Thank you for sharing. So does this mean that this earthquake did little or nothing to relieve pressure from the imminent ‘big one’?

I watched an informative video a year or 2 ago that showed how the Main Wasatch fault goes north to south but in pretty much each little crevice or canyon, lies smaller East/west faults that if triggered, could cause the main one to slip as well. 

It stated that if we regularly get the East/west quakes, it’s not a big deal because they relieve pressure if happening semi-often. But if we don’t receive consistent East/west quakes (like we haven’t), there is a potential for a smaller fault along the larger fault to trigger the larger one to slip 

Is any of that correct? And did the quake we just received not relieve pressure from any bigger ones?

There are places in the world that experience earthquakes on a weekly basis have active volcanos going off and tsunamis washing up on their shores. It just seems a little weird when something small happens and people here act like it is the end of the world.

The episode was about an earthquake and people getting trapped in an elevator. Naturally I get freaked the fuck out and start stressing as my mom is tucking me in to bed. She comforts me as any mom is expected to do, telling me that we really don't have earthquakes around here. The next morning I wake up, pour myself a bowl of cheerios and plop down in front of Thundercats. Next thing you know, the TV starts shaking and I turn around to see the walls bending back and forth.

7768,7768,VindictivePrune,"10:34 AM - U of U Seismology Stations:There is no currently accepted scientific method for predicting the precise time, location, and magnitude of earthquakes.
Based on past earthquake sequences around the world there is a small, about one in 20, chance of an earthquake larger than M 5.7 in the Salt Lake Valley area during the next week.
Although it is possible that larger earthquake in this area could be in the magnitude range of 7.0 to 7.5, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the chance of an earthquake of this size is about one in 300.
Earthquakes of magnitude larger than 7.5 are unlikely to occur in Utah. A magnitude of 9.0 earthquake is not possible in Utah.

Influenza in the US: Avg. ~26000 deaths per year over the last few years. For the sake of argument, let's take the highest recent count from 2017: 61000 deaths.

Using your estimate, COVID-19 in the US: 800k deaths. That's about **13.1 times worse than a bad flu season**.

The rocks will still be there next year, please strongly consider postponing your trip.  Rural towns like Moab have extremely limited healthcare facilities, equipment, testing capacity, and staff, and the population trends older and lower income.  The measures were put in place to avoid an unmanageable number of cases via transmission of the virus to locals from visitors or by visitor admissions.

From the Moab city website's summary of the order:

&gt;***ATTENTION: The following order will be strictly enforced. Violation of the order is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to 6 months in jail, and fines of up to $1,950. Violations also could result in the revocation of overnight accommodation licensure.***  
&gt;  
&gt;UPDATE: Southeast Utah Health Department Issues Order Restricting Lodging, Food Establishments, and Closing Public Places   
&gt;  
&gt;The Southeast Utah Health Department on March 17, 2020, issued a Public Health Order that places strict limitations on food establishments, closes movie theaters and other public places, and orders overnight lodging establishments to only accept new reservations for rooms for ""essential visitors"" effective at 10 p.m. tonight.The order states in part:""Overnight Lodging. Effective at 10 pm (MST) on March 17, 2020, all overnight and short-term lodging facilities (including but not limited to hotels, motels, condos, townhomes, guest homes, RV parks, and all camping on public or private lands) within Carbon, Emery, and Grand Counties may only check-in, rent, or lease to Essential Visitors and Primary Residents. Essential Visitors and Primary Residents may utilize public lands for primitive camping purposes. No camp shall be located within 200 yards of another camp and no camp shall consist of more than IO people. **An Essential Visitor is any individual renting lodging or camping for an amount of time less than 30 days for the purposes of work within Carbon, Emery, and Grand Counties, or for an employer within the boundaries of Carbon, Emery, and Grand Counties, and their spouse and dependents.** Primary Residents are any individuals renting lodging for periods of 30 days or greater or whose primary address is within one of the counties.""",1584677613,fkzqoh3

7931,7931,brett_l_g,"TL;DR don't bother, just stay home.

Technically, counties don't have any authority over activities on Federal land.  The National Parks are free to enter, but they aren't accepting any new campers, only those who have reserved.

BLM land is differently administered.  I'd imagine if you run into a county sheriff, they could probably cite you but it may not hold up in court if you fight it.  But you'd have to fight it in Moab courts.

In my opinion, the NPS and BLM are examples of what is wrong with the federal response.  Instead of just clearly shutting everything down, they are leaving this gray area, as well as abdicating their responsibility to care for the public's treasures.

I'd assume your visit would not fit the definition of ""essential"".  It probably means people who are working in the area, assisting with health care operations or maybe temporary employees of the grocery stores, for example.  Recreational visits, which is clearly what you are doing, is not essential.

In any event, now isn't time to risk long travel.  Recreate nearby; that's what we all have to do.  I'd love to go there too, but it isn't safe for you or others.  Moab's hospital is really small and they don't want any additional stress from visitors potentially getting injured in the wilderness and then that taking up a bed or ventilator or anything that a local COVID patient would need, or many if there were a bigger outbreak in town.",1584678312,fkzrkhd

There's a few switchbacks midway through like someone else mentioned, and there's a short climb at the upper lake, but it was otherwise easy. There's also abundant water access. If you've never backpacked before, you'd still need to go with someone experienced and research what you need. 

On this hike, there's quite a few primitive campsites (just bare soil and a makeshift fire ring). When I did it, we started the hike around 8:30am, set up camp at the lower lake around 3pm, then hiked up to the upper lake. We then camped overnight and hiked out the next morning. It was 100° in Salt Lake that day, but still in the 50s and windy at the upper lake. It'll be chilly at night pretty much any time of year.

Some folks actually hiked it in a day, but I wouldn't recommend it, unless that's your kind of thing.

My take on it is that the powerful moneyed right is really trying to chip away or erode the basic fundamentals of the 1st Amendment one basic fundamental right at a time. This anti-porn effort is about them controlling free speech. If they can control and define what free speech means, then they can ultimately manipulate every 1st amendment right.",1584752895,fl2k2q8

While you're generally right, it's not all about materials.

It's very possible to make a brick home earthquake resistant. Many historical buildings have incurred massive costs to do it retroactively. The Utah capital building is a pretty notable example of a massive retrofit to its foundation and the dome support. It's extremely expensive, though, so usually only done in areas with money where earthquakes are more likely.

Some rent-seeking is useful, and some is not. One purpose of government is to inject structure into a market so it can not only set efficient prices, but also limit extortionary behaviors, market-cornering schemes, and other activities that capitalize on inefficiencies without doing anything to solve them. 

Who said anything about Soviet-style planning? Let's not trot out silly false dilemmas.

8658,8658,helix400,"&gt; but the Church should have used their very hierarchical organization (especially in Utah) to make sure everyone knew the rules.

Not so simple.  The church had no mechanism to easily get the word out to *all* members in 24 hours.  

For example, I ran into my stake president on a walk yesterday.  Before the airport missionary gathering photos started going viral.  He said that day he was knee deep in missionary logistics, working with missionaries coming home, those who came home, mission presidents, worried parents. In the few minutes we chatted, he got two more phone calls on missionary situations.  

I've got clerk duties in my stake, so I commented that we need to get better email addresses, as many are old addresses or members didn't provide us one, so we have no way to contact everyone in the stake.  We have a weird mix of Facebook + Zoom + email + ministering (old home/visiting teaching) + church newsroom.  Our stake is still trying to more or less take a full census of everybody's needs, and many members still haven't had contact since everything shut down 10 days ago.  

We currently have no mechanism to send out word to all local congregation members.

&gt;there is plenty of blame to go around,

8680,8680,Dewey_Oxberger,"These are mostly ""presumptive positive"" since testing is so scarce. There are a few ways you estimate the number of cases: 1) use the number of dead (since that is more accurately measured). Knowing that mortality is about 2% of infected and average time from infection to death is 20 days (WHO numbers). When someone dies you assume they were 1 of 50 people who were infected on that day. Then project the 49 people forward assuming 1.2x per day growth rate (the large-scale average). That estimates 1800 people infected. 2) do the same thing, only with the national numbers. This puts the national infected count at nearly 400,000. Then assume uniform distribution across the population. That puts Utah at 3600 or so.

Finally, the number doubles every 4 to 5 days. Stay home people!

I should say: Don't expect a deviation off of exponential growth until Mar 27 to maybe April 3. (Assuming the Mar 13 declaration of emergency is going to do something).",1585018477,flc2t9k

Unfortunately it's impossible to detect the inflection point until it's long past. So exponential growth is a good model for now and will be for the foreseeable future; that is: until herd immunity is such that the growth curve levels off. And herd immunity can increase in only two ways: either a vaccine is created, or people contract and overcome the virus.

8729,8729,ChrisMill5,"Biological testing is tedious and difficult. A lab can own five of the exact same machine with sequential serial numbers and it still takes tens of thousands of identical tests and some pretty comprehensive statistics to determine that one of the machines is giving false positives/negatives.

The COVID test protocol is relatively non-routine and changing as we learn about the virus, the reagents are scarce, the equipment and the personnel to operate the instruments are lacking.

Certain brands and models of instruments have been deemed qualified to carry out the tests by default. This is atypical, biological labs are required to qualify individual machines through thousands of tests and statistical verification. This situation is so beyond fucked that we've given hard science and 50 years of empirical data the middle finger, trying to do anything we can to save lives.

Not every lab has a (defacto) qualifed instrument. Those that do may not have the test kits to run. Those labs that have both still can't be statistically certain of the results. Allowing technicians to run these unqualified tests on similar but ultimately unqualified instruments is adding an order of magnitude more uncertainty to the results. What's worse, a false positive or a false negative?

So no, there is no artificial scarcity of tests. There is an actual, real life scarcity of tests, mostly due to government ineptitude and lack of action. But there are also a lot of armchair scientists graduating with their Internet MD just in time to weigh in poorly on current events.

Isolate and quarantine yourself and be very conscious of how/where you can spread the disease. Take over the counter treatments for colds and coughs. The majority of COVID-19 cases (roughly 80%) do not require hospitalization and you can ride it out at home. Just make sure you do not spread it to others!

But keep an eye on your symptoms. COVID-19 can turn south quickly, so if you start having trouble catching your breath, you need to call your local hospital right away. Do not go straight to the ER, call ahead so they can meet you and isolate you, you don't want to spread it to everyone else in the waiting room. 

Try not to panic about the lack of a test, they're only going to hospitalize you based on that, only on the symptoms you experience. Just take care of yourself and be mindful of others, seek medical care if needed.

Utah Code 53E-3-501 provides that the State School Board determines what the minimum academic year is but then

Utah Code 53F-2-102 give the power to actually determine when the school year is actually going to be to the local school boards.

Utah Code 53-2a-209 gives the Governor authority to trump both those statutes in a declared emergency **for the duration of the declared emergency.**

Herbert has used his emergency powers to close the schools but as soon as the declaired emergency is over those powers cease and school has to resume unless the STATE SCHOOL BOARD reduces the minimum required school days enough that Local School Boards can close the schools earlier.

That is a mess... one state level agency has to do one thing that makes it possible for local level agencies to close schools early... if they want.

However that's not the comparison that should be made.  Covid-19 is as deadly as any disease is. Covid-19 just like sars and all prior pandemic disease in history are respiratory. 

How covid is different,  is this disease attacks the lungs far harsher than the flu. But the death rate is not a 2% or even 1%. Before anyone was able to put enough data to gather nations pulled the plug on their economies and suspended peoples liberties without enough data. 

The data they did have came from a group in London with even less data and basing their model of incorrect assumptions, not even data. And because of that the world lost its shit.  With less than just two weeks after, the head of Stanford Universities  biomedical research, data center put out a piece stating that with the data on hand, the death rate of covid is .1 or less, presumably much less if treated properly. 

Let's say the death rate is 1/10th of 1%.  Or even 1% you do not take away peoples liberties, shut your country down and cause turmoil over this. One even without medication, simply having enough ventilators is all you need to stop the majority of the would be fatalities.  Which gives you plenty of time to work on a vaccine. 

But instead of all this, we have a nation or world even willing to rip peoples lives apart. Because the elderly and at risk population are at risk of a disease. Quarantining retirement homes and making emergency services avail to anyone with respiratory problems would be more than enough action.

But now, we will kill our economy and the livelihoods of millions, with an ignorant over reaction, because we dont know enough to make a informed decision.

Are you wondering if it's illegal to put your pet down? I'm confused.  You can put your pet down but vets will usually make sure it's necessary.  They'll make an assessment before putting them down and that will incur a fee and if they determine it's necessary then there will be another fee to actually put them down. Prices will vary.

Regarding burying. I believe it's technically illegal to bury within the city and around water tables due to risk of spreading diseases.  For that most vets will offer cremation usually through a 3rd party and that 3rd party will offer various options like private cremation vs group. With private you'll have the option of getting the ashes back. With both options they'll offer things like bronzing the paw print, etc. Private will be more expensive then public. When my cat passed last year I opted for a one of the higher packages which included the bronzed foot print, a plaque with a spot for a photo, a private cremation, a cedar box with inscription to house the ashes. In total, with the euthanasia it was approx. $600.

The Reason being is my wife is a nurse at one of the instacare clinics in here in Utah.  She literally is on the front lines of this mess.  And the the actions of other people do directly affect my wife and my kids.   This is physically, emotionally, and mentally taxing to my wife and other clinicians as well as literally dangerous.  If someone at her clinic gets coronavirus then everyone that worked that person can’t work for a mandatory 14 days.  So now an entire shift of clinicians are out of action.  

I can’t tell you how many times someone has come
Into the clinic acting entitled and honestly, being ignorant to those who are trying to care for them.  So yeah that’s when I get angry when I feel like people are acting selfishly.  When they think it’s ok to still have that birthday party, or go play basketball because “it’s still just 10 people on the court at once.”  It doesn’t just affect themselves.

So we had a big group of kids on this street all within a few years of each other, constantly playing night games and going up to the park to play baseball/soccer/football etc... but the poor mormon kids next door just had to watch from their yard.

9058,9058,qpdbag,"It's easy to criticize in hindsight. There is never going to be a perfect response to an epidemic and definitely not a global pandemic that has spread this quickly. You can disagree if you want.

Secondly, if you read the actual article you would see that they are being asked to self-quarantine for two weeks.

&gt;Elders returning to the U.S. and Canada who have fewer than six months remaining in their 24-month mission will be immediately released and asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Elders who have more than six months remaining in their mission will continue as missionaries in their home countries after a 14-day self-isolation period.

Thirdly, if they waited any longer they would be stuck after the borders closed. Some of them are in that precise situation.

&gt;This change applies to all missionaries serving in a foreign country, except for those in Australia, New Zealand and some places in Europe, as well as those who are unable to leave the country where they're serving or enter their home country, Elder Christensen said. A Tuesday update to the church's news release on missionary work said that nonnative missionaries in Taiwan and the Dominican Republic won't return to their native countries, either.

So it was either wait until even more U.S. citizens were potentially caught outside U.S. borders with no ability to travel home in the foreseeable future or bring them all home when the scope of the situation is not in focus. It seems crystal clear now, of course, but it wasn't as clear a month ago. 

Regardless of whatever your feelings about the Mormon church are, they are also U.S. citizens exercising their free will.

If you could please keep an eye out for it or put the word out I would forever be grateful.

It has custom running lights LED strips color changeable as well as the turn signals are LED strips too. There isn't a bolt on this bike he hasn't touched. Video cameras show a female mid 30s and female accomplace in a uhaul van loading it into the back of the van. From what I understand they could be armed, living out of the van and, using methamphetamines. If anyone sees it please call the salt-lake-city unified Police department at 1-801-743-7000.

Reality issue #2: We can't do a ""shelter in place"" lockdown for 12-18 months.  We'd enter a depression worse than the 1930s.  

We have to learn how to live with the virus between now and then.  That can be done.  Covid-19 has an R0-value of somewhere between 2.2-3 in *normal situations*, meaning each infected person infects 2.2 to 3 others.  If we can practice enough measures to keep the R0-value below 1 (social distancing washing hands, avoiding large groups, staying home when sick, etc.), then we have a good chance of opening society back up enough to keep treading water.

We have to acknowledge that if any governor takes an a lockdown a step further than what NJ is doing runs the risk of inciting civil conflict. 

We really have to ask ourselves is this all worth it. In the beginning we reacted without having clear data based off a single report. There were experts that told us not to react the way we did, but we did out of fear. In the past few weeks. 

There has been countless infectionious disease experts, medical data scientists that have come forward and stated we made a mistake, in our reaction and in the data. The London based group that created the report which we reacted on. Have since published an updated report admitted they were wrong. The disease is far less deadly. Based off new data, the UK has updated the risk level of Covid-19 a d lowered it to less than a national emergency. 

And the more time goes on, the more people are seeing this. People will not abide by an order to stay in a home as time goes on.

This means they aren't effectively fertilizing any specific area before moving on.  Instead they are spread out and the manure and urine aren't being concentrated enough to give back to the system.

You can get just as much exercise walking a three-mile loop around your house and there is no driving involved. You can picnic in your back yard, or in your apartment parking lot.

However, people aren't just going to the trail. People stop at gas stations, sporting goods stores, restaurants, and other places as well. A lot of people don't just go from home to trail and back home. Not to mention the people who say well I can go to the trail so why not take my kids to the park and playgrounds. I get that people need release and activities in these times where we are all getting stuck at home but we are stuck at home for a reason. If people actually quarantined themselves, washed hands, and we responsible adults this would all be over by now or at least be less severe. Hell, I thought this was going to be over by the end of the month but I forgot the fact that people suck and don't do the responsible thing.

While there is some legal uncertainty, you will have to fight any citation in the jurisdiction it originated in.  You want to make trips to Kanab (or even Salt Lake) to argue it?

That's if they don't just imprison you.

It's same principle that applies when you speed through, for example, the Cottonwood Canyons in Salt Lake and you get a ticket from the local police.  Just because the road is in USFS land, you still have to obey the local laws.

Currently, I don't think any orders extended into mid/late May yet, but I would not be shocked if they do.  Also, the [Southwest Utah Health Department](https://swuhealth.org/#1), which covers Zion, Grand Staircase-Escalante, and the surrounding area, does not, as of now, have a no camping order.

I expect prices will stay flat in some areas, and increase at a slower pace in the most desirable areas. To echo others in this thread, you won’t see huge price drops since demand is (and will continue to be) so much greater than supply in the Wasatch Front

Many of the people impacted by this recession (restaurant, hospitality workers) weren’t likely in the market to buy a house because those industries don’t pay especially well.

&gt; [Money] I would encourage Utahns to learn from our forefathers and foremothers’ history of problematic responses to pandemics, especially after reading an email yesterday from a Utah leader inviting sacrament/worship in their home stake-wide and promising protection.

The LDS church works on the principle of some people being qualified to tell others how and what they should do. The common vernacular within the church, ""...a bishop holds keys over his congregants."" The implication is that the person is acting as an agent for deity himself, and thus, ""...no harm or accident will befall them,"" especially when following said advice. The magic of consecrated oil is not enough protection for a highly contagious pathogen.

It seemed clear enough to me, albeit, I was raised in the LDS culture and understand it better than the average person in the wider population. The Saints can think they're immune. If that fails, the old Clayton hymn is the fall back position, ""if they die before their journey's through...all is well. All is well."" Fuck that.",1585679461,fm1jbg3

Those are all examples of people doing the wrong thing, regardless of what the church itself has instructed. It is not social distancing and is problematic in Utah. The church needs to very firmly instruct that these things are not to be done, from the very top. Like Pres. Nelson should specifically address this kind of behavior because it is still rampant in Utah.",1585681782,fm1nsrt

Delivery people are one of the biggest risks when it comes to spreading this virus. They pick up and drop off food at many different locations daily. Those people frequent apartment complexes and could easily infect other people simply by doing what they do normally. You won’t ever find a door dash being delivered to one of these trails.

I’ve hiked many times in my life and always avoided touching railings when they are there because they are disgusting. Most other hikers would also follow that guideline. Other than handrails, there really aren’t many things on a hiking trail that you will be touching that have been touched by anyone else in the last few months, let alone days.

We have had the lowest funded education system in the nation, some of the highest college tuition in the nation, and corruption galore.  And it has been that way for 40 years.

The only reason we got through the last recession was because of ARRA funds, thanks to the Obama Administration and the Democratic Congress (not one Republican vote for in the house, and only three in the Senate from then moderate Republicans).  Without those, Utah would have been as bad or worse than other states because of the failed flat tax had its greatest impact at that time.

* There are 4 different types of mountains on this map and it was a little hard to tell the difference between some of them as I did this on my phone, so there's no real significance between the two snow-capped mountain emojis apart from those areas are drier than the green mountain emojis.

It may surprise you to learn that minorities can also be racist. So tell me: why are you trying so hard to shift blame to China? I thought we were all supposed to ""burn through the disease"" so that we can all ""develop antibodies""? Shouldn't we be thanking China then?

&gt; You dont even realize that you are asserting that all east asians are chinese which is racist in itself. You just proved that you are a racist.

No way.  Covid-19 has a R_0 infection rate of 1 person infecting 2-3 others *in normal day-to-day contact*.  The R_0 becomes far less than 1 when people interact only briefly with others.  I mean, look at Rudy Gobert, be played a few high contact NBA games and practices, and it appears he only passed it onto 2 other NBA players and 1 camera man.  

The R_0 value isn't to 2-3 if you simply go to a public bathroom on a vacation, or hand cash to an attendant, or stop to get gas.

[From Jonathan Caulkins](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/02/coronavirus-economy-reopen-deaths-balance-analysis-159248), professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College. 

&gt;The logic for all-but shutting down the economy is that doing so will stop the virus’ spread and allow mass testing to catch up. But even with all-out shelter-in-place efforts, we will likely still be living in the age of Covid for the rest of this year at least. Keeping businesses’ doors completely closed will have huge costs. Given this possibility, we need to figure out how to work sustainably in this new reality.

&gt;We’ve already figured out how to protect many white-collar jobs—just work from home online. But we also can and should reengineer some blue-collar jobs—on-premise, physical work—so it can get done while maintaining social distancing. . . .

&gt;It’s not that companies viewed as essential have made no changes, but they are haphazard and undirected. A concerted and systematic effort to reengineer public-facing essential businesses would almost certainly cut virus transmission by more than would reengineering and reopening shuttered sectors that don’t inherently involve so much person-to-person interaction.

&gt;The original idea of two-week shutdown wasn’t long enough to eradicate the virus, and a two-month shutdown will do permanent damage to the economy. Neither protects against Covid returning in the fall or some other pandemic striking next year. Instead of seeing only two possible options—reopening the economy as before or keeping it closed until further notice—we need to be more flexible. We can start by inventing ways to reengineer the vast middle of the U.S. economy so that it can operate sustainably in the Covid age.",1585939582,fmc62as

10802,10802,AdamColligan,"To be clear: speech ""disrespecting"", ""making fun of"", or ""being childish about"" public health directives can almost never be against the law in the United States.  There would be no point in trying to formally ""report to authorities"" that kind of expression.  

In some cases, it can be against the law to incite others to actually commit crime, but even that is quite rare. Someone would really have to be actively organizing physical violations of public health orders that are actually mandated for enforcement. For example, [this pastor in Florida was arrested](https://www.fox13news.com/news/tampa-megachurch-pastor-arrested-after-leading-packed-services-despite-safer-at-home-orders) for gathering large groups of people together when that had been specifically banned. I don't know where in Utah the guy you are worried about lives, but there may not even be many legally mandated orders there. It seems like you aren't even claiming that much, though -- the wording of your post indicates that he is just *saying* disrespectful things and encouraging others to *say* disrespectful things. There's nothing even remotely illegal about that, and so there's nothing to ""report to authorities"".

Of course, public officials also have an informal leadership role in encouraging people to do the right thing, and sometimes they may want to use their profiles to call out bad behavior. So you could look for state and local leaders and tweet at them or email them, letting them know that there is some high-profile influencer that is undermining their message. Maybe they would want to urge people not to listen to that person. But unless there's something I missed in your post, that's about the most that could possibly happen, and most public officials would usually be reluctant to give someone even more publicity by rebuking them.",1585962993,fmdaee9

10829,10829,utahgamer,"Almost all of the recipes you find online use a ratio of two parts mayo to one part ketchup (2:1), though you will find recipes that range from 1:1 to 4:1. Interestingly I found this 2:1 ratio to be the case for Fry Sauce (Utah), Mayoketchup (Puerto-Rico), Marie-Rose Sauce (Britain), as well as the myriad of restaurant versions from across the US. Salsa Rosada or salsa golf (South America) tend to run a little more ketchup in the 2:1 to 4:3 range. Thousand Island Dressing tended to vary quite a bit more but was still in that 1:1 to 4:1 range. Variations with BBQ sauce, horse-radish, or other more extreme flavors did not vary in ratio any more than simple versions.

The earliest pre-Utah mayo-ketchup sauce recipe I could find (New Orleans circa 1900) was entitled ""Thousand Island Dressing"" and sported a 1:1 ratio and was to be served on head lettuce, in my opinion, that makes it a different thing.

Also, a shame that this recipe does not mention the myriad seasonings that work in homemade fry sauce. This is an excellent opportunity to use spices and seasonings to jazz up your fries.

At least the original story was  guilelessly muddled; this opinion piece seems Machiavellian and intentionally manipulative.

This piece is citing specific internal policies regarding the COVID-19 response.  Pay for physicians who signed contracts based on the amount of services they provide is going to be affected by people not coming in for elective procedures.  That's not Intermountain cutting pay any more than a car dealership cuts pay to salesmen when people aren't buying cars.  The pay structure itself hasn't changed.  In fact, Intermountain is paying those physicians 85% of what they normally make to *not* work!  How is this manipulative to give people *more* than they are contractually obligated to?

&gt;The simple moral reality is that for-profit health care is extremely unethical in all circumstances and volume-based compensation for providers almost certainly leads to pernicious outcomes in good times and bad.

Intermountain is a non-profit entity, all your complaints about a for-profit system don't apply to a not-for-profit.

I applaud the Trib for trying to get to the bottom of it fast.  The original piece did more harm than good to the issue though, because somehow they made that parasite IHC into a victim and good guy.

What does Intermountain have to gain by making a pandemic worse?  You make it sound like there is some James Bond villain trying to murder people.  They have no financial interest in it, this is costing them money.  Their providers on the front lines are in danger and already overworked.  They have literally nothing to gain by a massive disruption to their lowest-risk planned elective procedures.

&gt;Too bad.

Saturday, May 15, 1880 was the big day for the first train to come to Milford. Local citizens and others who had come from surrounding communities and mining camps were filled with excitement as they waited and watched for a glimpse of smoke in the north, finally the belching, roaring engine and the hissing steam approached, frightening most of the spectators. This was the first passenger train to come to Milford.

The hotels in Milford were the finest in Southern Utah. Exquisite dining and accommodations welcomed many renowned people and weary travelers. The mines and the boomtown knew their glory, but dreams died as the rich veins of ore ran out. Now they are just recorded memories in books.

""I am concerned about the public facing models not clearly expressing in lay terms what data and what the assumptions that they’re using are. And so I would caution readers that if they don’t understand the assumptions that a model is making or worse, if the assumptions are not clearly laid out, that they should be cautious of the results.

What concerns me about these public-facing models, including the one you mentioned from IHME, is that they can do more harm than good. It’s not a case of some information is better than no information. On the one hand, they can cause panic, and on the other, they can cause distrust of science.

The IHME model is projecting that the peak is happening in April and when the peak doesn’t happen in April, I worry that readers will start to think that scientists don’t know what they’re talking about, that these models are wrong, that they’re not useful, that we shouldn’t use them to guide an epidemic. Or that people will say, “Oh, we’re past April, so now I can go back outside again.

One day we ran into a rattlesnake at one of the bathrooms off the trail.  It was coiled around the toilet.  At first we were going to leave, but then one of my dad's friends mentioned that we're lucky we saw it, and if another person comes by, they might not see it and get bit.    


We then proceeded to lure the snake out of the bathroom with some meat on a stick and dropped some heavy rocks on its head to kill it.  My dad cut off the rattles and gave them to me (I was the youngest there so I was the only one super excited to have the rattles).  We finished our four wheeling for the day and went back to the hotel and left the next morning, finishing our trip.  It wasn't until I got home that I realized, I could not find the rattles.  


I started racking my brain and then it hit me.  When we got back to the hotel I was playing with them in the bed and fell asleep.  Over the night they probably moved further down into the bed.  And I'd forgotten about them until we got home.

A lot of neighborhoods take 15-20 minutes just to access the freeway. Then another 20-25 minutes, without traffic, to get to downtown Salt Lake for a lot of jobs, restaurants, bars, music, sporting events, theater, etc.  

The west side of Draper is slated for a massive development in the upcoming years. The Utah State Prison is there now, but is being relocated. That will open up a couple of hundred acres, right in the middle of a very desirable location. It's a suburban setting between Salt Lake and Utah County, where a lot of the Silicon Slope tech companies are located. 

Socially, it's a lot of house gatherings, more than a diverse bar scene. There is a sizable LDS population, but most cities in SL County have a diversity of religious views. A lot of families in the area, but you could say that everywhere in Utah with the lowest median age in the country.

815,815,sociopathicsamaritan,"Spoken like someone who has absolutely no idea how any of this works. 

First, this website is almost certainly hosted on a server through AWS. It's not like it's a desktop in someone's basement. When you set up a server (or servers) to host a website, you have to allocate resources. Sure, they're probably virtual servers in this day and age, but you still allocate a finite amount of resources for that system. You choose a number of processor cores and an amount of RAM, as well as hard drive space. In this case, a site that is expected to see only a few visits per day isn't going to be given massive resources. So, people manage to run it out of resources when they all visit it for no reason. I don't even see that as a problem. Bounce the box and forget it happened. 

Incidentally, this idea of limited resources is why DDOS attacks work, and they work against literally any system if done properly. That's why ""hackers"" create malware to set up a botnet. If you infect enough systems in enough areas, any system can be shut down temporarily. In this case, the DDOS attack came because people who have no need for a site all decided to check it out at once.",1586555749,fn16hgl

Your business allows you to take advantage of two types of deductions, but the IRS says that's not allowed and comes after you for it. But then you take them to court and you win. 

In the end, the IRS (feds in this case) will always interpret things how they seem fit. That's why we have a law that a person can only get audited so many times in a given period.

Even comparing the two is entirely repulsive. I standby my statement that the W2 request is completely fabricated. A bishop is tasked with ensuring a person is doing all that is possible to meet their own needs. If he noticed you’re driving a 2020 Cadillac and yet cannot pay your rent for 3 months running then there may be a conversation about financial need versus want or downsizing your perception of financial obligation or something along those lines. It’s much less instructive than what food stamps or other state programs require. Tax documents though are not asked for.

Unless you have personal direct experience in requesting assistance and you personally were asked for a W2, just save it. Did not happen. It is not the SOP. If you make a habit out of asking for assistance over a long period of time then of course some financial counseling will be discussed. Will you have to provide a W2 from your 2019 taxes when you lost your job this February and need help buying food in April? Nope. If you’re asking for your rent to be paid for 3 months then some financial documentation is more likely to be asked for. I’m sorry I triggered you with mentioning the assistance is often expected and even demanded by the entitled generation but that wasn’t the overall point. 

I know life has to be hard when you’re stupid and can’t read and I’m sorry that was the hand you were dealt. I’m sure your mom did her best. If you need assistance (that means help) I encourage you to reach out to your local bishop. Good luck to you.",1586836337,fncgq5n

There is a 600-foot waterfall called Bridal Veil Falls in Provo Canyon. Very easy to get to from the main road. Be careful, if hiking around. People die there every year from slipping on wet rocks or even falling into the swift water. 

Stewart Falls is another good one down in that direction. About 1.5 miles or so up a paved trail at Aspen Grove, past Sundance Resort. Not sure if the gate is open or if there would be a lot of snow there still. Will probably be melting off soon though.",1586840901,fncmv0j

You could simply park in front of the gate and walk back into Jordan Pines for as long as wanted. I bet there is a lot of snow still, but it could be nice and is fairly flat.

Absolutely. I agree 100%.

That is true, but not well understood. While it is very unlikely that children will die from this infection, they can still get sick. They *can* still die. Most importantly they can still be vectors to others.

&gt;And the deaths we have had here are almost all sick, elderly people who would have most likely died this year anyway. 

That can't really be proven true or not. Those who have existing conditions certainly fare worse. You may be right.

&gt;And because the disease has not been spreading fast or killing or hospitalizing many people, our hospitals are far from being overwhelmed, to the point where local nurses here are being sent away to New York to help out over there. And from what we've all been told, the whole point of all of this is so we ""flatten the curve"" and don't overwhelm hospitals.

None of the available numbers or facts about the situation support the decision to cancel school. 

Utah is certainly doing better than a lot of other places. We've been proactive. We've got resources to bring to bear in this context (ARUP, the U, IHC, Lots of other reasons), we benefit from being a major transport hub.

&gt;That is why it's the wrong call. It is ignoring the very real problems that are already happening to our children, and focusing on a theoretical problem that all the available data shows to be an unlikely outcome.

This is where I disagree. It isn't really a theoretical problem, its a currently small problem in Utah that could grow exponentially into a disaster. If it was a theoretical problem, IHC wouldn't be sending nurses to NY. The data we have says we are doing great, but if we relied only on our data then we would be missing the forest for the trees.

I do appreciate that you wrote out your reasoning and it definitely isn't a great situation. However, if we do this right it will look like we overreacted. If we do it wrong then missing half a year of school will be the least of our kid's worries.",1586903459,fnf8p19

Because the same thing happened in Wuhan, the same thing happened in Italy, the same thing is happening across the globe...it just takes time. Utah seems pretty rural to a lot of these places, but having hot spots like this will make the spread inevitable in the long run. The biggest difference will be those who react early and decisively.

When people talk about ""Flattening the curve"" they rarely point out that its the same area under both curves. Stretching this out will reduce knock-on effects such as running out of capacity as you said in your earlier post, but it will also make it take longer. There is no quick fix for this and being too cavalier about getting back to business as normal will directly increase deaths caused by this virus. We know this.

It varies widely from country to country and from region to region. Just dive into the data in Italy and you will see that the outbreak was primarily centered in the Milan metro area (lombardy, emilia-romagna, piedmont). The rest of Italy really wasn't affected that bad. Same thing is happening in the US. New York City has been hit hard (the one city in the US that resembles a place like Milan). Detroit and New Orleans both dont look that great, but after that, most of the rest of the country is really not that bad at all. In the end, there are way more places in the world with very promising results than there are problem areas. 

I understand what flattening the curve is. The problem I have is there is this notion of basically a neverending process of flattening. There is always some justification to why we need to keep flattening and flattening, and it's never quite flat enough. And regardless of how flat our curve already is or how unimpressive our numbers are, there is always this underlying idea that it's not good enough or that worst is yet to come. And then every doomsday scenario and possible catastrophe is talked about as if the only conceivable outcome is bad, unless we endlessly flatten and flatten.

And with that in mind, it's made me think a lot about these rituals/milestones/rites of passage, as said previously, and how ever present (perhaps even all-consuming?) they are in our lives, especially for kids under 18. Will this hyperfocus on (missing) these milestones and their perceived importance put more of us at risk? Not only for the virus, but will it somehow trick them into thinking that because they have missed these things, that somehow their life is incomplete?

I’d suggest you stop in either albuquerque or or Farmington, NM. This will put you in Moab at around noon to 2 depending on where you stopped. Chances are you’ll pass through Moab if you come up through New Mexico/Roswell. Stop and explore for a day or 2. I’d also suggest coming straight up to SLC from there. While in SLC you can get acclimated a bit to the elevation and possibly take a hike in big cottonwood (bring a jacket). After this head to the wasatch area. Stop by antelope island then head East. The area between ogden and Wyoming is nice, pick any reservoir with camping and camp some while there. On the way back I would suggest going East then south through Colorado.

This is a great way to allow them to help, be part of the community, be part of the solution and stay the fuck home.

Yes, the church can afford to just donate the masks, and I'm guessing they are doing just that in other efforts. This one stands apart as a brilliant fucking idea that serves multiple different purposes.

Everyone is trying to buy masks, the market is severely backlogged.  From the article:  ""'The burn rate between Intermountain Healthcare and University of Utah Health alone is projected to grow to 70,000 masks per day', . . . said Dr. Jeremy Biggs, medical director of occupational health at University of Utah Health.  Biggs was overwhelmed by concerns about the crisis in personal protective equipment as the pandemic began.  **Suppliers informed the University of Utah that they would be unable to resupply the equipment.**""
