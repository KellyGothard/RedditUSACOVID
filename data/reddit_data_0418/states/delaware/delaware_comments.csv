Jews (Hebrew: יְהוּדִים ISO 259-2 Yehudim, Israeli pronunciation [jehuˈdim]) or Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and a nation, originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah. Jewish ethnicity, nationhood, and religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the ethnic religion of the Jewish people, while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance.Jews originated as an ethnic and religious group in the Middle East during the second millennium BCE, in the part of the Levant known as the Land of Israel. The Merneptah Stele appears to confirm the existence of a people of Israel somewhere in Canaan as far back as the 13th century BCE (Late Bronze Age). The Israelites, as an outgrowth of the Canaanite population, consolidated their hold with the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.

132,132,MrCRC1992,Then what she said was wrong but she's not representative of Republicans as a whole. Nor is she representative of the Delaware GOP. I'm a Republican and I'm not antisemitic. For you to assume such is bullshit. I read the whole thing. I think that it's mudslinging on both sides. And calling people of your faith? Do you speak for all Jews all of a sudden?

134,134,built_internet_tough,"she isn't coming out and saying ""commit violence against the jews"" or ""they aren't people"" but saying the Jews  as a whole are supporting impeachment is factually incorrect, and given todays political climate, there will be a Trump supporter, who doesn't take the time to question the statement, and harasses some Jewish people based off it. it's a very stupid statement to make especially as someone who has influence in politics in a leadership role",1577893308,fcqwkda

140,140,MrCRC1992,"More than 6 percent of the new Congress is Jewish, with 34 Jews among the total of 535 lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.

Jews make up 2 percent of the U.S. population, so Congress as a whole is more than thrice as Jewish as the country in general, according to a new [study](https://forward.com///Users/70facesmedia/Downloads/Faith-on-the-Hill-116-1-2-for-web.pdf) by the Pew Research Center on religion. All of the Jews in the Senate are Democrats, as are all but two in the House. Would it not be safe to say that those that are Jewish in the government supported impeachment proceedings against the President? I think it would be safe to say that's true. Adam Schiff is Jewish. He's also Chair of the [House Intelligence Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Permanent_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence). Who made a big deal out of this whole impeachment? Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler. Both Jewish. Both high ranking members. 

Now, I'm not going to say that Jews as a whole supported impeachment but those in government sure as hell did and still do.",1577893882,fcqxy6g
141,141,built_internet_tough,"but it is. it's prejudice against the Jews, as she sees them mostly as tools of the democrats. she is tying being Jewish to being Democrat, and implying they are anti-Trump due to that. She is painting the entire Jewish population with a negative brush, thus the antisemitism claim",1577894026,fcqya46

If she was frustrated at Democrats in general, that’s one thing, but singling out Jewish Democrats for some reason, holding them to a higher standard than gentile Democrats, or somehow making an assertion that being Jewish means you’re a Democrat, that is classic anti-Semitism. Religion has nothing to do with political leanings. 

Also, you can’t make an assertion like that without proof. What’re your statistics for how many Jewish people are right or left? I’d really love to see them, because I think you’re pulling that out of your ass.",1577895185,fcr11ed
146,146,built_internet_tough,"sure, and if she specifically named Schiff/Nadler no one would have cared. but she did generalize, saying ""many Jews lend themselves to the Dems fake impeachment"". Many Jews could imply the Jews in Congress, or Jews as a whole people. and people easily interpret the same statement with different meanings. so it was a stupid thing for her to say, and even if she didn't mean for it to be all Jews,  you can see even in this subreddit, some people are interpreting that way. And since we are all American, it's outputting to see someone supposed to be represnting all Americans put out statements like that,  because even if she didn't mean it that way, it shows she didn't take the time to think about what she was saying and how it might be construed",1577895453,fcr1moo

Another quote is “Only God knows whether this kind of Jews [sic] are really believers in God or do they believe in the same God that many Democrats believe in ‘the father of all lies."" That quote means she thinks Jews worship the Devil.

From what I remember the only place you can get it in Delaware is from a Christiana Care facility (unless you’re under 25.  There is a youth gender wellness program at A.I. Hospital).  I called them up and told them I wanted to start hrt and set an appointment.  The first appointment was basically just a check up and they said I needed to meet with their psychiatrist before moving forward.  After that I had another appointment with the doctor to go over changes etc. and sign papers, then had bloodwork done, and then another appointment to go over the bloodwork and get my prescription which I was able to pick up that day and then made an appointment with a nurse to learn how to do the shot.

""Faggot"" was originally a slur for older single women in the 1600's, because they would be out gathering bundles of sticks by themselves and doing menial work by themselves because they were so ugly/useless that no man would do it for them.

This eventually took on an association with burning women and witches. The American slur started in the 1910's and is assumed to be implying that gays are feminine and disgusting. It might have also carried over the burning/witchcraft inclinations form the original slur, but nobody knows exactly for sure. 

A lot of people did like to use faggot as a slur because of the association with burning, but that started getting popular in the 1930's - 20 years after the slur first started being commonly used - so, they can't pinpoint for sure if that was part of the original intent or was later retroactively associated with it by terrible people who wanted to make the slur even more terrible.",1577940729,fctejbe

Faggot, often shortened to fag, is a pejorative term used chiefly in North America primarily to refer to a gay male. Alongside its use to refer to gay men in particular, it may also be used as a pejorative term for a ""repellent male"" or to refer to women who are lesbian. Its use has spread from the United States to varying extents elsewhere in the English-speaking world through mass culture, including film, music, and the Internet.

* To the People of Delaware and my fellow Republicans,
Here we are now in 2020 where we know the English language and yet have little understanding of context or intent.
I had a friend call me concerning the upset of many Republican Party members calling for my head for a word I used in a FB conversation with a Close male friend that was picked up by the Blue Delaware Blog. That word was “faggots.” My friend asked me why I used that specific word. He said, “Dude, I know you have many friends who are gay or lesbian, so why choose this word?” I told him I have been using that word since before it ever meant what people are offended by today. In this context I used it for it’s impact &amp; it was between close friends. Knowing that I am not a Homophobe nor have an ounce of bigotry in my blood, he understood and left it at that. Hell, I have been instrumental in bringing gay candidates into this upcoming election for the GOP. Why would I do that if I was “of the mind” the article claims me to be? The friend I was in conversation on the thread with was not offended, nor was anyone else in that thread.
So, Why are so many so upset? Was my intent to disparage any gay individual or community? No. Did I cause injury to any gay individual or group? Nope! Did anyone reading this thread suffer an injury or loss? No. Is this a reveal of my mind? LOL, not even close. Anyone who knows me knows the answer to this is an emphatic No. It was locker room talk between 2 men.
And yet, here I am writing this post now in the year 2020 where we know the Language is English but have little understanding of context or intent. Where I differ from most people is that I am also a firm believer that being offended is a choice or a Voluntary Act. A self-inflicted wound per se! Blaming someone else for your upset? Well, that’s just being childish.
What saddens me is that so many in the GOP not only suffer from this lack of understanding, but are Hyper-quick to kick under the bus anyone based upon an article from an Anti-American, Progressive Democratic Blog. And I believe this contributes as to why the GOP has such a time succeeding in Delaware. As we have witnessed for years, the Democrats would have each other’s back if they were guilty of a multitude of crimes, including capital crimes. I use a word in a locker room context calling out FaceBook and GOP Bladders go into full spasm mode from a Progressive Left Blog article. So, let’s continue to allow the Dems to control the narrative and lob hand grenades over the wall to keep us splintered. You know what they say, “You only catch Flak when you’re over the target.”
While I have only been the Chair of New Castle County for a short while, I am not afraid to say I have made some solid gains where little was done in the past. I honor and Respect our State Chair, Jane Brady and serve at the Chairs Pleasure. I am and will continue to support GOP Candidates who uphold their oaths to the Constitution as I have continued to uphold mine these past 43 years. Have I called some folks out &amp; made a few enemies? Sure. Because the ONLY way to avoid being a target and causing controversy is to do nothing.
And haven’t we had a surplus of that in recent years?

I'm a proud progressive who comes from a right-wing family, and I have longtime friends whom I'd characterise as Reaganite/Rockefeller Republicans. They're good people, and we can have good-natured sincere discussions about politics in which we disagree but respect each other's differences and even, occasionally, listen to each other with an open mind. However, it's been really difficult and personally painful to witness some of these people struggle with the incongruity between their long-held values and their current party--or more sadly begin to completely betray their values and try to ret-con some of the evil stuff that the Trump administration is doing into their own views about what's wrong and what's right. The experience of listening to a friend who long prided himself on his strong Catholic beliefs trying to justify the current treatment of immigrants at the Southern borders is utterly depressing. The values that I once admired him for are being slowly replaced by empty strings of Fox News talking points that are incoherently strung together.

I didn't vote for her and the only way I would have if she would have nominated Bernie or Warren for her running mate.  And her donors vetoed that outright.",1578061226,fcxf1lk

Basic rule of thumb if something is outside of your body that should be inside of it, difficulty breathing, chest pains, stroke, car accident  or bleeding that cannot be controlled then you go to the emergency room.  These are the things that get moved in front of vomiting, general not feeling well, sprains, abrasions minor lacerations and tooth aches.

Christiana is also the local level 1 trauma center so people are airlifted from other hospitals for more comprehensive care and this adds to the wait.

Their recommendation is to contact the state liquor board to see what the state laws are.  I can't find anything specifically about any state and their laws in regards to importing wine from out of the country.  I also didn't dig too deeply on each state website.

1. It wasn't even a super nice/new truck. We're talking a 4-5 year old Ford F250 that hadn't seen a car wash in a good bit of time.
2. He was parked such that he was taking up FOUR spots. It wasn't that he just parked on the line, taking up two, he parked on the intersection of four spots.

The reason the wait gets so incredibly long is because cases such as this are at the back of the line. We bring in some people on our ambulance for back pain that has been bothering them for weeks and they decide to go to the hospital, then cuss at me because the hospital had us move them to triage, which is basically just a waiting room from ambulance drop offs.",1578342848,fdenoob

Many complaints online about cash app and people reported no phone # for cash app to complain to and terrible customer service via email.

The rule of thumb in hospitals is you WANT to wait a while in the ER. If you're in the ER and you get pushed to the front of the line, you're at risk of life, limb, or eyesight, something like that.

982,982,RiflemanLax,"I would refer this to a postal inspector.

As some background I’m a fraud investigator with years of experience. This sounds like a scheme that isn’t exactly a ‘new’ fraud trend, but the popularity has increased in recent years. 

Basically the perps scout locations based on ease of stealing mail. Then they use a service like LexisNexis or Clear or whatever to get your personal info. Those are usually only available to banks or law enforcement so they usually have someone working at a financial institution who they pay for the info.

Then they apply for the accounts with all good info and have it sent to the good address, then steal the cards out of the mail when they arrive. Since everything looks good on the bank end they have no reason to believe it’s fraud until the balances blow up.

Not sure what bank backs that Cash App card, but usually perps feast on smaller banks with less established procedures. Or newer products with bigger banks because the backing bank is still trying to nail down expected spending for that product.

The reason to go to the postal inspectors is because A. these went through the mail, and B. they’re better than regular PD. Postal inspectors are my law enforcement of choice whenever I can engage them. It’s no contest- they’re tenacious bastards, and very good at financial fraud, especially fraud rings. Regular PD ain’t going to get it done here. These rings tend to travel- hit one area, move to the next. Had one run from Maine to Florida and back up and down. They don’t sit still. For this you’re going to get County PD and they only know how to work domestic violence and have a limited reach.",1578404774,fdgpdw4

1121,1121,PizzaForce1,"I worked at the Charcoal pit over the summer of 2014.  During this period is when Obama visited.  Somethings O can list off about my time there:

-The place overall is a little run down, especially what you wouldnt normally see in the dining area on a visit.  It feels like it hasn't been updated in 30 years. 

-Cleanliness wise it actually wasnt that bad.  I worked in the kitchen and all the grills, work surfaces and fryers were cleaned before, during, and after service. The walk in wasn't dirty but that was probably because the menu wasnt complex and turnover of food was very fast. 

-Weird items and steaks are probably frozen.  Did you know there is salmon on the menu? Yeah its frozen along with the porthouse and NY strip.

-Most of the food supplies seemed ok quality but the cooking skill applied varied widely.  I had a manager that thought he was very good and I never saw him cook a steak that wasnt way overdone. 

-Salads and ice cream were made by the wait staff or the to-go counter. This at least kept contamination down for the kitchen staff but i dont know how serious the wait staff were about cleanliness when the place got busy. 

-I was unfortunately not working when Obama stopped in. I was on the shift after it which was simultaneously the charcoal pit's best and my worst shift ever.  They put up a sign on all the doors that said ""Obama Special"" which was just the normal burger with fries that he ordered but with an extra dollar on the cost.  At some point during service we actually ran out of patties we were selling so much so someone ran and bought more at the grocery.  Place continued to be very busy for the next few days.  Friend of my was the server for Obama and still talks about.  Pretty sure Obama roasted him at one point for being nervous and was just cracking jokes.  He definitely said Biden told him to come. 

Overall, it was a crappy place to work and management was always mad but it was pretty clean and some of the cooks could actually make good food.  Was it the Must Go To Place in Delaware? HELL NO.

It's like Sherlock Holmes quote on the country

&gt;“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?”

&gt;“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.”

&gt;“You horrify me!”

&gt;“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.

On the back end, the states figure out what of the taxes that have already been withheld go to PA and which to DE. If I get a refund (or if I owe a small amount), it's all figured out.

If you do see a reduction in take home pay, it may be due to differences in state tax brackets. For example, DE personal income tax is 6.6% and PA is 3%, so someone working in PA who lived in PA would pay 3% state income tax - but if he or she moved to DE while still working in PA, they'd pay more state income tax (but save on sales tax and property tax).

How do you know exactly where to point your telescope?",1579012916,fedj8k9
1650,1650,FrizzleFriend,"Thanks! I love sharing them. Excellent question. Many of the targets I shoot are invisible to the eyes even if you have a reasonably powerful telescope. They are just too dim for our pathetic eyes. So there's no way to visually frame the target in the camera.  The only way to see them is with long exposure photography.

The telescope mount is computer controlled.  First I have to align it with the star Polaris, and the celestial north pole. This is the point in the sky that the entire sky rotates around. This is called polar alignment and is one of the major keys to the whole process.

Then I tell it my current GPS coordinates, date, time, and altitude.  Once that's done, the computer will know roughly where the telescope is pointed and is ready to be fine tuned using allignment stars.  So I will tell it to point to an alignment star. It will get close, but not dead on. I adjust it so it's dead on. Then I repeat the star alignment.  Now the computer can point the telescope at objects that are invisible to us.

So now I tell the scope to point at my target.  It will be in frame but will still need to be framed properly to make a nice picture. 30 second exposures will usually reveal enough of the target to make final framing adjustments.

Then I calibrate my guide camera. This is a second telescope and camera mounted on top of the main telescope. It's only function is to lock on to a guide star and tell the telescope mount how to move to stay dead centered on target as the sky moves. This is how I'm able to get very long exposures without the stars looking like a trailing mess.

It starts with researching what targets are in the sky at the time though. Objects available now are not available in another month or so.",1579014827,fedm0s3

Don't feel that's particularly applicable to the initial crime here, personally.  This guy was arrested for a DUI, not carrying an ounce of weed.  That's *extremely* dangerous behavior, which needs to be restricted.  The guy was being monitored to make sure he didn't drink anymore -- that's why he had to meet with a parole officer -- because his drinking could have catastrophic consequences.  He blew off that restriction, which is why he went to jail.  Probation is leniency -- you get to keep some degree of freedom in exchange for being monitored, instead of going to jail.  He broke that agreement, and since his initial crime was not only a threat to himself but to others, it 100% makes sense he should return to prison.

How he was treated in prison was absolutely, categorically wrong, but the reason he was in prison?  Honestly, one of the best reasons there is.  He wasn't able to function responsibly in society with his addiction.",1579024987,fee2f11

I'm not entirely pulling this out of my ass, I've read articles and some light sociological research that touched on it.  See: what you mentioned, Anders Breivik in Norway and others.

Of course these ideologies know no borders (kind of ironically) but I think it's worth reflecting on. 

 I'm not well versed in Scandinavian history but I know Canada's treatment of it's First Nations people is on par with that of the U.S. and our indigenous people and there is a history of confrontation and racial discord up there as well that I'm sure provides quite the incubator for these ideologies as well.

1968,1968,wholeheartedxvx,"sure. no sarcasm here, friend. here's honestly how it works:

overnight truck comes. employees strip the shelves of expired product, rotate the new product toward the back and the old product toward the front, fill the shelves up again. they check the corporate map and work any new seasonal products into designated places on the shelf, which first requires rearranging to make space. they run a report on price changes and replace signage. they log and throw away the old product and complete another dozen tasks to make the store safe, clean, and ready for customers.

store opens. customers shop, cashiers ring them up. department buyers take inventory, check order lists, run reports and place tomorrow's orders. staff assists customers.

mid-day thru closing time: shit's busy. staff culls all the produce that has gone wilted or spotted or otherwise poor quality throughout the morning, wipes down the shelves to keep fruit flies away. staff re-stocks the emptying shelves, but it takes ***much*** longer now, as they are constantly re-directed by customers requesting help (*hovering*). staff complete safety walks, food temperature walks, out-of-stock walks, and perform cleaning duties to make the store run smoothly (*milling around*).

there's more that happens after the store closes, but this is the basics.",1579271317,femwc2u

Never had a house with them before, small holes in the vinyl, spaced maybe every 8-10 feet all around the house. Whenever the wind got strong enough, we'd hear the noise. Doesn't take much wind, certainly not strong enough to be able to hear it blowing from inside the house.

In talking to a restaurant owner friend one time, he told me it's near impossible for even the best restaurant owner not to have roaches once in a while.   Apparently the food service companies (eg. Sysco) bring them in.   Roaches love corrugated cardboard, they leg their eggs and live in the holes/cells of cut edges of cardboard.   So the best thing to do is immediately transfer all food out of boxes and into plastic tubs with lids.  Then break down boxes and get them out of the restaurant. But that's a lot of work.     The thing is, many restaurants will just cut open around the top of a box and store food like that.  

They also use the boxes throughout the restaurant for other things, like laying down on wet floors, or storing say pizza pans in a box.     He's gone through and made all stainless steel storage units for his pans, and other items.

2447,2447,WikiTextBot,"**Nazism**

National Socialism (German: Nationalsozialismus), more commonly known as Nazism (), is the ideology and practices associated with the Nazi Party—officially the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP)—in Nazi Germany, and of other far-right groups with similar ideas and aims.

Nazism is a form of fascism and showed that ideology's disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system, but also incorporated fervent antisemitism, anti-communism, scientific racism, and eugenics into its creed. Its extreme nationalism came from Pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist völkisch movement prominent in the German nationalism of the time, and it was strongly influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in World War I, from which came the party's ""cult of violence"" which was ""at the heart of the movement.""Nazism subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism, identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race. It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (Volksgemeinschaft).

2702,2702,drjlad,"The People Vs. Mr. McWhippy:

I am of the belief that he is not being truthful.  There is too much in common here to not be Mr. Whippy. 

**Exhibit A**: 

&gt;He about in his mid 40’s  
&gt;  
&gt;he used to drive an ice cream truck when he was about 16

This puts us somewhere between 24-33 years ago(1989-1996) depending on if hes 40-49.  As u/drthvdr87 pointed out, the [Mr. Whippy website](http://www.misterwhippy.com/history.html) even mentions selling some trucks to people in Delaware in 1991.  

&gt; He sold most of the ice cream trucks to men in Delaware and New York.  
In 1991 

**Exhibit B:** 

&gt; it was a bright pink truck 

[Mr Whippy trucks](https://www.google.com/search?q=mr+whippy+ice+cream+truck&amp;safe=off&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTcsPUWOnIEivcaey9xmXKF871_mw:1579877342144&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjkl5HevZznAhXChOAKHamnCDUQ_AUoAnoECBAQBA&amp;biw=1745&amp;bih=881#imgrc=_)

**Exhibit C:** 

&gt; on the side there was a big ice cream bar with overalls on it 

[Ice cream cone in overalls logo](http://nebula.wsimg.com/f8780939ac510b1bfc408f7112f67fbd?AccessKeyId=E47E9BE0FD53FC195A65&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1)

**Exhibit D**:

&gt; i was set up by a colleague of his who taught at brandywine. 

This stems from a response to [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/esx39w/teacherice_cream_truckmcnickname_i_have_your/) with the information. u/kristinauaezac says: 

&gt; update: that is not the name of the truck. he is in contact with his old coworkers from Brandywine and they told him that I was looking, gave a fake name, which you gave to me. 

In my post I mispoke.  My wife's stepdad has worked for Brandywine for a long time and she knows many of the teachers so I went to her so she could ask him/them.  She posted on her Facebook directly in lieu of asking them.  Apparently one of her friends reached out to Mr. McWhippy himself but **he would not divulge the information to her either.**  

The Mr. Whippy name came from a former student that while uncertain, believed it to have been Mr. Whippy.  **To my understanding, a colleague/friend did approach Jay Mac to ask but there was no setup and he did not give any name/misleading information.** 

There was no fake name provided by a former co-worker.  

**Summary**:

It is my belief that the truck was a Mr. Whippy truck.  I am asking someone else that is friends with him on FB if they have any information.",1579879135,fff9oci

Think back to how forward and brilliant thinking DE politicians were years ago for A. the chancery court which virtually guaranteed us to be the incorporation king for decades, and B. the credit card usury laws which brought a ton of banking here..... when’s the last time someone in state government actually came up with a clever idea or plan to get a huge amount of new business.

However, this witness would then be required to appear at any and all court actions against the violator and testify to the observed violations.

Better planning of developments Residential &amp; commercial can help 60% the peoples voice can help out 30% &amp; the state representatives can help 10% by making it possible. 

Let me give an example of how good planning can work, take a city for example any one really, they are a balance between walking, biking or other wheel ride, cars &amp; trains. With all of these together it helps everyone get around without having just one or two options. 

Our suburban areas have only 2-3 modes of transportation 

1- Cars is the main one
2-Bus or shared ride is the 2nd one
3-Bikes, but barley anyone does this if the destination is too far or the weather is inclement. Who would put their self in those elements &amp; also if you include the high rate of speed vehicles travel. 

Now if you think your area is congested come up north to New Castle or even Philly. You’ll see how our traffic issues are not as bad car wise, But everything else we lack. 

Now in order to fix our suburbs we would need to support new developments that are walkable, bike able &amp; built in a way where stores, homes &amp; etc are accessible without a car. 

This takes a lot of planning &amp; effort from everyone but will save us in the long run

Kent County in general has no identity. It’s pretty much all franchises, no culture, nothing to really lure you in. 
It really got the short end of the stick, not close enough to the beaches to be exciting and not really close enough to the cities to really be exciting.

I lived in various parts of new castle county for the first 33 years of my life. I worked in Dover, but commuted from northern Delaware from 30-33. Decided to move there to shorten my commute. Lived in Dover from 33-35 years old. I’ve honestly never been more unhappy in my entire life. It fucking sucks. There is nothing to do. There were like 2 or 3 bars you could go to and maybe not worry about your safety. People in general just suck and are unfriendly. I would never recommend anyone move there.

I moved to Lewes 8 years ago. It’s like night and day. The people are totally different. You see familiar faces and people you’ve met everywhere you go. I met a few worthwhile people in dover.

It's true if your bored with Wilmington/Newark you're probably gonna be really bored with Dover. There are some hidden jewels as far as restaurants but there is much less selection. 

With that being said it is a much quieter atmosphere depending on where you live. I personally have lived south of Dover my whole life and you couldn't pay me to live in Newark/Wilmington unless you had deep pockets. I hate it up there. But I know that there is a lot of stuff to do there, I just wouldn't like the day to day.

The beach and a quieter area is probably the 2 highlights. Me personally, I can go have friends over in my fenced back yard and have a bonfire, sleep with my backdoor unlocked (not in Dover btw) and be to myself in a small town. But there are definitely times I wish there was more to do.

From the sounds of it, I tend to agree with everyone you're probably going to find yourself incredibly bored in Dover. I like the quiet but it sounds like you like being in close proximity in a city and I don't think Dover is gonna satisfy that.

So living in Dover, or the surrounding area is probably going to feel boring because it's more rural and less concentrated, but overall it's not a bad area. But I'm 35 and not about the crazy nightlife. I like my peace and quiet.",1580166188,ffrum7l

You don't have to talk if you don't want to, just listen. To make the best of it though, at least get some phone numbers from people for support and future meetings.
You may not like the first one you choose, but don't let that discourage you, try a few more different ones. All are different but operate on the same premise.

3129,3129,nexuscard,"Wilmington airport (ILG) has a relatively small catchment area.  Catchment area refers to population that would consider ILG first as a primary airport.  The catchment areas for Baltimore (BWI) and Philadelphia (PHL) nearly overlap and offer a much broader range of flights and options.

The other small airport in the general region that serves Frontier exclusively, Trenton (TTN) has a larger catchment area combining both the Delaware Valley and middle New Jersey. 

I can't see this second time around for Frontier yielding any different outcome at ILG.   

Another issue with Frontier at ILG is that it is the only carrier out of the airport.   

You do not have any convenient options to get back to ILG if Frontier decides to cancel your return flight due to ""problems"".   

Neighbors of mine who flew from ILG to Orlando (MCO)  in 2014 patted themselves on the back for getting such a good deal on their fares.  Then on Sunday afternoon when they arrived at MCO airport to return, the desk agent for Frontier told them ""sorry, the flight today to Wilmington has been cancelled.    You will be given priority boarding for our next flight - three days from now"" 

As they needed to be at their jobs the following morning, my neighbors could not wait three days for Frontier.  They had to book last minute (and expensive) one way fares from MCO to PHL on another carrier and then take a cab ride back from PHL to their parked car at ILG.  

Needless to say, they no longer viewed their trip as a bargain and will never fly on Frontier from ILG again.",1580252496,ffuzska

[***It's a Sorry World***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8318uHMlk-Y), by Tim Wilson (RIP)


You can go to war when you're 18  
But you can't buy a beer  
You can load missiles on a submarine  
But you can't buy a pistol here  
You can breathe chemical-weapon fumes  
But they don't want you to smoke  
So when you're shootin' up a bar in Baghdad, don't order a rum and coke


&amp;nbsp;


You can have sex when you're 17  
You just can't have the cigarette  
You ain't old enough for a slot machine  
Or to lay down a football bet  
But they'll take you to the clinic if you're 15  
And your folks don't have to know  
Or you can take penicillin,  
Just don't watch people gettin' naked on video


&amp;nbsp;


You can be a governor at 21  
Or a president at 35  
You can be the senator from South Carolina  
If you can just stay alive  
They'll throw you in with sharks when you're 12 years old  
Teach you to scuba dive  
But when you're 94 and can't see anymore  
They'll still let you drive  


&amp;nbsp;


Just don't get caught with no beer in your hand if you just turned 18  
They don't mind you ownin' an acetylene torch  
And a gallon of gasoline  
You just can't buy smokes at the liquor store or y'all will both go to jail  
But they'll sell you the rope  
So you can hang yourself while you're listening to Nine Inch Nails  


&amp;nbsp;


It's a sorry world  
It's a sooorry world  


&amp;nbsp;


It's a sorry world when you can raise younguns but you can't smoke a Marlboro  
It's a sorry world  
It's a sooorry world  
It's a sorry world when you're 17 and you can't call a callgirl.",1580267603,ffvmh6b

I am opposed to gun control, but this is my proposal to fix the current broken system:

* By law ATF can only use microfilm and microfiche to store records. This is ridiculous and makes it much harder, longer, and expensive to trace guns. They need to be computerized.

* Universal registration. You give away or sell a gun, a background check must be run. There are very good reasons why the vast majority of guns used in murders are bought on the secondary market.

* A federal law holding gun owners accountable for guns that fall into the hands of criminals. Someone steals your guns? File a police report and you have no problems.  Guns need to be secured, there are more pre-school children killed each year than cops.

The NRA opposes these because it would mean far fewer guns manufactured.  Keep in mind the vast amounts of money pumped into the NRA comes from gun manufacturers.

My problem with her is she is promising the world with no actual plans to move forward with those promises. It's kind of like everyone out there wants World Peace, but what really matters is how you plan to achieve that.

I think you're really blowing the whole racist thing up a bit too much. DE schools aren't really that segregated either, other than people with money send their kids to private school. Our schools are shit because the funding for them goes to the bloated amount of overhead in each district. Anytime we vote them to get more money, it goes to the same bloat.


Overall, personally I wouldn't vote for Scarane because her plans really aren't plans, just ideas. Someone asked her where she's going to get the money for her pseudo-universal income and she responded with the $19b increase in defense spending from last year. That's not an answer. Even if you think that money should go to schools or universal income, how are you going to achieve that? If there's one thing everyone in the US can agree on it's that the government spends way too much money on stupid shit, the problem and what we want senators to figure out is how to force that spending into things we do want. Corporations are not the problem in Delaware. Half the corporations in Delaware are small businesses, 15 employees are less. There's no chance in hell you're going to win my vote by telling me you're going to make corporations pay for all these new expenses. Tell me you're going to go after bloated mega-corp's, then maybe you're getting somewhere. But even then if you were to go after a company such as Walmart or Amazon, they're going to just leave the state. There needs to be actual plans and not just idea's written down for these changes she wants to implement.


I couldn't find the info on decriminalizing all drugs, but if that's the case it just solidifies my stance. That's a pipe dream for people that have lived sheltered lives. Hard drugs fuck up a lot more than just the person using them. Saying they need to be put into rehab and not jail is not a solution to the problem. If they're not forced, aka incarcerated, to do the rehab than a huge majority of them would not do it.

3278,3278,scrovak,"As far as I know, there is no current registration system, with the exception of National Firearms Act Title II weapons, i.e. actual bona fide machine guns.

Currently in Delaware, the purchase of any pistol must be done via Federal Firearm Licensee who performs a background check on the buyer. The same requirement exists for any purchase of new firearms. The part that gets lax is person to person teansfer of firearms.

One of the key examples people use to argue against P2P transfer regulations are a grandfather buying a 12yr old his first hunting rifle, or a man inheriting his dad's firearms. Performing a NICS check can cost as much as $50 which, in the case of a grandfather buying his grandson his first .22, can be almost half the cost of the rifle itself.

The first thing we need to do in order to make universal background checks commonplace is to fund them. Provide funding so that any Delaware resident purchasing or selling a firearm may have a NICS performed on themselves or the other party for free. Find a way to anonymize it - if you're buying a rifle from someone on a gun forum, you don't want him/her to have access to your SSN and personal info, so give every NICS a reference number that will pull up the name and photo of the prospective buyer. That way, the seller does his/her due dilligence at no financial burden to themselves or the buyer, the buyer's personal information is protected, and all parties are happy.

As for the firearm security, I agree wholeheartedly. That said, if a collector owns say 200 firearms between antiques and competition builds, and someone steals one or two, how often does he/she have to perform inventory on their firearms before noticing they went missing? That is the biggest hurdle I see with that idea. If there are provisions for people who were not aware their firearm had been taken, I support it.",1580325685,ffxi9gm

The estimated death rate for the coronavirus by the CDC is 0.02 = 2% death rate.  That's 4x the death rate from the flu.  This means, if the corona virus were to infect 15,000,000 people, the death rate would be ~32,800, substantially more than your 8200 number

You're right. This is all a waste of time. People need medical treatment now and can't keep waiting for the government or the insurance companies. Opiates are poisoning communities while we debate. Our soldiers are dying in deserts when they should be home. Nazis are trying to make a comeback.

We all face adversity in our lives.   The deck may have been stacked against black people in my grandfather's generation, but that doesn't mean I want it stack against me in mine.

&gt; Consider that statistcally, we as white people tend to have better access to better education as a start.

Statistics don't mean diddly shit on an individual level.  There's one of two ways to look at this: Either you have defined me by a single factor (My skin color), or think that I failed because I didn't get to go to college.  You want to complete ignore class, or losing my mother in high school, because the only factor you feel that matters in my educational attainment was that I'm white?  That's frankly completely fucking insulting. It's a filthy, prejudicial view based on a single characteristic you know about me: My race.  Want to take a guess at the word for ""prejudice formed on race""?

&gt; Economic justice is for everyone though, not just POC.

You should inform Scarane about a typo on her website, where the portion I quoted erroneously had the header ""**Racial** Justice"".

&gt; But the point is that the difference in wealth is growing and the middle class is shrinking.

I'm not in the middle class.  I am working class.

I don't really like corporate money in politics, but I like my union having the ability to lobby for us as a whole, so it'd be hypocritical for me to call for the end of ""Money in politics [Except my money.]""  And at the end of the day, abolishing that would just make individual donors and PACs more powerful, which skews the influence from at least corporations with stakeholders in them to lone individuals?

&gt; **SMOKE DETECTORS**
&gt; 
&gt; The ploy: Fashion a dirty bomb using a radioactive chemical commonly found in smoke detectors, infecting all those in the blast’s vicinity with radiation sickness
&gt; 
&gt; This one was actually tried by an Islamist terrorist cell led by Indian emigrant Dhiren Barot in London back in 2004 as part of a larger plot to Wreak Havoc in New York City, Newark, and Britain. Raids following a yearlong covert surveillance operation turned up a suspiciously large supply of smoke detectors in one of the cell’s safe houses. Law enforcement agencies believed the group was planning to either harvest a man-made radioactive chemical found in the smoke detectors called Americium-241 and use it to create a dirty bomb or to just blow up a large cache of smoke detectors to have the same effect.
&gt; 
&gt; The likelihood: In reality, the plot was pretty laughable. Americium-241, though radioactive, has to be present in large quantities to make anyone sick — let alone kill them. For example, the group would have had to harvest Americium from 10,000 smoke detectors to cause 500 people to get radiation sickness. Even then, the amount of released radiation would be manageable by authorities and unlikely to cause fatalities. There’s a reason there have never been warnings about disposing of your household smoke detectors; even if they are found in large quantities in the landfill, they would have a negligible impact.",1580478059,fg3cqkk

The June 2012 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest derecho was one of the most destructive and deadly fast-moving severe thunderstorm complexes in North American history. The progressive derecho tracked across a large section of the Midwestern United States and across the central Appalachians into the mid-Atlantic states on the afternoon and evening of June 29, 2012, and into the early morning of June 30, 2012. It resulted in a total of 22 deaths, millions of power outages across the entire affected region, and a damage total of US$2.9 billion which  exceeded that of all but the top 25 Atlantic tropical cyclones. The storm prompted the issuance of four separate severe thunderstorm watches by the Storm Prediction Center.

I only went to one in the early aughts - compare that to what they had 10 years later and it was totally different.  The machines were huge and powerful and very dangerous.  They needed to have good liability insurance but didn't.

It followed the natural progression of getting bigger and flashier - think football in the 60's versus today.

Stopgap solution: Go back to simple-powered machines. Make it the Trebuchet Chunk. Run it without the giant redneck air cannons that can explode if you look at them wrong. Run that for a few years, prove that you can run a safe event, and then try again.

You get what you pay for, and the places I’ve worked for in the area all figured that out. This is likely your competition if you’re fintech.

The trains running later could be an added bonus but in no way is that my primary concern.  

But also low income people do often work later, the service industry for example is full of low income people who work late at places like hotels and bars and restaurants. There are also people working night shifts as security guards, or janitors. A train running later would enable people in Wilmington to seek a wider range of jobs in Philly, not just recreation.

For your example, yes, theoretically you could “use mom’s address”, but when you file your taxes, I would assume that has to be your address. I would also assume that two people filing jointly would be considered a “household”. The household would pay 4% of their income for healthcare.

You make a good point that it might help *some* lower-income folks, but I think the number would be quite tiny for the investment that would be required.  



And for high-speed rail, it would be about $200,000,000,000 to put in high-speed rail just from DC to Boston (including displacing lots of people by demolishing their homes for straight rail lines).

That said, the 32 trillion may actually end up being less than we would have spent on healthcare otherwise over a 10 year period. It's not a guarantee, [but it's one of two potential outcomes found in a study funded by the Koch brothers around two years ago.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/aug/03/bernie-s/did-conservative-study-show-big-savings-bernie-san/) The other outcome was it costing more of course, but I really think it boils down to just how much support and adoption the plan gets. Unfortunately, I admit I am worried about how much opposition the plan would get, as the private insurance industry stands to lose a lot of money if the USA joins other countries in offering universal healthcare. Correct  me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that one of the reasons healthcare is so much more expensive in the USA compared to other countries is that hospitals in the USA have to inflate their prices just to get the insurance companies to pay them what they actually need. If that's accurate, then there are definitely going to be growing pains while prices adjust and private insurance companies scramble to remain relevant and competitive while still turning a profit.

4459,4459,kazoodac,"I have to preface this with the fact that I disagree with you on almost every point…but one place we do agree on is the fact that Democrats are slimy as all hell. The only reason I registered as a Democrat is to be able to vote in the primaries, and I’ll be changing back to independent after the election. We’ve got bigger things to discuss, but one thing I really hope Delaware does in the next few years is join the majority of US states in adopting an open or semi-open primary system. But anyway, Bernie is no Democrat, and that’s just one of the many reasons I think we should support him. Running as a Democrat was his best chance to make a difference in 2016, and due to the corruption of the two-party system, that still remains true. The government envisioned by the founding fathers has mutated horrendously over the last few centuries, and the two-party system is one of the most grievous of these changes. It was never supposed to be that way, but both the GOP and the DNC benefit tremendously from it, so here we are. But the DNC is terrified of Bernie for many reasons, not the least of which being the fact that he has time and time again rejected the slime that you and I both detest. No bribes, no Super PACs, no people who make more in a day than you and I will in a lifetime pulling the strings. In a way, he represents several of the traits that made Trump himself so appealing to many: Disrupting the system, draining the swamp, speaking his mind, taking no shit, and not being in anyone’s pocket. The country needs someone like that, but I believe Bernie Sanders is that man more than Trump ever was or will be. Of course the DNC wants to beat Trump, but they want to do it with someone that maintain their status quo…so they stabbed Bernie in the back in 2016. How did Bernie respond? He grit his teeth and kept fighting for his ideals…four years later, he’s got more momentum than ever. Regardless of your stance on his politics, I’m sure you can appreciate the courage and fortitude it takes to soldier on for what you believe in despite betrayal and pushback on all sides. He deserves admiration for that alone. Forget political parties for a moment. Forget the platforms and policies. Even with all the gone, Bernie Sanders is the kind of PERSON I want in the White House. He’s straightforward, brave, experienced, and resolute. He’s promoting acceptance, tolerance, and equality. His campaign is centered on and fueled by inclusion and collaboration. To me he represents the America learning about…the one I so desperately want to believe in again. Now, I know I can’t change your mind with a Reddit post, but I hope I was at least able to give you another perspective to consider.

I can speak to your example, I’m actually a teacher. Teachers are required to carry a bachelor’s degree at a minimum, but new teachers aren’t getting much of a look without a master’s degree. So, a lot of us have advanced degrees and, more often than not, are in a lot of student debt. As far as jobs go, compared to other professions with bachelor and master degrees, teachers are paid significantly less. 

So, there’s a lot of debt and comparatively low pay. The best scientists and mathematicians and scholars aren’t opting to teach. And it’s worse for private school. They don’t have to follow the state’s pay scale and pay a lot less than public schools do. I worked at a school in Wilmington, in the city. They got grants specifically for technology a year or so before I got there. And it was great for our kids. But we still didn’t have enough teachers or support staff to really give our kids the best learning environment possible. But they had to spend that money on technology because that’s what the grant was for. Ultimately, if we get funding specifically to pay teachers, it would get better.

I sympathize with Polaski's frustration - the district, the schools and the teachers really struggle to help kids who don't have a foundation of learning before they come to school. His recommendation to take them from their parents is unacceptable even if he isn't really serious.

So how do we ensure that all children learn the fundamentals of knowledge (i.e. numbers, colors, parts of body, etc.)? This would be a good question for John Carney and/or any of the presidential candidates. 

Since subsidized childcare for all with caregivers required to go through a more rigorous training/licensing (a la Denmark, Netherlands, Portugal) is very unlikely, my plan is to  give every kid a mobile phone at birth loaded with educational videos and not let the phone be able to download anything or watch anything but educational videos :-)",1581471917,fhcvtxi

The reservoir in Newark is a cool walking spot with lots of wildlife to see and there's a really cool inclusive playground there too

If you want more ""qualified"" in-state students to attend, pay your fair share of taxes in to the state for our schools, and to the City of Newark to make the surrounding campus more desirable.

4943,4943,purrfect_seashell,"UD president: Lack of qualified students to blame for low in-state enrollment

NATALIA ALAMDARI | DELAWARE NEWS JOURNAL | 4:19 pm EST February 7, 2020

At a hearing Thursday during which the University of Delaware requested nearly $128 million in taxpayer funds, school president Dennis Assanis was quizzed about why less than 40% of the school's students come from the First State.

His response: “I am not the one holding back the kids in Delaware to come into the university. ... We need better-qualified students who come out of our K-12. Because we don’t want to put them into a first-class environment and then lead them to having mental health problems.” 

This year, the governor has recommended increasing UD's state funding by $4.6 million, which would bring its total for fiscal year 2021 to $127.9 million. The Legislature's Joint Finance Committee heard testimony from UD, Delaware State University and Delaware Technical Community College on Thursday to help determine the state's final budget. 
Throughout the hearing, legislators probed Assanis about the university's enrollment of Delawareans and underrepresented students, groups the school has long struggled to recruit. 


A slowdown in population growth and a lack of qualified students coming out of Delaware high schools are to blame, Assanis said. 

In 2014, 40% of University of Delaware undergraduate students were Delawareans. Five years later in 2019, that number still hovered around 39% ⁠— or 7,480 of the university’s 19,000 undergraduate students. 

“What are you going to do to make that bigger?” Rep. Earl Jaques, D-Glasgow, asked.
“If we had just a few more babies in Delaware, and make sure they go through K-12 and graduate successfully,” Assanis replied. “Every baby, every Delawarean who’s qualified, we’ll take. It starts out by having stronger schools K to 12 and having qualified students when they graduate.” 

Students admitted to UD need to have strong English, writing and math skills to succeed, he said. 

Last fall, 3,652 Delawareans applied to UD's Newark campus. While 68.1% were admitted, 1,394 or 38% accepted a place at UD. Out of the university's 22,849 out-of-state applicants, 2,736 accepted an offer. 

“We may admit them, but they may think there’s a better fit elsewhere. Or maybe they want to leave Delaware,” Rodney Morrison, vice president for enrollment management at UD, said in an interview Friday. “For a lot of students, it’s about personal fit.” 

High schools nationally continue to see increased graduation rates, a trend reflected in Delaware as well. But at the same time, because of increased access to credit recovery programs, college readiness numbers are not improving at the same rate, said Gary Henry, dean of the College of Education and Human Development. 

In 2019, just over 10,000 Delaware seniors took the SAT. According to CollegeBoard, the company that facilitates the test, 31% of those students met college-readiness benchmarks, meaning about 3,400 Delaware seniors would likely pass a semester of college courses.  

“I think we’d be doing a disservice to students in high school by putting them in an environment where they cannot succeed,” Assanis said.

Both in-state and out-of-state tuition continue to climb at UD. In 2013, in-state residents paid $12,112 per year. In 2019, that had risen to $14,280. In the same amount of time, out-of-state students' sticker price has climbed from just under $30,000 to $35,710.

While these are training programs and not jobs per se, you are setting yourself up for success within those respective fields. More and more employers are requiring their staff to have these certifications anyway, plus you have the potential to earn more money.

Also, most of the students enrolled are able to get funding to pay for the classes. This way you have a certification (ServSafe or OSHA-10 respectively) without taking on the (potential) burden of college debt.

Both of these programs end with a 2 week internship at a local business. Your salary is paid through the program rather than by the employer. The vast majority of the time the student will end up with a job at the end of the 2 week period.

He was the ""old schoolmaster"" professor that all the freshman feared, but by the time you were a senior, you might be with him sharing a beer on the porch of the Deer Park.

Surprisingly, the stern professor was a surrealist, and his work was filled with touches of whimsy and humor, sometimes almost hidden, and sometimes an elizabethan style portrait of a woman with the head of a seagull. One of his pieces commissioned by NASA was of suited astronaut towering over the launch of a shuttle, with the astronaut's gloves curling around the smoke of the launch as if supporting it. I saw it still on his easel as he was finishing it up, and it was simply stunning. Looking closely, s few little ladders with feathers for rungs (one of his favorite motifs) had snuck into the background. I asked about them and he just winked. I can't find any images of it online, and there's a Florida landscape painter who shares the ""Charles Rowe"" name that makes searching for his work difficult.

Charles hardly ever gave A's, and a B in his course was a golden ticket into just about any other art course in the department. I once threw absolutely everything I had at getting an A out of him in a winter session airbrush course, staying up for days and biting off an insanely complex final project. That session was the first where UD moved to a minus and plus system, and I got an A-. Looking back, he knew I could have done even better. He drove me to do work I didn't know I was capable of, which is exactly what a professor should do.

5270,5270,WikiTextBot,"**Palliative care**

Palliative care (derived from the Latin root palliare, or “to cloak”) refers to an interdisciplinary medical caregiving approach aimed at optimizing quality of life and mitigating suffering among people with serious, complex illness. Within the published literature, many definitions of palliative care exist; most notably, the World Health Organization describes palliative care as ""an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual.”Palliative care is appropriate for individuals with serious illnesses across the age spectrum and can be provided as the main goal of care or in tandem with curative treatment. It is provided by an interdisciplinary team which can include physicians, nurses, occupational and physical therapists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, social workers, chaplains, and dietitians. Palliative care can be provided in a variety of contexts including hospitals, outpatient, skilled-nursing, and home settings.

The reality here being that all poor people are unfit to be parents and all of them should have their children taken away? That's what Polaski said and I assume you believe that to be true based on your comment. Whether or not Polaski is racist is a debate to be had. Suggesting all poor people should have their children forcefully taken from them because their unfit do to poverty....isn't. So either you didn't know what Polaski actually said and you're just taking the opportunity to sling insults towards at ""SJW's"" or you think all poor people should have their children stolen from them.

5287,5287,ONE_GUY_ONE_JAR,"His comments can be read and listening to [here](https://www.wdel.com/news/best-thing-we-can-do-take-em-away-from-mom/article_2076b96c-4c38-11ea-886f-4bd9d219c312.html), anyone that takes the time to comment should take the 5min to listen to them in their entirety. 

He clearly is passionate about doing something about the terrible state of city schools. Refusing to recognize that many of the children are coming from absurdly broken environments is naive and no progress can be made until that is recognized. Race has nothing to do with it. Sadly, it's a fact that the vast majority of low-income city residents are African American. But his comments are directed to African Americans per se. 

I've been involved with city schools for a while, and candidly anyone who has been involved will tell you the same thing Polaski is saying. It's hard to not come to that conclusion after learning a filthy, malnurished, neglected five year old's mother is turning tricks and doing drugs in their home. The child has no chance. No amount of schooling for a couple hours a day can outweigh the impact of that kids life outside of school. 

I don't think Polaski seriously is advocating to take kids out their homes, because that's fraught with other problems and he admit's he's ""half joking"". It seems like he's expressing exasperation of trying to improve a school system when the root cause is a hellish home life. 

A good solution I've heard from many advocates and teachers is more robust early childhood and before/after school services. That has the effect of getting child out of their home more, which is a good thing. Public early childhood education also would enable parents who otherwise would struggle to work while taking care of a child to be able to do it more easily. Additionally, many education researchers believe that once a child enters school at 5, they can already be so far behind that they will never catch up. Like the children Polaski is talking about the enter school with no vocabulary, not being able to identify colors and shapes, and never even seeing a book. Early childhood education would enable those people to have a better start.

Even if you disagree with Polaski's comments and think they're racist, it's clear he's passionate about improving Wilmington education. It's obvious he doesn't have any racist or hateful intentions; at worst he is misguided. I seems counterproductive to focus on condemning someone like that. Make it a teaching opportunity and keep working towards improving the schools. In fighting about dumb stuff like this isn't going to solve any problems.",1581950221,fhxbeua

That's what happened with Kaepernick's cause as well.  Thanks to cancel culture and the media, it became *incredibly* easy to refocus the argument very far away from the issue he was actually trying to bring attention to, instead to whether he was doing it the right way.",1581950855,fhxc93b

So he nominates his own brother to take the unoccupied seat and then the council conducts a closed meeting of a selection committee that decides to unanimously back the nomination. When it was later put to a vote, the city council opted to vote against the nomination.

Zanthia Oliver, one of the council members on the selection committee, was clearly upset with the results of the vote and said ""I think it's a hate crime"" - because the council voted against a black man who she thought met the standards of that position.",1581953821,fhxghuc

5299,5299,millenialfalcon,"Thank you for sharing the link to his actual comment. What he said may not be racist, but they are at least racist-adjacent. He didn't drop a hard-R, but he was borderline ""you people"". Remember a few months ago, when Joe Biden was talking about poor students but slipped and said black students? and everyone was like eeeeuw that's at least a little racist..? Joe was envisioning the exact students and families that Polaski is talking about. 

When a large majority of a group you're making blanket statements about are persons of color, you don't get to claim you weren't making racial statements. If he didn't know that readily available statistical information he was negligent at his job; if he did know and decided to make the statements anyway then he severely lacks empathy and understanding. 

 He talks around a lot of racial issues without naming them, and as such does not use the tact that might have helped his ""passion"" seem more  relatable or rather been a better presentation of his intent (especially considering the potentially delicate nature of the topics at hand).
Talking about how we used to have community schools is a nice way of NOT talking about busing. Talking about the late arrival mom with a toddler and a baby on her hip sounds an awful lot like the old welfare mom troupe (which is as racist as it is inaccurate). Talking about impoverished areas: which predominently white neighborhood pops into your mind when he talks about impoverished areas? Talking about poverty without talking race in Delaware is disingenuous at best.

Saying that your half serious when you joke that we should take children away from their parents at 10 months and return them at 18 years, is just unfunny and unnecessary. What if you flip the statement? Say ""white people clearly can't be trusted to raise non-racists so you'll get them back when they're 18"". 
 It actually hurts the point he's trying to make which I assume is that what's happening outside school is more impactful to student success than anything a school can do. That is well known and well documented. It's also one of the constraints and issues Polaski was elected to work with and around.

Will there be parents that are consistently the cause of their children's tardiness? Yes, of course; some parents are bad at it. Parenting is hard, living in working poverty is hard. Some of the people who work night shifts have children (including the alleged self-identified prostitute Polaski references). Some people don't have cars and missing a bus because your kid took an extra long poop this morning means you're late to work and they're late to school. Some people work 2 jobs and get home after bedtime if they don't take their kids to school a little late they don't get to spend time with them for 3 days. There are innumerable reasons, excuses, and jusitifcations. The job Polaski was elected to do requires working with some bad parents and sometimes inattentive, sometimes ineffective, and sometimes downright uninvolved parents no matter the reason(s) for their inadequacy.  I'll take those constraints into consideration when voting but they have been known and I'd like to know how Polaski or anyone else intends to do the job despite them. If he can't then maybe he should resign, if he can, then show us.",1581957249,fhxltl4

But provide that home environment somehow, because they’re not getting it where they live.”

Wanting a child to grow up outside of poverty, in an environment that lends itself to learning and education, was his sentiment. Of course The State can't provide that environment, and has no right at all to remove children from their parents except under certain abusive or neglectful circumstances, and any rational person wouldn't endorse such a scheme. 

But he wasn't stating a policy plan, to me he seemed exasperated that these children have to return to such an unhealthy, un-nurturing environment that actively decays what progress they make in school. Part of the problem *is* the home environment. But as an educator, he has no power to affect one of the biggest hurdles to a child's education.",1581959198,fhxoz4k

For Kaepernick, his initial way of saying his message *was* a problem in that it sent another message of purposefully disrespecting the flag as perceived by numerous veterans (sitting and not participating in the anthem at all) so when a veteran asked to meet with him and devise a better way to get his message across (kneeling in respect) he went with it. Kaepernick also only went to these extremes after years of people not listening to others including himself speak up in less obtrusive ways. The people who complain about that would complain about anything they disagree with regardless of how it was said-- case in point they clearly don't care about flag code as kneeling is something people do in respect for the flag in certain circumstances, and holding the flag horizontally across the field is against code. 

With the Senator, according to this he's been cited multiple times for saying dogwhistles and explained how those things are harmful. He's refused to reflect on how his words affect people, or look into new ways to help students and support improverished communities as proposed by people from those communities. That's a red flag, and the people calling it out are even recognizing that while his intention may have not been racism, being unwilling to have the discussion and doubling down despite the people harmed speaking up is supporting racism.",1581972439,fhybbj0

Acknowledging that a large percentage of Delaware’s poverty falls upon minorities disproportionately, I think it’s a fair and accurate point that those living in low income and particularly extremely impoverished households are at a much higher chance of struggling academically. Taking kids from their families may be extreme but I think this still all falls back to the cycle (or trap) of poverty and trying to figure out what steps to take to give kids (regardless of race) the best chance at success.

Every low income house in Wilmington is not dilapidated or lacking a positive role model, there are plenty of poor families who do provide a good environment for their children. However there’s a fair question to be had about those who do not. 

Without giving too much personal info away, I worked a job where I was in peoples homes a lot and I’ve seen homes (all races, ethnicities, etc) where cockroaches were crawling up the wall, and electricity was off in part of the home, kids in the house had truancy warrants (while they were napping on the couch at 11am on a school day)...  you tell me how much of a chance that kids or kids have at successfully getting through school and out of poverty.",1581988748,fhz1k2v

Have a source for that claim? Simple sweeping statements don't actually mean anything. How much will free healthcare cost? Where will that money come from? What will tax rates be? Who will pay those increased taxes? What do we do with the 2 million people who would be out of work? How much are you cutting the defense budget?

Trump sold himself as someone who could come in from the outside and shake things up in a way that would benefit the common man. I also think his aggressive stance on immigration really spoke to many in the south who felt betrayed by the Bush administrations more compassionate or more open approach to immigration.

Look who is doing the best in the democratic primary right now, its a man who the Democratic establishment hates, they've been open about this and they actively tried to screw him when he was running against Hillary. Obama came out and said he may actively try to stop Bernie if he thinks he will win. Bernie may have been in DC a long time but he has always walked to the beat of his own drum, often voting against bills that nearly everyone else in congress was voting for, like the Iraq war. Because of this and his consistency people feel they can trust Bernie that goes a long way, the other half is his populist approach and policies which are aimed at average people, not rich people.

Numerous professionals (and not-so-professionals) have speculated and mulled, publicly and privately, over what has caused u/Sluggerbaloney to establish a world in which disparagement and hate dominate our discourse. Let us note first of all that he hates people who lend support to the thesis that it is a universally acknowledged truth that the things he wants to do are unfair, if not illegal. He wants such people nabbed, grabbed, and thrown out of the country.

Unfortunately, there is no shortage of individuals and organizations, many of whom may seem innocent at first glance, who secretly want to shove us towards an absolute state of vassalage.

What's Jessica Scarane's way of paying for it?

The devil is in the details but again you mis-characterized my words as me saying it was ""far left.""  For someone who criticizes Trump so much you sure do like to spread a shit ton of fake news.

&gt; Thank you for your lesson on politics - it looks like you went to the Barack Obama school of politics where you talk one thing then deliver something else entirely. Then you wonder why you lost the Senate, the House, thousands of state reps, and hand pick a corrupt plutocrat like Hillary Clinton to be your successor and wonder why she lost. Tens of thousands of Michigan voters went to the polls and didn't pick a presidential candidate.

Obama did what he could in the face of historic obstructionism.  Maybe you don't understand how the 3 branches work, but Obama did not have the ability to push through more progressive legislation.  He favored pragmatism and actually getting things done over more progressive reforms that would die on the Senate floor.  It's only morons like you that think Obama could have passed true universal healthcare, mandatory paid time off and free college.

Keep dreaming big though because America is the right country for that.  Unless people like you keep reproducing as it appears you like to actively try to kill the American dream.

This is my last reply here though.  You're an obstinate idiot who never concedes the point even in the face of overwhelming evidence.

I understand what youre saying to be true(if memory serves, recipients typically get benefits for like 2-3 years and then get off of them).

Just because it has the word welfare in it doesnt mean we need to get our pitchforks out while in the same breath agree with it. 

If someone uses government benefits for a year when they lost their job and needed help, they're not using it as a career choice and would have no reason to be offended.

If someone had a bumper stick that said ""Nazis suck"" would you assume its targeting every German person or would you assume it means Nazis?  Im guessing you would take it literally.  Why is this any different?  Is anyone here saying that welfare actually is in fact a lifelong/career choice?

Because it's very obviously a dig at people receiving welfare. IF the person driving/owning the vehicle understood my statement, then there would be no reason to put that sticker on the vehicle. 

The sticker indicates this is a person who sees people getting benefits and feels the need to point out to them that they need not be soaking up said benefits for years to come. A statement they would not feel the need to make if they were educated on the subject. Even if the statement is solely directed at one small percentage, it's practically friendly fire. 

But going further and knowing people and growing up around people who put shit like this on their bumpers, and just using plain common sense, we all damn well know someone who would put some dumb shit like that on their bumper is the sort who's not bright enough to draw the disctinctions I'm making. They're the sort that makes a face when they're in the supermarket and someone pays with an EBT card, jumping to conclusions without knowing the facts.

I've got a neighbor like that who believes their shit don't stink while completely ignoring the fact that their sons are on drugs. I've got relatives whose family has been arrested for drug dealing, possession, prostitution, but are still out dropping N bombs at family functions like they're somehow better because of the color of their skin. Oh but your kid was arrested for dealing, yeah, you're so much better. These are but a few examples- I really have a lot of experience dealing with clowns who think they're better than everyone simply because they had a better childhood, more stability, better luck with jobs, and so on. 

You could say 'hey, you're making an assumption by assuming that's what he's like!' This is an easy deduction. You have something like that on your bumper, you think you're better than them.

&gt; If someone had a bumper stick that said ""Nazis suck"" would you assume its targeting every German person or would you assume it means Nazis? 

That's actually a pretty terrible analogy, not even just because you're mentioning welfare recipients and actual Nazis in the same argument.

He just mutters bullshit when he doesn't have an answer. He argues with people to argue, not to comprehend. 

&gt; Let me be clear on one major point - The US is the only industrialized country without universal health care or mandatory paid time off.

The US is the only one without universal healthcare. The current rate of uninsuranced is below 8%, compared to when Obama took his first term at 15% and his second term at 11%. 

Most nations that have universal healthcare doesn't mean it's free. It means the government offers or demands it in one way or another. More than half the nations that have free government sponsored healthcare pay up to 10% of their GDP to maintain it. A few are as high as 15%, but we'll consider them way outside the norm. The US cannot afford to do that with the military funding that exists in this country. Of the 15 major countries that offer free healthcare to all citizens, 6 of them are underfunded and 9 of them are understaffed by their own self-reporting. In three of those 15 countries more people pay for their own private healthcare and insurance rather than use the free program from the government.

Theres so much conflict in the world, specifically politics, that maybe this is an example that its not needed.  We all agree that abusing welfare is bad and that making assumptions is bad but then we race to make assumptions based on our beliefs.

They're coming up with a near 20% cost savings out of thin air. They believe the government will be able to reduce the wages of medical staff by nearly 3% across the board. I'm sure that will go over will with Nurses and hospital staff. They're coming up with a 9% reduction is administrative costs? Since when has anything the government has done reduced administrative costs?  A 6% decrease in the cost of pharmaceuticals, which is certainly possible. Improved service delivery and reduced waste? uhh, what? I definitely wouldn't consider any services I've had to use with the US Government as being an improved service.

They also are eliminating private insurance in the US by getting rid of subsidies that help employers provide costs reduction of such insurance. 

And of course, the part right from the report that many people will have an issue with:

&gt; Given our estimate that the costs of providing universal coverage under Medicare for
All would be $2.93 trillion in 2017, we can then conclude that, for the U.S. economy as of
2017, we would need to raise an additional $1.05 trillion in new taxes to fully fund Medicare
for All. 

Those taxes don't come out of thin air, they're coming from the same people that have an issue with Delaware paying Amazon to bring business here. That number is a lot bigger than $4.5 million. Their main suggestion for these taxes is hitting capital gains (aka, most US retirements) and a 3.75% sales federal sales tax, or VAT tax for the middle-class and up.

A 3.75% tax increase would be higher than my overall medical spending in a year. I'll pay less in overall healthcare, but I'll pay significantly more in taxes. Chances are that as a middle-class household it'll cost me more per year in universal healthcare under this proposed plan. I can't imagine how it would hit a healthcare worker.

General context, and understanding of why a statement would be made in the first place is important.

Your example, ""Nazis suck!"" wouldn't be offensive to most people as they aren't Nazis. A person who is a Nazi, would probably be offended by it.

So why would someone say Nazis suck in the first place? I'd think it was because they don't agree with their ideals. Would the same person who says Nazis suck, also say ""but most of them are actually really nice people! Of course when I said Nazis suck, I only meant the really bad ones, why would you assume I meant all of them?""

Are you 20 years old or something? Do you know anything about the history of Dupont in this state?

Here's a tip...Dupont's motto was ""better living through chemisty.""  Dupont was the biggest employer in Delaware for nearly a century. Dupont employed a shitload of chemists all the way through the 1990s.

Long story short, Delaware has always been a ""company state.""  FFS, Ralph Nader wrote a book on [the subject](https://www.amazon.com/company-state-Naders-report-Delaware/dp/0670233579) in 1973!

The UD Chemistry program(s) is/are irrelevant to this conversation. This conversation was about granting taxpayer funded subsidies to mega corporations like Amazon.  I used AZ as an example of how that doesn't work out in the favor of the taxpayers. You then chimed in with complete conjecture and brought up UD's Chemistry program(s), positing ""Maybe the truth of A.Z. is that UD started producing more engineers per capita to keep manufacturing in the state (DuPont) than it did chemists for R&amp;D (AZ),"" when that is not at all what happened. You could have just [googled it](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2016/05/02/astrazeneca-cut-1-billion-impact-delaware-unknown/83830534/) and learned the real reasons behind their actions, but you were so full of yourself with your degree and your minor that you earned four whole years ago that you felt it necessary to regale us with your uninformed opinions.  If you'd read the article, you'd know that AZ eliminated its research department in 2011, which, at least as far as AZ goes, means they don't need any research chemists. Which renders the UD Chemistry Program(s) irrelevant.

You may be an expert in Chemistry and you should be proud of your degree(s).  Your next challenges are learning how to follow a simple conversation, and how not to make an ass of yourself by putting forth an opinion that is easily shot down by a simple google search.

I use a telescope for my images. Not a very powerful one either. Only 600mm focal length. You wouldn't be able to see this object if you looked through the scope though. This image is the result of about four hours of long exposure photography over the course of two nights. Its using a mount that perfectly tracks the motion of the sky or else it would be a mess of trailing stars.

A lot of the images I take are of objects that are too dim to be seen with our eyes even through a telescope. Only a camera sensor exposed for a long time can see them.

However, I have a big powerful scope that I use for visual astronomy and there's a ton of stuff you can see from Southern Delaware. Even from Milford fairly close to town.

6105,6105,delawareness,"I feel like you got some abbreviated answers here. Delaware's division in labor and culture has geologic and historic origins. In general, northern Delawareans is less rural so our lifestyles are different, and while some say they see a division along the Canal, I see it as  south of I-95.

Delaware has two geologic regions which historically impact residents' activities and lifestyles. Kent and Sussex are in the Atlantic Coastal Plain region, while a tip of northern Delaware (beginning around Kirkwood Hwy) is located in the Appalachian Piedmont. There's an area that divides these called the Fall Zone, and there, Piedmont rocks disappear under the Coastal Plain sediments. You can supposedly see Coastal Plain fragments over the gneiss rocks under the bridge at Windy Mills in Newark, I haven't gone down there to look though.

Early European settlements began along the Fall Zone because the availability of fresh water attracted settlers, who then built flour and gunpowder mills. New industries like the chemical industry post-1945 drew even more people to Northern Delaware. Today,  2/3 of our population resides in NCC. In this northern Piedmont region, we actually have some small hills, exposed rocks (you can see these walking along the trails of White Clay Creek SP), and higher slopes, which allow for fewer floodplains. ""City slickers.""

In the Coastal Plain we have more flat wetlands and lots of farms, partly owing to the  Greenwich loam soil found on coastal plain uplands, which makes for prime farmland. Also, broilers. Poultry is Delaware's biggest agricultural product, it got a boost with the construction of Dupont Hwy, which gave farmers easy access to Philadelphia. We've got soybeans, corn, dairy, and seafood going on in Slower Lower, too. ""Hicks.""",1582478774,fikedgg

I really think that malls need to evolve somehow if they want to survive. Mall atmosphere is really nice. It brings back memories for all age groups. 

I think malls should move a bit away from being almost entirely retail clothing. Wow the 45th worn denim and trendy tops shop. Can't wait to ignore that one also. It gets so stale to basically have 4 variants of stores that all seem just like a slightly different shades of the next one. 

I really think malls should start focusing on paid experiences. have store fronts with escape rooms, virtual reality co-op experiences, etc etc. 

Those all make $ and promote recurring customers. 

I was at a mall in orlando last year and it was like a whole different idea of what a mall was supposed to be. 

I went in one store that was a shop for board games. In the back of the store they had warhammer tournaments, and magic tournaments going on. Along with private rooms where a local DM hosts DnD sessions for anyone wanting to join. 

Somewhere else in the mall there was a chocolate/candy store, but on the other side of the shop they had chocolate classes. They had someone basically host and teach you things like tempering and molding and you left with your personal creation. 

They had a store where you and a bunch of friends go into a VR room and you could all co-op these cool missions. The one i saw was kinda like a Halo alien vibe. You and your friends go in strap on these gloves and helmets and you're free to walk around in the room. 

A separate mall i was at had this cool store where you paid like 10$ to enter and they had all kinds of group game tournaments. 

GamerDoc back in the day used to host all kinds of Video Game tournaments. Like smash and mario kart. 

I'm not saying clothing stores and jewelry stores don't have their place in a mall. But how about instead of having 6 overpriced jewelry stores how about a few less and replace those store fronts with things that provide experience. Things that make you want to hang out there a little longer.

I've been to Main Event twice now and I gotta say, that shit was garbage. 

The first time i went I remember friends telling me they had a zipline and laser tag, and all the arcade games. 

I get there that I had imagined being more grandiose was just some little 20ft cable for kids lol. 

Good luck getting into laser tag. And when you do it seems as if the idea was thrown in last minute. 

I'm about to get into the rant where i complain about kids. 

I get it, gets also want to have fun here. I'm not against that. But so do adults. Dave and Busters busters rides this fine line perfectly, Main Event just completely fails at it. 

The arcade is garbage. They advertise that they have a ton of games, but most of them seem like they scooped them up off of some discontinued lot. 

Both times I've been there the FEW decent ones they had were mobbed and at more than 1 point I had parents sitting at the machine doing nothing because they were trying to occupy the game until their kid got done with their current one. Staff did not care at all. So basically if you want to be a rude piece of shit just sit at a game and block it's access to save spots for others, nobody will do shit about it. 

So my group just basically ended up hanging out on the singular shuffle board table in the bar area. Drinking overpriced drinks, and overpriced food that barely tasted edible. 

Oh and the bar shuffle board area is kid friendly until like 9. So you really get no repreave from other people kids just fucking around. 

Compare this with DnB. 

They have WAY more games of way higher quality. They find a way so that adults and kids can coexist in the same area without being a burden on the other while also having an area just for adults. And the food isn't half bad for an arcade bar.",1582487248,fiktyui

The Annual Appeal raises funds to provide financial assistance for members of our local community who would otherwise not be able to afford membership, access to the Y’s programs (for example Livestrong, diabetes prevention and after school programs) and kids’ summer camp. 

You don’t have to be a member to participate. If indoor cycling isn’t your thing, we are also holding a Zumba-a-Thon at the same time. Sign up [here](https://donate.ymcade.org/event/2020-brandywine-cycle-a-thon/e269397) for one, two or three hours, or to donate without participating. 

Thank you!",1582573052,finz0xq

6263,6263,SirCaptainMirMir,I work for a store in the Newark shopping center. Even though it is huge it’s always packed. The guests that frequent the stores in the center always complain how hard it’s to find parking. There for the center will tow the cars of people who walk off the premises. The shopping center wants to make it easier for guest to shop in the center.,1582573534,finzv05
6264,6264,JimmyfromDelaware,"Solid Bernie supporter - he has my vote and I think he is by far the best candidate.  I was a life long republican and became progressive when I got fed up with working class people being screwed over by both parties and republicans deficit spending was just as bad as the democrats and in the case of Trump even worse.  I started working in the 1970's and will probably be the last generation with a pension.  I have seen health insurance go from being fully provided to more and more expensive year and year with pensions being dropped in favor of 401ks then those 401ks being cut back more and more.  More and more employers are not offering either now.

Now capital has gone after minimum wage and workers comp in the gig economy.  The reason I say all this is because I never would have supported a democrat or someone like Bernie Sanders until politicians were legally bribed by capital to advance laws that screw the working class and companies colluded to keep wages low.

But he is going to have to beat the democratic establishment and then the republican establishment.  Warren was pretty good but she flaked the hell out when under pressure and is a serial liar.  Biden is worse than Trump.  Pete is a socially liberal republican.  Bloomberg and Steyer are a joke.  Tulsi I liked but got some major issues with some of her policies but she gets major hate because she stands up to the military industrial complex. Harris and Booker have planned to run for president for years and offered nothing.

Justice Democrats have gotten 4 or 5 people in Congress elected in their first Congressional election; if that is not getting off your ass, I don't know what is.  They were the group that got AOC elected, the rights favorite boogeyman.  Now she refuses to pay DNC dues and instead started her own PAC to get more progressives elected.  She is not beholden to the donor class and it shows.",1582573714,fio065t

6269,6269,xamj,"So not to get in the way of the anti Amazon circle jerk, but ...

DE gives Amazon a tax break of 4.5 million. In return Amazon brings 1000 jobs to the state. Let's assume that all those 1000 jobs are $15 an hour warehouse jobs. In reality many will be more than that, but let's keep it simple

So 1000 people working 40 hours a week at $15 an hour. In reality many Amazon warehouse workers work overtime and make more, but we'll leave that out to keep the math simple. 40 hours a week at $15 an hour is $31,200 a year. The DE tax tables tell us at that income level, the state income tax rate is 5.5%. 

1000 jobs * $31,200 per job * 5.5% tax rate = $1,716,00 per year in DE income tax. So DE will recoup that $4.5 million investment in 2.6 years on income taxes alone, and then be collecting almost $2 million a year in income taxes every year thereafter. AND $250 million invested up front to build facilities. AND 1000 Delaware citizens can go from making less than $15 an hour to making at least $15 an hour. 

Seems like a pretty good investment to me. Don't how anyone could actually be against this, leaving aside juvenile reasons like jealously and hatred of people who have more money than you.",1582575520,fio3eer

This allows me to not guess my time, I just do a small amount of time and if I happen to stay over it sends me a notification that I have 10 minutes left and do I want to add more, I can do it as low as 12 minutes on the road. So the 25 cents acts as insurance if I fail at guesstimating. This use to burn me all the time at the old parking meters on Main.

That’s better than the alternative which at present is nothing or helping small businesses with those funds but not bringing the total number of jobs up since small businesses can’t hire at that rate nor really scale for that matter. If we could use that 4.5MM in the way you propose building infrastructure and jobs like  Eisenhower with the turnpikes, that’d be amazing. I just don’t see that happening at present.

Del tech offers courses for very affordable prices(I’ve paid bills there) books are also affordable through, dare I say it, amazon.

Thank you for suggesting Fort Dupont! We welcome visitors to explore Fort DuPont during operating hours. The park area is closed from dusk (8 p.m. in spring/summer)to dawn. While you're in the area, check out charming Delaware City too.

Fort Dupont is now under the ownership of the Fort Dupont Redevelopment &amp; Preservation Corporation. Many locations on the site are off limits  including buildings, the mortar bunker and interiors of batteries. For your safety, we ask visitors to stay on trails, be respectful of the site's historic value and natural setting, and to avoid areas marked as ""No Trespassing"".  Metal detecting and off-road vehicles are prohibited. (Only authorized motor vehicles are permitted on trails)

Fishing, hiking, biking are permitted on the site (except as noted above), and the Fort affords easy access to the Castle Trail. Fishing requires a license, available at the Ft. Delaware/Ft. Dupont DNREC office located on N. Reedy Point Road, just south of the Fort's main entrance. There is a public boat ramp with ample parking at the Fort which provides direct access to the Branch Canal, which leads to the C&amp;D Canal or Delaware River. 

We encourage you to visit this once-abandoned military base being restored and transformed into an exciting mixed-use community for residents and visitors alike.

In Delaware, we have closed primaries, which means that if you want to vote in a Democratic or Republican primary, you have to be registered as a member of that party.

It's in the primary where voters decide which of the candidates get to represent their party in the general election.

Take the example of a County Council election. You are registered Republican, and there are two Democrats and zero Republicans candidates running.  You may have an opinion on which of the two Democratic candidates will better represent you, but you can't voice that opinion (by voting) unless you are registered Democrat because you are locked out of the Democratic primary. 

By the time the general election comes around, your favored candidate has already lost the primary election, in which only a small portion of the population actually represented by the candidate were able to participate.",1582816693,fixay7q

Crime has gone up since legalization, mainly burglary and assault/battery. They are trying to get inmates out of prison on drug charges because of this and how little room they already had.

With that said, the counter argument would be: well crime always happens in a big city and there’s no way to pin that on legalization. 
If you look into how many shops have been shot up, burglarized, or just plain destroyed in comparison to past years it skyrocketed.

This is false and is usually spread by the police.  While there has been incidences of crime, it is usually from criminals in states that still prohibit it.  Also they are forced to deal in cash because of banking prohibitions; making them a big target for thieves.

From the article:
&gt;there is no evidence that statewide legalization is making life more threatening for anyone.

We do know the affects.  And yes, burning plant material and ingesting its smoke in your lungs is not a healthy thing to do.  And it is not good for kids to be smoking it.  But an interesting thing I found online was drug rehab sites that cherry pick studies to present the worst possible case.  it's almost as if they have motivation to over hype the dangers.

A big positive of pot legalization is opiod use significantly drops.

Smoking pot does have negative affects on your health.  This is nothing compared to the negative affects that prohibition has had on the population, particularly African Americans.

Where is all the demand going to come from?  Plus meth is primarily a rural drug and when drug dealers get busted they rarely have both.  The exact opposite is true, hard drug use goes down significantly in states that it is legalized.

Plus another benefit is teen use plummets.  Mostly because dealers on the street corner will gladly sell to kids.  When it's available in a store and a felony to give or sell to a minor it removes a lot of motivation to sell to kids.

There will always be a black market, but I don't know about you but I haven't drank moonshine since the early eighties when I lived on the parents farm.  Have you ever?

So it's true that COVID-19's fatality rate is only about 2% but it's already killed more than MERS and SARS both other Coronaviruses and this epidemic has been going on for a fraction of the time. So how can a less fatal virus that's been around for a s far shorter period be so deadly?

It's hard to know if you have COVID-19, it can lay in wait in you for up to 2 weeks before you begin to show symptoms. This is why the start of the outbreak in China went off the deep end so quickly. Infected people were spreading it for 2 weeks before anyone knew what was going on and each person they spread it to had 2 weeks before they knew. It's exponential and we've seen the results of that with so many infected and many dead, but thankfully more recovered than dead.

7162,7162,pickleback11,"lively day scene?  yes for the most part.  

so friday, i'd say HH isn't that impressive.  there's this thing called ""taco toss"" which is basically free taco's at lighthouse (was north beach for awhile while lighthouse was being renovated, but i believe it is supposed to be back at LH).  i'd say it's ""ehhh"" at best.  something to do, but not over the top.  friday night, things will be lively, so i personally dont worry about getting down and going out before 8pm (worth it to me to skip HH to preserve energy).  i usually base my decision on where to go on what bands are playing where (as good bands pull better crowds than others).  

saturday, you can basically start drinking at starboard any time past 9am (go for bfast/brunch and just plan on staying there).  it's not vegas pool-party crazy, but there will be a good crowd with good energy that just builds over time.  when 5pm hits, head over to bottle and cork for jam session.  that is guaranteed to be packed and a big drunk mess.  by 830pm people are falling all over the place (which is when i think it's most fun).  jam starting at 5pm sounds late (not exactly early daytime), but it's a blurry marathon when you start at starboard at 11/12.  saturday night, once again, kind of depends on who is playing where and what is going on where. 

sunday funday is pretty decent in dewey (will be less crowded than sat afternoon tho).  it's been a while since i've done it, but there will be people out and about all day.  once again, prob makes sense to start at starboard first and go from there (meet people, see where they are going/etc).

as for saturday afternoon, starboard -&gt; jam session is just my go to.  you can stop in other bars/etc and there will be people around.  i just think that's the most ""excitable"" path with the rowdiest people.

also keep in mind, the weekend you go down highly factors into things.  holidays (MDW/july 4/LDW) each have their own feel to them (ie: people love dressing up for july 4th), though hotels are more expensive.  running of the bulls (in july) is always crowded.  there are numerous bar crawls/etc (stache crawl/etc) that can change it up.  

once again, it's been awhile.  but OCMD/Seacrets has always felt a little trashy to me.  My friends and I are not ""tough guys"" but for some reason there almost always seems to be a fight in OCMD.  the crowd at seacrets can be pretty rowdy in a drunk fun way, but i dont know if it's my type of people.  also my only experience of getting a table in the bay was pretty unimpressive.  just a bunch of people sitting around peeing where they are sitting waiting for their waitress to bring them buckets of beer.  i had more fun when we went down there with a bus of people and started our own dance party on the sand (not in the water).

Since the private school kids did well, we were placed in honors classes sophomore year, and later AP classes. With the exception of maybe three students, the entire honors and AP programs consisted of kids who went to private school for K-8 (or Newark Charter, they didn’t have a high school back then).

7327,7327,estebandelasexface12,"I'm lazy so I won't do this research but I would be interested in seeing a comparison of state universities in terms of quality vs. state population vs. cost. I have a feeling that UD punches above its weight b/c it is very small state, w/a very good state U that is a  relatively medium cost option in its region.

To be more example-driven, would you rather pay $40k/year to go to Rutgers and live in shitty-ass, expensive New Brunswick or pay the same and go to UD and live like a king in Newark?

Nonetheless, college is way too expensive and part of the reason is b/c all states give less money than they did in previous decades. UD's status as a ""publicly chartered yet getting public money"" has nothing to do with that. It is annoying that they get the public money but have less transparency than other institutions that get public money, but c'est la vie - if we want to change it, we can via lots of legislation and hard work.

On the other hand, political capital could be better spent on something more important than hating on UD and we can all agree that UD is critical to our state as a talent magnet. IMHO, UD is too big and good for a state of our size -- and that's fantastic for Delawareans.  It's like we have a light heavyweight/middleweight university for a bantamweight place.

How that happened is a good Delaware history lesson b/c all one needs to do is walk around campus to realize that the DuPont family created UD and its money still has a big impact on the university's prominence. (How they got all the money and if such a thing is ethical is a different discussion.) Very interesting stuff with a fair amount of nuance.

&gt;Who May Apply For A Patent
According to the law, the inventor, or a person to whom the inventor has assigned or is under an obligation to assign the invention, may apply for a patent, with certain exceptions. If the inventor is deceased, the application may be made by legal representatives, that is, the administrator or executor of the estate. If the inventor is legally incapacitated, the application for patent may be made by a legal representative (e.g., guardian). If an inventor refuses to apply for a patent or cannot be found, a joint inventor may apply on behalf of the non-signing inventor.
If two or more persons make an invention jointly, they apply for a patent as joint inventors. A person who makes only a financial contribution is not a joint inventor and cannot be joined in the application as an inventor. It is possible to correct an innocent mistake in erroneously omitting an inventor or in erroneously naming a person as an inventor.
Officers and employees of the United States Patent and Trademark Office are prohibited by law from applying for a patent or acquiring, directly or indirectly, except by inheritance or bequest, any patent or any right or interest in any patent.

I have been in Delaware a long part of my life. I voted for Biden a few times in Senate elections. Being in Delaware you get a chance to meet a lot of politicians. I have met Joe several times. When I was in the Delaware Air Guard he sometimes stopped in and thanked us. I always had the impression he genuinely cared for everyone. I have heard dozens of stories of times he stopped and spoke with children or adults in supportive ways and without press around. In one story I heard from a PA GOP congressman was that his dyed-in-the-wool Republican mother was approached by Joe at White House reception. She was prepared to hate him. By the end of the conversation he told me his mother was ""in love"" with Joe and would now crawl through glass to support him. 

I do believe his faculties are not as sharp as they once were, but he has always been prone to gaffes. As an old man myself I am less inclined to vilify people for behaviors we no longer accept (if you lived back then you know no one would meet today's standards, and that is for the better).

My hope is that he brings his brand of compassion to a nation that is told by the current President that half the country are the enemy. I think he will work hard to restore experts to the things they know best in the State Department, HHS, NOAA, and other government agencies that keep us safe beyond the Defense Department.

Unfortunately this is not the year for revolution. People have fatigue from Trump and are not looking to dump everything they know just yet. Sanders has not used his time since 2016 to gather support from Democrats across the country. In order for any of his proposals to get a chance Democrats will need the House and Senate. He has not made the efforts needed to ensure the House and Senate can be secured. 

Trump announced he already had ""Bernie is a Commie"" speeches ready. For people over 50 (who vote in greater numbers than younger voters) they are easily scared by such nonsense. 

Demographics are in your favor. The Silent generation is nearly gone, the Boomers are dying off now. Younger people will soon have a better chance of changing things.

Hillary was right when she said she knows of no one who likes him; she is just as corrupt as Trump, but she is smart enough to do it legally.  Trump just doesn't give a fuck.

I am a boomer and it is disgusting how less workers are getting paid.  When I first started working I got a pension and fully employer paid health insurance.  Like a frog in a pot of boiling water more and more benefits have been taken away and employees have been paying a higher and higher percentage of health insurance.  Pensions got replaced with 401k's - 401k's have been cut back and eliminated.  According to economics 101 with supply and demand wages should be going up due to low unemployment and huge gains in productivity.  Instead they are flat and decreasing compared to inflation.

But only about 45% of those are empty at any given time. So just the death rate more than completely fills every available hospital bed and that's a small fraction of those that would need or go to the hospital.

The danger of this thing is not the death rate. It's the infection rate because we don't have the infrastructure to handle it if this thing really gets cooking. What happens when you push the medical system thag far beyond what it can handle?

If this works out we'll be looking for places to live around the DE/PA border. I'm wondering if anyone has advice on the benefits of living in DE vs PA in terms of taxes, cost of living, etc? Are there any cons of living in either we should be aware of? Thanks!

Delaware Pros - Cheaper property taxes, closer to work. Private schools are closer. More convienent to bars (Trolley Square for post-grads usually)

Pennsylvania Pros - More land for your money, typically nicer house for your money depending on area. Public schools are better(only matters if kids) Property Taxes are higher.


As someone that has lived mostly in PA over the DE Line, I vastly prefer PA. The tax differences is honestly negligible. I enjoy the more rural aspects, the fact that there is more than 6 feet between me and my neighbors. I find most people that live in PA just over the line tend to be people that work in northern DE and are local (Chadds Ford, Kennett Square, Landenberg, West Grove, Oxford etc). Whereas a lot of people that live in the more affleunt areas of northern DE tend to be commuters to Philadelphia, New York, etc.

I will warn you though, Kennett Square is the mushroom capital of the world. That means there's a lot of compost smells in the area, including from Pike Creek DE all the way through to West Grove PA, over to the center of Kennett Square. If smells are an issue for either of you, I'd check it out on a day when it stinks to make sure you can deal with it. The best way to experience this would be to go north on 41 through Avondale. There's a few winery's in the area you could visit as well that tend to be near those ... smells. (personally hate the smell, can't stand it, but I do live just close enough to get it once every few weeks when they cycle the mushroom house a few miles from me)",1583752754,fk0d1s2

So even with the best case numbers, its still 4 times worse than the flu.

7821,7821,PrincessFlirtwood,"The first concern is the flu is seasonal and will run its course, usually by spring, COVID is not seasonal and will continue to spread throughout the year. 

Secondly, while the virus is relatively mild for most people, those who get a severe case are more likely to die from COVID than the flu.  

All of us know people who are immune deficient, whether it is because of illness or age. I am not really worried about catching it, as a relatively healthy adult, but I have great fear of spreading it to my coworker with a newborn or the guy who works at my grocery store part time and the Modern Maturity Center part time.

This is from the Johns Hopkins website:

The COVID-19 situation is changing rapidly. Since this disease is caused by a new virus, people do not have immunity to it, and a vaccine may be many months away. Doctors and scientists are working on estimating the mortality rate of COVID-19, but at present, it is thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu.",1583775238,fk19o5f

The fact also remains that we mostly get over it and the only people who die are the elderly and the immunocomprimised.

It's tragic when people die, but people *do* die.  About a hundred people die a day, every day from car accidents in America, [36,560 in 2018](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year).  This sucks, and it's serious, but, in my humble but we'll-experienced opinion, it's no bigger a deal than any other danger we mitigate every day.

7827,7827,AssistX,"&gt; What is the unique threat that this virus poses? Conversely, why aren’t we taking these same precautions when there are flu or other virus outbreaks?

I believe Coronavirus has a lot higher rate of patients being admitted to hospitals than influenza. The worry is that the medical system would be overwhelmed since so many are being infected with it compared to the flu. Even though it's not a cause of concern for younger healthy people, it seems to be a high mortality rate for people that are 60+. Kids in schools are the fastest way a virus could spread I imagine, which is why the focus is on shutting the schools first. Little Johnny goes to school with 3000 kids, one of them has it, Johnny then goes home to his parents who have to care for their elderly grandparent. Suddenly someone at higher risk of death has been exposed to the virus. Where as the parents go to work, with an office of maybe 100 people, who can then spread it.

The problem is that it's a Virus and not a bacterial thing. You can't go to the Doctor and get antibiotics to fix it. You can get things lower temperature, clear congestion, etc. But when people are being admitted to the hospital for this it's because they're struggling to just breathe. It's also still thought that it's only one strain of a SARS virus causing all of this whereas the influenza is hundreds of different strains. I think the current Coronavirus is like a 3% deathrate(yes mostly elderly) whereas Influenza is like only 0.01% deathrate. (Remember that the Coronavirus deathrate is by those confirmed to be infected so not including those who didn't go to a doctor, whereas the Influenza deathrate is typically an estimation including those who never went to a doctor. )",1583777054,fk1ctbi

7942,7942,The_Projectionist,"Great to see another Delaware filmmaker! There was a push a few years ago to try and bring the Delaware film community together with Wilm Film, a small film festival hosted at Penn Cinema. Each year there was a collection which showed 5-7 short films made by Delaware filmmakers from the previous year, ranging from student films to high quality productions. I recall a great documentary called ""The People's Report"" that debuted at Wilm Film, which touched on the growing violence in Wilmington and how to combat it. Sadly, poor attendance was a recurring issue, and the festival hasn't been held for a couple years. 

For my part, I have directed and starred in several short films over the years, most of which were produced for a now defunct website called Spill . com. It was a film review website which hosted a convention and film festival every year in Austin called SpillDotCon. I was lucky enough to win that festival two years in a row, though I have not been a part of any film productions since that website was shut down. 

I'd love an opportunity to work with another local filmmaker! I haven't been a part of a production for roughly five years now, so I'm likely incredibly rusty and my equipment is obsolete by this point, but I'll help however I can!",1583854370,fk46log

Real jobs have time off, starter jobs rarely do.  Don’t work a starter job your whole life, or save money and take off unpaid time.  The government is not your mommy or your kind boss, they don’t owe you paid vacation.  Good jobs have good vacation policies.

Agree and finally a Pres that got us out of those wars.  Lefty’s love it because it funnels huge sums into their coffers.  Righty love it too for same reason.  Trump &amp; Rand Paul might be the only two that truly despise it for both financial &amp; humanitarian reasons.

Lefty politicians and the MSM are one in the same and they are both horrible.  Today’s lefty’s HATE the working man.  Huge taxes, regulations, 2A, crappy universal healthcare, on it goes.  The Dem party left the working man behind which is how Trump won in 2016, everyone saw it and it’s much bigger support now than in 2016.

High drug prices are due to onerous regulations, it’s terribly expensive and takes years to navigate the IS drug regs.  Lefty’s put most of those regs in place, they love big government and control.  Then the Pharma companies donate huge money to both parties, including the DE guys.  See the pattern?  

Your free trade argument makes no sense unless you’re talking NATFH?  It was one sided and it’s getting fixed.  Much Chinese money comes into politicians, NGOs, big liberal universities (huge money), and influential US industries (NBA, Bloomberg).  Pattern yet again.

Trump is not a lefty but brought home thousands of troops, the military rank &amp; file love that man.  The Lefty’s and a lot of Righty’s criticized the heck out of him for doing it.  Obama, Hillary, Bush all failed on this front.  A Righty fixed the problem, argument holds no water.

The Food Lion is nice and bright, well organized and stocked, and I don't feel as stressed.   (i know this sounds like a commerical but it's not).

As far as meats, I only eat chicken and turkey, so I can't speak on beef/pork.   But Food Lion has Perdue chicken, and they have a Natural Pride or something like that which is good as well.   I personally stay away from the unbranded chicken.

Street sweepers once a year doesn't cut it; glass and literal razor blades, for example, covering the bike lanes force cyclists into the drive lane.

Also, roads without a bike lane or shoulder obviously force cyclists to ride in the drive lane.

Driver behavior doesn't help, either.  When people try to squeeze past when there isn't room, cyclists are forced to ride in the middle of the lane rather than close to the edge to signal that there is not, in fact, room.

This is a link to a recent Joe Rogan podcast with  Michael Osterholm.

 Michael Osterholm is an internationally recognized expert in infectious disease epidemiology. He is Regents Professor, McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), Distinguished Teaching Professor in the Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, a professor in the Technological Leadership Institute, College of Science and Engineering, and an adjunct professor in the Medical School, all at the University of Minnesota.

Very educational 90 minutes. Well worth a listen/watch. 

Personally I listen to what the Doctors/Healthcare workers have to say because they have no agenda. Whereas politicians, of ALL parties have an agenda mostly revolving around whether something they say will affect their chances of re-election.

https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/03/809904660/why-the-death-rate-from-coronavirus-is-plunging-in-china

Hubei  didn't start testing people until after a couple dozen people died and the figured out what it was. This jeans that tens of thousands (if not more) people already had it or were carrying it. After that China ramped up testing. If you exclude Hubei, from both deaths and cases the death rate falls to 0.7% and falling. In Europe where they are doing rigorous testing is 0.4% and falling. 

The latest case study in Germany with close observation showed that 80% of people develop no symptoms. Those people generally don't get tested. The number of real cases is easily double the confirmed number. 

Any other ridiculous points you'd like to make?

You're the epitome of the often misunderstood colloquialism ""knowing just enough to be dangerous."". The common misinterpretation is that you know just enough to get the job done.

The main issue here is the mass hysteria of the general public. As someone in the healthcare field doing the testing, I’m not truly concerned about Coronavirus.

We’re already at capacity with really sick people from the flu and other respiratory infections. We don’t need the extra stress on our time and resources from all these people panicking about Coronavirus.

These sick people will be coming to our hospitals and urgent cares regardless of if they’re told not to by their doctors. They will be sitting in the Emergency Department or doctors office waiting rooms. Choosing to do testing like this actually does limit the exposure to the general public. They are staying in their cars with their windows up until it’s their turn for testing. The only people they’re coming in contact with are the healthcare providers collecting their info and the specimen. The healthcare professionals were wearing proper PPE to protect themselves. This testing site let that many more people out of the hospitals and doctors offices, giving more space and time and resources to care for those that are critically ill, rather than wading through all the people that just want the Coronavirus testing. 

Your logic that these people are staying home isolated from the rest of the community is what’s supposed to happen and everyone in healthcare would love for them to follow that. But they’re not. They’re going out and getting gas and groceries and other supplies and exposing people regardless. That completely invalidates your argument that the testing site is creating more potential for the sick to exposure others. They’re doing it regardless because they want testing.

Attention then has shifted toward a more northern connector, and some small segments of trail have been built, but it’s still not contiguous. Where to put the 896 crossing is another obstacle.

Currently, most people connect by climbing Wedgewood Rd by Carpenter Park, going north on 896 a short distance, then cutting through Glen Farms on Harvest Lane. After a few turns, you come out at Little Egypt Rd and there’s a gap in the hedge that takes you right into Fair Hill land.

Yet.... 65% of American adults don't get a flu shot. Did you?  The CDC strongly recommend that everyone over the age of 6 months does. Not just to protect themselves, but to protect those around them. Especially for people that are in regular contact with children or the elderly.

My favorite thing is my Facebook friends, that I know for a fact didn't get a flu shot, all of a sudden engaging in massive virtue signalling and acting  like anyone who doesn't lock themselves in a hamster ball is going to kill everyone.  

Point being.... People not taking CDC recommendations silly is nothing new. It happens every year. Also people are massive hypocrites.

I was affected by one of the first clusters of H1N1 (swine flu)  back in 2009. People were freaking out and they closed a bunch of schools. This was before social media.  It's also worth noting that their initial fatality rate were WAY overestimated (by more than 10x).  

Either way, even the preliminary fatality rate of COVID-19 is nowhere near 3%. It's between 0.3% and 0.7%.

https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/03/809904660/why-the-death-rate-from-coronavirus-is-plunging-in-china

Countries with robust testing have shown us that the majority of people that are infected (~80%) either have no symptoms or symptoms mild enough not to notice. Many countries (like Italy) are only testing in areas after people have died and only testing those with undeniable symptoms that seek out testing That decreases the denominator. Inflating the rate.

https://time.com/5798168/coronavirus-mortality-rate/

All that being said, I have little doubt that COVID-19 will kill 10-20,000 Americans this year. Probably on the lower side since viruses struggle after April in the northern hemisphere. That's a big number. But for perspective, 40,000 Americans die every year in car accidents. 35,000 died from last year's mild flu season. 60,000 died 2 seasons ago when we had a bad flu season. But like I said.... 65% of American adults can't be bothered to get a flu shot. Even though it demonstrably lowers transmission and lethality.",1584280104,fkkc1o6

But don't take my word... Take Dr. Paul Offit, co-inventor of the  rotavirus vaccine, CHOP doctor, and UPenn Professor of Vaccinology's word for it.

Here he is correctly predictions that it can't be contained in large part because of the number of unconfirmed cases die to lack of robust testing. Also staying that it won't be dramatically worse than the flu.

https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2020/03/02/doctor-paul-offit-coronavirus-pandemic-trump-response-aman.cnn

Here he is saying that a vaccine is unrealistic and similar to the flu it will likely be back every year. And won't have a mortality rate different from the flu.

At no point have I suggested taking this lightly. People are going to die. All I have said is that the numbers people are throwing around are inaccurate.

Shutting down every school statewide isn't the best policy. The CDC agrees with me.

&gt;It also said that “available modeling” indicates that early closures of a few days or two to four weeks “do not impact” the spread of the virus or hospitalizations but may be useful if many students and staff are absent, or to clean buildings and try to trace networks of people who may have been infected.

9319,9319,That_Girl_Cray,"I’ve dealt with it in multiple ways and I still have trouble figuring it out. 

This year was the most confusing.  I ended up owing PA almost $300 but getting a refund from DE for about $230... I’m the other way around.  I live in PA and I work in DE.   My employer only takes out DE taxes.  
PA &amp; DE tax differently. In DE the income tax rate is based on how much you make.  The more you make the more you pay.  The less you make the less you pay.   In PA the income tax rate is 3% for everyone regardless of income.   So here’s what went wrong with me this year.   I went part-time mid year and made a lot less this year. So DE taxed me less... so much less that it fell below the 3% I’m required to pay to PA.  Which is why I owed.  I’m still not 100%  on where my DE refund is coming from.  I guess I overpaid ?   My filing status is always 0 which means I get the max amount of taxes taken out of my paycheck so that’s possible.  

So if your PA employer is only taking out PA taxes at a rate of 3%  and you fall into an income bracket in DE that requires you to pay more than 3% that could result in you owing.  
( plus I’m not sure how your NJ income effects that).   

When I lived in DE and worked in PA I got a refund.  Then the year I moved back to PA from DE. I had to do a partial year resident and ended up breaking even.  It’s a pain in the ass trying to figure out when you live and work in different states.",1584351973,fkn3ncj

9329,9329,That_Girl_Cray,"PA native here ✋🏼Who lived in DE for several years and is now back in PA but still working in DE and commuting everyday. So I’ve been bouncing back and forth between these two states for years now and probably always will because I could live in either.  They’re things I like and dislike about both of them.  

I’ve never owned anything personally but it’s pretty well known that PA property taxes are high. Ridiculously high in some areas.  So if you’re buying it’s probably better to in DE.  
Rent is pretty much the same and really depends on what neighborhood you’re in. 

Since your wife is going to be working in Wayne and you in Wilmington. I agree with some of the other comments that North (emphasis on the North) Wilmington would be an ideal location for you. I work in North Wilmington and I like the area. Would consider living there myself.   

The commute for your wife could be a bit of a pain in the ass. It’s 40-50 minutes without traffic. Which she would have to leave ( assuming she has a 9-5ish type of work schedule)  between 6:30-6:45am to avoid the worst of in the morning.  There’s no avoiding rush hour unfortunately.  I’m in Delaware County same as Wayne. But on the other end ...Lower Delco.  It takes me about 30 minutes to get to North Wilmington without traffic. But can go over an hour during rush hour and I only got to hop on I-95.  Your wife would have to do 95 and the blue route ( 476).  Known for heavy traffic.  I’d say over an hour guaranteed during rush hour.  

Another option to commuting if the traffic is too much would be Septa’s regional rail.  ( Philadelphia and southeastern PA’s public transportation system) did this for years myself. There’s a line that runs into DE as far down as Newark. With stops in Wilmington and Claymont.  But she would have to ride it from DE into Philadelphia and get another train at 30th street station that would bring her to Wayne. That’s also over an hour total. 😕

Hopefully you both drive and own vehicles because one of the cons for DE is that it is NOT walker friendly. I mean unless you’re smack dab in the center of Wilmington or in other parts of Wilmington that I doubt you would want to go to. I didn’t have a license when I first moved to DE and had to walk and use their public transportation system ( DART) which makes no sense. Did that for two years it sucks. 

Two things I love about DE. The Christiana Mall and the Christiana Hospital/Healthcare system. Now St. Francis hospital is closer to North Wilmington  (and so is Nemours  DuPont an excellent children’s hospital if you decide to have some little ones).  Some will disagree but I prefer Christiana over St. Francis.  JMO. 
And it’s a good thing The mall is a good one cause it’s the only one left in the immediate area.  Oh and no sales tax in DE.  

Another pro for DE ; Beaches! A little over an hour or so south you’ll start hitting the beaches and beach towns. Roehobeth is the most well known but my least favorite personally. Boardwalk sucks, parking is a nightmare, and they don’t have good ocean waves. Nearby Dewey &amp; Bethany are much more preferable IMO.  Dewey’s good for the party scene or more alcohol restaurant/bars beach type of town. Bethany is more quiet if you want a more peaceful trip.  They’re are also a few beaches along the way that are just beaches not part of a beach town. They’re good for day trips. There’s bathrooms w/ showers/ changing areas and snack bar.  Only thing with those is that you have to pay. But it’s not expensive. There’s a few campgrounds too. I don’t really like camping myself so I know less about them. Only been to one near Roehobeth. Then just beyond the DE beaches you’ll hit Ocean City, MD  which is one of the best beach towns. They have something for everyone. A good boardwalk, a beautiful beach . Lots of bars, restaurants, activities.  You have the ocean on one side and the bay on the other.  I highly recommend it.  


Philly also isn’t far 30-45 minute drive.  Plenty to do and see.  Wilmington has been stepping up their game as well with night life and events. Delaware park is a pretty good casino. 
Jersey isn’t far either so Atlantic City and the Jersey shore towns are only about two hours away.  NYC is even within driving distance. A little over 2 hours.  You can get a train right from Wilmington train station that will take you right into NYC in less time.  Amtrak trains and a Septa train run through Wilmington train station.  

This part of the country is ideal as far as weather too. Same as Chicago we get all four seasons.  No major natural disasters. Too far inland for Hurricanes to cause too much damage ( although there have been some that were worse than others).  Flooding can occur it really depends on where you live.  You’ve lived inChicago so you’re use to snow. Which we seem to be getting less and less of. I don’t think we got any this year.  Haven’t had a blizzard in probably over a decade.  

Overall I’d say it’s a great place to live. Been around here my whole life.  Wouldn’t want to live anywhere else. So welcome and good luck with everything. Hope you find your place here.",1584362070,fkncntg

If you are blaming media on this, you are watching too much media.  Stop acting like this is already over, and understand that it is just barely ramping up.

We need to band together and help the hospitals and health care system, we need to isolate in order to protect those among us who are elderly, sick, and immunocompromised even if it’s an inconvenience to us. We need to stop thinking about just ourselves in the moment and band together to do what’s best for the community as a whole. What you can do is petition the right people for aid and assistance.

&gt;WILMINGTON, Del. – Governor John Carney on Monday modified his March 12 emergency declaration to limit Delaware restaurants, taverns and bars to take-out and delivery service only to help prevent spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Governor Carney’s updated emergency declaration — which takes effect at 8:00 p.m. tonight, March 16 — also bans public gatherings of 50 or more people, consistent with updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and closes gaming activity at Delaware casinos.

This is not something that is taken lightly.  We are not allowing anybody with any symptoms of any illness to work whatsoever, and employees must be symptom free for 72 hours before they can return.  We are sanitizing all hand contact surfaces every 30 minutes.  We are disinfecting every check presenter after it touches anybody's hands.  We are telling customers to keep the pens they sign the credit card slips with so that there is no chance of cross-contamination.  

We always ramp up awareness during flu season anyway, but I would feed my immunocompromised father food from my restaurant without hesitation (and I do).  

Also, it's not just the small restaurant owners who need local support.  I don't want to see anybody lose their business from this pandemic, but please remember that the larger restaurants also employ far more people, and we are trying our very best to insure that our employees are all able to continue to work in some capacity and pay their bills and take care of their families.

The chance of you getting covid-19 from a togo box or bag is probably less than the odds of you getting it from the package of food or TP you bought at the grocery store that had a hundred people around it before you bought it and took it home.  If you aren't fearful of that scenario, then I wouldn't worry about the restaurant food.

9804,9804,Hurrmionegranger,"We don't actually get that much sick time, and vacation time accrues very slowly if you're in the bottom tier for that scale.  So of you burn your time now, in an effort to prevent the spread without a governor mandate, you're fucked if anything else happens to you. 

Please bear in mind that I'm not saying that some other people don't have it worse --i know that there are people with no paid time who are also facing this decision, which is horrifying.  The solution to the whole problem, however,  is for Carney to mandate remote working, and then mandate that companies have to pay employees for that mandated time off.  He's not doing that.  He's halfassing all the moves he's making, which is infuriating.  Please note that the confirmed cases doubled in 24 hours yesterday; halfass moves are putting everyone in very real danger in this state.",1584525413,fktll57

The underlying factor here is that he doesn't want to look like he's letting taxpayer-paid employees get away with something by having them work at home.  

The solution to that problem is,  as I said before,  MANDATE that all nonessential employees, state or otherwise,  stay home and that their employer pay them regardless.  If it's a small business, supplement employee pay with emergency stipends. Then everyone has the option and no one feels resentment, the optics are good,  and most importantly, the virus loses thousands of opportunities to infect.",1584526173,fktm6pu
9806,9806,Hurrmionegranger,"My point is that if he were truly being proactive and this wasn't community-protection theatre,  you would receive emergency supplemental help to pay your employees at home. 

The point of a stay home mandate is to prevent the spread and protect people,  which isn't happening if you're continuing to meet with them.  No blame on you for that, but if you're still doing business as usual, you're creating more opportunities to spread the virus. The loophole he won't close because he's a fuckin idiot is that without a mandate and without financial help, of course you'll be forced to stay open and expose your staff.",1584526737,fktmmm1

I have been told that the term sock puppet is outdated, people just use the term sock.

You suck at being a sock, because you used the same unique term that only one other person has said to me ever and that was in a long line of **private** messages recently when you posted this.

So we engage in private messaging and one of the first things you say is everyone calls you a racist.  Then you go on to defend the most racist acts people do as normal.  It seems white people can do no wrong in your eyes and at first you ""supported"" BLM, but then they got too ""radical"" and you couldn't anymore.  I didn't even call you a racist - I just said it is very telling that you always support racists.

Keep in mind this was all in private messages.  And how do you respond?  You trash me in a public thread saying I harass you.

Everything was going well and we agreed on a lot...until it got to race.  Once I didn't support your bullshit, you flew off the handle and started trashing me in public.

10121,10121,AssistX,"&gt; Freeze foreclosures on non-vacation rentals. Easy.

You mean freeze payments or waive payments? Freezing foreclosures just means when the virus restrictions are lifted the landlords would be left with paying the full amount for the lost time all at once. Same as freezing mortgages, it doesn't change anything unless Utilities are going to freeze payments. Waiving late fees for 90 days, like some utilities are doing, doesn't change how much you're going to owe. After those 90 days you're going to owe $600 instead of the normal monthly $200 you pay. 

People that are worried about making a mortgage or rental payment are very shortsighted in what is going to happen to the economy due to the jobs lost. The Federal Government believes the peak of cases in the US will be around May 1st, that's a really long time to have small businesses closed down.

I'd contact the DNC, as it's their platform you're voting for and not for the President. Technically the DNC could tell Delaware they don't care about their votes and opt to not have the Primary in Delaware.

But, the Primary can actually be held as late as August or something like that. They could also decide that Biden is the next Democratic Presidential Candidate and Delaware would then have to put 100% of it's delegates behind him, regardless of how Delaware would have voted.

Presidential Primaries are fucked up when you think about the fact that you're voting for whose going to be the top guy of the team you're voting for.

The harsh reality is that the country will need to shut down for several weeks, if not up to two months minimum, to curb the virus spread. China has been in strict quarantine for nearly 9 weeks this week in most places and is expected to continue for at least another week. That's 10 weeks of no business. 

No restaurant, small business, and so on could survive that and the government knows it. So they're either going to keep milking the ""haha it'll be fine very soon"" when it's not... or worse they WILL actually let things reopen in two weeks and we'll see another surge. Two weeks is barely enough for infected people to show symptoms and get tested, let alone for the virus to stop spreading.

That's my hot take on things... I'm so glad I didn't hop jobs this year from my current one... which is arguably safer than anywhere I was willing to go.

https://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-employer-obligations-under-slightly-revised-families-first-coronavirus-act-hr


So basically, people will get sick leave immediately. Problem is after the 14 day sick-leave, the employee can still remain out for extended sick leave, the employer is being told they have to pay 2/3rds of their wages to that employee for up to 3 months. They say the employer will get a tax credit for this, but right now that tax credit is only going against Social Security taxes (6.2%). Essentially that means that for every $100 the employer is sending to the employee who hasn't worked in months, the employer is only being compensated $7. Small businesses cannot afford this and instead you're going to see them lay people off. They're laying the cost of the pandemic at the feet of small business rather than taking it from wasteful and defense budgets.",1584627721,fkxgm7i

They also have not, and still do not recommend widespread school closures.


&gt;The latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says **the available evidence from other countries is those places that did close schools, such as Hong Kong, “have not had more success in reducing spread than those that did not,” such as Singapore.**

&gt;It also said that “available modeling” indicates that **early closures of a few days or two to four weeks “do not impact” the spread of the virus or hospitalizations** but may be useful if many students and staff are absent, or to clean buildings and try to trace networks of people who may have been infected.

&gt;As for longer school closures of eight to 20 weeks, the CDC said that “there may be some impact” but that **modeling shows that other efforts, such as hand-washing and home isolation, “have more impact on both spread of disease and health care measures.”**

It was all over then news--its   contagiousness was all over the news as well.    I bought my 3m N95 masks on 2/16 for 14.98. Some of us were all over this.  

   Sometimes people need to go out and even those non 95 masks are better than nothing.   If they do this and the other safeguards your mentioned they will face better odds.

Stanton is an unincorporated area, so its boundaries are literally undefined.  Also, none of your links even remotely *suggest* that Artesian supplies water in the Stanton area.  It is quite possible that parts of ""Stanton"" are service by Artesian and other parts are serviced by UWD/Suez.

The reason most masks are not effective for Coronavirus is the virus particles are so small, they can penetrate through the masks, which makes them zero percent effective. That’s precisely why the N95 masks are the only one that should be used. And even they do not provide 100% safety. The main reason for wearing the masks is when you’re sick, you’re trying to minimize the spread of the droplets, which is how the virus is spread. 

Bandanas, scarves, and even the cloth masks people are making ARE NOT effective at stopping the virus and will actually make you more susceptible to becoming infected. There are many articles from Infectious Disease specialists and Laboratory professionals who work with these viruses that explain the reasoning behind why masks are not going to prevent you from getting sick.

If you want to figure out mortality rate, you need to know how many cases there are. This will give you the most accurate denominator to determine mortality. This is hard to do due to the number of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. 

Based on the World Health Organization, South Korea is #1 on per capita testing in the world for COVID-19. So they are the most accurate model we have for mortality rate. In South Korea that mortality rate is around 0.7%. Wuhan, China is the second highest testing location in the world, and thier numbers work out to a mortality rate of 1.4%. Despite the news saying we are short on tests, the US is actually #3 in the world for testing numbers and our mortality rate is right around that 1.4% rate you see in Wuhan (and dropping as test results keep coming in). People will point to the rate in Italy, but that number is artificially high since they actually aren't testing much at all since they have switched to full treatment mode. So they don't have an accurate count of infections. 

The numbers people are throwing around online siimply aren't grounded in any scientific data or evidence. And there is already more than enough bad information out there, please don't add to it.

If they follow safe practices at work (cleaning surfaces, washing hands, avoiding touching) they have almost no chance of contracting the virus. And the number of cases in DE is very, very low. If they are immuno compromised or suffer respitory illness they are in FAR greater danger from this year's especially virulent flu outbreak. 

Again, calling someone who works in the field ""ignorant"" and painting false situation's as the only option and giving into panic (and hostility) due to a lack of education on your part isn't helping anything.

While we appreciate the support, if you really want to help, the best way you can do that is don't panic. Out phone systems are overloaded with constant calls of concerned citizens. People sneeze and immediately insist the must have a test for COVID-19. We have people walking into the ER demanding a test, showing no symptoms, exposing themselves to other sick people who could pass on an infection (COVID or otherwise). Which is the absolute opposite of what they should be doing.

We have to ask people who come in if they have a history of respitory illiness or are immuno-compromised, I have yet to hear a single person answer no, and that include patients I have been working with for years and know thier medical history and they certainly do not have any history of respitory illness or immune system deficiency. 

People need to stop panic'ing and stop overwhelming the emergency hospital system. If you have a fever and shortness of breath, CALL (do not go to) your doctor. Listen to thier advice. Turn off the TV, don't watch the news, dear God don't go on social media. Hospital's are not out of supplies, we have plenty of beds, but the best way to change that is an onslaught of people consuming hospital resources who do not meet the clinical threshold for hospitalization.

Either way I'm not here to argue with you. I'm pointing oilut the fact that protection from the virus is almost entirely dependant on people personal actions. Not the government.

Stay at home, was your hands, if you have to go to work follow safe workplace protocols (I do every day and am exposed to far more contagious pathogens than you and am not I'll in any way). Making statement like ""going to work is a death sentence"" is simply untrue and does nothing but already panic, and panic WILL have an impact of the availability of medical care for those who need it

10650,10650,qaxr,"Again, your ""facts"" aren't backed up by the data. When it comes to immuno-compromised people, respiratory illnesses are far more deadly. The flu mortality rate you are citing is for non immuno-compromised people. The mortality rate for COVID-19 varies by area, population, age, and several other factors. 

As for the R value for COVID-19, there is no consensus yet, it is still being studied. It seems to be between 1.5 - 3. The flu is 1.3. Making an absolute statement like ""it is twice as contagious"" is false, and unnecessarily panic inducing to people who don't know the science. 

Again, I'm not sure where this latent hostility to someone presenting facts comes from. I will say we in the wing I work at have witnessed a very bizarre trend amoung patients, especially younger patients, who seem to want this to be worse than it actually is. We are working with therapists and counselors to make sure people are getting the mental health treatments they needs, but this desire to make an already bad situation sound apocalyptic is really weird. 

This is not the end of the world. We know exactly what to do in order to minimize the spread of this virus. We are learning more facts every day but a lot is still unknown. What is certainly harmful is filling in that lack of knowledge with hunchs, assumptions, and doomsayer predictions. The situation is literally changing almost by the hour as testing results come in, treatment and recovery data comes in, supplies are brought in (or getting depleted, people please stop buying your own masks, we in the hospitals need them!) and information from local, federal, and international sources some in. We are living in a time of extreme uncertainty and that is a ripe ground for people to make false claims which do nothing but risk panic and people seeking uneccesary treatments. 

As for Gov. Cuomo, his response to the virus has been excellent and I think he is the most accurate source of information from the various politicians on TV holding press conferences. I'm not sure what that has to do with your ability to personally minimize your risk or claim that not closing down your job is a guaranteed death sentence. 

You seem to be really irrational here, and if you are truly feeling the level of anxiety and hopelessness you are displaying on here, I would encourage you to contact Delaware’s Division of Public Health at 1-866-408-1899 from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mon to Fri, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sat and Sun, or e-mail at dphcall@delaware.gov and ask about mental health/counseling resources available to the public related to COVID-19 fear. counselors can work with you remotely via TeleMed.

The truth is they can make all the proclamations and shut down orders and tell everyone to stay home all they like, that's only going to work for about 2 weeks (and we are already 1 week in). After that people are going to be saying to themselves ""this whole thing was overblown I feel fine screw the government I'm going back to living my life"" and people will ignore the orders and go about thier routines.

We see the same thing with medicine, the medical term is ""adherence"", people start thier medication and when they feel better, thry stop taking it, even if they still have weeks of treatment yet.

Government can say anything they want but unless they plan to turn the US into a police state with armed patrols wandering the streets of America, isolation will not be a successful long term strategy. People will resume thier lives in a week or so, and that's when cases will surge.

Our best way to prepare for that is by not using up medical resources now if you do not have a fever and signs of respitory illness. The panic driven consumption of health care capacity occuring now is the threat we can stop so we have that capacity in 2 weeks when people stop paying attention to government orders.",1584839488,fl5lc6k

I'm not saying don't vote for somebody who's policies you agree with, I'm just saying the most important thing for a head of state is not whether you agree with them but rather how effective of a leader they are.

I don't want to go into more than that because i don't think there's another company who does it in Delaware, so it would be easy to figure out. But, I will say she's figured out that the secondary industry they're claiming to support is actually handled by another office in another state. It falls under the umbrella of what they company provides, but it's not something their office handles at all.

I'm going to give an example based on the pdf. The list says realtors can only work remotely (which it should say this for any job that can be done remotely). It would be about the same a realtor office claiming they support the construction industry and therefore can legally remain open. 

This list cannot be a vague as it is. We can't leave businesses to interpret these laws or they're going to do what makes sense $$$ wise.

Newark has a decent night life but you're going to have all the college kids around for about 9 months out of the year. If you like beer Two Stones Pub is awesome ( there are multiple locations throughout the state) There are a ton of great parks in the area Glasgow Park and White Clay Creek State Park have a concert series in the summer.  The Delaware Art Museum has a lot of cool stuff. Longwood Gardens and Winterthur are Dupont estates that have amazing gardens. Hagley is more about the industrial side of things but still worth a visit.  In the fall there's the Brandywine arts festival which is cool to check out. Like I said before,  Philly and Baltimore are close enough for day trips. The Inner Harbour and Fells Point in Baltimore are very cool.  Philly has a ton of museums. The Franklin Institute always has cool displays and they have cocktail hours pretty regularly.  The Mütter Museum is a medical oddity museum and its my favorite,  worth the trip if you like that kind of thing,  they have the soap lady.

Newark is a cool town, it’s a university town so lots of college age kids but also a great place for lunch for office workers near there. Main Street has a good selection of bars and restaurants.

Wilmington is on its way up, it has a reputation because of its high violence rate but I personally enjoy the city downtown Market St), riverfront and Trolley Square. A handful of good restaurants, bars and even the theaters downtown bring in some decent shows, concerts and lecturers from time to time. It’s not a major city, but it’s big enough to give you a little taste of city life without driving to Philly or New York. If you plan to move there just be careful where you end up, Downtown, Riverfront and Trolley are good for apartments, I wouldn’t live elsewhere unless you’re getting an actual house.

Wilmington/Newark is about 1.5 hours from the Delaware beaches, my personal favorite part of the state. Cape Henlopen State Park is beautiful, it’s on a peninsula and has plenty of beach. Rehoboth, Lewes and Dewey are also nice. Rehoboth is the busiest beach town, Lewes one of the more low key ones and Dewey is a party town.

WilmingtonNewark is also only about 30/40 mins outside of Philadelphia, there is also an Amtrak station in Wilmington that you can use to get to New York City or D.C in roughly an hour and a half-two hours. 

The state parks are really nice, again Cape Henlopen is the best in my opinion but I’m a huge beach fan.

Also there’s no sales tax so that’s always nice when going out.

As someone whose lived all over the state, and also several major cities in the US and abroad, I enjoy this state, it’s not NYC or DC but it’s very charming, relaxing and has enough to do to keep you happy especially if you love the outdoors.

Its hard to say. Ive met real life guys like him in Dover and Georgetown. 

And they stomp around looking for a ""cuck"" to cuss and shit at. 

Their politics isnt about policy, its about contrarianism and counter society. The more the abrade against decency the more real they feel.

They dont believe that they are trolling. Despite their ever shifting values, and beliefs, and complete lack of a foundation. As long as the other person is ""wrong"" and as long as they feel that the other person got ""owned""

Its technically trolling, because they feel good from making people angry. But its **NOT** the trolling we think of when we use it on the internet.

These are people who never really had political beliefs before 2016. They  only voted on one issue for the same party. And when they did discuss politics , they only talked about how ""they never really like *insert incumbent*"" because liking someone who had done things means taking a stance. 

And taking a stance means they would need the foundation of beliefs and values to support them. 

But during 2016, it became mainstream vogue due to memes and the internet to ""feel and do politics"", so they glommed it on to their identity. And they will defend their identity even from reality. 


They cannot measure themselves except by tearing at another, for  they lack an identity that is wholly their own. 

Is it any wonder the divide has deepened as far as it has with active reputational saboteurs like him coming to the fore and stealing control from the republicans that actually had policy.

I cannot tell you for sure if any particular dem would have handled it better, but I KNOW that it has been mishandled by our current leader. Even when other republicans like Dewine are handling it much better.

People need to *stop* getting defensive when their preferred politician gets criticized and accept that *maybe* their support is coming before the reality of the situation. 

Learning how bad this was going to be, keeping that info, pumping stocks with misinformation about its not as bad as the flu, and dumping stocks right before it gets bad, and *only then* making weak moves against it (much too late) isnt something that should be defended.

I would be a first time gun owner; but I did hunt when I was a teenager so I have fired guns and I did have to take a gun safety glass to get my hunting license (note: I'm almost 40 now so yeah it's been a while). 

My fear is that if this thing explodes, or unemployment continues to skyrockets, and there’s any form of non-panic related food shortages (aka: supply chains get cut off)….. Crime will definitely increase; and will increase drastically as people get desperate. And if crime goes up during this pandemic - that could lead to a) cops may begin not doing or not able to do their jobs if this gets really bad. b) the emergency system could be overran if this gets really bad…   

Do I think that’s what’s going to happen? No.

Do I think that could happen? Yes. 

I have a machete and a baseball bat right now. And while that’s probably more than some have - I just don’t feel prepared enough to defend myself if all hell breaks loose (And yes if all hell breaks loose I realize I’d probably just be buying time fighting off an intruder)

Note: I also have a ton of food and water stacked up in my spare bedroom. Do I think I’ll need it? I hope not; but if I do I’m prepared. It’s not like it’s a waste if everything improved in a month or two. Just will eat like a college kid and not have to buy groceries for a couple months.

That is easy to do!

according to the CDC:

**How to Clean and Disinfect**

**Surfaces**

* If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
* For disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.
   * Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.
* Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:
   * 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water or
   * 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water
   * [Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimsexternal icon](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2) are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
   * For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning:
   * If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely.
   * Otherwise, use products with the EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims (examples at [this linkpdf iconexternal icon](https://www.americanchemistry.com/Novel-Coronavirus-Fighting-Products-List.pdf)) that are suitable for porous surfaces 
* [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.html)",1585333762,flo8wfk

They also leave out testing data. Did a zip code have 1 positive amoung 100 negatives, or 1 positive amoung 25,000 negatives? Those are two very different realities. But again facts and details make it hard to generate clicks based on fear

And if you think your employer would never do that; check out what these assholes are doing:

&gt;The agreement would put workers under a “temporary compensation reduction that is in line with the assistance that it receives from the federal government related to the COVID-19 pandemic.” By signing the agreement, the company’s employees would have their paychecks between April 6 and April 20 cut by 100% of any money received under the stimulus bill.
The company would also take half of the $500 stipend allotted for dependents under the bill.

You make a link to one company in Austin, TX and make it seem like it’s happening everywhere.

Changing jobs isn’t as easy for everyone as you make it sound and most people in this subreddit are talking about service industry jobs. Some people just do not like change. Even if you could get a new job that pays better, that doesn’t always mean it’s worth it to ones overall well being. If you like your current boss, co- workers and come home happy. That is more beneficial to some instead of a crappy boss, shitty co-workers and coming home miserable but with a better income, especially if it’s only marginally better. 

I have some students who work in the service industry with employers that work with their school schedule that changes every semester and give them reduced hours during mid terms and finals week. I have even more students who are in the service industry that do not have that luxury. By them looking for a different job then they might lose that non-monetary benefit which is hard to find.  I have had more than one say they could bartend at the beach and make significantly more $ but tailoring their school schedule around their job instead of vice versa isn’t worth it. It’s a temporary sacrifice for their future. 

The stimulus package almost guarantees these restaurants and bars will reopen and you cannot really reduce a servers pay below $2.13 (or whatever it is) an hour. Not one of them has said they would have to reinterview for their job when these establishments reopen. 

Basically it comes down to, if a person wants to look for a new job during this time because they’ve been furloughed, that’s great. If a person wants to go back to working for their previous employer when we get through this. That is great too.

12868,12868,delaware420,"Oh I completely understand about people giving their everything to a company. 

I have some friends who have worked for Sprint for 10+ years in Kansas City at their world headquarters. I’ve asked them would they be willing to relocate to Seattle and they usually say no and do not understand why I’ve asked them this question. It is where T-Mobile’s US headquarters is located. While Legere (T-Mobile’s CEO) has said they will keep two headquarters, while that may be true and may very well try, I don’t see that always being the case. Consolidation will happen. People will lose jobs, have to relocate or quit because they do not want to relocate. My friends are under the impression none of that will happen, that business will just continue as usual and that to me is delusional of them. 

This has already happened with Sprint before when they merged with Nextel. They initially attempted to operate with two headquarters (One in KC and the other in Virginia) but a mere 3 years after the merger they realized that having two headquarters was not feasible. They then closed the former Nextel headquarters in Virginia. 

If it was Sprint buying out T-Mobile I would tell them not to worry as much since the headquarters consolidation would probably happen the other way around but alas, that is not the case.",1585509386,flusyh6

Yes, I do blame residents as well, but there’s a difference between 30 miles in your own state and 200 miles out of state. 

 More to the point and hopefully palatable, I just went to Aldi of all places in Kent mf county, and more than 35% of the tags were from NY. And more than half were out of state. The first, “tiny” state is being invaded, and I’m pissed. The governor might not need to be extreme like Rhode Island, but it’s fairly logical that if we suffer, it will most likely be from those fleeing their states.

Delaware is not even equipped to deal with 100 Covid-19 cases on top of pregnancies, strokes, etc. There is nothing progressive about defending  this. Go defend the transgenders down in Sussex instead. And when this mess is over, we will welcome all transgenders, heterosexuals, etc. from every place.

There are 2 testing facilities in the state (not collection sites), one of which is the DE department of health that has a 2 day turnaround time and is reserved for inpatient COVID tests or health care workers (so we can return to work faster) . The other lab is privately operated  which is taking 99% of all other tests, results on average are taking 8-10 days.  

  

I do wish we had better capabilities for faster results and more widely available testing but we simply don't at this time. In the majority of cases it should not change treatment but there may be a host of non-COVID illness (bacterial infections, heart failure, COPD) that goes undertreated because of lack of access. One of the major caregiver difficulties is getting patients evaluated and determining the cause of symptoms without putting patients at unnecessary risk or straining the health care system beyond capacity.  

  

[https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections)  

\^ If anyone is interested in seeing how well we as a state are faring compared to other states. As of 3/29/2020 it is projected that DE peak complications of infection (i.e. needing ventilators/ICU beds) will occur on 4/24/2020 (which is actually 10 days behind the predicted US peak). 

The predictions believe  \~60 people may need ventilators on that date and hundreds more needing hospital beds. A scenario dwarfed by neighboring states with larger populations (NJ to peak on 4/11/20 and require \~1,460 ventilators). 

These models have immense error potential and we have seen NY reach critical surge capacity much more quickly than predicted. That said, hospitals like Christiana Care have immense critical care resources and experience. It may be one of the best places in the country to be hospitalized with complications of COVID-19. As Delawareans continue to take this seriously and help flatten the curve it will help prevent deaths as there will be ventilators for those that need.  

  

If you or a loved one has a confirmed positive case remember the recommendations still have not changed.  

\~80% of people should have somewhat minor symptoms; fever, dry cough, muscle aches/headaches, sore throat

\- Many people will experience pleuritic chest pain while breathing and exertional shortness of breath

\- About 15% of people with symptoms will need the hospital, particularly for oxygen

\- About 5% of people with symptoms may progress to ARDS and need the ventilator and breathing tube (unfortunately a majority of this population are not surviving however we continue to improve our treatments)

\- Onset of symptoms takes typically 5-11 days after exposure

\- After symptoms begin 7-14 days is when majority of patients develop severe respiratory complications

\- If infected, shelter in place and attempt to isolate from housemates/wipe down surfaces and faucets daily

\- Stay hydrated; urine should be clear

\- Use tylenol for fever control but limit this to under 4 grams daily

\- Get in contact with your Primary care doctor to be referred to the COVID task response who will monitor symptoms with daily check-ins and provide recommendations for when to go to the hospital

\*\*\* Regardless of positive/negative if you cannot catch your breath while at rest do not wait for your PCP and contact 911

Here is everything Trump said in context of the ""hoax"" comment:

&gt;Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No they can’t. They can’t count their votes.

&gt;One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning, they lost, it’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.

Everything you just referenced in your comment is setting up strawmen and inserting your own subjective opinions and interpretations to make things meet your definition. If you want to defend the idea that he didn't specifically call the virus a hoax - you will need to do so within the context of his words, and not by summoning every piece of partisan nonsense possible to snowplow the argument.

&gt;he said that the Democrats and media’s (apologies for repeating myself) misinformation and sensationalizing was a hoax

&gt;
&gt; (1) the right to enter one state and leave another (an inherent right with historical support from the Articles of Confederation),
&gt;
&gt; (2) the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than a hostile stranger (protected by the ""Privileges and Immunities"" clause in Article IV, § 2), and
&gt;
&gt; (3) (for those who become permanent residents of a state) the right to be treated equally to native-born citizens (this is protected by the 14th Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause; citing the majority opinion in the Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Stevens said, ""the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel."").

i honestly feel like a lot of people have it and are asymptomatic. the virus is a sneaky sob too, and takes about 5 days to start showing mild symptoms and 2 weeks for symptoms to get bad, by that time you've probably infected many other people around you, this is why quarantine and social distancing is important!!

I never got sick, despite being around him a lot, which was weird because I almost always end up catching whatever he has.

I can only conclude that either I got really lucky or I was asymptomatic. I guess I won't know until they start doing serology testing.

Doctors most certainly know. This virus is not unique and operates like every other virus. Viral Immunology is a pretty deep field of study. 

To answer the question, if you get the virus and recover, you now have antibodies to that strain of the virus. So you cannot get infected by that strain again. However, viruses do not stay the same, they mutate over time. This is why you can get the flu multiple times, there is no ""The Flu"" virus, there are zillions of them and new ones are evolving all the time, so your antibodies against a previous infection may not be effective against the new strain. Covid is a slow mutating virus, which is good news since that means antibodies developed after initial infection are likely to be effective for a long time. This is why researchers are harvesting antibodies (they are called monoclonal antibodies)  from recovered patients to give to sick patients.

There are isolated reports of people getting reinfected by coronoavirus. That means they got infected by a different strain, not the same strain twice.",1585660577,fm0l1re

However you don't develop any sort of ""anti virus aura"" or anything. So you can still act as a transmitter via touching surfaces and physical contact. One paper out of Oxford is suggesting that the number of worldwide asymptomatic carriers is massive, people who had covid and recovered and never even knew it. In order for a virus to spread it needs to move, people who feel healthy move around a lot more, so having a very high number of people who recovered from covid without ever even knowing they had it is one possible explanation for the rapid spread of the disease. 

Similarly even if you show no symptoms due to having recovered, you can still shed virus for a few days afterwards. That's why there are 14 day guidelines, most people recover faster than that but can still shed virus for a little time after that.",1585671580,fm13zwo

Let me give you a little lesson. We learn this this in my field. If you want to change behavior, yelling at people and insulting them has the worst possible success rate in the world. 

So if we have an obese patient who has a cardiac event, we don't save their life and then say ""Jesus Christ fatso, why do you keep shoving all this food in your mouth, do you know what kind of medical resources we had to expend to save you? You're an asshole!"" You know why we don't do that? Cause no one responds positively or changes behavior after you insult them. 

That's what you are missing here. You aren't calling people assholes cause you want them to stop what they are doing. You are calling people assholes cause you want to feel sanctimonious. You don't actually care about people not social distancing, if you did you would be trying to effect change, which insulting people absolutely does not do. Your words are entirely self serving.

That's why people in your own post are giving you a hard time. You are insulting anonymous people so you can feel superior to them. Besides being completely ineffective at causing people to change behaviors, it has the added benefit of no one liking you either. 

&gt; Well if I end up in the ER I’ll make sure to bleed a lot on the floor- so that way janitors like you actually have to work and not just stand around. 

I'm an RN in the ER and perform life saving work on a daily basis. I'll put that up against a laid off retail worker any day.

13520,13520,qaxr,"&gt; That's not necessarily a good thing.

It's a very good thing because it drives down mortality rates and drive up recovery rates. DE has 264 cases and 7 deaths so far. That's a 2.6% mortality rate. If that positive test result is accurate for the state at the moment, that means that at an eventual 70% infection rate for the state, that results in over 18,500 deaths. If the models coming out of some studies now are correct they would suggest there is up to a 10x multiplier of asymptomatic cases in a given population. That would mean we have 2640 cases (of which we have only identified 264) and 7 deaths. That's a .026% mortality rate, which in a 70% infection scenario means 1850 deaths. That's over 16,650 less deaths. 

&gt; but the fact that it is so contagious and that the number infected is so big is very bad.

Not if most people are asymptomatic. That would be amazingly positive news since it means the mortality rate is much lower than expected and herd immunity will be achieved even faster. We would see a MUCH quicker drop off of cases since there would be a huge immunity wall the virus would run into of asymptomatic people that have recovered.

&gt;  This ""it's just because we're doing more tests"" way of placating is really bogus in my opinion.

There's nothing being placated here. There is literally nothing that isn't amazingly fantastic about having a large population of asymptomatic infections that self recover. If massive testing was done and discovered that, it would be world changing and hundred of thousands to millions of expected deaths wouldn't occur. Unfortunately we lack the testing capacity to determine that, so we will have to live through it in order to determine where the numbers actually lie.",1585676075,fm1crxm

&gt; If everyone stayed home for 2-3 weeks this would end quicker.

You make zero sense dude. None. The whole fucking point of social distancing is to have LESS cases over a LONGER period of time. If everyone stayed home, this would take LONGER to end. That's the entire point of flattening the curve, stretch this out so it takes longer but you get less peak cases. 

Since it's not working at keeping the peak below capacity, the correct thing is to shorten the time as much as possible which means going back to normal and letting the virus race through the population as fast as possible so it lasts the shortest amount of time

Have everyone on the world forgotten the difference between the concept of stop and slow? No one has immunity to this. You are going to get it. It's just when. Staying inside means you are just going to get it when you go out again. You think in June the virus going to vanish? Lol. You're just choosing to get the viruse when the government tells you to go outside vs today. 

Right now we have the worst of both worlds: overloaded hospitals AND massive economic destruction. Do you think that's the best solution?

Arriving officers found the apartment that was the source of the loud music and made contact with the tenants inside. In addition to two tenants, one of whom is a UD student, there were 18 additional people inside the apartment for a birthday party.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Newark passed an emergency ordinance on March 16 prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people. Delaware Gov. John Carney modified the state of emergency order to also limit gatherings to less than 10 people, effective at 8 p.m., April 2.

“We are deeply disappointed that this small group of students made such reckless and irresponsible choices,” said Adam Cantley, dean of students at the University. “Last week, all students were alerted to the various stay-at-home ordinances from both the city of Newark and the state of Delaware. The University's Office of Student Conduct will take quick and responsive action, given the severity of this incident and would do the same for other incidents in the future.“

The apartment’s two tenants were issued summonses for violating the city of Newark noise ordinance and the city’s emergency gathering ordinance. They were released pending their appearance in court at a later date. All others present in the apartment were advised of the requirements of social distancing.""",1585848928,fm8gekz

Not true at all. Unless you mean literally everyone, which would include every doctor, nurse, police officer, grocery store, cashier, truck driver, government employee, etc. Staying at home

""Flattening the curve"" by staying home actually makes it take LONGER. But the idea is that fewer people are sick at once, and that hospitals will be able to manage the lower number of patients. We are all likely going to be exposed to the virus, it just really a matter of when. And hoping the the hospital isn't flooded with people if you happen to have complications. 

If we just went about our normal lives, it would be over much much quicker, but there would be a lot of deaths. 

The real question is how many lives does all of us staying at home really save? 

If it saves 500,000 lives nationally is it worth it? Absolutely.

But if it only save 50 lives? Probably not. 

So there is some theoretical number of lives that is worth it to do this kind of damage to the economy in the interest of saving the lives of the elderly and immunocompromised. But how many lives is that? I'm sure there's an actuary out there that can tell you the answer.",1585856704,fm8vbs7

He's not wrong, though you could get away with it. If your fiancee is paying taxes and such from your address then she's going to be considered as living in DE. Once you are living in Delaware you have 60 days to register your vehicle. One of the top reasons for insurance fraud is living somewhere other than where your car is registered, it's considered a false registration. Delaware is one of the few states that doesn't really care where your car is registered though, but PA does. Car insurance is priced depending upon where you live so they may be missing out on money which will make them more interested.

Probably not a big issue, my old townhouse neighbor had cars with PA tags, that were 5 years expired, and they lived next to two officers. But now that they're pulling people over for out of state plates, I'd probably look into getting DE tags.",1585917137,fmb3a82

This isn't stopping the virus. As soon as things reopen cases will spike again. Look at China, they had the virus ""beaten"", they relax restrictions, and it spiked again and they had to re-close movie theaters and large gatherings last week. South Korea turned it;s tracking app back on cause cases have popped right back up there now that they relaxed thier measures. 

You need to understand how communicable disease work. Until there's a vaccine, nothing can stop it. By staying inside you're just choosing to get it later vs now. Which makes sense when trying to manage health care resources, but don't pretend like this is saving people from getting infected. They are just going to get infected 6, 8, 12 weeks from now. Until there is a vaccine, or some miracle drug treatment, nothing can stop a virus until it runs through the population and enough people recover to develop herd immunity. 

This has fuck all to do with Trump to, btw.

14461,14461,HelpfulMenu,"Looks like they realized they were on some sketchy footing and started scaling things back. I've been doing some reading on this ever since Carney started putting out these orders. It's a tricky situation. The National Governers Association did a fairly in depth study on the legalities  of suspending rights during a declared emergency (which DE is in).

https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/An-Assessment-of-State-Laws-Providing-Gubernatorial-Authority-to-Remove-Legal-Barriers-to-Emergency-Response.pdf

From that paper, it says Delaware law gives the governor broad power to suspend or modify statues and regulations (this is the most expansive category in the article). So in a legal sense, Carney has the authority to pretty much suspend or modify any state law or regulation he wants, as long as Delaware is in a state of emergency. If that state of emergency ends, he loses that power. The interesting part is at the end of the article, it states (emphasis mine)

&gt; ""it is important to note that gubernatorial ‘‘waiver authority is triggered only pursuant
to a formal declaration of emergency’’ subject to expiration and ratification requirements under state law, and that **changing state law during an emergency does not affect ‘‘[f]ederal and state constitutional protections** [and o]ther federal legal protections (e.g., Americans with Disabilities Act).’’

So Carney can change state laws but cannot infringe on constitutional rights at the state or Federal level. 

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law, the U.S. Supreme Court has broadly interpreted that the right to travel is a federal right, part of the liberty of which a citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Privileges and Immunities clause of the US Constitution. In the case of Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999) Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, held that the United States Constitution protected three separate aspects of the right to travel among the states:


* (1) the right to enter one state and leave another (an inherent right with historical support from the Articles of Confederation),

* (2) the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than a hostile stranger (protected by the ""Privileges and Immunities"" clause in Article IV, § 2), and

* (3) (for those who become permanent residents of a state) the right to be treated equally to native-born citizens (this is protected by the 14th Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause; citing the majority opinion in the Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Stevens said, ""the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel.""). 


On the face of it Carneys order would seem to certainly violate section 1 and possible violate section 2 of that interpretation of Federal law. They might try the argument that they are not restricting movement since you are allowed to enter but then need to quarantine for 14 days, who knows if that would hold up in court. 

Also, the NGA study states ""Regardless of whether a state falls within the 35 states that can change statutes and regulations, or the 7 states that can change only regulations, anticipating the practical challenges of implementing an altered legal structure and addressing fears related to government over-reach may be crucial to the successful removal of legal barriers in an emergency response.""

14467,14467,HelpfulMenu,"This might be starting to enter some shaky legal ground for Carney. The governor cannot override federal rights even during a declared emergency. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits any legislation that would abridge the right of the people to assemble peaceably.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution makes this prohibition applicable to state governments.

That said, state governments can restrict the time, place, and manner of assembly so long as they ""are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech...are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and...leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information."" as mentioned in Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781 (1989). Usually this takes the place of require a permit to assemble. 

Now for a party among some college students, they could have just broken it up in violation of a noise ordinance or something. But what if folks wanted to peaceably assemble to petition the state government and violate ""social distancing"" orders by doing so? Carney cannot infringe of Federal First Amendment rights and break it up. It's a very slippery slope they are going down with this stuff.

But that would seem to me to be a clear violation of the second guideline of the federal right to free travel between the states (not being treated as a hostile person) and a violation of federal law. I'm not a Supreme court justice but this whole thing Carney is doing seems to be getting into some real sketchy legal footing. If it was just a ""guideline"", that's one thing, but once you send the police out to enforce it, it becomes a whole other thing and can get real slippery real quick.  For example, what if someone wanted to come to DE but could not afford a place to quarantine or have a place to stay? That requirement would then clearly create an undue burden on that persons right to travel between states and be pretty clearly a violation of their rights under the constitution. If the state provided accommodations or reimbursement, maybe that would cover that, but I don't see any mention of that in Carneys order. 

&gt; I would imagine an argument could be made that constitutional rights have limitations

Well, those limitations would need to be enumerated at the Federal level. And I'm not sure I would use the Second Amendment as a shining example of how states can effectively regulate Constitutional rights on their own, since those restrictions get challenged in court all the time. 

If anything the Supreme Court has shown a strong reluctance to allow States the ability to modify Federal law through State Executive Action, one example off the top of my head are the various state governors trying to restrict abortion law beyond the limits of Federal statute and getting struck down in court over and over.",1585950452,fmcpvts

&gt; Self-quarantine requires that an individual stay in a quarantine location (home, hotel room or rented lodging); does not go to work, school or public areas; does not use public transportation; separates from other individuals in a residence as much as possible; and avoids sharing personal items.

So, under that definition, your SO could possibly come to your house and choose to self quarantine there, as long as they ""separates from other individuals in a residence as much as possible; and avoids sharing personal items"" and then leaves the state the next day. There is no restriction on you staying in PA and coming back.

The U.S. Supreme Court has broadly interpreted that the right to travel is a federal right, part of the liberty of which a citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Privileges and Immunities clause of the US Constitution. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law

You can try and claim that in a time of crisis all rights are subject to suspension. I would argue that times of crisis are the absolute most important time ever to make sure laws and rights are observed and protected. If not we are only ever one ""emergency"" (real or manufactured) away from forcefully becoming an authoritarian dictatorship. That's way more of a nightmare than anything a virus can do.",1585956840,fmd0tg5
14510,14510,WikiTextBot,"**Freedom of movement under United States law**

Freedom of movement under United States law is governed primarily by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution which states, ""The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."" Since the circuit court ruling in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right.

&gt; Freedom of movement under United States law is governed primarily by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution which states, ""The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."" Since the circuit court ruling in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right.

Governments cannot suspend constitutional rights via emergency declaration. Cuomo is already getting sued over this in NY, diBlasio is already getting sued for this in NYC, get ready for the lawsuits against Carney to come in. 

It's such a dumb move. It does nothing to stop DE residents from going out of state and coming back in, it puts police at risk by increasing traffic stops and interacting with the public a ton of people are exempted from the rule and are traveling back and forth every single day anyway, it creates lots of hardship to people living near the border, and it's on incredibly shaky legal group and will trigger lawsuits they need to spend taxpayer dollars to defend. That is way more than enough reasons for this to be considered an awful idea.

&gt;The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which has dealt with by far more COVID-19 cases than any other agency, says that COVID-19 transmission occurs primarily by respiratory droplets and close contact, with the ""possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long time exposure to high concentrations of aerosols.""   
&gt;  
&gt;Data are thus only somewhat suggestive of contact as a mode of transmission for COVID-19 in community settings and align with CDC advice that it is not the most important mode.

14816,14816,amcarneval,"Hmm I think you’d find its different from Brooklyn in a couple key ways: less dining out options, less people/noise, and nicer people.

Dining out: Wilmington and the surrounding areas have gained many new restaurants in the past couple years. Most if not all are great! However, the 30 or so great restaurants I’ve tried in my 1.5 years living here are no match for what is at your fingertips in NYC! There are great options here, but you will have to get used to 1-3 great pizza restaurants within 10 min of you instead of maybe 5-10?
Some of my favorites: Wilmington Brew Works, Stitch House Brewery, La Pizzeria Metro, V Trap Kitchen (vegan), Green Box Kitchen (vegan), Legal Grounds Coffee, Barroja, Trolley Square Oyster House, Farmer and the Cow, Del Pez, Ciro Food and Drink, Mrs. Robino’s, El Diablo Burritos, Mikimotos, Takumi, Washington Street Ale House, Torbert Street Social, Kid Shelleens. Ice Cream at Woodside Farm Creamery
^^Mostly in Wilmington. This is just a start. Newark is a college town but is near Christiana Mall also...there are some well known chains around the mall, but also more locally owned restaurants in downtown Newark!

Things to do in the area (I’ve done most of them and would definitely recommend!!)
Walk around brandywine River/Alapocas park! And Trolley Square neighborhood. The art museum near there is cool if you are into art. Check out potential shows at The Queen or The Grand. Local history at Nemours, Hagley, Winterthur, three DuPont houses. Walk or bike trail from environmental center at the riverfront down to old new castle. New Castle is cool to visit because of all the old architecture and houses!

Less Noise but nicer People: I moved to the Philly area in 2014. I didn’t speak to my neighbors until I bought a house in Wilmington in 2018!! I live in the neighborhood near Salesianum School, and have heard similar things from my neighbors. That being said, there are definitely a lot of families around. If you’re looking to date or meet someone or meet new friends, id definitely recommend living closer to where the crowds gather. That will generally be Trolley Square and the Riverfront (the apartments near Del Pez, Iron Hill Brewery, and Penn Cinema at the Riverfront). Those areas are also going to be slightly louder with more foot and vehicle traffic, which is probably more what you’re used to in Brooklyn! 

If I had a vote, I’d say give Wilmington a chance because it’s one of the best kept secrets in the northeast! All the things it has to offer, in addition to being around 40 min to Philly with even more options, AND the Delaware beaches.",1586046067,fmgcnbd

Like another poster said, none of them have a particularly cool vibe about them, but they are also in the middle of chain restaurants and strip malls. Being close to a mall will do that. However, there’s nothing wrong with that! I personally really like the New Castle area. You’ll have to drive to get most places for grocery shopping and other restaurants, but Old New Castle has so much history and character! The other options seem okay and are in okay areas, they just don’t generally really have “fun” things to do nearby unless you drive. 

If you were interested in Wilmington and wanted an apartment complex, I’d check out the apartments at the Riverfront near Iron Hill Brewery. I can’t speak to their price, but you’ll have parking around, and more of a vibe :)

Other safe Wilmington neighborhoods that don’t have great parking options are: the Triangle, Trolley Square/Highlands/Forty Acres. You may be able to find smaller apartment complexes in these neighborhoods or some with driveways for your guest parking.

Disinfecting wipes. I walked by 6 wipes along a four mile trail in Judge Morris today. Is someone sanitizing trees? Along with toilet paper, tissue, plastic gloves, or masks, these things are highly unsanitary and pose a risk to anyone picking them up.

And though I'm happy to see people finally going to parks, those ironic plastic spring water bottles and ""Nature Valley"" granola and health bar wrappers these last couple weeks is driving me crazy. 

Also. Someone left a black bag of dog shit on the trail last week. Don't worry, I got it. And I understand, it happens. For those of you who are tempted to leave your bag of dog shit in the nook of a tree or by the giant sign you think you're going to pass on your way out, DON'T! Because you will forget it. When I walk my friend's dog, I make sure she shits before the trail. That's how you do it.

My next question was going to be if those were mostly chains but it sounds like there's a really good variety of restaurants.  I'm not a foodie or anything, but it's really nice to have many different ethnic options and it sounds like you have many options as well.  Thanks for writing all of this out.  I probably could have used google map &amp; scrolled over - which I'll probably do anyway - but an endorsement for so many places is much more valuable than just knowing they exist.  


&gt;  Things to do in the area

Thanks for this too.  I guess I was mostly concerned about the neighborhood shutting down at 9:00 PM &amp; couldn't put it into words.  I work a lot so realistically there's only so much time to explore.  But knowing that is an option is great.

As I'm reading, I'm thinking *No no, avoid the neighbors.  What's this guy saying?*  I have a typical Brooklyn attitude about this.  I moved to my current apartment 2 years ago &amp; don't know any of my neighbors.  I brag about this as a win because it also means there was no issue where I had to confront them. I suppose if I were to live somewhere else, the goal would be to befriend my neighbors, but it's kind of funny that it's counterintuitive to me.  :)

Think of it like if you let a friend borrow your car- while they may not be on the plan they are still covered as they have permission to use the car (so technically any costs or rate increases from an accident will go to the person insured aka primary driver)

However- if some one is regularly using a car they should have a card with their name as an approved driver. 

When I was in HS I was insured and listed as the primary driver on an old 1980’s junker since insurance would be cheaper- however I was an approved driver on “my” car.

-no sales tax
-no car tax
-low property taxes
-general cost of living is low
-Close to PA
-Beaches

Cons:
-No real culture here 
-finding a great restaurant here is not always easy to come by, whereas in Brooklyn amazing food is the norm 
-Shopping is generally at malls
-Public transportation might as well be nonexistent
-Flat and ugly

And regarding the crime in another post...Yes there is crime, shootings, killings, car theft, robbery etc....theft off porches and people walking around checking door handles, but that is everywhere. You don’t go to a bar in X location because you know it’s a rough area. And you don’t walk around with headphones at night or unaware of your surroundings.

&gt; Delaware is a purple state which works for me

It's not really. It's deep blue up north and deep red down south. And both areas dislike each other. Since almost everyone in the state lives up north, the politics is extremely blue. The Delaware Democratic Machine is omnipresent in state and local politics. 

&gt; Wilmington seems to be a big enough city that I won't feel weird being out of my element

Wilmingtons not your typical city. There are a lot of low income dangerous areas where people live, and a large business district where people work. Thing is that business district turns into a ghost town at 5:00. No one with the means to leave the city choose to live there, people drive in, go to work, and then leave. There's a reason so much of North Wilmington is sprawling suburbs. That's where people go to live. 

&gt;  That said, I'm in my 30s and single &amp; my perception of Delaware is just families. 

You will be bored out of your mind here. There is no nightlife that compares in any way to NYC. You have a few bars that cater to locals, and that's it. You could visit all of them in one week and have exhausted the nightlife in the area. 

&gt; Also, I don't know if Delaware is as culturally different from New York as I grew up believing. 

DE has no culture. That's it's culture. You are too close to Philly to attract any ""lifestyle investment"". There's no reason for a business owner or entrepreneur to invest in bars, clubs, and nightlife in Wilmington with it's 70k population when you can drive 40 minutes away and be in Philly with its 1.5 million population. The whole point of DE is that it's a nice place to live with low property taxes, lots of mostly quiet suburbs to chose from, no sales tax, and easy transportation to everything else. 

Come down for a week. I'll bet you $5 that after the 3rd day you're be on the road heading back to NYC bored out of your mind.",1586103640,fmi6w3x

&gt; It's deep blue up north and deep red down south. And both areas dislike each other

So long as I live in the blue part, this would be pretty much good with me.  

&gt;  dangerous areas where people live, and a large business district where people work. Thing is that business district turns into a ghost town at 5:00. No one with the means to leave the city choose to live there, people drive in, go to work, and then leave

I guess this is the red flag I came to ask about.  Though I am kind of sorry that I found it.  Feeling safe is a big deal &amp; being surrounded by like-minded people is a big deal.  

&gt;  You have a few bars that cater to locals, and that's it. You could visit all of them in one week and have exhausted the nightlife in the area.

Again, the red flag I wanted to know about.  I don't really aim to compare the two &amp; want to enjoy each for being its own thing.  But even if I drank every night, it would take me ~25 years to visit every one of the 10K bars in NYC &amp; by then 80% of those would have been replaced by new ones.  One week (or even a month) of unique opportunities do detract from the opportunity.  So, I guess I'm glad you told me. 

&gt;  DE has no culture. That's it's culture. You are too close to Philly to attract any ""lifestyle investment"". There's no reason for a business owner or entrepreneur to invest in bars, clubs, and nightlife in Wilmington with it's 70k population when you can drive 40 minutes away and be in Philly with its 1.5 million population.

Can you clarify the point?  I get that when people say ""no culture"" they may mean fewer museums or investment in arts.  But surely people have to do something other than eat and drink.  Bowling, billiards, ice skating rinks, martial arts schools, gyms, music festivals, wine tastings, etc.  I have to imagine that these are popular things here too &amp; that separate from raising families, that people do interesting things &amp; meet each other somehow.  No? 

&gt; I like to describe Delaware as ""the Olive Garden of states"". There's nothing wrong with Olive Garden, it's perfectly serviceable

I have to admit that when I came to this sentence it was pretty much the coup de grâce of the conversation.  So perfectly succinct that I got the message immediately.  I do appreciate you putting all of this into words.  I will most definitely spend a few weekends there at an AirBNB or two just to see what it could be like.

No? 

It's not that there's ""nothing"" to do, there's just not a lot and not a lot of variety. You'll see people here say ""Sure, there's LOTS to do in Wilmington!"" and rattle off 10-12 suggestions. What you don't realize is that's pretty much the totality of it. You could burn through all the bars and restaurants and activities in a month or so and then that's it. You've done it all. In NYC you could go to a different bar/restaurant every night of the week and it would be decades to try and get to them all. In Wilmington you could so it all in a month or two. 

Is there bowling? Sure, there's like 2 bowling alleys around. Billiards? Yeah there's 1 pool hall. Martial Arts schools? Sure, 3-4 maybe. Music festivals? Wine tasting? LOL

Here's all you need to do. Do a Google search of something to do (billiards) in Wilmington, DE and click the ""More places"" link in the Google results. This brings up a map with pins of all the places. Then do the same for NYC. You'll quickly see the difference.",1586108912,fmig5tw

15009,15009,CumularLimit,"I lived in NYC for a few years (and a few other major cities) and have also lived in Wilmington, I liked Wilmington.

As you pointed out above, you’re not going to out New York New York. But it also depends on your priorities, Delaware and Wilmington are much calmer than NYC (and as pointed out cheaper). When I was in my early 20s I loved the city life, but once I grew out of the going out every gift bar thing I came to really appreciate not being in the city all the time, especially once you start working 45-50 hours a week and less down time.

I lived downtown Wilmington, near where the corporate offices are, and liked it. Market street has a few good restaurants and bars, a pharmacy within walking distance, some theaters that actually bring in some decent shows and lectures from time to time (obviously nothing like New York though).  Wilmington’s most popular areas are for living are arguably trolley square and the riverfront, both are nice, but again I preferred downtown because it had a lot of business options within walking distance and I liked being near the high rises and Rodney square (park). 

Wilmington’s other big plus is that it has an Amtrak station on the northeast corridor, so you can be in NYC or DC in about an hour and a half if you really want to see a show, go to a museum, etc. Philadelphia is only about a 30 minute drive (or you can also take SELTA from Wilmington station).

Delaware beaches are nice, Wilmington is about an hour and a half drive from the beaches, so in the summer you also have that option too.

It depends on what you’re looking for, Wilmington can’t compete with major cities for attractions and things to do, but it has a few things to keep you entertained in general and is close enough to other major cities that you can easily head to one of them on the weekends for a restaurant or museum.",1586109744,fmihmji

* Christiana Meadows (Christiana DE)
It’s a bit of a tougher crowd in this area. Lots of shopping centers and gas stations. Not a lot of green/landscaping/scenery or pedestrian friendly. 

* School Bell (Bear DE)
Same as Christiana meadows 

* Rockwood (Bear DE)
Strongly advise you stay away from this area. Lots of mobile home neighborhoods, gold for cash now stores, liquor stores, etc.

* Helm at Deemer's Landing (New Castle DE)
Not very familiar with this particular area but new castle itself has a bit of a rougher crowd. Good people but also has its fair share of crime.  

* Reserve at Forest Gate (Newark DE)
Absolutely not. You can’t walk anywhere and you wouldn’t want to anyway, if you know what I mean. 

* Pike Creek (Pike Creek DE)
Not bad but not really near anything. There are parks and there’s a main road that has the necessities but there’s not a true community social life. 

I recommend you look at Colonial Gardens (Newark, DE)
It’s at the very beginning of Main Street, which is the Main Street of UD, which is a big plus for walking around.  Also a perk is that it’s in the beginning, because since Main Street is undergoing serious construction right now and is frustrating to drive through, you’ll be able to exit onto Cleveland avenue and avoid much of the surrounding chaos. Oh, big note, *its only a 10 minute drive away from the Christiana hospital.* 

A friend of mine lived here and it’s a good place. I would stay here. UD students usually are a majority of those who rent here. It’s the kind of place where your only gripes are the routine kind.

The Department’s Employment and Training Administration will continue to assist any states seeking assistance in implementing these flexibilities.""

https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20200312-0

Delaware could be different since they are allowing some flexibility in how states implement this, but nothing in Delaware's FAQs suggest that they would not follow DOL's guidelines. I think this is a case of DE's wording being too vague. I'm just having a really hard time believing they would decide to accept people who are still being paid by their workplace when the DOL specifically states otherwise. If you've spoken directly with DE's unemployment office and were told otherwise, however, I'm more than happy to concede the point.

I'll post it again for you:

&gt; Am I eligible for Unemployment Insurance if I am quarantined due to COVID-19?
&gt; Yes. If you are employed but have been directed by a health care provider or public official to isolate or quarantine you are eligible for unemployment benefits. Delaware emergency rules waive the requirement to be able and available for work during the State of Emergency if the reason is a result of COVID-19.

It's specifically if you are employed. If you're out on Sick Leave, which is now mandated for small businesses for 14 days (for COVID-19), then you are still employed and you're also (according to Delaware UI) ""eligible for unemployment benefits"".

It's not cut and dried at all. Nowhere in there does it say sick leave, which is not equivalent to being quarantined. The previous stimulus bill does not include any company with over 500 employees. Businesses with under 50 employees can have the requirement waived. This includes a large portion of businesses.

So none of what you said is true. 

&gt; On March 18, 2020, President Trump signed into law the FFCRA, which creates two new emergency paid leave requirements in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Division E of the FFCRA, “The Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act” (EPSLA), entitles certain employees to take up to two weeks of paid sick leave.

&gt; In general, the FFCRA requires covered employers to provide eligible employees up to two weeks of paid sick leave at full pay, up to a specified cap, when the employee is unable to work because the employee is subject to a Federal, State, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19, has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19, or is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis. 

As you can read above, if you're sick with COVID-19 then you have to quarantine if a doctor tells you to. If you're quarantined, and work for a small business, then the small business is required to pay you up to 80 Hours Paid Sick leave. There is no skirting this, as it's now law. As of April 1st all small businesses were required to inform their employees and print the DOL poster to be visible to all employees in the same spot that the DOL Employee rights poster is made available. 
&gt; https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/ffcra-employer-paid-leave


&gt; Private employers with fewer than 500 employees must comply with the EFMLEA, although the Secretary has the authority to exempt by rulemaking employers with fewer than 50 employees from EFMLEA's requirements when compliance with the EFMLEA would “jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern.”

In Government speak, this means you have to adhere to it unless you can somehow get an audience with the Secretary of Labor about your small business (no chance).

Here's the poster: 
&gt; https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/posters/FFCRA_Poster_WH1422_Non-Federal.pdf


I get what you're trying to do, but realize that you're downvoting facts about this because you believe it should be otherwise. I originally expressed dissatisfaction with the CARES act because it mandated Sick Leave, extensive sick-leave if you read the Act, but it had no compensation for small businesses. Asking a small business to pay up to 12 weeks of employees wages while they're not at work simply isn't feasible for small businesses. This was finally amended when the small business Payroll Protection Plan was pushed through to give businessses full forgiveness of payroll wages instead of just forgiveness for payroll taxes.

It is definitely different and potentially slower than Brooklyn (depending on where you live in the borough). I wouldn't pass that as being a bad thing. 

The food options are great (not quite as readily available as NYC) you may have to drive a little to get the food you're craving, earlier close hours, etc. but they are still there. You'll find your favorite places and there's plenty of local eateries and breweries and plenty that are within a 20 minute trip, given you have a car. Another point to make is that Brooklyn obviously has much better public transportation if that's something that's important to you. 

If you move to Trolley or the Riverfront you will find a little more noise but also more nature than you would find it Brooklyn including trails along the Brandywine and Christiana River and plenty of state parks a short drive away. Both Trolley and the Riverfront are great for young professionals. 

IMO, Wilmington could be considered a small Brooklyn with a more cozy, small town vibe.

&gt;  Wilmington’s most popular areas are for living are arguably trolley square and the riverfront, both are nice, but again I preferred downtown because it had a lot of business options within walking distance and I liked being near the high rises and Rodney square (park).

See, those words: *walking distance*.  I think I am realizing things I want as I read through these comments.  It's strange to me that not everyone measures things in walking distance but most of the country does not.  I now know that is a priority for me. 

&gt;  Wilmington’s other big plus is that it has an Amtrak station on the northeast corridor, so you can be in NYC or DC in about an hour and a half if you really want to see a show, go to a museum, etc.

I didn't even think of this!  I just figured I'd drive, but the MTA has made me an Olympic-level-train-napper.  I seriously would have gotten a gold medal if this was an actual Olympic event.  Knowing that I'm a 1:30 nap away from the city makes this a little less concerned. 

&gt;  It depends on what you’re looking for, Wilmington can’t compete with major cities for attractions and things to do, but it has a few things to keep you entertained in general and is close enough to other major cities that you can easily head to one of them on the weekends for a restaurant or museum.

I still have a stash of elastic left for masks that these would be helpful to have, but I don't expect you to ship them. Do you have any contacts in this area? I know my husband has wanted to get a 3D printer so if this is something we can do ourselves, we can explore that option, too. It'll be faster than sewing buttons on ribbon (one of those hacks I saw online that can serve the same purpose.) Thank you so much!

If the day after the CDC says ""look life is gonna change for a bit due to the severity of this virus"" and Trump says ""it's gonna go away soon, we only have 15 people infected"", how is that him taking it seriously? 

Daily life wouldn't change nation-wide because of 16 sick people.

Really? 

From https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/mar/20/how-donald-trump-responded-coronavirus-pandemic/

* Jan 29: The White House forms a coronavirus response task force, initially led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.

* Jan. 30: Trump blocks travel from China.

* Feb. 24: Trump asks for $1.25 billion in emergency aid.

* Feb. 29: Trump moves FDA to ease guidelines to speed the broader use of testing.

* March 11: Trump uses a prime-time Oval Office address to announce a ban on travel for non-Americans from most of Europe.

* March 13: Trump declares a national emergency to access $50 billion for states and territories, and clear the way for fast-track waivers for hospitals and doctors as they respond to the virus.

Trump was informed of the virus on Dec 31.  He was warned again, TWICE in early January.  In late January, 4 Republicans sold millions in stock right after their briefings.    Trump did NOT block all travel from China in Jan, but that doesn't matter either way because the virus was ALREADY HERE, and in most other countries.

Trump continued to say EVERY time asked that it was ""A HOAX"", and there would be ""ZERO CASES IN THE US"" and it ""WOULD GO AWAY LIKE A MIRACLE"" through mid-March, and the idiots on Fox News backed that up.

Funny how all of this is MISSING from your ""timeline""?  You know what else is missing?  GOLF every weekend, and CAMPAIGN RALLIES every week.   What  kind an an idiot would do that?  An idiot named Donald Trump did.

Link: http://fb.com/HotBreakfastRocks 

I say ""they,"" but it's really ""we."" :-)

We play three songs: we get in, we get out, you get on with your day. 

Everyone needs a coffee break, whether you're working, not working, homeschooling your kids, or anxiety-scrolling through your phone 19 hours a day from bed. So pour yourself a cup of coffee (we do shots on Fridays!) and join other folks. The banter in the chat window is friendly, snarky and fun. 


It's free! We don't ask for money or anything... we're just trying to spread some good cheer, make dumb jokes, sing originals and covers, and help people feel a little less isolated. We've been doing this since March 30th and plan on going until May 15th. 

Our genre of music is ""dork-rock,"" which means our songs are usually funny,  socially-awkward, or kinda wise-assy. If you like They Might Be Giants, Jonathan Coulton, The Dead Milkmen, Tenacious D, Barenaked Ladies... you'll dig it. We always play one cover tune, too.

I think you're blinded by your party if you think it's a guarantee. As someone that has never voted the same party in two consecutive elections, I don't think Biden has a remote shot. People forget that Trump won while running on a platform of 'anti-government'. That brings out a lot of voters and even swayed people on the otherside of political spectrum who were tired of the DNC ripping itself to shreds. That hasn't changed and if anything I think the Democrats in general are more disliked now than they were 4 years ago. I think the DNC is doing the same thing they did in 2016, where the argument was 'Bernie is too old and senile' to possibly win the election. Now it's 'Biden isn't hated nearly as much as Hillary, this should be an easy win'.

But I think people severely underestimate how much the typical voter disdains politicians like Biden. He comes across as smug and arrogant, but not in the way of Trump who believes he's always right, more in the vein of a top banker who doesn't care what you have to say. That's not that far off from what the voters thought of Hillary.

I think once again the DNC made a huge mistake passing on Bernie. I think he would of obviously won debates against Trump, his ideas would take hold when the target is the Republicans, and I think he had the only chance to unite the Democrat's base. I think Biden is hated by a lot of the left, they think he's too moderate, he's too corporate, and they believe he's the Democrats version of Donald Trump in persona and charisma. 

Instead of directing their own campaign, supporting the issues with Bernie and changing the direction of the political landscape, instead they're trying to once again replicate the Republican's strategy using Biden instead of Clinton.

People may dislike Trump, but hardly anyone *likes* Biden. I feel this is a repeat of 2016 and I think Trump even wins by a larger margin than in 2016.",1586430483,fmvtny2

1268,1268,x888x,"Well here's the difference. Read the full model documentation and methodology and then come back and we can have a discussion. Social distancing is one variable in the model. It mainly drives **timing**, not the actual magnitude.  4 days ago it had 90,000 US deaths. Yesterday's update pushed it to 60,000. Social distancing measures haven't changed in the last 3 days. All the other variables and daily data has. Furthermore you can go state by state and see which states have what measures. Not every state has a start at home order. And even more haven't shuttered non-essential businesses.

The fact that my post is so downvoted and yours is up only serves as one more data point that most people have no clue. 

Social distancing s goal is to flatten the curve. It's a timing variable. It has very little to do with magnitude. Flatten the curve means that instead of having 50,000 people die in 60-90 days you stretch it to 180 days by ""slowing the spread"" to alleviate pressure on the healthcare system.  But if the model was predicting a million deaths and now it predicted 50,000, that's a model error completely independent of social distancing.",1586450392,fmwotl9

1282,1282,x888x,"All you had to do was ask.  Singapore did well. They never closed schools. Australia is doing well and they never closed schools.  The CDC guidelines never recommended widespread school closures. They recommended closing in cases where there are several outbreaks, cleaning the school and reopening. The same way we do with severe flu outbreaks. There is no data to support that closing schools is effective at slowing spread. In many cases it's counterproductive.  Let's look at UD. The day after they had 4 confirmed cases they sent all the students home instead of keeping them on campus. If 4 tested positive, it means that dozens of students were currently carrying the virus due to either bring symptomatic or not yet having symptoms (incubation period). So now... They're sending these cases all over the east coast. They're also bringing things of family members to Newark to move out their kids. Parents that eat at restaurants and stay in hotels. Students far away now have to travel through airports. 

Please explain to me how that helps slow the spread? It has a huge cost, no benefit and is counterproductive. 

Widespread testing, preventing mass gatherings, travel restrictions, smart social distancing, and more can all be done without lockdowns and be almost as effective, with a much lower cost. Effective social distancing can still be done with the majority of people going to work and school. At work it means to business travel or conferences. Employees eat at their desk instead of a cafeteria. Meetings are held virtually or on the phone. Employees that are at risk or that can work remotely do so. Similar for schools. No sports or extra curriculars. Don't have students switch classrooms.  Etc.

Suicide, overdoses, increased alcohol abuse. And... Stress. Stress is a giant contributing factor. Uptick in cardiac deaths. Heart disease is the number one killer. There's a trade-off.


The other thing is people greatly overestimate what we can actually do for people. Ventilators aren't a magic solution. 75% of people that go on them (from all causes) die anyway. 


So in an absolute crunch (which have happened in the US), if you're forced to allocate ventilators it's pretty simple for doctors to differentiate between the cases where they are simply delaying the inevitable vs the cases where it might actually be effective.

We stepped off the trail when others passed and turned our backs to them to give them space, which no one else did for us. After about ten minutes and stepping off the trail at least 5 times for people, we called it quits when two children came zigzagging down the trail at us while their parents casually walked with their dogs behind them.

Right now, my guys are already required to wear masks and gloves.  And as a restaurant owner, especially in Delaware,  we have zero guidance from the health department.   We can't stand near you but we can make food going directly into your mouth? I'm making decisions based on other countries with better guidance.

Hopefully,  we will be ready for your wedding in 2021.  But, this isn't going to be guaranteed.   Here's some advice from a former cater and current restaurant owner here in DE. 

I urge you to get additional verbiage in all your contacts.  You need to ensure they are taking precautions for cleaning and to protect you and your wedding party.  And if they have an illness and have to be closed during your wedding,  who is helping them cover?  Same for all vendors florist, seamstress,  everyone. 

Deposits and Returns-  You will want to push giving anyone money.  You want to make sure you can get refunds if your have to cancel for Coronavirus.   Insurance companies are still about three to four months out on how they are handling this stuff.  Keep informed so you do get taken advantage of.  

Most forecasts show periods of lockdown over the next two years.  They are planning for two additional lockdown between now and vaccine.  This means that your wedding could be planning in a lockdown period. 

Food - we are going to have food distribution issues and liquor prices are expected to inflate. Heck, everything is going to be a bit wonky.  

I hate being negative but I want you to have an honest overview of what you are going to be planning.  I don't want you getting ripped off or anyone getting sick because the venue didn't treat the furniture between events or the line cook was a asymptomatic spreader.  

In a positive note, congratulations on your engagement.   Weddings are exciting and a ton of fun.  I hope you have the wedding of your dreams.  Plan for the worst and the best possible outcome will be guaranteed.   Stay safe.",1586542630,fn0imxx

Delaware traffic is nothing compared to city traffic but it’s up to you how much of a commute you’re okay with, also summer beach traffic can really mess that up, especially  on fridays. There’s only one real highway south to north for the state, so it can get messy in the summer. 

Delaware is a nice place to raise kids, I was lucky to grow up near the beach so I had a very outdoorsy upbringing, I always tell people who ask about moving here that you won’t get the same amenities as the city but it’s deff got its pros, and you’re also close enough to DC, NYC and Philly that you can be back in a major city within a an hour or two if you want to go to a museum, see a show or whatever.

I've got bad news for you, dipshit, they absolutely are.  


First, you're gonna say that it's freedom of assembly/First Amendment. Look at the text of that amendment. It says ""Congress shall not"" and says nothing about a state government. Framers wouldn't have given a shit about states enacting their local orders because the First Amendment wasn't incorporated against the states until the 14th Amendment passed in the late 1800s.

Also, look at the 10th amendment. It specifically says that the powers not reserved by Congress in the Constitution are reserved by the state and the people. Congress did not assert a police power for quarantines until much later in our national history and still give states wide latitude to assert those police powers. 

The Founding Fathers themselves had quarantines and bans on movement during viruses, too, you dickbrain. Check out the Yellow Fever epidemic of 1793, which happened RIGHT UP THE ROAD IN PHILLY. Bans on travel and importation of goods.

Flattening the curve is in reference to MEDICAL RESOURCE CAPACITY. NOT CASES. Jesus Christ, this has been repeated in this sub like 100 times and you still don't get? Let me try AGAIN to spell it out for you

There is no immunity to covid-19. You cannot stop it. Almost everyone is going to get it. If we all got it at once, the DEMAND for medical resources would exceed supply. So we are trying to flatten the curve OF THE MEDICAL DEMAND so it stays BELOW THE MEDICAL SUPPLY. You are NOT trying to ""lower the number of cases"" because that is impossible. 

https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/delaware is the IMHE model of MEDICAL RESOURCE DEMAND. DE reached the peak 4 days ago and has been on the decline since. 

Your chart shows nothing even remotely relevant to anything. It's a count of numbers we can't do anything about. You can't stop people getting the virus, but if you flatten the curve of the MEDICAL DEMAND, then out MEDICAL SUPPLY can handle the crisis.

12,000 americans didn't die in a fire.  Why are you bringing that up?  It's a bad analogy and does not fit with the rest of your argument.

It is possible to discuss things like this in an abstract way.  It's what our scientists, medical professionals, and leaders do.  It's how we find out if we're getting over this virus, if it's getting worse or better.

It's required to make rational decisions about things that would otherwise overwhelm us emotionally.

Why does my comparison of our country's response to other countries' responses bother you so much?  It's not like my words are lessening or worsening the actual impact.

It is my goal to put things into perspective.  Things are bad.  They are bad everywhere.  Why can we not look at places where things are less bad and try to implement their strategies for lessening the badness we have here?  In order to do that you have to make comparisons.

Look at this way: We are on a ship. That ship is sinking. The ship itself doesn't have enough life boats to carry everyone, but there are more on the way. So if everyone pitches in and bails out water to slow the rate the ship is sinking, we can buy time for the additional life boats to show up and can avoid anyone dying due to their not having enough life boats. What we CAN'T do is stop the water flowing in or save the ship. You are complaining that the ship is continuing to take on water and sink so we are failing. But saving the ship was never the goal, because that's impossible. What we are doing is making sure we stall for enough lifeboats to show up so no one dies due to lack of a lifeboat.

Where do i state my data is complete. 

All of my math is based off of Delawares current *running* numbers. 

You could choose just not to read current preliminary reports. And wait for the whole thing to end. I believe this information is beneficial because we can look at how many tests are being issued daily and how much of Delaware's population is being tested. All this preliminary data I personally think is fascinating to see how my state is handling this virus and how well our medical system is holding up. This data can be useful to ask why we are testing only a certain amount of people a day. We can be worried if hospitalizations go over bed count. We can be relieved when our recoveries are higher then average etc.

At the end of the day this is all preliminary daily data. The daily data is incomplete because we aren't tracking properly. Our government doesn't tell us who is in self quarantine and those who successfully do that aren't being added to the recoverys number it is a good question. YOU should totally be raising that question to our government why they don't track those numbers to make the data more whole. Maybe we only know about 449 people of the 1625 positive cases because the other 1176 had minor symptoms and are self isolating. Maybe not that is something you should be asking our government.

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/02/826105278/ventilators-are-no-panacea-for-critically-ill-covid-19-patients

I was mistaken in my first point, by not pointing out duration. It's 5 days. After that, your survival rate drops from 50%. And it isn't linear. At 7 days it drops to 13% survival. Yet people are routinely kept on for 14-20 days because of end of life mandates. 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8989172/

&gt;All the early research suggests that once coronavirus patients are placed on a ventilator, they will probably need to stay on it for weeks. And the longer patients remain on a breathing machine, the more likely they are to die.

&gt;""We're not sure how much help ventilators are going to be,"" Osborn says. ""They may help keep somebody alive in the short term. We're not sure if it's going to help keep someone alive in the long term.""

&gt;Unfortunately, Osborn says, ""the ventilator itself can do damage to the lung tissue based on how much pressure is required to help oxygen get processed by the lungs.""

&gt;And coronavirus patients often need dangerously high levels of both pressure and oxygen because their lungs have so much inflammation.

&gt;Another risk from being on a ventilator is that the tube carrying air and extra oxygen to the lungs provides a pathway for dangerous germs. Many ventilated patients get a new lung infection, a problem known as ventilator-associated pneumonia.",1586813343,fnbczf4

Carney is bought and sold by DE business interests. The same DE business interests that can now get free government loans for up to 10 million dollars and as long as they pay thier workers minimum wage, it converts to a grant. They are making more money staying closed.

Then you have the arsenal of low income people that were put out of work, they don't care, they are getting MORE money through unemployment by sitting on their couch and playing video games. Carney doesn't care about the lost tax revenue, cause the federal government is going to pay DE more than it is losing. This is a net profit for the state. 

DE Hospitals are thrilled to stay in a state of emergency cause that's immediate access to a 250 billion dollar pool of money the government set up.
 
All the meanwhile Carney gets to virtue signal as a hero on TV by issuing a new edict every week or so that does nothing but violate people rights, but no one cares cause they are all making tons of money off this.

Anyone who thinks Carney is going to open anything back up this year is absolutely kidding themselves. This is his wet dream come true. He's being called a hero for telling everyone not to work and someone else is footing the bill. I can't even blame him, in his shoes I'd do the exact same thing. Why not? It's economically advantageous to stay closed down as long as the feds are footing the bill.

Every single virus in the world meets that description. So again your solution is is you have a virus you should die on the streets to minimize risk to others.

1st - on the PPP loans - you know that the $10mm doesn’t disappear and the forgiveness doesn’t disappear if businesses reopen?  It’s a lot better for a business to be open and generating revenue while also using their PPP loan to pay employees and other eligible costs. They get the forgiveness whether or not they’re open as long as the loan is used for eligible costs. Let me give you an example. My company I work for is an essential business. We received a PPP loan in the neighborhood of $4mm. We will use this for payroll and other eligible costs. We will get the forgiveness and at the same time we continue to generate revenue (although we will definitely have a big hit from this crisis). 

Your rationale that businesses want to stay closed as they make more money is completely nonsensical and completely ignores how the PPP loans work. Every profitable business would prefer to be open and making money while simultaneously having their payroll covered by a “free” loan. That’s a lot better than just paying your payroll. Plus - you’re not making money with the PPP loan because unless it’s used for eligible expenses then you have to pay it back. Eligible expenses are payroll, benefits, insurance premiums, rent and mortgage interest payments. So business owners aren’t just shoving the loan money into their pockets generally because then it has to be repaid. 

2 - talk to any hospital admin and ask them if they are “thrilled” by this situation from an economic standpoint. Spoiler - they’re not. The federal funds don’t come close to replacing the lost revenue from the inability to do elective procedures which are the largest portion of a hospitals income. Health systems across the country and losing money rapidly and hurting from this crisis. They don’t want this to continue any longer because it will likely mean pay cuts, layoffs or furloughs (for non essential people) for a lot of hospitals unless even more federal money is given out.",1586861252,fnd722f

The spotlights drew up smaller baitfish, crabs, and shrimp, and then the weakfish would swarm. It wasnt challenging to catch them. My dad one tied 6 ft of line and a hook on a pool cue and fished with netted bait and tore it up.

You never had to bring bait. You jest netted whatever swam up. We'd see weird shit out there hitting the fish and bait too. Massive sharks, gar... one time my dad caught a triggerfish, which was odd as fuck.

Depends on the size and how you want to deal with it.. expensive ways and cheap ways. But if you want a cheap, easy way to do it you could basically elevate the land and utilise aggregates to help with drainage, for pennies on the dollar for what you'd get charged by someone. The only problem is regrowing the grass over the area.. maybe $300-$400 depending on how big the area is? and thats including labor. Drop and taper a yard of sand and pea gravel to aid in drainage. Half yard top soil mixed with sand over the top of that 1st layer, for some pourous dirt to help with drainage. half yard pure top soil over the top and than just plant grass seed. Just have to taper the material nicely so it appears natural and blends well. Pretty much a  minimal cost fix, but will take a few weeks to get your grass grown over the area how you want it to be. 

Could be cheaper or more expensive since I have no idea how big the area is. I'm just spit balling. The bigger the area the more material needed to elevate it. My math is based on 2-2.5 yards of material doing the trick. $300-$400.

The science is clear (from both the CDC and WHO and many more) that certain low risk contacts like the one the nurse is complaining about have no need for n95 protection. Other PPE is sufficient.

Yes I would unquestionably provide treatment to COVID patients with care in a low risk procedure.

If I ran a hospital and I had 1,000 masks and I had to choose between giving them to nurses performing high risk procedures and low risk procedures, I would absolutely stop the nurses using them in minimal risk circumstances and save them for nurses and doctors using them for high risk circumstances. Without a doubt. As any rational, intelligent human would do. Which is what the hospital is doing now.

Here's a crude example you might understand. You have 10 condoms and you can have many sexual relations with a fertile woman. The goal is to not get pregnant. Are you going to use those condoms for a handjob, dry humping, and oral sex? Or for intercourse?

This is such full of shit.  I do believe you would have no qualms about putting other peoples lives in danger because of your incompetence in stocking supplies.  Here is the deal - you have no fucking clue what a ""low risk"" situation is.  Are you going to tell me you are an expert in infectious disease control because you do statistical analysis for a living?  I agree it is a shitty situation but you belittle the person who does not want to risk their life by saying:
&gt;But hey, that's actual facts and not people emotional reaction.

Also - I am no expert but this is certainly not a low risk situation.  These are confirmed cases of Covid-19 and with respiratory failure.  Did you actually read the article? Seriously, the nurse made a very good point, the hospital unilaterally announced the change in procedure.  This is akin to the EPA saying the air around ground zero was safe right after 9/11.

&gt;Jeffries worked on the only floor of the hospital that can accommodate COVID-19 patients, who are suffering from acute respiratory failure and require heavy amounts of oxygen through the use of high-flow nasal cannula.
""It was written on our huddle board in the morning that airborne precautions are no longer needed for high-flow nasal cannula, which is very concerning for me, because it is a very high amount of oxygen that's being forced into the nostrils. We don't know enough...we're in the middle of a pandemic. We don't have time to be testing new things, and I feel like we're almost lab rats,"" she said.

Seems like a damm good point to me, but then again I don't do statistical analysis for a living.

&gt;Here's a crude example you might understand.

Nice try to be condescending.  This explains why you are wrong so much but are deluded thinking you are right.  Then you use an absurd example that does not correlate to the problem at all.  Then you call her stupid for not going along with the hospitals whims.  Wearing a N95 respirator when caring for Covid-19 patients in respiratory failure is not equivalent to demanding to wear a helmet when walking down the street.

My take on this is the hospital is in a very bad situation and trying to make fundamental changes that puts healthcare workers in harms way.  I can understand why someone would not go along with that; but those patients need care.  It is a really bad situation and you belittling and degrading the worker is alarming.",1587046343,fnl3o8x

Statistical analysis strongly indicates that the US had at least 12 million cases at the end of March. The virus has been in circulation in NYC since late January. Early surveillance testing (serological antibody detection) is showing consistently across countries that 10-25% of the population has had or has the virus. The best estimates for a fatality rate is 0.35%. but it could reasonablybe as low as 0.15% or as high as 0.50%.

That's actual data based on actual science. 

It always should have been taken seriously but almost all effort should have been concentrated on protecting at risk populations. Can it kill a 25 year old? Absolutely. But 78% of the deaths are 65 and older. Which is ~16% of the population. Closing all ""non-essential"" businesses and shuttering schools and daycare facilities isn't sustainable in the long term and evidence showed it isn't very effective either.

I suggest you take your own advice. Turn off the TV and educate yourself. 

Social distancing definitely caused some minor slowdown. But it's nowhere near the biggest factor.  

I've said this a hundred times on here, but actions like UD shutting down campus after a handful of positive cases actually accelerated the spread. They sent dozens, if not hundreds of carriers of the virus all over the country. Likewise they brought thousands of parents from NY and NJ(and elsewhere) into Newark to move their kids out. Again, virus has been circulating in NY for 6 weeks at that point. 

You have to be delusional to think that actions like that somehow slowed the spread.

I know several relatives that had their non-essential, low contact job shutdown that have had to take high contact ""essential"" jobs. My father in law might have had to contact 5 people during a busy week doing his home repair business. Now he's had to take a job at a grocery store interacting with  hundreds of not thousands of people a day.

Edit to add from DOL site. You may be eligible for unemployment benefits, depending on your personal circumstances and how your state chooses to implement the CARES Act. States are permitted to provide Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) to individuals who are self-employed, seeking part-time employment, or who otherwise would not qualify for regular unemployment compensation. To qualify for PUA benefits, you must not be eligible for regular unemployment benefits and be unemployed, partially unemployed, or unable or unavailable to work because of certain health or economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The PUA program provides up to 39 weeks of benefits, which are available retroactively starting with weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 27, 2020, and ending on or before December 31, 2020. The amount of benefits paid out will vary by state and are calculated based on the weekly benefit amounts (WBA) provided under a state’s unemployment insurance laws.

2649,2649,arxero,"&gt;**\[WILMINGTON, DE\] THURSDAY APRIL 16, 2020 –** The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act recently passed by the United States Congress and signed into law on March 27th provides unemployment assistance to independent contractors and those self-employed who have been affected by the Coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most state’s unemployment systems determine eligibility and process payments for workers whose wages are reported by their employers and verified through the Division of Unemployment Insurance (DUI). In order to begin processing claims for this new category of eligible individuals and prevent fraud, abuse and identity theft, the Federal US Department of Labor requires that states design new systems to pay benefits to independent contractors/self-employed and ensure the validity of their claims.  
&gt;  
&gt;Delaware Department of Labor (DOL) is currently working with a vendor to design and test new technologies that will integrate with our existing benefits claims system. This technology will allow the Division of Unemployment Insurance (DUI) to verify earnings reported to the IRS and determine the eligibility of independent contractors and the self-employed to apply for benefits under the (CARES) Act.  
&gt;  
&gt;**We anticipate that these workers will be able to apply through this new system within 3-6 weeks. We will provide more details regarding implementation and how to apply on our website next week.**  
&gt;  
&gt;*“The hardship that the coronavirus pandemic has placed on Delaware workers is unprecedented. These workers will receive the much-needed assistance provided to them under the CARES Act. We are working around the clock to make that happen; Hopefully, ahead of schedule” said Cerron Cade, Secretary of the Delaware Department of Labor.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Once the system is ready to receive applications from those who are self-employed or are independent contractors, DOL will require specific documentation available at the time you submit your application online. The documents you will need are as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;Driver license or State issued Identification  
&gt;  
&gt;Your last year’s income tax statement or quarterly earnings statement  
&gt;  
&gt;State of Delaware Business License number  
&gt;

2688,2688,JimmyfromDelaware,"Holy shit dude - some of those links proved my point against you.  I fail to see how any of those links supports your position that the danger is way over-hyped, in fact it shows the opposite.

This is from your first link:

&gt;Insufficient and delayed testing may explain why some European countries, such as Italy and Spain, are experiencing much higher casualty numbers (relative to reported confirmed cases) than Germany, which has detected an estimated 15.6% of infections compared to only 3.5% in Italy or 1.7% in Spain. Detection rates are even lower in the United States (1.6%) and the United Kingdom (1.2%) – two countries that have received widespread criticism from public health experts for their delayed response to the pandemic.

and this gem:

&gt;In sharp contrast to this, South Korea appears to have discovered almost half of all its SARS-CoV-2 infections....On the same day the Johns Hopkins University reported that globally there were less than 900,000 confirmed cases, meaning that the vast majority of infections were undetected.

So what was your point linking that article?

&gt;I've said this a hundred times on here, but actions like UD shutting down campus after a handful of positive cases actually accelerated the spread. 

Your opinion and hunches mean complete shit, no matter how many times you say them.  You are really an arrogant prick that just keeps repeating your same talking points over and over.  You really think you know more than scientists.  When this first started you said it was nothing, no worse than the flu, etc etc.  You were completely wrong but you still repeat the same stuff.
