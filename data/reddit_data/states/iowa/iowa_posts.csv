I’m posting on behalf of my son. He has had a lot of struggles in his life: he was separated by divorce, he bears the challenge of autism, his mother passed away suddenly six years ago and changed his world. I have not known how to help him or be his beacon. I’ve struggled not knowing what will happen to him. I’ve laid awake at night panicking about his future and what will happen to him without having the tools he needs to survive in life. 
Scavo changed all that. 
He went from zero attendance his freshman year to actually completing his high school degree next month, and is looking forward to attending college in the fall and taking his place in society.
The support that Scavo has provided him cannot be measured by dollars. It can only be measured in the strength and determination he needs to succeed in life which is provided by the caring and nurturing staff at Scavo high school. It’s not possible to have that same connection online. Please, on behalf of my son and the countless current and future success stories Scavo has and will enable, step up, stand together as a community, and resolve to support Scavo in it’s mission to help the hundreds of students who need the hope and support only Scavo’s teachers and infrastructure can provide.",Iowa,Save Scavo high school!

1) VS. TRUMP

Bernie +2.6, Liz -0.2


2) NEW HAMPSHIRE

Bernie 21.5 (leading), Liz 14.8 (4th)


3) NEVADA

Bernie 19.7, Liz 17.3

(Note: Due to lack of recent polling, this average is pre Bernie surge. A Meyers Nevada poll released today has Bernie leading with 29, Liz 14)


4) SOUTH CAROLINA

Bernie 15.0, Liz 14.0

(Again, few recent polls. The Fox poll of this week is Bernie +4 vs. Liz)


5) CALIFORNIA

Bernie 21.0, Liz 19.6


6) NATIONAL

Bernie 20.3, Liz 14.8


7) SUMMARY

If you want to elect a progressive, the best shot is Bernie, who could parlay an Iowa win into victories in the first three states and kill Biden's electability argument. 

If moderates were to somehow rally around Biden and Joe wins Iowa, then all progressives will be left holding the bag.

✅ Wrote quite possibly the ""greatest song ever since Frreebird?"" Check.

✅ Family turmoil and death threats? Check.

✅ Former bandmate that dresses like a Pirate FULL-TIME? Check.

✅ The realization that happiness is relative, and this guy's life is pretty kickass? Check.

Also, /r/Iowa users should know that /r/Iowa mods unilaterally, arbitrarily censor political posts that they don't like, while allowing political posts they do like.

The posts that /r/Iowa mods censor ""lean-right"", which is why /r/Iowa has a reputation of being a liberal shit-show, in spite of Iowa being majority right-leaning. 

It time for new mods at /r/Iowa. 

When /r/Iowa was founded, no posts were censored for any reason. If someone was ""spamming"" /r/Iowa, we would politely explain to the submitter what SPAM is, and give them ideas for how they can promote their products in a less-spammy ways... 

I'm calling out specifically /u/fieldsocern as being a mod who censors way too many posts, and needs to have her mod power-trip taken away.

Our country doesn’t realize how much social media has affected our behavior in the past decade.  Did it seem like our country was so “divided” ten years ago?   Do you attribute that change with Obama or Trump? What we need to realize is that political affiliations are influenced by our core beliefs.  No matter what I do or say to you is not going to influence your core beliefs.  You have built those beliefs through your life experiences, your life experiences are not the same as mine, and please realize that your experiences are different than everyone else’s.  Social media’s exposure has rapidly grown since the last election and it continues to tear the country apart because we the people struggle to comprehend this simple fact.  We now know everything about hundreds or thousands of people in each of our small communities, compared to the small knit friend structure we were all used to.  Step back for a second and think about how much you judge people you hardly know personally because of what they post on social media.  I am 1,000% guilty of this and I’m just now realizing how childish it is.  Ask yourself this:  Is it the right thing to do?  Does it influence your relationships with people?  Does it affect your opinion of me if I say that I’m a republican and a Trump supporter?  As a new father I believe in the right to life because I’ve seen first hand how precious and special it is.  I’m not a republican robot though, I firmly believe everyone should have the right to marry and love whoever they want; I’ve learned that through my life experiences amongst many other things.  However, the Republican Party currently aligns with the majority of my beliefs.  We don’t need to “come together” like everyone suggests we just need to realize that we’re all different and maintain open thoughts.

The issues came from “inconsistencies” found in the reporting of results. The count was being done by a specially created smartphone app that was to organize the totals across all precincts. As backup, officials were also using paper cards on which attendees wrote down their preferred candidate.

Issues with the app has led to using photos of the caucus groups and the paper trail to verify results. There had also been reports that some caucus officials struggled to download the app.  

Mandy McClure, a spokesperson for the Democratic Party said, [“This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion.

eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

606,EnoughNoLibsSpam,1580858026,eyz49e,Nan,"check yourself http://cnn.com

also the subject of Iowa Democrats has been dominating /r/Conspiracy all day today 

and also dominating at http://voat.co

Thanks Iowa Democrats! Way to show the World how you are ready to lead America. 

what did you do? hire the same people to build your totally unnecessary app, as Obama hired to build his totally unnecessary ObamaCare website? remember that one? Dems spent over a BILLION dollars on a website that didn't work?

NO, the Iowa Dems didn't hire *those* particular incompetents, but they hired some other incompetents who did just as shoddy of a job...

SO from what i gather, the Team that put this app together is a bunch of ""diversity hire"" post-turtles. 

Also, Pete Buttigieg supposedly spent his own money developing this app ? 

Ask yourself... if you were a candidate for President, competing in the Iowa Caucuses, and you had limited resources like everyone else... whereabouts do you suppose ""building a new app to count iowa caucusers"" would fall on your priority list?

And then, as if by magic, Pete Buttigieg ""wins"" the Iowa Caucus, after a suspiciously-long delay. 

______

SO anyway, today would be a good day to talk about election and ballot integrity. 

There have been countless problems with so-called ""electronic voting machines"", endless videos on youtube of someone voting for one candidate, and their vote being registered for the other candidate. 

this is not a bug. this is a feature.

And you pay support electioneering, so long as your candidates are the beneficiaries of the cheating. 

But what would you do if someone like Trump came along and hijacked the election apparatus and controlled it for his own purposes?

Do we want free and fair elections? i think we do.

do we want to have confidence in our elections, even if our candidates don't always win?

there are 2 easy things that can be done to address our election problems. 

1) you have to show an ID to vote. 

sorry, its not ""racist"" just because you assume POC can't figure out how to DMV.

2) paper ballots, with receipt. 

i call them ""tally stick ballots""

tally sticks built the British Empire. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick

A) Ballot is perforated up the middle, so it can be torn in half. 

One half goes to the County, to be optically scanned, photographed, and uploaded to their website in real time, so anyone can see and verify the ballot instantaneously.

The other half goes home with the voter, so the voter can go to the County website and verify their ballot. 

B) Ballots come with serial numbers in the corners, like a Dollar bill has, so that once the ballot is torn, each half retains its serial number. 

C) Ballots come in blocks of 100, and every ballot must be accounted for, because we have serial numbers now. 

D) Serial numbers allow us to track how many ballots were produced, how many were used, and how many are left over. 

E) Serial numbers also protect the anonymity of the voters, by not linking any serial number to any voter. 
 
If we don't fix this problem now, then who will fix it, and when?",Iowa,The Iowa Democrat Caucus fiasco has dominated CNN's front page all day today...
607,TheGeckomancer,1580858591,eyz9hc,Nan,"There was only one candidate worth voting for, this isn't about opinion, or how you feel, mathematically, by results, numbers, and backing from the most intelligent people on earth. None of you should want anyone in office besides Andrew Yang and even if you did you shouldn't act on feeling but on logic. But assuming you were going to act on feeling how and WHY would any of you support Pete?

Did none of you do research and find out he is backed almost exclusively by big money, tried to doctor his donor results, flat out said he will lie and say whatever to win in politics because it's just a competition. Even before finding any of this out, he is the one person anyone can look at and go ""Oh thats where they got the Reptilian Humanoid theories from."" He literally looks like he is wearing a skin suit. By both logic and feeling he should be last, he is the only person you should be more afraid of putting in office than Trump.

661,ryooan,1580999490,ezt53c,Nan," Here's my proposal for how the Iowa Democratic Party should do their primary.

1.) Switch to paper ballots with ranked voting. People could now vote absentee and the polls could be open all day so no one has to miss out. This is more representative, less complicated, and less time consuming. It will raise turnout.  
2.) The paper ballots allow voters to rank candidates. If the party wants to make it electronically readable just list each candidate's name next to a row of bubbles from 1 to the total number of candidates next to it. People bubble in their order, for example bubble 1 next to Buttigieg, 2 next to Sanders, and 3 next to Warren if that's your preference. Leave a candidate blank if you do not want your vote transferring to them under any circumstances.  
3.) When it comes time to count the ballots place them in piles by first choice and tally each pile. Document how many first round votes each candidate got.  
4.) Realign. Start with the candidate with the fewest ballots in their pile who doesn't meet the 15% threshold. Redistribute their ballots to the piles of the other candidates based on second choice. Repeat with the next lowest who is still below the 15% threshold. If that candidate received some second choice votes from the first candidate eliminated, move them to a new pile based on their 3rd choice. Repeat this process until no one is below 15%. Some candidates initially below 15% may reach the 15% threshold and become viable during this process, just like in the in-person caucus. If at any point a ballot lists only candidates who have been eliminated it gets placed in a separate uncommitted pile.  
5.) Repeat steps 3 and 4 from scratch and make sure your totals match. If they don't match, do it again until you get two consecutive matches.  
6.) Report final realignment values and apportion delegates based on those values.  
7.) Alternatively, steps 3, 4, and 5 could be done automatically with computers if the party used computer readable ballots and developed a simple program. All results would still be verifiable by doing it by hand. But by hand would be simple to do as well.

That's it. Easier and less chaotic and also more accessible for those unable to physically caucus. It would need some rules developed for if two candidates tie for the fewest votes how you go about realigning them, but I think someone could come up with some fair rules for that. It would work almost exactly like the caucuses now and it would also be flexible so that if rules about delegate assignments or viability ever changed you could use this process with some minor tweaks.

If you like this idea and know anyone in the Iowa Democratic Party leadership please bring this to their attention!",Iowa,My proposal for improving the Iowa Democratic primary

677,BrainDeadUnit,1581033150,f01m15,Nan,"Look at how much the media sources we know are biased against Bernie and want a moderate instead are railing hard against the caucuses. Look at the fake Bernie supporters saying we shouldn't vote democratic at all (and occasionally even saying to support Trump instead) because the caucuses cheated Bernie. IMO, it's clear that the people who aren't favored by democracy are the ones most against the caucus system.

When we have the caucus, even if Bernie doesn't win, it is undeniable that he has support from a major segment of the population. Anyone can show up at the caucus and see the room half-full of Bernie supporters (at least anecdotally, Pete supporters seem to largely be people who chose Pete as a second choice when their first choice didn't meet viability).

They want a primary where Bernie supporters are divided -- where anyone can walk in, and see no obvious signs of Bernie's support. Where a person who thinks Bernie is the guy we need, but is worried about viability, will just cast their vote for an alternative candidate, so they can beat Trump, and where Pete supporters will think he's a long shot and vote for Biden (remember, Pete is establishment's second choice, they'd go with Biden if they could), too. They want a primary where Biden supporters will show up and never think twice about a second candidate, let alone realize Biden doesn't actually even have the support to meet viability in many places.

The caucus system, I believe, is the reason a very moderate state like Iowa can show so much support for Bernie at the polls. Sure, Bernie would have his loyal supporters, regardless. But what about people on the fence? What about people who's first choice between Warren and Bernie is dependent on whichever one is more viable? At the caucus, unity is on full display.

Primaries are low-information events. Most people will have only the information the establishment provided them. Caucuses give a lot more information as to how your community actually feels about issues and topics -- where the community can figure out what the community actually wants, not what the establishment says the community wants.

And that's why I support the caucus. It's a system that allows the community to come together and form consensus with the community, itself; not a consensus with the establishment.",Iowa,In defense of the caucuses.

I first started feeling bad for the people of Iowa when I volunteered to text bank for my favorite candidate. I was informing Iowans about free events the candidate would be at near them. What responses I got, most were very pleasant. A few were 'PLEASE STOP! PLEASE. PLEASE STOP!' and other variations of that statement. (If you were one of them, I apologized and immediately marked a box to remove you from the list). That's when I realized that you guys had been getting bombarded by all 200 candidates constantly. If I were one of you, I honestly would have put my phone in the toilet and flushed it lol. I also got one death threat and a couple dick pic's. Lol. The majority, though, were very nice. Whether they were supporting my candidate or not. 

When everyone starting complaining about Iowa going first, I  felt bad for you. When all the drama happened after the caucus, I again felt bad for you. You have all endured a lot these past few months. A lot of you worked your butt's off for your own chosen candidate. And those of you that caucused didn't get the excitement of seeing who won. 

Now to the reason I came here. Do not think I am pitying you. You all got to meet amazing people I will never get in the same room with any of them probably. You got to ask them your own questions! You all also made history. AGAIN. 

Iowa, you have chosen the first black man, the first woman &amp; now the first openly gay candidate (technically you also chose the first Democratic Socialist candidate) to be your nominee for president. To be the first nominee of an entire state. You picked them, all on your own. You didn't have the luxury of multiple states going before you, telling you they were a popular choice for a nominee. You just voted with your hearts. You have forced progress and change upon the rest of the nation. Three different times!  You all should be damn proud of yourselves. 

Your tv may tell you otherwise, but the majority of the nation is proud of you! The MSM has not learned their lesson from 2015-2016. They are the ones who started acting like the national power grid went down 5 minutes after they were expecting the caucus results and didn't get them.  They could have just said the state was counting the votes to ensure accurate reporting and that once Iowa was sure of the results, we would know. They could have said how serious the state was taking it and how great that is because our elections are under attack right now. We need to do everything we can to ensure correct results. That is more important than instant gratification. 

So if you're feeling down about how everything has gone, stop it. You are awesome Iowa!",Iowa,Hi from Indiana!

He's had girlfriends in the past, but since coming out, I'm the first guy he's been with. He's going to be my first Valentine, too. 

Usually we go out to eat, watch Netflix, and cuddle. We've gone out for sushi, breakfast, coffee, etc. I love spending time with him. Last night he made me supper and hung around his place. I love it, but he confessed he's worried he's too boring for me. ""All what we do is watch movies."" 

I'm planning on having Hurts Donuts deliver donuts to him in class. They hire a person to dress up as Cupid to deliver them and dance. His friends think it'd be funny. Sadly, they require a 4 hour window, and since he has lots of different classes Friday, I can't guarantee he'd be in one spot. So I'm going to surprise him on Thursday instead- as soon as I find out what classroom he'd be in 😅

I thought it'd be fun to go to the Crossroad Mall and go to build a bear, but apparently that closed down. He's a sweet, caring, affectionate guy that loves Disney. Whenever we go out somewhere, someone always knows him. I want to make sure he knows I care.

There's just not much to do in Cedar Falls. Does anyone have any advice? What's everyone else doing? Friday its going to be ~11 degrees out. If it was warmer I'd take him to get donuts and have a little picnic. I could just default to just a movie and supper, but I also want it to be meaningful for him too.

Any ideas? I was hoping someone else here would be a UNI student or Cedar Falls resident that could help me :)

838,xeroblaze0,1582301023,f7d6q6,Nan,"Dear Mr. Hay:

Thank you for taking the time to contact me with your support for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. As your senator, it is important for me to hear from you. 

The question of whether or not to impeach and remove a duly elected public official, in this case the President of the United States, is an extremely serious one that was contemplated by the Framers and addressed in the Constitution. Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that ""The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" Those are the sole bases for impeachment.

On December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives voted to adopt two articles of impeachment against President Trump. The first article provided that President Trump should be removed from office for “abuse of power,” and the second article provided that he should be removed from office for “obstruction of Congress.” Unfortunately, this marks perhaps the most partisan impeachment in the history of the United States. In fact, the only bipartisanship the American people witnessed during the House’s vote stood opposed to impeachment.

The Framers of the Constitution warned against using impeachment as a partisan weapon. They were rightly concerned that impeachment would be determined by the strength of political parties instead of by real demonstrations of innocence or guilt. But that’s one reason why the Framers didn’t leave impeachment solely in the hands of the House of Representatives.

On Wednesday, February 5, 2020, following a full and fair 11-day trial in the Senate, I voted to acquit the President of the impeachment charges brought against him by the House of Representatives.

As I explained in my recent statement on the floor of the Senate, which you can view here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB7lN9EodsM), a vote to convict or acquit the President on charges of impeachment is perhaps the most important vote a senator could cast. Before this presidential impeachment trial, it had happened only twice in our Nation’s history. That’s for good reason, and it’s something that should never be done lightly. Accordingly, I took my role as a judge and juror seriously.

The impeachment trial began with a full and fair debate on the rules that guided our process. We considered and voted on 11 amendments for over nearly 13 hours. Consistent with precedent, the Senate adopted rules allowing the same length of time for arguments and questions as was agreed to unanimously in 1999, and it engaged in a robust debate on calling witnesses and pursuing additional evidence. In total, the Senate sat as a Court of Impeachment for over 70 hours. The final vote to acquit the President was the product of a fair and judicious process, consistent with precedent.

I couldn’t say the same of the articles of impeachment adopted by the House. After fully considering the record and the parties’ presentations, I concluded that what the House was asking the Senate to do is constitutionally flawed and dangerously unprecedented.

First, the House’s “abuse of power” article described objectively legal conduct. A president is within his authority to request that a foreign leader assist with anti-corruption efforts. To make up for this hurdle, the House’s argument rested entirely on the President’s subjective motive. This is a vague, flexible standard that cannot be sustained. Under such a standard, future majorities in the House of Representatives could impeach presidents for taking lawful action for what a slim majority thinks are simply the wrong reasons.

The House argued that motive by itself is sufficient to prove the illegality of an action. But this flips basic concepts in our justice system upside down, and represents an unprecedented expansion of the scope of the impeachment authority. With limited exception, motive is offered in court to show that the defendant on trial is the one who most likely committed the illegal act that’s been charged—it doesn’t make an otherwise lawful act unlawful.

The House also provided no guidance on whether conviction—and therefore removal from office—should rest on proving a single, “corrupt” motive, or whether mixed motive would suffice under their theory. In its trial brief, the House argued that there’s “no credible alternative explanation” for the President’s alleged conduct. But once the Senate heard from the President’s Counsel, the House changed its tune. Apparently, even a credible alternative explanation shouldn’t stop the Senate from removing the President.

Re-shaping their own standard mid-trial, however, only served to undercut their initial arguments. And simply asserting at least 63 times that their evidence was “overwhelming” didn’t make the House’s allegations accurate or prove an impeachable offense.

Even after arguments had concluded, the House managers started repeating the terms “bribery” and “extortion” on the floor of the Senate, while neither appears anywhere in the articles. It’s not the Senate’s job to read into the House’s articles what the House failed, or didn’t see fit, to incorporate itself. As I made clear, articles of impeachment shouldn’t be moving targets. The ambiguities surrounding the House’s “abuse of power” theory gave me reason enough to vote “not guilty.” If we’re going to lower the bar of impeachment, we better be clear on where the bar is being set.

Second, the House’s article for “obstruction of Congress” was equally unprecedented and patently frivolous. I know a thing or two about obstruction by the Executive Branch. Congressional oversight—rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse—is central to my role as a senator representing Iowa taxpayers. In the face of obstruction, I use the tools the Constitution provides to this institution. That’s the very core of checks and balances.

For example, I fought the Obama administration to obtain documents related to “Operation Fast and Furious.” Under the House’s “obstruction” standard, should President Obama have been impeached for his failure to waive privileges during the course of that investigation? We fought President Obama on this for three years in the courts, and we still didn’t end up with all we asked for. We never heard a word from the House Majority then. So, the hypocrisy here is on full display.

In this impeachment, the House issued a series of requests and subpoenas to the Executive Branch. But the House failed to enforce its requests. When challenged to stand up for its subpoenas in court, the investigating committee simply retreated. The House may cower at defending its own authority, but the Senate shouldn’t have to clean up a mess of the House’s own making. For the many ways in which the House failed in the fundamentals of oversight, and for the terrible new precedent the “obstruction” article would’ve set, I voted “not guilty.”     

There’s also been debate about the whistleblower whose complaint motivated the House’s impeachment inquiry. Now, I’ve worked for and with whistleblowers for more than thirty years. I’ve sponsored numerous laws to strengthen whistleblower protections. Attempts by anyone to “out” a whistleblower just to sell an article or score a political point aren’t helpful. It’s not the treatment any whistleblower deserves. 

However, it’s important for investigators to talk to whistleblowers, to evaluate their claims and credibility, because those claims form the basis of an inquiry.  My office does this all the time. When whistleblowers bring us significant cases of bipartisan interest, we frequently work closely with the other side to look into those claims. I know the House committees have followed that course in the past. Both parties understand how to talk to whistleblowers and respect their confidentiality. But why no efforts were taken in this case to take these very basic, bipartisan steps is baffling. I fear that, to achieve its desired ends, the House majority weaponized and politicized whistleblowers for purely partisan purposes. I hope that the damage done will be short lived. 

Furthermore, as a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I’ve always made it a priority to hold judicial nominees to a standard of restraint and fidelity to the law. As judges in this case, we too needed to consider those factors which counseled restraint. To begin with, the articles came to the Senate as the product of a flawed, unprecedented and partisan process. The House Majority’s inquiry ignored many of the procedural rights that were given to the investigating Committee’s minority in previous impeachments. When the articles were voted on by the full House, the only bipartisanship was in opposition. 

Moreover, the Iowa caucuses have already occurred. The 2020 presidential election is underway. Yet we were asked to remove the incumbent from the ballot, based on an impeachment supported by only one party in Congress.

The Senate refused to endorse the dangerous new precedent this would’ve set for future impeachments.

Finally, I want to briefly address the issue of witnesses. Over the span of two weeks, the Senate conducted a fair and thorough examination of the House’s articles of impeachment and supporting materials. That includes more than 28,500 pages of evidence, interviews with 17 witnesses and 192 video clips. The House managers themselves argued that the evidence they provided was “overwhelming” and “uncontested.” Accordingly, the Senate did not need to take the unprecedented step of hearing from witnesses that were not already part of the House’s record.

Now that this impeachment trial has drawn to a close, the American people are more than adequately prepared to decide for themselves the fate of the President in November.

This decision belongs to the People.

Once again, thank you for taking time to contact me. I urge you to keep in touch. 

Sincerely,

Chuck Grassley

839,xeroblaze0,1582301201,f7d8eu,Nan,"Dear OP,

Thank you for taking the time to contact me about the impeachment process. It is important for me to hear from folks in Iowa on matters such as this.

On September 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry. Upon completing its investigation, the House Judiciary Committee introduced two articles of impeachment on December 10, 2019 - Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress. The House Judiciary Committee voted to advance these articles to the full House of Representatives on December 13, 2019. On December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives approved these two articles. Not a single Republican voted to approve these articles, while a handful of Democrats also voted against the measure.

The House delayed sending the articles to the Senate for nearly a month.  Finally, on January 16, 2020, the Senate began the process of hearing evidence from both the House impeachment managers and the President's defense team. Both sides were given the opportunity to present their cases, and we heard statements from over a dozen witnesses and were able to review over 28,000 pages of documents. After hearing all of the evidence, there was an opportunity for the Senate to hear from additional witnesses. On January 31, 2020, the motion to hear from additional witnesses failed by a 49 - 51 vote. After much thought and consideration, I chose to vote against hearing from additional witnesses. I believe that it was the responsibility of the House to hear from witnesses, and in the 28 days that the House stalled in sending over the articles, they could have been using that time to subpoena witnesses. Further, given the exhaustive evidence already provided to the Senate from the House, I felt that additional witness testimony was not needed to render judgement.

On February 5, 2020, the Senate voted on the Articles of Impeachment. The President was pronounced ""Not Guilty"" on the first article, Abuse of Power, by a 52 - 48 vote. The President was also found ""Not Guilty"" on the second article, Obstruction of Congress, by a 53 - 47 vote. 

I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and I take that oath very seriously. It’s clear to me that the Constitution intentionally sets a high bar for removing the President. This is because the Founders were rightfully concerned that impeachment might be used to upend the electoral will of the American people. This vote was not about liking the President or agreeing with his policies or even approving of his conduct. We had one job during this process: to decide, based on the evidence, whether the President committed an impeachable offense. Upon reviewing the record, as well as hearing the arguments from both sides, I chose to vote against both articles of impeachment because I did not believe these charges met the high constitutional standard of ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" 

Thank you for the opportunity to explain my votes and to hopefully answer your questions regarding this process.  I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts and views with me.

Sincerely,

The confessions can be lighthearted and funny or they can also be maybe more personal or a issue you have the region. Everything will be completely anonymous but it will be used in a video I plan on making.

980,DustinMacDonald,1583433759,fdztuy,Nan,"This isn't Iowa-specific but I'm interested in resources to learn more about farming, farmers, and farm policy. I've heard conflicting information about whether the Farm Bureau is truly a good advocate for farmers so I'm nervous to embrace them as the primary source of information.

I have looked for a coherent answer on how to go about setting up a courthouse marriage in Johnson County and all I can find that really is consistent is that everyone seems to agree that I need to file the Application for Marriage.  After that though, how do I get a courthouse marriage lined up -- do I just call the Recorder's Office, or is there a different branch of government with its own court system to handle marriages? Has anyone else done this? I understand I need two witnesses and that the judge will legalise the marital relationship upon pronouncing us married.

Thanks for any insights or guidance you may be able to proffer.",Iowa,Iowa City resident wanting to marry an NZ citizen in Iowa City in early June in a courthouse marriage -- advice needed

My wife and I are planning a trip to Iowa to dig into family history. Her great great grandparents had a circus called The Groth Brothers Circus in Charter Oak back in the day and she wants to dig into the local area and see what she can find. The plan is very loose outside of this. We can go at any point between April-August, we will have a car, and we just want to make the most of our trip.

Is there anything that goes down in the area at any point during the summer that we would be fools to miss? Example: If someone was planning a trip to Kentucky around April-June I would suggest they go in May to be part of the Derby festivities. We are down for anything fun!

We're currently researching Airbnbs and trying to formulate a plan. Any guidance for that time period would be great!",Iowa,"Visiting Charter Oak Soon, any suggestions?"

988,ZombiePotato90,1583482532,feah6t,Nan,"I took and passed the MSF course in July of 2019. I later took and passed the written tests at the DMV for cars and motorcycles.   
However, I was told I still had to take the road test. 

I have never driven a motorcycle on the street before, only in a parking lot during the test. I haven't ridden since the course (I bought an old bike and have gotten it running, just need to replace the tires). As such, I feel I am out of practice. I'd like to go and practice maneuvers at a parking lot across the street from my house, with permission from the owners. I'd walk my motorcycle down the street there, ride on the lot, then walk it back. I'd go for a permit, but I don't know anyone with a motorcycle license (except for my dad, who lives in my home state of Texas), and I doubt anyone would take time out of their day to watch me do loops around a parking lot.   
I have never had a license before (I'm 29 and autistic, driving a car is difficult for me, but a motorcycle is small and I have clear visibility). Looking on the DMV website, it says that if you successfully pass a MSF course and provide documentation, they waive the road test. However, I was told that I still had to take it. The DMV workers were confused, as I was going solely for a Class M (they actually had to take about 10 minutes to look it all up).   


Do I have to take the road test, or is that an oversight? Perhaps I'm reading the DMV page wrong, or missing something?",Iowa,Taking the DMV motorcycle road test

993,helpfulsmile2020,1583588320,fev8bd,Nan,"Hy-Vee, for the first time in my 20+ year career with the company is laying off employees. About a month ago every store director in the company was called to Des Moines for an emergency meeting where over 80 store directors were demoted and received paycuts ranging from 20-45%. They were then tasked to go back to their respective stores and reduce the number of full time employees and cut wages. Some employees were offered positions working overnight at a lower wage, some were reallocated to local Aisles Online fulfillment centers (announced they are shutting those down yesterday), and some were let go on the spot. Experienced, loyal employees were targeted due to their higher wage. 

Failed concepts and programs over the last 10 years have led us to this point. Market Grilles, Clothing &amp; Basin departments, centralizing fresh food production (lower quality), product and celebrity endorsements (Mark Wahlberg), just to name a few. Hy-Vee lost its identity trying to be something it was not. We sacrificed operating a clean, service-oriented grocery store with a wide selection to try and sell you a bath bomb and a sit down meal before you shop.

Hy-Vee operates 4 Aisles Online fulfillment centers in its trade area. 500+ employees at each location will be let go as of March 24th. There are no guarantees of placing existing employees into Hy-Vee stores. 

When you shop at Hy-Vee you are paying a premium, you can get the same items at competitors significantly cheaper. You're paying for the better service and selection that is lost at most retailers today. Hy-Vee is now no different than its competitors other than being priced higher. When you shop your local Hy-Vee, take a look at the employees or lack thereof. Morale is at an all time low, employees who weren't let go now suddenly have 2 or 3 extra jobs to do. Fully stocked shelves with product that is properly rotated and not out of date will be a thing of the past at Hy-Vee. 

With this corporate greed taking place, consider taking your business elsewhere.",Iowa,Hy-Vee Layoffs

But, unfortunately, I still have questions and won't be able to get in to see him again for a while.

I have the petition for name change all done and filled out. All info on there is correct. Meeting with the lawyer, I found out that I had to submit my birth certificate on eFile as an ""Other Event,"" and redact my DOB. However, I noticed after meeting with the lawyer that, on the top of the petition, that ""this form requires protected information and the filing of a separate Protected Information Form. He didn't mention that. And i'm not sure what exactly to do with that form. While I've redacted *my* protected info (my date of birth) on my birth certificate, my mom and dad's DOBs are both still on there.

1060,ImageJPEG,1584028184,fhie9g,Nan,"I visited Des Moines last weekend from Friday to Sunday.

On the night of 3/10 I developed a cough. Nothing crazy sounding.

It continued on yesterday, not running a fever or shortness of breath.

I informed my boss late last night and was basically told to not come into work until I'm cleared up.

Had a doctor's appointment at 8:30 this morning. Was given a flu test - came back negative. Didn't give me a coronavirus test.

Boss told me to stay home until my cough is over, boss thinks COVID-19 is much more widespread than what is officially known.

Still no fever or shortness of breath.

At least I can work remotely.",Iowa,Can't go to work due to a cough

If you go to the stores at this point you are just increasing your risk of infection, dealing with crowds and compounding the problems. 

Basically, those shoppers are becoming part of the problem. We are seeing long lines at Costcos and Hy Vees all over the metro. Basically turning those lines into a petri dish of people. Limit social contact and isolate as much as you can. Its better to be isolated at home alone than to go out to buy supplies now.

1067,urkellurker,1584060084,fhqz0h,Nan,"I was directed by my primary care provider to contact the state health department. I was caller 51 and they called me back after 2 hours. They said they don’t have any test kits and don’t know if or when they will. They directed me to my local county health department. The local dept said the same thing. 

I contacted several different Unity Point facilties and even though they all had a “limited” amount of Coronavirus tests available, they were extremely strict with their policy. You can only be tested if: 1. you recently traveled to one of the high risk countries. 2. You were in direct physical contact with someone who tested positive for Coronavirus. 

This is absurd to me. No one will test positive if no one is taking the tests to begin with! Is there any other way to get tested besides lying and saying I traveled or that I came contact with someone who tested positive?

Moderators of /r/DesMoines:

I am not a public health official or medical professional - merely a concerned Iowan.  People have begun making anonymous posts (two linked below) on /r/DesMoines claiming to have inside knowledge about Covid-19 at area hospitals.  

At best these posts are made by people with actual firsthand knowledge who are exercising poor judgment and spreading this information in a haphazard manner.  At worst, they are individuals intentionally trying to spread fear.  Either way, these posts need to be brought under control.  The moderators of /r/DesMoines need to do whatever is necessary to make sure this subreddit does not become a conduit for misinformation and fear-mongering.

I realize moderating every comment is difficult, but at least moderating top-level posts of this nature is necessary to mitigate this type of misinformation from spreading.

Kimberly Graham is a progressive democrat running for US Senate to defeat Joni Ernst and represent our great state of Iowa. She has lived in rural Iowa the past 24 years and worked as a lawyer to represent abused and neglected children. You can read more about her here: [https://www.kimberlyforiowa.com/meet-kim](https://www.kimberlyforiowa.com/meet-kim) 

Currently, Kimberly Graham has the most name recognition out of any democrat running to unseat Joni Ernst ([https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2020/03/07/joni-ernst-job-approval-below-50-but-plurality-of-likely-voters-say-they-would-definitely-re-elect-h/4977479002/](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2020/03/07/joni-ernst-job-approval-below-50-but-plurality-of-likely-voters-say-they-would-definitely-re-elect-h/4977479002/)). 

If you are looking for an Iowan who will fight for Medicare For All, a Green New Deal, reproductive rights, ending Citizens United, raising the minimum wage, ending Big Ag, and so many issues affecting Iowans, look no further. 

As you might imagine, we are a grassroots movement, our campaign is funded by small dollar donors who believe in our message and is run by passionate activists all across the state.

All I need is your last 12 months of electric usage, which is typically on your bill, and I can do the analysis for you remotely.  Then we can set up a Google Hangout or phone call to talk about how it all works. No need to worry about Coronavirus transmission!

They see city dwellers as a homogonized group even though they have never seen places like southside Chicago with their own eyes.

The changes allowed by the FDA are now reaching effect. National ""reference"" labs have started accepting tests and Iowa hospital systems are now sending lower risk tests to these labs.

Tests for higher risk patients meeting the state's stricter criteria will still go to the State Hygienic Lab in Coralville. These results are a bit faster and are sure to be no charge, even if you have no insurance.

If your doctor wants you to get a test and you don't meet the strict SHL criteria, then the clinic's send-out system will route it to the private national labs. If you have insurance, this should still be free. 

But, please... Trust your healthcare provider's advice. If he/she says you don't need a test, then just follow that advice. There is still a national shortage of some testing chemicals and supplies, so you doctor may feel you don't have enough risk to waste supplies getting a negative test just to make you feel better.

If you have a high risk person in your household, tell your doctor about that. It might be enough to push the decision over the line and get you a test.",Iowa,Getting a coronavirus test if you've been rejected.

Is there anything at all that can be done against us if we don't pay? We really don't care about this and have seen reports of people getting these and just throwing them in the garbage.

I'll start by saying that her office has taken swifter action than many states. I believe this is due to the fact that Iowa essentially went from 0 cases to roughly 16 immediately which jolted them awake.

Many times I've heard Gov. Reynolds say ""if you're sick, stay home"". While true, I am concerned that many Iowans take the inverse to be true by assumption, ""if you're not sick, you dont need to stay home"".  This isn't true, this virus is very stealthy and efficient. Someone could have it and not know it at all, but still be contagious. Someone could be infected for up to 14 days before they get health issues. I think she needs to be honest, and inform the public that you can be ""sick"" before you even know it. Lots of people could make better choices with more clear guidance from leadership.  Essential people of all types are going to have to continue functioning, so non-essential people need to pitch in by staying home. You could be a spreader for 14 days after your last interaction in public.  

The virus also lives on surfaces. Most things say hard surfaces, like metal or plastic, for up to 3 days. That's why you need to wash your hands. I think the Governors office would do well to explain WHY we need to wash our hands. And to emphasize that the virus will die eventually on it's own, which is a good thing. In theory, you could leave an item you obtained in a room for 3 days and hopefully it will be decontaminated.  We CAN slow it down if we start considering these things.

 
Finally, we are all in this together. Help others as best you can.  And take care to slow the spread. 

Thanks and be safe fellow Iowans!",Iowa,Opinion: Gov. Reynolds needs to optimize her message to all Iowans

Tell your Senators and congressional representative how the virus is affecting your life. Encourage them to allocate the funds needed to fight this virus.

Let's face it -- the Federal government has been one to two months behind on this. The shortage of test kits is embarrassing. I read how a patient who had been to a US party returned to South Africa and was tested and came back positive ***in one day!*** 

We in America can't get tested unless we're being hospitalized. The test situation is getting better, but is nowhere near what it should be. 

Our healthcare providers are working with ***home-sewn masks.*** What century is this? 

Thanks to everyone who is helping with the situation, whether you're a emergency worker continuing to risk exposure, a healthcare working helping save lives or one of the many people helping make masks. 

Also, thanks to everyone who is following the stay-home recommendations. Get your kids to follow that rule too. Trust me -- I know how angry they can get about it. Every time you avoid getting the virus, you break a link in the epidemic chain. You're not only protecting yourself and your family, you're helping save lives in Iowa.

Yes, I'm worried that the idiot spring breakers are incubating and spreading the virus right now, but we have dramatic isolation in place.

We're not New York or Chicago. Right now, Iowa's containment is working pretty well. Check the numbers over the next seven days. If we stay on pace at about 5 patients per day, we will be very lucky to be living here.

My family member (Z) got really sick and had to be hospitalized in a small community hospital in Iowa. The physicians decided to test them for Covid and this sample was then supposed to be sent to a secondary testing company called quest. 

A week goes by &amp; no results- then they find out that quest “canceled” the batch of tests?! I’m dumbfounded at this point but luckily my family member has gotten much better and was discharged from the hospital but still- WTF? Does this sound as fishy as I think? I get that having a positive or negative test probably wouldn’t have changed his course of treatment b/c he was able to fight it but this sounds super fraudulent. I’m not really sure who to trust or blame- the small hospital that says they tested him, the larger institution the hospital sent the test to, or the outside laboratory that’s being blamed for “canceling the batch”. 

This doesn’t bode well for my trust in Iowa’s testing capabilities or adequate case tally. I’m just honestly confused and worried. My family member has decided to be safe and remain quarantined as he’s getting better along with his family. But seriously WTF?",Iowa,Covid-19 test canceled by Quest diagnostics?

Most stores are doing replenishment orders 7-10 days out, and they try to do their best not to over purchase on perishable goods. (Produce, milk, eggs, butter, etc) when the initial panic buying began, the replenishment orders coming in only had 3-4 days of forecasted demand, and people were buying 2-3 weeks of product. Starting this weekend, we should see better fulfillment rate because all the retailers are reacting accordingly to the change in demand. However, there’s still issues at the mainland warehouses, they are depleted, and need at least a few weeks to resolve. 

There were also rumors that our ports were closing down, which definitely didn’t help the panic.

Hope this helps and everyone should see much calmer shopping patterns starting this week, and just be patient and give the stores a chance to get caught Up. I am Still  open to help Much more. Whether it’s dropping off groceries or some other task that require labor/transportation.

8. Walmart was out of wipes for the carts but I'm not surprised. I'm sure they're out of them by now.

There was more but the point is people are at walmart acting like it's a normal day and just shopping around.

There were just SO many people there today.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

But there is a movement among healthcare systems to recommend *all* Iowans make/get homemade cloth masks and wear them when out in public. These masks alone are not great at protecting **you from** the virus, but they are good at **protecting others from you.**

COVID-19 can be contagious before you notice symptoms. The early signs can be like allergies or a mild cold. You can spread the disease to your coworkers, friends and family before you know you're sick.

A cloth mask helps. If your mask catches virus-filled droplets from an unexpected cough, that may save one or more people from getting your infection.

###Don't get me wrong: a cloth mask might keep YOU from getting the virus. It isn't fully effective, but it is much better than nothing. 

To fully protect yourself, you'd need an N95 mask, plus training on how to put it on, take it off and disinfect it before reuse. 

Instead, cloth masks let you protect those near you, and gives you some protection, too. For this level of protecting your coworkers, friends and family, all you need is a cloth facemask. You can wash it at night to disinfect.

To learn how to sew a mask, check the website of your local hospital. There are detailed instructions. I've also heard that some fabric shops are donating supplies, even precut and ready to sew.

If you can't sew, consider trying to buy a regular face mask. They're tough to find, but you might get lucky. Also, some hospitals may start giving out extra homemade masks. Cloth masks can be sterilized and reused, so the hospitals will reach a point where they have enough and can start to share.

Keep an eye out for this coming announcement from local hospitals. But, don't wait... Sew a mask for everyone in your family. Then sew more for your local hospital. It will help you and all of Iowa.",Iowa,Iowa Hospitals Beginning to Recommend Cloth Masks for All

# It may be time for everyone to mask up

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is [**having second thoughts about masks**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/health/cdc-masks-coronavirus.html?campaign_id=154&amp;emc=edit_cb_20200331&amp;instance_id=17231&amp;nl=coronavirus-briefing&amp;regi_id=120519662&amp;segment_id=23454&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=e9cb4bb1f113e9ca3c0bce3f0c004be1). For weeks, it (and we) said that ordinary citizens in the U.S. did not need to wear them unless they were sick and coughing or were caring for someone who was.

Now, with the number of cases in the U.S. doubling every three or four days, it looks as though [**that may not have been the best advice**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/health/us-coronavirus-face-masks.html?campaign_id=154&amp;emc=edit_cb_20200331&amp;instance_id=17231&amp;nl=coronavirus-briefing&amp;regi_id=120519662&amp;segment_id=23454&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=e9cb4bb1f113e9ca3c0bce3f0c004be1).

New data cited by Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., shows high rates of transmission by people who are infected but don’t know it yet. An infected person can be contagious for 48 hours before developing symptoms, if they get them at all. Having a mask on could cut down on the number of transmissions from asymptomatic people.

So the C.D.C. is now considering whether to recommend that more people — maybe everybody — wear a mask when out in public.

Not a high-grade N95 medical mask, though. Those are scarce and should still be saved for those who need them most, medical professionals and others on the front lines. One reason the C.D.C. hesitated to advise universal mask-wearing was to avoid making shortages of those masks even worse.

But for this purpose, you don’t need that type; ordinary surgical masks and even homemade masks will do. They will help slow transmission in the community, even though they don’t ensure complete protection for the wearer.

And there’s a side benefit: Wearing any kind of mask, even a bandanna, will make you less likely to touch your face — an important route for infection.

Make your own mask. It isn’t difficult, and you may already have everything you need at home. [**Here’s a guide**](https://www.nytimes.com/article/how-to-make-face-mask-coronavirus.html?campaign_id=154&amp;emc=edit_cb_20200331&amp;instance_id=17231&amp;nl=coronavirus-briefing&amp;regi_id=120519662&amp;segment_id=23454&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=e9cb4bb1f113e9ca3c0bce3f0c004be1).",Iowa,Wear a Mask in Public -- CDC is Now Following What Cedar Rapid's Mercy Medical Center Said Today

*""These numbers feel made up to me. \[Insert location\] had \[insert rumor\] test positive a few days ago, yet it is not showing in \[insert county\].""* 

I replied to one of these in today's post and thought I'd add this here. 

* **Cases are counted where the patient lives**. The person may work somewhere else or be tested somewhere else, but the case count goes to the residing county. (My thanks to the user who pointed this out.)
* **Word of mouth can get messed up quickly**. I exchanged messages with a husband who insisted there were no test kits in all of Cedar Rapids. He insisted for a few days. Nice guy, no bad intent. He checked back with his wife. Turned out, he misunderstood.
* **A lot of healthcare workers have their own health on the line each day -- we would be screaming if the numbers were faked.** Many, many people have visibility into the data. A lot of hospital leaders are watching and planning for when ICUs will fill up. Again: If these numbers were being faked, **we would be screaming.**
* **It would be great if we could test everyone, same day.** 
* **Results in Iowa are running from same-day (two major hospitals) to up to five days.** I'll update this bullet point if I can share any more exact data. 
* **Yes, it can take up to 14 days to develop symptoms, so there are more cases** than what the maps and counts show. But...
* **Scary fact: 20-40% of cases appear to be symptom-free, walking around spreading the virus without knowing it. You, dear reader, might be infectious right now.** That's why there's all the talk about everyone wearing a mask.

I only make these posts as a private individual. I cannot and do not make statements on behalf of my employer. Look at my profile: Some Random Guy.

But I *can* tell you that I'm ass deep in reporting this stuff.  I do these graphs as I can, but I spent the *whole day today* making sure these tests are reported... and I'm not done yet.

The team at Johns Hopkins updates the data multiple times during the day.  Each time you open the map or click on a symbol, you will see the **most recent data** that is hosted on the GIS server.

The map has **multiple GIS overlays** that you can turn on/off/restack.  These overlays include:

\* Cases by county (USA only)

\* Deaths by county (USA only)

\* Cases by state (World)

\* Deaths by state (World)

\* Testing locations (USA)

\* Hospital data (USA)

\* A layer with links to each state’s COVID-19 website (USA)

When the map opens, the overlay layer showing COVID-19 cases by county is displayed.  If you zoom in you should also see blue lines that are the county boundaries.  If those lines do not appear then the federal GIS server hosting that data is likely too busy.

Looking for the legend?  Need help?  Please read the **""Map tips""** \- link in upper left corner. 

If you take a moment to read the ""Map tips"" then you can learn (1) **how to make your own custom map links**, (2) how to make any overlay clickable and (3) learn more about the data the map can display including links to more information about the Johns Hopkins data.

Finally, be careful in interpreting the small yellow and magenta circles on the map.  Together they show counties (or states) where there is less than 10 \*reported\* cases.  There could easily be additional cases in that area that have not been tested.  Remember, people can spread the virus even when they are not showing any symptoms.

I’m going to be quitting or taking a leave of absence because I am not risking my life so someone can come in or get a snack or smoke or a pizza. Especially not for $12/hr plus $2 for working through a pandemic because we’re essential, which is false because they can pay at pump and if not screw off go somewhere else. P.S someone came in and told me and my co-worker that he had it and I told my manger and didn’t seem to care, neglectful. Getting unemployment and $600/week doesn’t sound too bad.

\--------

Sorry for the stress the pandemic is causing you! We all feel your pain. We appreciate the retail workers on the front lines! We know you don't get unemployment if you quit, so you may feel stuck and powerless. 

Here are some facts and ways to protect yourself and your family. 

**General Coronavirus Facts**

* First, don't panic!
* Yes, you've probably already been exposed. In retail jobs, the odds are good.
* 25% of cases have no symptoms. So, you or your co-workers could have the virus and be spreading it to customers. That's an unhappy fact and why customers should stay home.
* Even for those with symptoms, 80% of cases are mild. The younger you are, the better the chance of a mild infection. 

**Recommendations to Protect Yourself in Retail**

* The regular cleaning supplies you have will kill the virus. Just wipe down your work area often. 
* Wear a homesewn, cloth face mask. This gives you a bit of protection, but also protects your coworkers and customers. If you have a no-symptoms infection, those little coughs or everyday sneezes could be spreading the virus. 
* Wear gloves. Cloth work gloves are great. The gloves don't protect you from the virus, unless you have cuts or broken skin. They do help you **notice** when you touch your face. Face touching is the primary way the virus spreads, along with breathing in when an infected person coughs or sneezes near you. 
* If you have glasses, wear them instead of contacts. It helps you not touch your eyes and protects you from sneezes and coughs.
* Try to stay six feet away from your coworkers and customers. This can be difficult in some work environments, but do the best you can.

For the recommendation for cloth, homesewn face masks, you should [watch this video to know how to wear and remove them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OABvzu9e-hw). Washing the face mask at night will kill any virus. Wash or disinfect your hands after touching or removing the mask.

For the gloves, wash or disinfect your hands after you remove them. If  you wear cloth work or gardening gloves, wash them at night to disinfect. When you're using cloth gloves at work, you can use hand sanitizer or disinfectant wipes on them to kill any germs.

When you get off work and get home, consider yourself contaminated. Without sitting down (if possible), take off your clothes and wash them immediately. If you can't, place them in a laundry basket and be sure nobody touches them until you can do the wash. After removing your clothes or doing the laundry, wash your hands. 

After removing your ""contaminated"" work clothes, consider taking a shower. At the least, wash or disinfect your hands.

If have to sit down to remove your clothes, do so on a wood or plastic chair. Wash down or disinfect the chair after your done. 

**Work With Your Manager or Higher Leadership**  
Present these recommendations to your manager and encourage that all staff use these guidelines. If you manager won't let you wear the cloth mask and gloves, consider calling your local health department and discuss these recommendations. Ask the local health department if they can call the manager or company leadership to push for you.

Ask your management if the company will hire someone to sew cloth face masks for the staff. Disposable masks are being reserved for healthcare workers and patients. If the company won't do this, make a mask for yourself or find someone who can sew to do it. (See below for instructions.)

**Recommendation If You Are Higher Risk or You Live With Someone Higher Risk.**  
Higher risk people are:

* Those over 65 years old and older;
* Those with chronic health conditions. 

See [this CDC guidance for more details](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fpeople-at-higher-risk.html). If you are higher risk, contact your doctor for guidance. You may not be able to keep working retail without significant danger.

If you live with or care for a higher-risk person, you and that person have some tough choices to make. Ideally, a different job would be best. If you must keep working retail, be sure to use all the protection steps listed above. 

**If You Have Proven COVID-19 Exposure**  
If someone at your work site tests positive for the virus, your company should consider sending you home for 14 days on paid leave. The company should also do a deep-clean of the work site. The company will probably already be working with the local health department on this. If your company isn't following these guidelines. call your local health department. 

To find your local health department or get more information in Iowa, call 2-1-1. That hotline is running 24/7.

""When you think about the use of public health mitigation strategies, which is what we have right now while we await additional tools like medications or vaccines, these strategies have to be put in place carefully and consistently in order for them to be effective. So in some ways it wouldn't be enough if somebody you know just sort of stopped in place for two weeks. What we would do in that situation is delay a peak. And what we're trying to do is flatten that peak. It's not that I want to push it out, it's that I want to keep as many people as healthy as possible for as long as possible. And so that's in part why we think about using the strategies we have, and also why, I know this has been a hard time for everybody, but it is so important that we all remind each other wash our hands, cover our coughs, and stay home when we're sick.

---

&gt; Dear digitaltransmutation,



&gt; In response to social distancing directives issued by federal, state and local government officials working to slow the spread of Coronavirus (COVID‑19), Mediacom is implementing new precautionary measures related to service installation and repair appointments.

&gt; We are asking for your assistance because we know you share in our commitment to helping prevent the spread of this virus.

&gt; Our goal with these new measures is to keep both you and our employees safe by limiting in‑home contact between our technicians and members of your household.

&gt; * New Appointments: Before scheduling a new installation or repair appointment, Mediacom will ask if you or someone in the household can assist in completing the interior work related to your requested install or repair. If you answer ""yes"", the appointment will continue as scheduled. If you answer ""no"", the appointment may need to be rescheduled.

&gt; * Pre‑call and Appointment Changes: Before your scheduled appointment, you will receive a pre‑call from Mediacom to confirm your appointment. Once at the appointment location, the Mediacom technician will alert you to his or her arrival and then proceed to complete all necessary work outside the home. Upon completion of the exterior work, the Mediacom technician will ask for your assistance in completing work inside your home.

&gt; * Your assistance: From a position of at least 10 feet outside the entrance to the home, our technician will provide you with instructions on how to activate or repair your Mediacom services. These instructions may include a combination of verbal, written, pre‑recorded video or live chat video directions. Your assistance will be critical in these final steps in order to make sure your services are working correctly. Any equipment needed to complete the installation or repair will either be shipped to your home before the appointment or dropped off at your doorstep by the technician.

&gt; * Electronic Instructions: Included with the equipment will also be written installation instructions. Additional instructions and troubleshooting tips can be found using the following links:

&gt;    * Connecting new equipment: Internet, In‑home Wi‑Fi &amp; Phone set‑up, Wireless Network set‑up, and Video TiVo and HD equipment set‑up.

&gt;    * Troubleshooting tips: How‑to Videos, Internet or Phone repair, Optimizing Internet speed, and Answer Center.

&gt;    * Digital Tools: Download our MediacomConnect MobileCARE app or visit us online and log in to your account at Mediacom Support. You can manage your billing account, troubleshoot services, check for outages, control your home Wi‑Fi service, and more!

&gt;    * Text Care: Text us at 66554 and talk to our digital assistant Molli with questions about your account. And if Molli cannot help you, she will connect you to a live agent.

&gt; Please know we are advising our technicians to enter customer homes only when absolutely necessary and only after the customer has verified that no one in the home has exhibited any signs of illness. Additionally, to help facilitate governmental directives, Mediacom is currently prioritizing requests related to installation and loss of essential services only. If you call to make a service appointment that deals with a non‑essential issue, we may not be able to accommodate your service request at this time.

&gt; As the situation continues to evolve, so will our plans for how we support you and our employees. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience these new precautionary measures may cause you, but we believe they are for the collective good of everyone.

&gt; Thank you for being our customer and for your continued trust in Mediacom to keep you connected.

&gt; Please stay safe and healthy.

&gt; Sincerely,

1686,Blaze5546,1586200425,fw4wyv,Nan,"Throughout this pandemics development, Governor Reynolds has had a fair amount of backlash due to her decision to hold off on issuing a Stay At Home order. I personally support this decision for many reasons and would like to share with others so that others may consider keeping an open mind and trust in our governor. 

The first reason is in regard to the workforce. Many are pushing to have Governor Reynolds to issue this Stay At Home order, but as per the Governor’s daily public addresses, nearly 80% of the workforce would be deemed essential, limiting the actual impact a Stay At Home order in the state of Iowa. 

The second reason is in the actual effectiveness of a Stay At Home order. It is nearly impossible with our current police force to enforce everyone to stay home 100% of the time. It simply would not be effective or efficient in any capacity to enforce by threat of punishment. Governor Reynolds has already issued a proclamation limiting gatherings of 10 or less individuals. I may be naive but I do hope we as a state can be trusted to listen to officials and not need the babysitting of a Stay At Home order. 

My third point is in regard to many people citing Dr. Fauci’s teaching in the situation. While I do believe Dr. Fauci definitely knows what he is doing, he is only able to go off of models and models are representative of the data in our current situation and can be trusted to a certain point. In the Data Science discipline, models are trusted but must be viewed at with understanding that outside sources can change models in a moments notice. This point exposes a potential flaw in models that don’t necessarily make them unusable, but rather means you must handle them just as Governor Reynolds has, setting benchmarks and when the benchmarks are hit, respond appropriately. Not looking at models and potentially overreacting with data that may as well not be representative of the current situation and the future situation. I compare it to the forecast of weather. We understand the weather much more than we do of COVID-19 and it’s development and trends so why do we trust those models more than we do of weather models that are multiple months out? Again I do not completely throw out the predictive models as they do have a lot of predictive power, but they should be applied with logic and utilize Data Science understanding just as Governor Reynolds and her administration has done.

In short, I believe that Governor Reynolds and her administration has done a great job in dealing with the COVID-19 situation.
