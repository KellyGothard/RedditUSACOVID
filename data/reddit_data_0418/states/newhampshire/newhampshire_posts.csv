6,6,litmas69,1577818981,ei77f4,Nan,"Hi all! Can anyone tell me about the concord and General New Hampshire. I got a job offer in Concord and I’m highly considering moving to N.H. from Long Island. I work in Brooklyn and live on NY, and I hate it. Every day I commute over 3 hours to work in the city where I just get destroyed with taxes. I have to live with my parents because it is literally impossible to find a place WITH roommates for less than 1200 dollars. Forget about living on your own. I also love nature and don’t wanna have to drive 3 hours to see the mountains. These are some of the reasons I’m debating on moving to New Hampshire. My question is, if you live in concord or near concord, how do you like it? Are there any nicer towns to reside in near concord? Are people friendly? I am moving here on my own with absolutely no friends or contacts in the area so that’s a concern of mine. How do you feel the scenery is? Is there a lot of tourism? How’s the traffic? I don’t expect you to answer all these questions but if you could give me a general idea/ your feelings I would appreciate it so much! Thank you all(:",newhampshire,"Moving to Concord from LI, NY"

64,64,DebbieWinner,1578509507,elwz2w,Nan,"Hey all, so I've made the decision to move to the Granite state. I did originally for the first 16 years of my life grow up just outside of Nashua in Merrimack. I found the area nice to grow up in. My junior year of high school we moved to Portland Maine. Portland was much more city like, and somehow, COLDER. 

Anyways, I still live in Maine but want to move back to the Granite state. I need the laid back lifestyle again that Portland doesn't offer. While Merrimack is on my list, I'm looking for more options on places to live and could use some guidance as I really only know Merrimack and barely Nashua. Not planning to live in Nashua or Manchester though as I don't want a city. 

So, here are things I am looking for/my current thoughts. I appreciate any and all advice given.

\- Im a 22 yo millennial with 15K in savings, hoping to not spend much more than $1200 a month on rent. I will likely have a roommate, but if not my father has offered to pay half the rent for my first 6 months of living. Job is a bit up in the air, but ill worry about that on my end. I have plenty of serving experience but also may look for different kind of work.

\- Not looking for the city life. Im generally socially anxious, but I don't want COMPLETE isolation. I don't need to live in Colebrook, no offense to those that do. 

\- Close to mountains. Id like to get into hiking, but in general I LOVE walking. Not super in shape so I am not a major runner but walking/hiking every weekend/every other weekend sounds rejuvenating and relaxing. 

\- Not to contradict myself, but if possible, outside of, but relatively close to one of the 4 major cities (Concord, Nashua, Manchester, or Portsmouth) 

\- Need internet service 

\- Movies. I LOVE going to the movies. Portland is very artsy and cultured, so every indie film I want to see plays near me. I love going to the movie, typically go a few times a month but don't really see a lot of the ""blockbuster"" type films. Movie's are a very important escape to me. 

\- Golf scene. Preferably a golf course nearby. I don't need anything fancy. 

\- Relatively easy highway access 

\- Any gay scene is a bonus but again socially anxious dude here so not looking to settle down anytime soon, just need a new place to live. 

&amp;#x200B;

So with all that being said, it may not consolidate all my thoughts into 1 but that should give you a general idea of what I am looking for in living. I really want a relaxed atmosphere if at all possible. A few locations I have in mind based on what I have said here are (in no order): 

Merrimack 

Lincoln 

Hudson 

Hooksett 

Hennicker 

Loudon

I am planning to move to NH with my girlfriend in April. She will be going to nursing school and I am hoping to get into flight school to become a helicopter pilot. I visited cr helicopters in Nashua and am highly considering it. 

We will hopefully be living rent free for a good chunk of time, although it would either be in Manchester or Walpole so school will be a bit of a commute for both of us  since school for my gf will be in Keene. 

I am trying to figure out what to do for work while there to be able to save up money and be able to chip away at flight school without taking out too big of a loan. I’m 27 and do not have a degree, which is frustrating but also why I’m going to flight school to end up in a solid career. 

I’m looking for somewhere to work that pays great and has health benefits. Something that doesn’t require a degree. I’ve thought about working for ups and trying to work my way up to a driver. I assume these sort of jobs exist there but I’m just unfamiliar with the area and would love any insight/leads anyone has. I have a lot of Restraunt/Bar/Event experience and currently working as a ski/snowboard instructor for people with disabilities. Would prefer not to work as a server or bartender. Maybe bartend part time on weekends or something for extra cash though. 

Anyone know of any jobs that fit my needs in Manchester or Nashua area? I think it would be helpful to work in Nashua so that I could get flight time both before and after work but also am open to anything that seems reasonably close to where we will be living.

The app said my deposit failed because my bank “doesn’t allow deposits for sports wagering.” Meanwhile, I logged into my bank and there is a hold of $100 for the deposit that failed. 

Anyway, I’m just curious if others are having similar experiences. I get that sports betting is new in NH and there are kinks to be worked out, but this app seems terrible.",newhampshire,Has anyone tried the new sports betting service?

I live in a shitty apartment in Rochester.  The landlord doesn’t mind when I pay rent late and is usually understanding of circumstances.  Up until this point, I’ve worked three jobs and was able to make ends meet.  I recently got a letter of acceptance for the Shipyard and have been waiting to start there, but going without a paycheck is killing me.  I do have a side gig cleaning houses but it doesn’t pay nearly enough.  Long story short, I’m now two months behind on rent.  I haven’t “officially” been given a “Demand for Rent” letter or an eviction letter but my landlord is pretty insistent on asking for the rent.  He knows I’m about to start on the shipyard but an agreement is an agreement and I haven’t paid my rent so I understand where he’s coming from... 

I guess I’m just asking if anybody knows of any programs or anything out there.  I’m in strafford county, and there’s a program called the “Share Fund” that could potentially help with my rent but they require an eviction notice or a demand for rent letter which I haven’t gotten yet.  Other programs are generally more focused on paying security deposits.

dude got pulled over back in August with like a .24 BAC. the arresting officer said he reeked of alcohol and even had a container in his car that had booze in it. dude tried to fight it, or say that it wasn't that big of a deal. tried to apologize, tried to seek forgiveness from his family, God, his constituents, or whoever pretended to give a shit.

as a resident of Merrimack county, I've been aware of the news surrounding this issue, specifically the appallingly high BAC at the time of his arrest. im just honestly curious, how in the name of Christ is he allowed to be back in office right now?  

.....there is a major problem when someone who is in such a position of power is able to commit such an egregious crime against everything they are standing for and enforcing, yet maintain their job.

IMO, he should be humiliated so badly &amp; widely that it prevents him from ever being able to seek meaningful employment in the area ever again.  yet there are all sorts of courts and legal bullshit and lawyers and all that other dumb horseshit that allows him to have second chances. yeah, sure. we all make mistakes, but he is a fucking sheriff. The top echelon. The cream-of-the-crop, the ""king of law enforcement"". The ultimate one who abides by each and every law, every second of every day. and this is the crap we get?

yet if a citizen like you or I were arrested for being THAT FUCKING DRUNK behind the wheel, not only would be lose our license, but also likely our job as a result, and likely any other potential future prospects of employment or self transportation.

the guy is garbage.

I am otherwise young and healthy. Today (Sunday) things came to a head when I fainted multiple times and couldn't keep any liquids down. Fearing for my health, I went to the nearest ER. I was seen for a total of 5 minutes. Dr. Blum stated that my vitals weren't  ""that bad"" and I didn't ""look dehydrated."" He did not run any tests. I requested lab work, urine testing, observation, head CT, anything. He declared my situation non-emergent. I requested to see another provider and was DENIED because the almighty Dr. Blum was certain and REFUSED to let me be seen by the nurse practitioner. After advocating for myself as much as I could, I was told that there was absolutely nothing else they would do. I fainted in the waiting room on my way out the door and hit my head on the concrete ground. The charge nurse and nurse supervisor continued to tell me that nothing could be done in the emergency room, even after hitting my head, and I was sent home with a giant, bruised egg on my forehead.

Long time lurker here, I absolutely love this subreddit- very valuable resource for information. I’m born and raised in NH. I figure you guys might be the ones to ask a question I have. 

So me and my girlfriend (both mid 20s) are getting a 20ft yurt in late spring and are moving to southern Maine for my work (federal law enforcement). We are planning to stay in the area for 2-3 years. Because of such a short time being there we were hoping to be able to find a small plot of land to rent from maybe a large farm in exchange for money/help around or a combination of the two. 

We both have knowledge of most farming/livestock practices and would be a benefit to the land- not a liability. I’m a veteran as well and have a “no quit, get it done” attitude. None of our structures are permanent and/or make a permanent mark on the land. 

We are having trouble finding a way to meet up with and talk with local large land owners who might consider this, and are hoping perhaps somebody here can point us in the right direction or might know somebody in that area- Within an hour (preferably) of Kittery Maine (south western portion of the state) for us that translates to the Portsmouth area. 

Thank you all very much for your time and help! If there’s any more questions ask away and I’ll respond when I can.",newhampshire,Rural Land for rent/use

I miss late night grocery stores that were open till 1-2am. And what’s with separate liquors stores? It’s just adding a trip!

I miss grids. And road signs. There’s rarely any direct way to get anywhere and half the streets aren’t marked.

It’s weird how I can go from a large town, to pastures, to city in 30-45 minutes. Actually it’s really weird to me.

I miss ranch style homes... and yards. What is it with homes being 2ft from the street, but a mile from your neighbor? 

The weirdest thing to me is that in a few hours you can drive through a multitude of different states. 

It’s interesting how all the cars are new. In Cali it wasn’t uncommon for someone to daily a 1970 something Ford.

14 years on and I still feel like I’m in a strange, weird, truly different world.

But I will say, it is beautiful out here. Even the coldest night as I get out of my car, to go inside my house after a long day at work, I’m stunned at just how bright the moon can be, or how many stars are in the sky. I always stop to take it in. 

I miss my pines and my firs, but it’s pretty swell to see the trees change color.

Beach pizza truly is delicious as is homemade ice cream, and it makes the summertime worth the wait.

Hey everyone! Born and raised New Hampshirite, here again, to bring awareness to and promote this resident's program. I apologize if I'm breaking any rules or ruffle feathers by posting but I believe in this program and want to see it spread so we can help improve the experience of living and visiting New Hampshire.

The program is called NH Rocks (nhrocks.com) and the site itself acts as an activity aggregate, connecting you with things to do in the 603. I'm still trying to expand the database to include even more activities but I'm fairly happy with our current list. I'm hoping this will eventually be the go-to resource for all things ""play"" in New Hampshire and you'll never have to ask ""what is there to do?"" again!

&amp;#x200B;

[Our LOGO and URL](https://preview.redd.it/y2vt76ny7cd41.png?width=3300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cfd4c3dfc4ce5bb480a99ea3333ac04d2ac0257)

If you are a resident of New Hampshire, this part of the program is what I am most excited about. It's called the Locals Card. You can think of it as an annual membership program that unlocks discounts at participating businesses for a full year. We launched this product in February of last year but already have 55 locations participating (including some that aren't quite built-out yet, like Teatoatller coming to Concord). Some of the discounts are 50% off an app (Kettlehead and Twin Barns Brewing), $400 off Clear Correct (Lakeside Smiles), Spend $25+, get $5 off (The Pint), and a splattering of 10% off, 15% off, etc. To get a Locals Card you need a valid driver's license (tried finding another option but this was the only real document that didn't have loopholes. All information is deleted when the card is printed) and $20. The discounts are repeatable where applicable. So, you get 15% off your morning coffee at 48 Main Street (Meredith) each visit, or 25% off Evo Rock + Fitness (Concord) day passes each visit, as examples. You can see a full list here: [https://nhrocks.com/locals](https://nhrocks.com/locals)

&amp;#x200B;

[The 2020 Locals Card](https://preview.redd.it/5tuv9hab8cd41.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b046dfd0ad44e238706e2cf0b9fb9da8ea405be4)

As the program grows I want to launch a tourism card and increase free events (well, free for residents) across the state by working with local community-focused organizations. This last fall we began hosting these events and have a few coming up in Feb, including another Throwback Game Night at Backyard Brewery, A Board Game Night at Twin Barns, and our first One Year Field day (Feb 22 at Barn Door Hostel in Rumney). At each of our events, you can purchase the card on-site as a way to get a card without digitizing your license. Honestly, we don't want to be liable for that information. 

If you are a business owner, I'd love to have you join the Locals Card (Thanks for joining last time, Area 23!), send a message on over and we can go from there! There is a cost to businesses but I made sure to over-deliver at each service tier and we lean on the profits from the Locals Card to help minimize these costs.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

I have really put in maximum effort to design this program to act as a ""rising tide"" for all parties involved as I simply aim to help. I am happy to field any questions, comments, concerns, feedback, etc... It seems this post has become longer than anticipated, sorry, I got carried away. Thank you for reading!",newhampshire,NH Rocks

My boss is looking into getting group employee portraits done.  Were a small business, only 6 of us total, 2 females and 4 males.

He was looking for someone who does those vintage, old west style photography.  With the costumes and props and all that jazz.  

We're looking for someone that can come and take the photos of the staff in front of our building, but we cant find any photographer that travels for something like this.

Were thinking they dont exist in NH, but I thought it was worth a shot to ask here and see if maybe there was something/someone we didnt know about.

307,307,user121008,1580554295,ex4hla,Nan,"Livng in a small town rural area, I've learned that the road crew is one of the most powerful parts of the local government. They can greatly impact anything within the right of way, drastically altering the nature and scenery of a given property.

I've heard stories of road crews behaving vindictively towards some residents while not holding others to the same standard. Such as removing trees without any warning or reason other than that they were in the right of way.

Is it not possible that the road crew is corrupt? Can they be taking these trees to feed their woodstoves? Have they damaged your driveway and roadside in substandard plowing and grading efforts? Is your local roadcrew as unfriendly and spiteful as I suspect mine are?

I wouldn't want to say more because I fear my road crew. They have the power to make life difficult for us way beyond aesthetics, and they're paid by our taxes.

 **DURHAM, N.H.** – University of New Hampshire interim head football coach **Ricky** **Santos** announced the addition of 11 commitments on National Signing Day. That brings the total Class of 2020 to 20 student-athletes who signed a national letter of intent to join the Wildcats football program this fall.  
   
""Our assistant coaches did a phenomenal job of putting in the work and building relationships with these young men over the last year,"" Santos said. ""This will add a lot of positional competition to the group we already have in place.  
   
""We added some big linemen with toughness and demeanor up front and guys on the defensive side of the ball who can really rush the passer,"" Santos added.

TL:DR--It was actually a pretty good experience, and with the free trial, if you're in the service area, it's worth a try!

I live in the delivery are for the Rochester Walmart, so this review is based on my experience with that one.  Can't tell you if the other WMs provide the same level of service.  I've used it two times so far.

I signed up for the free 15 day trial.  After that, it will cost 98 bucks per year for unlimited deliveries (minimum order of $30).  There is also a monthly plan, $12.95 for that.  You don't need to get either of these plans; if you want to get a delivery only once or twice, the fee is 7.95 or 9.95, depending on the time slot you choose.

They are offering $10 off your first order (minimum $50) with a coupon code (more on that near the end), and they also have a refer-a-friend plan. (PM me if you want a link to get a coupon--then I'll get a coupon too)

The website interface was easy to use.  My strategy was to search for all my usual products, and add them to ""Favorites"" by clicking on the little heart.  This was a huge time-saver for making up my shopping cart, because now I have a kind of master list that I can use to quickly add what I need to my cart.  I found the whole process to be fairly quick and easy. (It was a lot simpler than the website for Hannaford's  pickup service.)

During the ordering process, there is a point at which I could choose which products I would allow substitutions for.  There was a list of the items with check marks pre-filled beside them all.  Anything I did NOT want substitutes for I un-checked.

There is an option to reserve a delivery time slot before you make up your order--I didn't do this, but I assume it holds the spot for you for a couple hours while you make up your list.  I chose to select my delivery time when I placed my order.

Time slots are available from 8 am to 8 pm, seven days a week.  If it's early enough in the day, and there are still slots available, it's possible to get a delivery the same day.  I chose to have it done the next day, and I picked 2-3 pm as my time slot.  I did this on both a Sunday and a Wednesday.

Once the order is placed, I had a few hours during which I could make changes or add items.  I did this on my second order and it was super easy.  I just added the forgotten item to my cart, and there was a button for adding it to my order in progress.

When placing the order, I had the option of providing my cell number, which gave me the option of getting a text alert when the delivery was on it's way.  I did so.

On Sunday, I got a text at 1:41, with an estimated arrival time of 1:46 (earlier than I expected!).  There was also a link to a tracking map, so I saw in real time exactly where the driver was.  (I also was told his first name).  I waited outside for about 30 seconds when he arrived. On Wednesday, the text came at 1:34!  I don't know if drivers are always so early--maybe they give themselves extra time in case they hit traffic problems.  

The driver was very nice (seemed like a retired gentleman--he was the delivery driver both times), and took the bags out of his trunk for me, gave me a card with the refer-a-friend details and the name of the WM employee who did the shopping, and when the groceries were unloaded, I signed on his cell phone, and that was it.  I didn't ask for or expect any help carrying the groceries in.  After I got the final receipt, I could rate the driver (thumbs up or down) and give a tip if I wanted to.

I mostly ordered shelf-stable stuff--canned goods, etc.  I also got some produce, milk, eggs, packaged deli meat, cheese, and frozen vegetables.

The produce was very good quality--I would have picked out the same or similar for myself.  In the first order, I wanted organic bananas and got non-organic.  Not a big deal, but there is a price difference, so I wanted to correct that (see below).  The second order was perfect, no mistakes.  One item in the first order was substituted--spicy chicken cup noodles instead of spicy beef.  Not a big deal at all.

The milk and cheese were fine, well within the sell-by dates. The eggs were fine, though I noticed one later with a small dent in it.  I probably wouldn't have noticed it even if I picked it out myself.  Frozen veg were fine--still frozen.  The deli meats were also fine.  (Note: I don't like the meat in WM's meat dept., so I probably will never get any, but the pre-packaged stuff is okay.  Well, as good as it can be anywhere, that is.)

So, I mentioned the bananas earlier.  Once I got the final receipt in my email (there's also an app), I was able to report any problems.  I selected the bananas as having an issue, and I could choose from several options--missing, poor quality, didn't like substitution, and a couple others.  There was no option for ""I got the wrong version of the thing I wanted and therefore overpaid by 52 cents,"" so I picked missing item.  They just refund the entire price of that item!  I contacted customer service about this, and said I really just wanted my 52 cents, but found out that if there's a problem like this--wrong price applied--I should call them for an adjustment.  The online system is automated to simply refund the whole price of items.

I mentioned coupon codes at the beginning of this.  I used a code that they emailed me before I placed my first order.  I entered it, saw it on my order before I clicked the final ""place order"" button, and it somehow dropped off and didn't apply.  I contacted customer service and they sent me a new code which I used successfully on my second order.  

If you'd like a link to a coupon code (which will also benefit me!)  send me a PM and I'll give it to you.  You get $10 off your first delivery order of $50 or more, and I get $10 off too.  (I can only get 10 referral coupons in a year)",newhampshire,I tried Walmart's delivery service. Here's my review.

I currently am a residential service plumber in Austin, Texas. We’ve decided to relocate, and are considering New Hampshire. My current position is 100% commission, as is almost every other company in town (I hate it). I’m wondering if any plumbers in New Hampshire could tell me about pay and good companies to work for.

You do not have to choose a political party in order to vote in the Democratic Primary Election.

You can be

* Registered as a Democrat; or
* An undeclared or Independent voter.

If you are an undeclared voter, you may vote in the Democratic Primary by temporarily changing your affiliation to Democrat at the polling place before casting your vote. You may change your affiliation back to “undeclared,” at the polling place before you leave. Either way, you can change your affiliation back to an undeclared voter at a later date.

Unfortunately, if you are registered as a Republican, you may not change your party registration in time for the Primary Election, and therefore you cannot vote in the Democratic Primary.

I understand things will be different, I just don't want it to be hard to go out or meet some people (I don't know anyone on the east coast).

I live in NH and work for a company in MA. I work from home two days a week every week. I learned that I can apportion my income on my MA tax return as only the money I make while working in the office is taxable. I understand the formula is income x (days WFH in NH/working days) and I see that there is a workbook to fill all that in on the MA non-resident Form 1. My question is - do I need to itemize the exact dates I worked from home or is a letter from my employer simply stating that they allow work from home enclosed with my Form 1 enough?

558,558,zrawk,1581624708,f3g19o,Nan,"I've lived in New Hampshire for less than a year but I'm in need of some real help. In September of 2018, I took a buyout from my old company and bought a farm in Farmington. It's been my dream to save enough money to build a house on the property (currently there is no livable structure). I started working at the local high school and loved every minute of it, took pride in my work and tried to make everything work until I found something that pays more and uses more of my experience. By early January, a staffing agency helped me find what I thought was going to be a great long term career selling heavy equipment for a company nearby.

I started working there a few weeks ago and immediately began to notice the owner had a temper problem. She would scream at other employees and I witnessed her throw tools in her garage. I like to think that I am very thick skinned, but it began to evolve into calling me ""stupid"" and ""retarded."" She would regularly use racist language in private, and even referred to another customer with the n word. Even though I am white, I took great offense to her using that language, and I let her know. She immediately began to treat me worse, culminating in an argument involving the mishandling of her mail (part of my job was to pick up her mail from the post office, which she then accused me of ""going through her mother's mail""), her openly wondering ""what I really do"" when she's not around, how I wasted time trying to sell a customer on a piece of equipment that ""he never would have bought in the first place"" (he wanted to see it), and when I asked her for information on a piece of equipment she wanted me to inventory, she screamed it, while changing her tone to make her sound mentally disabled, then called me a ""fucking retard.""

I talked to the staffing agency about this and asked if they could help me by trying to reason with the owner. I felt the verbal abuse I was taking was well beyond that of anything I have ever been through, but I still agreed to go in if the agency would mediate first. She agreed and called the owner. An hour later she informed me that the owner was letting me go. The agency did say that she would try to find me another position, but as I'm in the second week of unemployment, with bills and rent looming, I can't wait much longer. If anyone can help, I'm trying to find a job in the $40k-$45k area that would be a role in sales, but obviously my aspirations are to make more than that. I have a long history with corporate level food sales, including merchandising, brokerage, trade shows, sampling, among many other roles. I'm very good at gaining customers who are primed to say no. I've worked supervisor and management positions as well, and have a lot of experience working with Microsoft Office suite. I helped to build a company making less than a quarter million dollars a year into a company that was making three times that by the time  I took my buy out, and I credit a lot of that work towards how we marketwd ouraelves on the internet. I took a lot of extra classes and courses on my own time to improve my knowledge of SEO and online marketing methods, and can easily work with ads on Google, Bing, Craigslist, and Facebook. I'm also very familiar with DOT regulations and have my DOT physical card, and I've trained people on how to properly circle check a truck. I'm detailed, I work well under high stress situations, I'm never late, I'm never distracted, I'm organized, and my clients always like me.

So I'm wondering if anyone out there might be able to help point me in a good direction? Someone I can give my resume to? Please help!!",newhampshire,HELP! I NEED A JOB! ::PLEASE READ::

It's been obvious that there has been increased activity on the subreddit recently, mostly in regards to the lead up of the primaries last week. There's obviously been more spam and trolls which I know affects the quality of a small subreddit pretty quickly.

I'm only speaking for myself, but I do keep an eye on the subreddit and take action on comments and posts as needed, though I will say there is a purposeful light touch in regards to the style of moderation. I work full-time and have a life outside the sub so I can't monitor it constantly. Post removals may take up to a day until I take a look at the subreddit again.

If anything is related to New Hampshire in any fashion, the post most likely won't be removed and I'll ignore any reports about it, unless they are truly valid reports (threatening, etc). Even if the post is reported as ""spam"" there is often a thorough discussion within and I'm not going to hamper that by removing the post.

If something is really flagrant and inappropriate, send a message to me or the mods as a whole and I'll get a notification on my phone for it. There are no notifications for reports. I admit I don't always respond if I don't think it's worthy of removal.

In regards to users who comment in less than agreeable ways, I'm not going to do anything unless it's inherently threatening, explicit, etc. There are tools and resources to hide and block content you don't want to see or agree with. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I hope everyone's having a pleasant day.",newhampshire,A moderator statement

I'm literally willing to knock off price of septic system (quoted $12k) but I have no idea best way to approach this.

Should I come off market and have the septic system done, should I do another price drop until I find a buyer who is more willing, or should I explain in disclosure my offer of $12k to re-do system for buyer?

So the wife and I will be in NH in t-minus 7 days (Feb 28).  To say we are excited is a huge understatement. Can't wait for the fall (we're leaf peepers, sorry).

Have a couple questions though.  Will be commuting from Epping to Portsmouth beginning mid-March.  How bad is it in the winter, really?  I was there on the 8th and all the roads were plowed and clear.  Is that not typical after a mild snowfall? How soon do the plows get the side roads during/after a storm for morning commuters (say I have to be at work at 7:30am, will leaving at 6:50-7:00 be enough time)?  Have a front wheel drive sedan (AWD SUV if I take the wife's), from CO so I know how to drive in the snow but would like to keep the car at least until the fall and trade it in for a AWD model at the end of August.  Since there's no sales tax and no tax on inventory how on earth do you get leverage and negotiate car prices with dealers out there? What's an average LP monthly cost for heating a single family home around 2,000 sqft, two adults?  Heard about the 11 day ice storm power outage...are power issues common in rural/residential areas?

I wanted to follow up on my job search. I still am looking for a permanent career but I did take a job recently with American Flagging. Its obviously not a long term thing and I think they realize that. The hours are very sporadic and there's no guarantee you'll actually work your shift. They started me with barely an interview though, and the next day. Very strange hiring practice but fortunate that they called me anyways. I'd recommend it if you need something fast, just don't expect it to pan out into 40+ hours. Last week I worked two days...

I'm also doing some sales work again for my former company that I helped build. I'm cutting great deals for grease trap and fryer oil recycling (or at least I'm trying....). I'm also willing to snake drain lines at residential houses in the area for great low rates.

Continuing with my job search, I've found that there are plenty of staffing agencies that will look for jobs for you. The one who had gotten me the original job, Staffhunters out of Portsmouth, are very nice. Despite that job not working out, I wouldn't badmouth Staffhunters for that. They were professional and tried to find me other opportunities (though nothing has panned out yet...). Leddy Group out of Concord were also nice, and I had a very friendly interview with the Nagler Group. There are PLENTY of staffing agencies and I'd encourage anyone looking for a job to at least do an interview with them. I guess my lesson from my experience is, if they send you for an interview, to vette your future boss or company before you take the job. I didn't, and I seriously wish that I had.

A few people reached out with some great suggestions. Thank you. I have found a few interviews for sales positions in the area, but obviously I'm still waiting for that ""final interview."" There is plenty of work to be had, and I'm hoping I will find something soon. It's an incredibly stressful process and there's no clear cut outcome yet. I'm still open to hearing from anyone if they may know of sales positions in the seacoast area to send them my way.

I did want to touch on something from my previous post. I think that if you do a search for ""equipment sales"" in Lebanon Maine, you will find the employer that was abusive towards me. I'm not interested in naming names, I don't think that's professional at all. Also, partially, it's borne out of fear. I do not know if this person knows where I live, and I know they own a firearm. I do believe this sociopath has the capability to retaliate.

I do still wonder if I made the right decision. With bills looming and rent due on Saturday, my anxiety has peaked. I've gone three weeks now without a paycheck, and I'm not sure when I'll see my first check for the temp work I'm doing now. Part of me still wonders if I should have tolerated the abuse and racism from the owner, at least to have a paycheck coming in. What a messed up world. It's sad to think that I have to either decide between taking the abuse in stride or quitting and being broke/homeless. Again, this isn't abuse from a client or a customer, this was from the de facto owner of the company. There was no changing the situation, no one else to talk to. I was stuck.

Thanks for reading. I'll update again should I find a permanent career. If anyone has any desire to help me out with bill money, my Venmo is @zrawk. I need $1100 for rent on Saturday and I'm still not sure where it's going to come from. Very scary times....",newhampshire,HELP! I NEED A JOB! ::please read:: PART 2

A little background: I am from Poland. Ever since I can remember, I was in love with New York City and the USA in general. It is probably the city I know most about without ever having set foot in it. Now, being quite a few years older, I don't think I want to live in NYC (for many, many reasons) but close enough to be able to visit, should I ever manage to make the move to the US. 

After looking at many different factors like laws, criminal statistics, politics, taxes etc, I settled on the beautiful state of New Hampshire. I'm not going to omit the fact that I am in love with your state's motto. When I read about it the first time I might or might not have gotten a little teary-eyed. It has been my dream to become a US citizen for many many years now, and if that's not possible, at least a part time resident. I am trying to nudge my future in that direction and that wish has not diminished over time.

Now to my way too specific, way too early question:
I'd like to live in a brick house. I have always preferred this building material to anything else, due to the fact that it is not only beautiful, but allows to build safe, climatically well regulated homes. Seeing as the most houses I found for sale in NH are turn of the century, wood buildings, this question came up:

In your opinion, how hard would it be to build something out of brick, in an area with mostly wooden houses, fulfill building codes, find contractors who are familiar with that type of construction and actually build a brick house? Do you think this would be viable, financially, compared to buying an old or new house built ""the area standard way""?

This might be too weird and too specific to answer, but I thought I'll try and see if you guys have thoughts about it.

Thanks and greetings from Poland :)",newhampshire,"New Hampshirites, how difficult is it to deal with building codes in your beautiful state?"

780,780,marchofwestley,1583200424,fcn73u,Nan,"Today, we have our first (of many im sure)confirmed case. This news came in around 11:30 am. The infected person is an employee at one of our main hospitals,recently returned from Italy and is self quarantining. I have an aunt who works in the medical system and just told me about a conference call at work today where they were told that the infected person worked for 10 days before seeing a doctor for his symptoms, despite the fact that the state officials told us all on live TV that he did NOT return to work at the hospital between his return to the country and his positive test result.We also have students at several different schools who just returned from Italy and have been ""asked"" to self isolate, many of which are not doing so and are goimg out in public.

On saturday i put in a grocery order at wal mart. I tend to order a lot of ""weird"" things that most people never would( dry beans,large bags of rice, cases of tuna packets and vienna sausages, bulk flower snd sugar). All of these items were out of stock so i had to leave them out of my order. When i went to pickup my order there were 11 substitutions which is a pretty high number compared to the usual 0-3 or 5 around major holidays. I had to run inside for something and was met with empty shelves. Non-perishables were non-existant and most of the frozen section was empty. The other local grocery store was still pretty well stocked but busier than a noreaster 2 days before christmas. Interestingly, they are currently running sales on Powerade, gallons of water, shelf stable milk, canned goods etc. 

Fast forward to this morning. My sister is out of depression meds, goimg through withdrawals and doesnt have money to pay for them out of pocket now that her insurance is shut off. I go to costco to buy them for her and get there around 9:45. I dont shop at costco so it didnt occur to me that they wouldnt be open yet but i walk up to the door and theres a couple people just standing there forming a line (literally like 3 people). I figured it was normal. i look at my phone for a couple minutes to pass the time while i wait for the store to open. i hear the doors starting to open and i look up and suddenly the parking lot is full and theres easily 100 people standing in line behind me. Now its 9:50. The store doesnt open until 10:00 but theyve now opened 10 min early. Keeping in mind that i domt normally shope at Costco so i still dont know if this is strange but it seems like it may be. I walk in amd i hear one employee yell to another "" you giys better buckle up! its gonna be an interesting day! the parking lots full and theres a hell of a line!""  So now its safe to assume that this is all, in fact, unusual. I proceed tp the pharmacy which hasnt quite opened yet and the first thing i see is a big sign on the window that says "" no more masks, sorry.""  I can hear the pharmacists out back having a meeting about washing their hands often and not touching their faces and reminding customers to wash their hands as well. 
I bugged out of there pretty quick. I considered walking around to see what the shelves looked like but there were so many people pouring into the store that i decided it wasnt worth it and left. 

TLDR: containment measures are fake news, the state officials lie, and the shit is starting to hit the fan. dont go out if you dont have to.

Why? 

Because “everyone” can do something with Excel, which gives folks the wrong idea that it must not be serious enough to handle serious business problems. “Oh it’s so manual and prone to mistakes” So, more and more businesses are opting for “sexier” business intelligence tools and sometimes unnecessarily spending on software they don’t need if they just leveraged software nearly 100% of businesses already own. Often, foundationally, these other software options are nothing more than “re-skins” on top of excel-like handling of data. Like, fancy packaging for ordinary products. The result is the same, but the packaging is shiny and new. 

So, I lament the disregard for Excel as a serious tool for analysis and other complex reporting.

I co-host New Hampshirecast (which is a podcast all about New Hampshire and I've posted about it before) but I am co-host a new podcast called Quantum Week.  It takes the basic idea of the show Quantum Leap where you ""leap"" through different periods of your life. My co-host and I both live and grew up in New Hampshire so the state comes up a lot in the show as we talk about our lives.

How the podcast works is we take a week in the past 40 years (my co-host and are both 40) and talk about the movies, music and headlines that make that week special.

Here are the first 4 weeks we did and the movies/music we covered. We try to take the movie and song that was #1 so it's not something we would pick on our own:

Episode 1: 12/25-12/31/1999 (Talented Mr. Ripley/Smooth by Santana) Episode 2: 9/18-9/24/2011 (Moneyball/Moves Like Jagger by Maroon 5) Episode 3: 1/29-2/4/1995 (Legend of the Fall/When I Come Around by Green Day) Episode 4: 9/3/-9/9/1989 (Uncle Buck/Hangin Tough by New Kids On The Block)

You can get it on Apple Podcast, Stitcher, Pocket Casts or anywhere you download podcasts. If you check it out and have any feedback, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks and I hope you like it!",newhampshire,Quantum Week

Way back when, about 40 years ago, we took a family trip through New Hampshire. During this trip we stayed at a little motel in the middle of nowhere, and high up on the mountain above this motel was a building that -may- at one point have been a girl's school. I have a mental image of a big white building with pillars on the front of it, similar to a plantation house.

We did try to drive up to the building, but the road up was in such poor condition that my father gave up part way.

I don't think I'm imagining things, as all four of us have the same vague memory about the place. We can even pinpoint the time period by the car we were in, roughly the late 70's; but we have never been able to track down where we were/what it was.

you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

922,922,Hawk46,1584121084,fi3h5d,Nan,"Letter from Superintendent David Ryan:

Good afternoon:

In consultation with our health partners and school leaders, we have elected to enact a proactive closure of all SAU16 schools and offices for a minimum period of two weeks effective the close of school today. We have been working closely with our community health partners including Exeter Hospital and Core Physicians as well as monitoring research and information from DHHS and the CDC. Our local health partners are in complete agreement and support our closure.

I will be sending more specific information to you in a letter later today but wanted you to have the information as soon as the decision had been reached. We believe that by proactively closing our schools it will assist the public health agencies and healthcare professionals by slowing the spread of the virus. We also believe in the research and science of social distancing and non pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures as available data demonstrate a high level of effectiveness. We believe it is our ethical responsibility to assist our local and state public health officials with their mission.

Lastly, since we consider ourselves a suburb of Boston and a significant number of our parents travel each day by train to the metropolitan area, our community will most decidedly be affected soon by the virus, and we would prefer to have properly prepared for this epidemic instead of contributing to its exponential activity. 

Again, our schools and all school activities will be cancelled at least until March 30, 2020. We will continue to evaluate the maximum effective closure duration with our partners and keep you informed throughout the process. I know that this closure places a significant strain on many families' abilities to manage childcare and other associated issues, and we will continue to work on solutions to assist you.

Thank you.",newhampshire,"SAU16 just cancelled school for the next two weeks. (Exeter, Brentwood, Kensington, East Kingston, Newfields, and Stratham)"

We are beginning a small community-based music project and will be opening submissions for interested participants. The project is a small-batch tape label that will be operated with your help, kind of. 

When submissions are closed, my team and I will sift through all of the music and vote on our favorite 12 releases. This will be the season of tapes that we release this ""year"". A 13th tape will also be compiled as a best-of for that year as well.

All of the first run of tapes will be provided at the cost of the project. This means the artist will be advanced half of the run (25 tapes) to sell and distribute as they please. The remaining 25 will go to the project to be sold on the project's website and generate funds for the next release. The project will also kick around the idea of releasing bootleg tapes in the collection for half the price of the professional run tapes. Funds from bootlegs would also be used to continue funding the project.

The agreement would be such that if there is demand for a second run, that run and subsequent runs will be funded by the artist unless the project agrees to reprint. There will be no obligation for the artist to fund a second print, only the incentive to help the community and keep the project alive.

All of the dubbing will be done in-house. The manufacturing will be outsourced. Artist must provide artwork if selected for release.

We are looking mainly for electronic music of any variety, but are open to all genres. This is not a proper label, and is not meant to be a money-making-machine for any party involved. It is simply a project we feel needs to happen in order to help music be heard. As we are based in Manchester, we would particularly be interested in hearing from local New Hampshire artists!

He's cut funding which has led to a shortage in medical supplies and a lack of trained personnel to respond. He's blatantly blamed democrats for fabricating the virus. He's blamed nearly every other nation. But in reality, Trump had 5 months to prepare and he spent the whole time lying on Twitter.

With millions of people out of work, they are bailing out airlines and companies who have spent a decade funneling money to CEOs. Now you and I will pay for their hubris.

Entry day dozens of lies are tweeted out as if this is how a country should be led. Decisions are made, not based on the health and well-being of the US citizens, but based on how ""good the economy looks coming up on election year"" and how much profit can be made off this disaster.

Don't listen to this government, unless you want to throw your life away. The actions of the past 4 years--and specifically the past month-- have shown that we are expendable. We can not rely on Trump's government. As far as they are concerned, we are peons who will drive this economy for the rich.

Make America Great Again my ass. It's now very clear how far this country has fallen, even in just four years. The degradation and dismantling of the country came from the top down. 

Now, in dark days, the president sits on the shitter at 2 in the morning, tweeting to the nation about how great he is and how this whole pandemic is everyone else's fault.

A few of the venues I was supposed to be performing at are now closed indefinitely. And more have reached out to let us know they're considering doing the same. Rather than wait til all the dominoes fall, we've decided to cancel the tour so people have time to make alternate plans. Anyone who had tickets to the following shows will be getting a refund. 

CT - Manchester

MA - Boston

MI - Westland

NH - Manchester

NJ - Atlantic City, Point Pleasant

NY - Albany, NYC, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Syracuse, White Plains

OH - Cleveland, Perrysburg

ON - Kingston, London

PA - Philly

QC - Montreal

RI - East Greenwich

VT - Burlington

I will be rescheduling these shows ASAP (Poughkeepsie, Manchester NH, and Cleveland have already been rescheduled for October). Meanwhile, I will be hosting free YouTube livestreams while I'm home (assuming my internet doesn't go down because people stormed the Spectrum offices looking for toilet paper.). Some are Q&amp;As with famous people, others are stand-up shows with my comedy buddies from our houses. If you wanna watch, they're free at [YouTube.com/thehofstetter](https://YouTube.com/thehofstetter) every day at 2PM and 8PM ET. 

The refunds will be processed automatically, give it a week or two to show up on your statement. My statement is that this sucks. 

Also for future shows - if any show is ever cancelled, you will get your money back. You don't have to worry about that before buying tickets. If you request a refund because you see a video you don't like (it's happened) or because your babysitter cancelled (it's happened) or because the weather suddenly got nice and you want to eat outdoors (yes, it's happened) you'll politely be told to go have intercourse with yourself.

Thank you to the thousands of you who tried to come to shows anyway. You are warriors, and I love you all. I hope you can make the show when I return to your area. As for future tours, they're on for now, but we'll wait and see.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to in the thread EXPOSE them for their hypocrisy and antisemitism but I was DOWNVOTED and my Karma suffered because of it (I expect reparations for this BASELESS injustice). But I am here now to expose the rotten underbelly of this greedy, biased and unfair establishment..

&amp;#x200B;

For context: I am a 56 year old entrepreneur who moved to Dover in 2005 from Israel. I am Israeli and Proud and am very passionate about my Jewish upbringing and rituals

&amp;#x200B;

I needed a job due to my boredom of being a successful entrepreneur and decided to apply to Market Basket  (Note: NO. I DID NOT GET THIS JOB BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL REASONS, I AM VERY SUCCESSFUL AND RICH AND HAVE STARTED SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL START-UPS). 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got to the establishment I was wearing a very nice suit, tie, dress pants the whole 9 yards to seem as professional as possible while also wearing my yarmulke, the one my father gave me before passing away on the battlefields of the Gaza Strip

&amp;#x200B;

When I met the Hiring Manager her eyes immediately darted to my father's yarmulke, I shook her hand and gave a nice friendly ""Hello!"" but her eyes remained glued to the yarmulke, I asked her if anything was wrong and she immediately responded with ""What the hell is that on your head?"" I tried to explain to her that it was the yarmulke that my father gave to me, but as soon as I started to explain she instantly started to drift off into space, not caring what I had to say...   


When we finally got to the table she asked me what former experience I had, I started to talk about my past endeavors and my successful start-ups, but before I could even get an entire sentence out she cut me off and said: ""If you want this job, I need you to stop speaking in that silly voice and take this seriously.."" I was appalled... In the 13 years (as of this story being told) I had lived here, I had never been told my voice sounded ""Silly"". I told her that this was just my normal speaking voice, and that I had lived in Israel for the first 41 years of my life. She just quickly said ""Okay.. Sure.."" while rolling her eyes...

&amp;#x200B;

I did eventually get the job however, stocking the shelves and cleaning the backrooms. I immediately was singled out by the General Manager. Apparently the teenage cashiers were told to, and I quote: ""Not count the register money anywhere near him"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I would also get written up for sniffing female customers' hair while stocking the shelves.. When I tried to explain to the managers that this was customary in my culture and that it's not MY fault that their hair smells so good that I just need a whiff of it, they would call BS on me and tell me that I'm a ""Chicken Nugget Scoon"". I still have no idea what that means...

&amp;#x200B;

All in all: Market Basket is an antisemitic establishment and should be avoided at all costs!!!

During this time of uncertainty, NH Rocks would like to remind you of our commitment to all communities and toward helping improve the experience of living in and visiting New Hampshire. 

Even though we are still a start-up, with recent developments in the COVID-19 response, we wish to ""put our money where our mouth is"" to help those we care about and to help alleviate pressures put on small businesses across the state. 

A large part of our state's charm is the culture created by local communities and businesses, all supported by our residents. In our ambition to help residents better explore and engage with those communities and businesses, we created the Locals Card - an annual discount and events membership exclusive to New Hampshire residents. To our joy, this card was a proven early success; we have been able to help residents better afford to engage with our communities. This means more memories made with friends, family, or that quirky bartender you always request to make your drinks. 

This program was also designed to help small businesses by offering affordable digital services, increase foot traffic, and save on taxes. At this time, however, our state's small businesses need a little extra help to survive and we want to step-up.

For the next three weeks, we will pay participating businesses 25% of sales from Locals Cards purchased using their code. 

This means, for every card purchased we will pay $5 to a participating business. While this isn't a lot alone, we can help these entities survive if we do it together. $5 x 100 = $500 and it only gets better from there.

To get your own Locals Card, go to [NHRocks.com/locals](https://NHRocks.com/locals) and click on ""Have a Discount Code?"" and follow the prompts. Cards cost $20 for a year-long membership. While we do need to verify residency, please know we do not keep the information. We are in the helping business, not data business. So, please, help us help our communities. Share with your friends, family, and social network and get your card. 

Thank you all! Participating businesses and their codes are below, under the graphic. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out here or at info@nhrocks.com:

We are a primarily a Cold Brew Coffee manufacturer and distributor and service 100 or so cafes and restaurants in New Hampshire and more across New England. We are a small company, like so many others, that saw their sales drop to virtually 0 over the last few days. We carry a ton of stock and are hoping to be able to stay open a bit longer for our employees and further more, looking to be able to reopen again once the dust settles a bit. 

We opened an online platform to be able to sell our products direct to consumers and added an option to be able to donate coffee to local hospitals at a discounted cost to keep the medical staff functioning through there long and challenging shifts in the days to come. This option was overwhelmingly popular from those within the state. We realized that there were many out there that wanted to show support to local businesses and also be able show support to those on the front lines of this pandemic. You can also write a message of support on all bags of coffee in the notes section of the website. 

We Currently these bags are going to Dartmouth Hitchcock as that is where we have a close friend to the company that is currently one of the many treating those with Covid-19, however, we may be adding hospitals as time progresses. 

Regardless of whether or not this is what you do to support realize that this will have incredibly awful consequences for thousands of New Hampshire residents that never get this virus. If you are looking for something like coffee consider going locally instead of to Dunkins or Starbucks in the weeks to come through the mail or by donating.

Every state that has a stay-at-home order in place is doing extreme damage control and each of those Governers has said they wished they had acted sooner. They should have been proactive, instead of reactive. Is Gov. Sununu in possession of some knowledge that makes him better informed than these others? Does he think NH is immune? Why has the order not been given now, BEFORE cases multiply exponentially?

Not more than two weeks ago he said there was ""no reason to cancel large events"". Within days he reversed that statement and said to CANCEL all large events. I am not waiting to hear another ""Oops...I should have told you a week ago to stay at home. Sorry, I didn't know this would happen"".

How many people will need to become sick before he gives the only order that is known to work in reducing the spread? People need to stay at home as much as possible for a few weeks. This is such a small price to pay for the health and safety of ourselves and our loved ones. Do not wait to hear an order that might never come. We are smart enough to see what is happening all across the country and take the correct action on our own.

Dear Harbor Freight Community,

As we’ve been following the news over the last few days, we’ve heard about the severe shortage of protective gear for hospitals, healthcare workers and first responders as the impact of COVID-19 is being felt across the country. America depends on these heroes every day and in the days ahead we will depend on them even more. At Harbor Freight, we want them to know that they can depend on us too.

So we’ve decided to donate our entire supply of the personal protective equipment items listed below to front line hospitals with 24 hour emergency rooms in the communities served by our stores.

           •  N95 Masks
           •  Face Shields

If you work at a hospital with a 24 hour emergency room in need of these items, please ask the office in charge of procurement at your hospital to click here so they can provide us with the information we’ll need to determine if we can make a donation. If you’re not with a hospital, but would like to give us the name of a hospital with a 24 hour emergency room in your community that might need our help, please email us at hospitalhelp@harborfreight.com, identify the hospital’s city and state in the subject line, and our team will follow-up.

PLEASE DO NOT MAKE REQUESTS AT YOUR LOCAL STORE OR OUR CALL CENTER AND PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT HOSPITALS—THEY’RE BUSY HELPING THEIR PATIENTS. 

For hospitals we’re able to help, we’ll email them a voucher when the supplies are available for pick up at their local Harbor Freight Tools store.

Although we certainly won’t have enough of these supplies to fill everyone’s needs, we’re going to donate everything we’ve got. We also recognize that there are so many other critically important people responding to this crisis and that there is need everywhere. We’ve chosen to focus our efforts on hospitals with a 24 hour emergency room with the hope that we can help as many people as possible right now.  

Thank you and God Bless,

1163,1163,The50centTourist,1585139274,fopfvs,Nan,"Maybe a thread where we can all share our tips and tricks for managing self-isolation in a positive way?

I know that many people have no problem handling time alone indoors, or may have been working remotely for a long time and are used to it. But there are many people having some difficulty adjusting, or have children and would love ideas for managing family-style self-isolation.

So I’m going to share some of mine and would love to see yours!

Before we get started…some boring, but **important**, stuff:

**1.** Let’s not talk about health issues or give any medical advice here. We are not medical professionals. If anyone is having medical concerns please call your doctor, a hospital, or urgent care center for advice. If you are experiencing an emergency dial 911, if you are experiencing what you believe to be a COVID-19 emergency dial 211.

**2**. If you are self-isolating in a situation that is unsafe due to domestic violence, please reach out to the NHDS at (866) 644-3574 or your local police department. You can also find a number of resources through the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence (603) 224-8893. https://www.nhcadsv.org/

**3**. If you or a loved one is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, or in need of a little extra support you can call the New Hampshire HelpLine at 1-800-852-3388 or visit [https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/dcbcs/bbh/centers.htm](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/dcbcs/bbh/centers.htm). 

If you or someone you know is having thoughts about self-harm please call the NH statewide suicide hotline at 1-800-273-talk (1-800-273-8255) or dial 911. And remember, although this is a difficult time, it will pass and you are not alone or unloved. We are all in this together.

**Above all…none of what I say is professional advice. These are just some things that have helped me.** 

I have been remote working off and on for years and have found a few tricks that help. Now that I am home but not working I still try to stay as close to that routine as possible but have added a few new aspects in response to the current situation.

I break up the day into structured blocks of time. Most people have a natural rhythm for workdays and weekends. We get up, have coffee, shower, dress, make breakfast, go to work, take a break, work some more, lunch, etc. You get the idea. It’s easy to let that slip away when working from home and soon the lines between hours and days start to blur.

I have found it especially helps to stick to my normal morning routine. Sure, some things get skipped a few times a week, but I don’t forsake the entire routine. I feel more energized, positive, and productive when I stick closer to the normal rhythm. Doing that may also provide comfort for any children and pets at home. They are super sensitive to environmental changes so an upheaval in routine can cause stress that they may not even understand themselves, but can bring about stress-related behaviors.

At the beginning and end of each day I do a little extra cleaning, being sure to disinfect all high touch surfaces. So far, we have only gone once for groceries and I cleaned like a maniac after that, wearing gloves and thoroughly cleaning all the stuff we bought. 

Throughout the day I wash hands at regular intervals and am sure to stand every hour for a little stretching and shaking. During that stretch, I give some attention to my loved ones and pets so they do not feel ignored. My lunch break is spent with family. If I didn’t have them in the house I would be using the phone, an online chat, or a FaceTime app to spend that time with them. I do have one child that lives in another city so we text and/or email 3 times a day. Connection and reassurance is the best thing about my mealtimes.

I am doing extra spring cleaning, organizing and decluttering. Would have done some gardening if that blasted snowstorm hadn’t come through. 

I'm also laying plans for either getting a new business started or reviving whatever might be left of my current/old business. I’m brushing up my resume and looking at jobs online, just in case. I don’t know how long this will last but feel better when I’m taking proactive steps for the future. One way or another, this will pass, and I want to have a direction to point my feet. 

I still keep a daily stretch/walk/exercise routine. People with private yards can take advantage of outdoor space more easily and still be ""staying at home"". Apartment dwellers may have to be more creative inside with a window open (assuming that window is not too close to a neighbors window. I would be looking for the most remote window and set up a chair or exercise spot close to it).  And of course, exercise is something the entire family can do together. Also setting specific times for family movies, games, and activities is great (and a little me-time each day). 

I cut up some sheets to use as bathroom squares or hankies and am hemming the edges. (don’t wash them until they’ve been hemmed! My first attempt was a mess in the dryer…ooops!) I also broke out all the fabric napkins. We're using the fabric now for nose-blowing in order to save those last rolls of TP for bathroom needs, but if there is no TP available we will switch to the fabric squares and I will handle it like they did cloth diapers in the old days. We've done some camping so a sheet square is still way better than the leaves! LoL

Maybe the most important thing I’ve learned is to be flexible and forgiving. I set a routine and stay as close as possible, but am ready to switch things up when something changes. Being rigid just causes more stress. It’s like driving to a destination and hitting a detour. Even though it changes the original plan, it can be a lovely view if you just relax and trust that you will be back on the main road soon enough. Sometimes you gotta go with the flow for a bit. And you have to allow that others in the home may need things done differently from time to time. It's all about balance, respect, and compromise.

I am super careful not to dwell on the news, but to stay well informed through credible sources. I don’t want my need for information to turn into a morbid fascination and I do not want to weed through fake news from every yahoo with a social media account. I check the news 3 times a day and spend some time on Reddit to get a little more personal perspective and engage in discussion.

By the way, over the past few days I’ve thrown up some pretty controversial cartoons and I want everyone to know that my intention was not to sow fear, but rather to initiate a sharp wake-up call. Cartoons usually get more attention than text, so that’s what I used. One kind and intelligent reader suggested that I instead posted something with a more positive spin, which inspired me to post this. Props to that person! I am going to delete the newspaper mockup cartoon today (I moved it to a more appropriate sub). 

Finally, every night when I go to bed I remind myself that we have all seen dark times and have come through them. As New Englanders we have seen H1N1, 9/11, Desert Storm, The Boston Marathon Bombing and more. This time being NH Strong requires a different strategy. Self-isolation for some time and probably more social distancing for a while after that. It’s not going to easy for anyone and will be harder for some than others. We need to support each other and our communities in the best ways that we can. We can adhere to the recommendations of medical professionals so we do not spread the virus unknowingly. We can use our computers to network, start new business models, connect with people that might be future employees or employers, gather and share resources. We can also use our computers to create virtual play-dates for kids, with parents taking turns leading a session several times throughout the day, giving the other parents a little break. 

I'm sure there are people out there with far more creative ideas and hope they will share them here!

No one needs to have these buildings right now, no one's living in them and no one depends on them, so why hasn't the governor or any other state agency asked for new construction to be closed down temporarily?

What's making this worse is that people who got laid off or furloughed are now going to construction sites to work off the books to make up the cash that they're lacking. This is only making construction sites both large and small more risky for the community.

* If you develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, call ahead to your health care provider. They will determine if you need to be tested for COVID-19.
* To decide whether you need testing, providers refer to the [CDC criteria](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html), which evaluates a combination of symptoms and risk factors.
* Providers collect specimens before sending them to labs for analysis to the New Hampshire Public Health Laboratories. Results are generally available within 24 hours.
* If you are not being tested and can manage your symptoms at home, self-isolate until at least seven days have passed since symptoms first appear and at least three days have passed since the resolution of your fever (without the use of fever-reducing medication.

1274,1274,Friendly_Effect,1585589160,frv1tv,Nan," COVID-19 statement from Great Barrington (from Letter to the Editor)

In the days since the town of Great Barrington, MA  put out a [press release](https://theberkshireedge.com/great-barrington-implores-second-home-owners-tourists-to-stay-away-during-covid-19-contagion/) asking second-home owners and visitors not to come here, or if already here to quarantine for 14 days, we have received several letters from people who are offended. They ask, why is it OK for us to welcome them and their money most of the time, but to turn on them now?

It’s a legitimate question. Our region does benefit quite a bit from second-home owners, weekenders, and tourists. You pay taxes, you support our local businesses, and you contribute generously to local arts and charitable organizations. You are our friends and neighbors.

It is a good question but there’s a good answer. We are not turning on you; we are concerned for EVERYONE’S safety. Of course, second-home owners are welcome here most of the time, but for now, the only chance we have to avoid serious illness and death on a large scale is if all of us stay home. All of us.

The statement put out by the town of Great Barrington is not town policy. It is the town echoing the advice and directive of both New York’s and Massachusetts’ governors and health departments and it is similar to pleas made by governors all over the country. Stay home, everyone.

We are concerned for the welfare of year-round residents AND second-home owners. More people arriving here, especially from an area where the likelihood of illness is high, is not good for the people arriving or the people already here.

There are two issues: the first is contagion. That can be mitigated if the people who come here, as well as the people who live here year-round, stay in their homes. We hope all arrived with two weeks of supplies and are staying home so they don’t need to make trips to the grocery store or pharmacy. Each of those trips risks the health of the employees who are doing hero’s work just by showing up. We would hope everyone did arrive already prepared, but many didn’t.

The second issue is healthcare capacity. Our 25-bed hospital is working fast to expand to 50 beds but even that will be overwhelmed very quickly. Medical equipment is as strained here as anywhere else.

We entirely understand why one would prefer to be here now rather than NYC. We really do. But to assume that we will have the medical resources to handle this, to take care of additional people who are sick, is wishful thinking. We do not have that capacity.

The decision to send out the press release was anything but short-sighted. The COVID-19 task force meets (virtually) almost daily to assess the situation and the town manager spends almost all of his time dealing with COVID-19 issues to determine the best course of action. One can make all the political and economic arguments in the world about why we should not have asked people to stay away. But the obvious truth is that more people, especially coming from an area where the disease is rampant, will be dangerous for everyone who is here, whether year-round or a seasonal visitor.

Again, we hope that second-home owners and visitors who are already here came with enough supplies to stay in their homes. And if they didn’t, we hope they take advantage of the businesses that will deliver. If you haven’t left, please heed the warnings of the governors, the CDC and all expert scientists, and shelter in place.

Mostly we hope, for everyone’s sake, that we all stay healthy.

My parents have a car inspection due at the end of the month. They did pay and send in the paperwork for their registration, as they are older and not in the best of health and did not want to risk exposure at the clerk's office, and the clerk's office is closed anyway due to COVID. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, they still need to bring in their car for an inspection. Seeing as corona virus can be infectious even in people not showing symptoms, and both of them are older and have health issues, they would prefer not to bring in the car for an inspection as they are both not going out at this time and cannot really afford to risk exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

 I know car shops are open at this time as they are deemed an essential service, however I saw in Massachusetts that they did provide 60 day extensions. Who can I contact to discuss this matter further? I moved back from out of the country to live with my parents, and as I lived in a major city for the past decade or so, I do not have a valid license as it was easy to get around on Uber/bike/public transit.

I started on 3/31, looking back to 3/16 as my start point. At this point the trendline equation was f(x) = 17.939 * e^(0.2346x), with x being the number of days since 3/31. 

At that time, the projected cases for 4/1 was 478. Actual reported cases came in at 415. This is only one additional data point, so don't read into it. 

The new trendline equation is f(x) = 18.311 * e^(0.2305x). 

The projected cases for 4/2 was 605 from the 3/31 data, and is now 578.

The actual number of cases for 4/2 was 479. Updating the trend line equation now predicts 695 for 4/3, which was originally 732 from the 4/1 equation. This is only two additional days of data, so don't read too much into it.

The new exponential equation for the trend line is:

f(x) = 18.79 * e^(0.2257x), where x = number of days since 3/16.

The exponential factor of the equation has been decreasing over the past 3 days. Again, this data set is too small to say that the curve is flattening, but it gives hope. The cases per day are still increasing but at a declining rate of growth.

The last time we spoke was through a video call. My heart is broken and I have no idea what to be doing and I cant even go anywhere.

To see people in New Hampshire in the  US going all over the country to their holiday homes etc is so frustrating to see. We are only asked to stay at home and a lot are not following it.

I'd love nothing more than to head to LA with my Gran and give her a big hug she needs and deserves but I wont be doing that and haven't done for a long time now. Everything is so hard and boring to me

I used 2018 Hospital stats from [here](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/beds-by-ownership/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) and the current Covid-19 stats from [April 16th](https://www.wmur.com/app/new-hampshire-coronavirus-map/32009329).

Looks to me like 187 of the 2636 beds could be in use, so 7%. (6% if you adjust for deaths.)

However there are huge problems with the figures, I have as I have no idea how many have checked out of the hospital so the 187 number is likely too high.

Just looking to grasp whether the goal of the lockdown was accomplished, preventing hospitals from being overwhelmed. Again very rough numbers, hoping someone more plugged in can chime in.",newhampshire,Anyone have a good hospital utilization number?
